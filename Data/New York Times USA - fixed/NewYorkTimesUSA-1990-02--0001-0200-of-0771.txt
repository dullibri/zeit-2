HEADLINE: BUSH IS CAUTIOUS ON DOMESTIC GOALS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Bush lent oratorical flourish and the weight of his office to his domestic agenda tonight but added little new substance to policies outlined earlier this week in budget proposals that Democrats have already criticized as inadequate.
The only major new aspect of Mr. Bush's comments on domestic policy in his first State of the Union address lay in a set of education goals that he sought to portray as ambitious, including making every adult literate by the year 2000.
But Administration officials suggested that the real goals in the Department of Education's strategy for the coming years were actually more modest than Mr. Bush suggested, and Democratic leaders immediately complained about the scope of Mr. Bush's education proposals.
 
The Central Conflict
This conflict has been central to Mr. Bush's Administration: While he has outlined some broad visions, he has constantly been constrained by the tightness of the Federal budget and his determination not to raise taxes. 
The speech tonight was shot through with the sense that while change is convulsing Europe, Mr. Bush's view of the State of the Union is more placid, less a call to join ''the revolution of '89'' than to build on a solid foundation.
The President said he envisioned ''a better America, where there's a job for everyone who wants one. Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care, and where the Goverment works to expand child care alternatives for parents; where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy.''
 
Two Standing Ovations
Mr. Bush, smiling as he was announced into the House chamber, got two standing ovations before he spoke.
He brought most of the audience to its feet when he spoke of the Panama invasion. He drew his longest applause when he said his new budget would reduce the deficit without raising taxes. The Republicans stood. The Democrats sat, applauding quietly, and Mr. Bush laughed as Republicans waved at the Democrats to stand.
At times, the speech was quintessential George Bush, filled with the litany of his campaign oratory - drug-free schools, help for the disabled and homeless and commercial enterprise zones, without the offer of substantial money to back the programs.
But Mr. Bush also borrowed from the stage directions of Ronald Reagan, using Mr. Reagan's technique of reading a letter from an ordinary citizen. This time, it was from the mother of a soldier killed in Panama. Taking out his reading glasses, even though the letter was on the TelePrompter like the rest of his speech, Mr. Bush read from a note the woman's son had sent before he went into action. ''Do not mourn for me,'' the soldier, Pvt. James Markwell, wrote. ''Revel in the life that I have died to give you.''
 
General by Design
Outlining his domestic priorities, Mr. Bush said he was asking Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to review Federal medical benefits and ''bring the staggering costs of health care under control.''
But that and most of Mr. Bush's comments on domestic policy were deliberately vague in keeping with his stated plan to allow his budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which he sent to Congress on Monday, to carry the brunt of his agenda.
''I come not to speak about the 'state of the Government,' '' Mr. Bush told a joint session of Congress, ''not to detail every new initiative that we plan for the coming year, nor describe every line item in the budget.''
Mr. Bush's comments reflected the general philosophy of his budget. He proposed major investments in what he called ''human capital'' - including substantial increases in subsidies for basic scientific research and space exploration - and equally substantial reductions in the growth of benefits like Medicare and Federal pensions.
 
Cuts Are Envisioned
His budget would trim Federal investment in such areas as highways, railroads and bridges, cuts that Administration officials say reflect the proper role of the Federal Government.
The only portion of Mr. Bush's speech that was not contained in his 1991 budget were his remarks on education.
''Last fall, at the education summit, the governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure kids are ready to learn, the very first day they walk into that classroom,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to the meeting he held with the nation's governors following a conference on education in Williamsburg, Va., last year. ''By the year 2000,'' he said, ''every child must start school ready to learn.''
Mr. Bush said his request for a $500 million increase in the budget for the Head Start program ''made good on that commitment.''
Mr. Bush said that by the end of the century, the high school graduation rate must be ''no less than 90 percent.'' The Bush Administration calculates that figure by the number of children who finish high school within four years of entrance. That rate, last calculated in 1986, was 72 percent, Education Department officials said tonight.
Officials said Mr. Bush was proposing ''dropout prevention assistance grants.'' But the White House has budgeted only $45 million for the effort and, as with many of its domestic programs, is counting on the grants to get states to increase their own spending.
 
Meaning of a Diploma
Two of Mr. Bush's other proposals sounded more all-encompassing than they did when described by Administration officials.
''We're going to make our schools' diplomas mean something,'' he said. ''In critical subjects - at the fourth, eighth and 12th grades - we must assess our students' performance.''
Officials said Mr. Bush was referring to efforts to expand a program that samples several thousand students in those grades across the country and measures their achievement.
Mr. Bush also declared that ''every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen'' by the year 2000. Officials said that meant ''functional literacy,'' which is loosely defined as being able to read well enough to perform day-to-day functions. The Education Department has said that 13 percent of Americans 20 and older are functionally illiterate.
 
Foley Agrees in Part
In his reply to Mr. Bush, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said: ''We will set a national goal of making our schools once again the best in the world by the year 2000. On this issue the President's words seem to agree with us, but his actions say something else.''
The Department of Education's spending in 1991 would increase to $23.7 billion from $22.3 billion, an increase of about 1 percent. But most of that budget is made up of student loan guarantees, which are mandated by law.
Mr. Bush, who has been lashing out at Congress on taxes, crime and other issues, said tonight: ''The American people did not send us here to bicker. There's work to do - and they sent us here to get it done. Once again I offer my hand to all of you.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Spells Out Shifts in Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Bush Administration told Congress today how it will distribute nearly $8 billion in United States foreign aid this year. In an indication of its shifting global priorities, the Administration plans a dramatic increase in aid to Poland and a sharp decrease in assistance to most of Central America, including El Salvador.
The overall amounts for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, have already been appropriated by Congress, with more than 85 percent of the money earmarked for specific countries and the Administration given discretion in deciding how to spend the rest. No further action by Congress is needed. 
The draft list of allocations, prepared by the State Department and sent to a few members of Congress today, shows that economic aid for El Salvador, $185 million last year, is being reduced to $130.6 million this year. Military aid will be $84.6 million, about the same as the $85 million last year.
The United States has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the Salvadoran Government, and the Administration has vigorously resisted efforts by Congressional Democrats to reduce aid to El Salvador because of human rights abuses.
 
Budget Considerations
State Department officials said the cutback in assistance to El Salvador did not reflect any dissatisfaction with President Alfredo Cristiani. Rather, they said, this cutback and others reflect fiscal pressures in the United States. In addition, they said, Congress earmarked so much of the aid budget for a few countries that relatively little was left for Central America, Africa and East Asia.
The official list shows that military aid for Honduras, $40 million last year, would be cut to $20.2 million this year, while economic aid is reduced to $60 million, from $85 million last year.
Military aid for Guatemala, which totaled $9 million last year, would be cut to $2.9 million this year. Economic aid would be cut to $56.5 million, from $80 million last year.
The Administration is also cutting economic aid for Costa Rica, to $63.5 million this year, from $90 million last year.
Jamaica's economic aid would be slashed to $5 million this year, from $25 million last year.
In Eastern Europe, Poland is scheduled to receive $227.5 million in cash assistance for its economy, up from $3 million last year. The State Department list shows that Hungary is to get $2.5 million of such aid this year; it did not receive any last year. Both countries are eligible for other types of assistance under legislation signed by President Bush in November.
 
Israel and Egypt Get Less
In allocations for other parts of the world, Israel and Egypt suffer small reductions as a result of an across-the-board cut mandated by Congress to provide extra funds for combating drug traffic. Israel is to receive $1.79 billion in military aid and $1.19 billion in economic aid. Egypt will get $1.29 billion in military aid and $811.5 million in economic aid.
The Philippines will get an increase in aid this year, but less than it expected under an agreement permitting the United States to operate military bases there. The allocations for this year - $140.1 million in military aid and $124 million in economic aid - are less than 80 percent of what Manila was expecting.
Military aid will be cut 15 percent for Portugal (to $84.6 million from $100 million) and 86 percent for Thailand (to $3 million from $22 million).
In sub-Saharan Africa, only two countries are scheduled to receive economic aid: $1.7 million for Djibouti and $2 million for the Seychelles, where the United States Air Force operates a tracking station. In addition, at the insistence of Congress, $10 million is earmarked for scholarships to bring black South Africans to this country.
Among the countries scheduled to receive increased economic aid are Pakistan, which is getting $229 million, an increase of $14 million, and Jordan, which is getting $34.9 million, an increase of nearly $20 million. The program that provides food and health care for Afghans would also increase, to $34.9 million this year, from $22 million last year.

Moscow McDonald's Opens: Milkshakes and Human Kindness (Reuters)

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Connoisseurs of fast food and human behavior were doubly satiated today as anxious crowds of Soviet customers engaged in traditional pushing and shoving to place ''Beeg Mek'' orders at the nation's first McDonald's restaurant, only to be calmed by uniformed compatriots dictating that they have a nice day.
''We added our own spice to the menu, our usual commotion,'' said Valentin Gmyzin, a pipe factory worker, after making it through the counter crush at 27 cash registers and spending four days' salary for a Big Mac, cheeseburger, apple pie and two milkshakes.
As exotic as the food seemed, opening-day customers said they were most impressed at the simple sight of polite shop workers - Soviet workers - somehow having been trained in this nation of commercial boorishness to actually smile and say, ''May I help you?'' and ''Thank you for coming.''
''There is a lesson to be drawn from this for the country,'' said Tatyana Podlesnaya, a teacher. ''What is killing us is that the average worker does not know how to work and so does not want to. Our enthusiasm has disappeared. But here my meal turned out to be just a supplement to the sincere smiles of the workers.'' 
She vowed to lead her elementary-grade students into the gleaming restaurant. ''This is a lesson in humane treatment which our children have to learn.''
 
To Go - to the Ukraine
Mr. Gmyzin was less didactic about progress as he scarfed down half his order himself, murmuring in particular at the cheeseburger and looking happily unrushed at a window table. He was watched by throngs of hope-starved Soviet consumers who waited in lines far longer than those outside Lenin's mausoleum.
He showed a gold-toothed grin of pleasure and departed, taking the rest of his fast feast home to the Donets Basin in the far-off Ukraine, the bearer of an exotic innovation in a nation currently spiralling through an economic crisis. Soviet consumers must spend long hours searching for scarce, inferior goods, and then hoard them, so little faith do they have in daily mercantilism.
The debut on busy Pushkin Square seemed to mark something of a reversal of stereotypical values: the West was being hailed for perfecting socialized eating.
The event was enough to attract commentary from such institutional sages as Stanislav Kondrashev, international analyst for Izvestia, the Government daily, who explained that this was ''the expression of America's rationalism and pragmatism toward food.''
''The contrast with our own unrealized pretensions is both sad and challenging,'' he wrote on the front page, recalling old Kremlin vows to commercially bury the West's cola industry with Russian kvass and its pasta craze with stuffed Siberian pelmeni. ''All that has turned to sand,'' he rued.
 
Blini Advocacy
Sure as ketchup comes in packets, the restaurant has prompted still another grave Soviet debate over what might be termed delectable materialism. A chauvinistic commentator in a Moscow neighborhood newspaper called the ''monotony'' of McDonald's quality characteristic of Western imperialism, but then he had to admit yearning for the return of a pre-Revolutionary Moscow cafe, Yegorov's Blinnaya.
This fabled place for ''incredible Russian blinis,'' or pancakes, ''filled with the most imaginative fillings,'' was the archetype of quality fast food, said this partisan. Just so did some Soviet accounts insist that the cuisine of marauding Tatars, as in steak tartar, prefigure the hamburger's storming of Mother Russia.
''It's a rather complicated sandwich,'' said Valeriya Kaverina during her first encounter with a Big Mac. It cost 3 rubles and 75 kopecks, a good bite of her daily wage of 12 rubles, but a decent price compared with the costs at Soviet restaurants that customers agreed offer nothing like the same quality. Tourists will find that price a bargain, the equivalent of 63 cents in United States currency at the official rate in effect for most cash exchanges.
 
Revenge of the Ruble
''It is a three-story sandwich,'' Lyubov Paladeva said carefully, marvelling at the lettuce tucked within. She was pleased at the roll, a high compliment in this nation of canny bread lovers.
Customers who waited up to two hours to get into the 700-seat restaurant, the largest McDonald's in the world, greatly appreciated the sweet revenge implicit in the sign by the front door: ''For Soviet rubles only.''
Usually Muscovites can merely salivate outside several richly stocked groceries and restaurants newly opened for Westerners, exclusive marts that want none of the internationally valueless rubles and so bear the sign: ''For hard currencies only.''
Many departing customers proudly took their logo-ridden refuse with them to show they were pioneers. They had seen the future and it works, as least as far as their digestive tract.

HEADLINE: Seoul Officials See Accord on U.S. Troop Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Senior Government officials said today that they ''fully expect'' to reach an agreement with the United States this year for the largest withdrawal of American military personnel from South Korea since the end of the Vietnam War.
The officials said that they expected that the reductions would involve 4,000 to 5,000 of the 43,000 Americans serving in the armed forces in South Korea. The move would bring United States forces to the level of the early 1980's, before the Reagan Administration began a broad buildup that swelled the American military presence in Asia and around the globe.
Despite their surprising willingness to reach an agreement, South Korean military officials have in recent days stepped up their warnings that the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe have yet to reduce tensions in Asia, or to have any detectable influence on North Korea. 
The officials' comments, in interviews with foreign reporters here, came two days after the Pentagon announced proposals to close three of its five Air Force bases in South Korea, eliminating 2,000 support positions and consolidating fighter aircraft at two remaining bases.
A senior South Korean official deeply involved in military affairs said today that the Government of President Roh Tae Woo had no objection to cutbacks ''as long as the basic element of deterrent defense remains in Korea.''
That appears to mark a subtle but important change in South Korea's stated position. Previously, the Government had regularly sought assurances that there would be no reductions of any kind.
The change in tone appeared to reflect a decision by South Korea that, given the choice of bearing a bigger share of the cost of stationing American troops here or watching their numbers dwindle, the more attractive option is to allow at least some decline.
The question of how deeply to cut the United States presence here is expected to be a top subject of an Asian tour by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, scheduled to begin in about two weeks. Mr. Cheney will visit Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, the three main sites of United States military installations in Asia.
The last major pullout of American troops in South Korea came in 1971, when President Nixon moved about 20,000 military personnel from the peninsula. In 1978, President Carter announced a plan to withdraw all but 14,000 troops and support personnel, but it drew intense criticism from both in South Korea and on Capitol Hill. He ultimately canceled the plan after pulling back only 3,600 people.
For several days the Korean press has been likening President Bush's efforts to reduce American strength here to Mr. Carter's. Some have suggested that the move amounts to an abandonment of South Korea.
''Any plan to reduce the size of U.S. ground forces in Korea in haste is unrealistic,'' the English-language Korea Herald asserted this morning, saying North Korea's ground forces outnumber South Korea's by about 10 to 7. Dong A Ilbo, a leading newspaper here, insisted today that ''the military threat from the North has not decreased,'' but said that ''the question of American troop withdrawal has left our hands.''
Government officials disputed that view, saying that the United States was acting only after full consultations with South Korea. During the Carter Administration, they argued, North Korea was more threatening and the South had yet to surge ahead economically or build up its own military forces. Most officials here say that they now view the North's economy as unsustainable, and that North Korea will soon have to reduce its own army.
But Hyun Hong Choo, the Minister of Legislation, said today that the United States ''must link its scaledown with developments in North-South relations.''
Mr. Hyun suggested that in return for troop cuts the North should withdraw some troops now stationed just above the demilitarized zone, arrange for exchanges so that families could cross the border to visit relatives, and open a suspected nuclear weapons installation for inspection.

HEADLINE: St. Paul Journal;
He Says Populist but Foes Say Pasha

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Jan. 26

 BODY:
While other states grapple with crime or drugs or unemployment, the Minnesota gubernatorial race this year may hinge on one question: Is Gov. Rudy Perpich an arrogant autocrat who lives in a Middle Western Taj Mahal or an offbeat populist who carries his own luggage?
As half a dozen opponents line up to run against him in November, the three-term Governor, a Democrat, is at the center of a front-page squall over what critics call his ''lavish life style'' and quirky behavior.
The trouble began last month when The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch published a list of the contents of the Governor's mansion, a 33-room English Tudor house used by Minnesota governors since 1966. It included 156 chairs, 81 tables, 26 sofas, 16 rugs and 23 lamps. 
In what opponents called an overreaction, the Governor responded that the mansion had only 113 chairs, 59 tables, 15 sofas, 12 rugs, and, yes, 23 lamps. The rest of the furnishings named by the paper were in storage.
The Governor's wife, Lola, was so outraged that she cut short a trip to New York to tell the Minnesota press that she wanted to sell the mansion and give the proceeds to the homeless.
The trouble did not stop there. Angered after a reporter referred to his Lincoln Town Car as a limousine, the Governor scrapped the car and driver for a Chevrolet Caprice, which he drives himself.
Then came an article in the St. Paul paper saying that the state police had been escorting the Governor's 29-year-old daughter, Mary Sue, to concerts and on shopping trips. Governor Perpich immediately declared that if his family could not have security, neither would he. He got rid of his own bodyguard.
The Governor's supporters note that a mansion, a bodyguard and a limousine are standard perquisites for most governors, and are dwarfed by the boats and indoor swimming pools that others get.
To defuse some of the talk, the Governor and his wife took reporters on a tour of the mansion the other day to show how difficult it is to live there. They pointed to a leaking roof and told of an oven door that was held up by a string before $1.3 million in renovation work began.
''This entire first floor looked like Bangladesh,'' Governor Perpich said. ''You have to have it so it looks right.''
The mansion uproar comes after years of what people here describe as offbeat behavior by the Governor that at first endeared him to Minnesotans but now seems to mystify them.
A few years back, for instance, small farm towns in Minnesota were abuzz after the Governor began dying his graying hair brown. Indeed, one theory for the Governor's behavior, said The Star Tribune in Minneapolis in a recent editorial, was, ''The horrid shoe-polish brown tint that's been applied to his hair also has affected his brain.''
Charles Backstrom, a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, described the hair coloring and other eccentricities this way: ''It's un-Minnesotan.''
''People are unpretentious around here,'' he added. ''He acts kind of flaky. People like somebody a little bit more stable.''
The Governor's approval rating among unassuming Minnesotans reached a low this month with fewer than one in three saying he should seek re-election, according to a poll in The Pioneer Press Dispatch.
''It's going to be a recurring theme in the campaign - his behavior and his arrogance,'' said Duane Benson, a Republican who is minority leader of the Minnesota Senate. ''The person who grabs a lunch pail in the morning is having a hard time identifying with someone who spends a million dollars on his house and still can't fix the roof.''
Governor Perpich dismissed the charges as campaign rhetoric. ''I've been center stage for four months, bleeding and bruised,'' he said. ''It's a wonder I'm still standing.'' Amid the ruckus, William J. Janklow, former Governor of South Dakota who is a Republican, wrote to the St. Paul paper to extol Governor Perpich. Mr. Janklow said that on their travels abroad, Governor Perpich ''rode in the front seat of cars, readily took taxicabs when a chauffeured limo was available, carried his own luggage and never acted or presumed any regal role.''
Some say the attention to Mr. Perpich's life style says as much about the governed as the Governor. ''Perpich has been around longer than any other Governor and some people are just tired of him,'' Professor Backstrom said. But few are willing to say the Governor is out of the game.
''He has been in trouble before and bounced back to win big,'' the professor said. ''He is not to be counted out by this.''

HEADLINE: Environmental Groups Told They Are Racists in Hiring

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Several members of civil rights and minority groups have written to eight major national environmental organizations charging them with racism in their hiring practices.
The letter, which did not accuse the environmental groups of actually refusing to hire or promote anyone on racial grounds, said the national environmental movement was isolated from the poor and minority communities that it said were the chief victims of pollution.
Spokesmen for the environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club, agreed that they had a poor record of hiring and promoting minority employees, but they denied that racism was involved and insisted they were trying to correct the situation.
They said they had not had an aggressive recruiting program in the past to attract minority employees. But part of the problem, several of the spokesmen contended, was a scarcity of black or Hispanic people among the pool of trained environmental specialists, and the fact that few of them wanted to work at the relatively low salaries offered by nonprofit environmental groups. 
 
No Response in Writing
Among those criticizing the environmental groups were Dr. Benjamin Chavis Jr., director of the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, co-chairman of the Southern Organizing Committee for Social and Economic Justice. They demanded that the environmental groups take steps within the next 60 days to assure that 30 to 40 percent of their staffs are members of minority groups.
None of the environmental groups has yet responded in writing to the letter, which was sent Jan. 16.
''I don't think anybody is as aware of the whiteness of the green movement as those of us who are trying to do something about it,'' said Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, the nation's biggest conservation organization.
In addition to the wildlife federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club, the letter was sent to the Environmental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth, the National Parks and Conservation Association, the National Audubon Society and the Isaak Walton League.
None of the top leaders of any of those groups is black or Hispanic or Asian, and few of their middle managers come from minority groups. Of 315 staff members of the National Audubon Society, for example, only three are black, said Bob Norman, the society's director of human resources.
 
'We Are Not Proud'
Friends of the Earth's staff of 40 includes five minority workers, counting secretaries. The Natural Resources Defense Council has five minority professionals among its staff of 140. The Sierra Club's 250-member staff includes one Hispanic person but no blacks or Asians among its professionals, said J. Michael McCloskey, chairman of the group. The other groups have similar records.
''We are not proud of our record -we are terrible,'' Mr. Norman said. But he said: ''I can't believe it is racism. We are not getting the candidates from the minority community.''
Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said, ''The truth is that environmental groups have done a miserable job of reaching out to minorities.''
One problem, he said, is that minority members who are ''cause oriented'' tend to be attracted to issues like discrimination and poverty, rather than environmental issues. Only recently, he said, have environmental problems been recognized as falling disproportionately on the poor and minority neighborhoods.
 
At the Grass Roots
On the grass-roots level, many local environmental organizations, whose members and constituents are often those directly exposed to environmental threats, are led by blacks, Hispanic people or women, in contrast to the national groups.
The national environmental groups have formed an Environmental Consortium for Minority Outreach, which its , executive director, Gerry W. Stover, described as part of a ''concerted effort'' to remedy the hiring imbalance.
Among the other civil rights leaders signing the letter were the following:
 
Richard Moore of the Southwest Organizing Project.
Amos Favorite Sr. of the Ascension Parish Residents against Toxic Pollution in Louisiana.
Sharon Lewis of the Monte Santo Tenants Organization in Baton Rouge, La.
Bettye Ewing of the Mississippi Tenants Organization.
Rose Mary Smith of the Marrero Tenants Organization in Jefferson Parish, La.
The Rev. Avery C. Alexander of Louisiana.
Anne Braden of the Southern Organizing Committee For Economic and Social Justice.

HEADLINE: Immigration Policy Sends Blacks Back to South

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The explanations offered by the Census Bureau for confirmation of the movement of blacks back to the South, where the percentage of black Americans rose in the 1980's (news article, Jan. 10), overlooks the major reason for this exodus: namely, the urban black work force has been adversely affected by resurgence of mass immigration into the cities of the North and the West.
As late as 1910, more than 92 percent of the black population lived in the South. It was not until mass immigration from Europe was curtailed by the outbreak of World War I that blacks began to leave the South in unprecedented numbers. After that war, immigration was sharply curtailed by legislation. Immigration receded dramatically over the subsequent four decades. The percentage of the population that was foreign born fell from 13.2 percent in 1920 to a low of 4.7 percent in 1970. By then, the percentage of blacks living in the South had fallen to 53 percent. In the mid-60's, a new immigration law was adopted. It more than doubled the annual number of legal immigrants admitted. Significant increases have also occurred in refugee admissions (through administrative parole procedures and by new legislation enacted in 1980). Extensive abuses of the laws by illegal immigration, as well as the new gimmick of allowing United States employers to hire tens of thousands of nonimmigrant foreign workers each year have added to the scale of the immigrant flow. 
As a result, the 1980 Census showed that the foreign-born population had reversed previous declines and rose to 6.2 percent of the population (the real figure was higher because of the acknowledged undercount of illegal immigrants - especially in areas like New York City and Los Angeles). With the immigration and refugee policy developments of the 1980's, the foreign-born population should easily reach or exceed 9 percent of the population in the 1990 Census.
The impact of immigration is wholly an urban phenomenon. The 1980 Census showed that while 74 percent of the United States population was urban, 92 percent of the foreign born were. In cities like New York, the impact has been far greater (for example, 23.6 percent of New York City's population was foreign born in 1980, and the figure should easily exceed 25 percent in 1990). As the Census report shows, outside of the South the black population is overwhelmingly concentrated in urban areas -especially in the inner cities. Consequently, the urban black population has borne the brunt of the competition with immigrants for jobs, training opportunities, community services and housing.
In 1981, the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy (the Hesburgh Commission) found that United States immigration policy was ''out of control.'' It urged reforms that would confront ''the reality of limitations.'' Unfortunately, Congress has paid only lip service to this request and has found piecemeal ways to increase the annual flow of immigrants, refugees and nonimmigrant workers. Pending legislation will add only more ways to increase the size of the annual immigrant flow.
As matters stand, immigration is more out of control than it was when the reform movement began in the early 1980's. The major deficiency is that immigration policy is primarily designed to accommodate political goals. It is not accountable for its economic consequences. For much of the nation's urban black population outside the South, immigraton policy is but a revived instrument of institutional racism. It provides a way to bypass the national imperative to address the employment, job preparation and housing needs of much of the urban black population.
Before the 1920's, the effect of immigration policy was to keep blacks out of the urban North and West; in the 1980's, it has sent blacks back to the South.

HEADLINE: First Aid for a U.S. Agency

BYLINE: By Lowell Weicker Jr.; Lowell Weicker Jr., a former Senator from Connecticut, heads Research! America, a health-education group.

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va.

 BODY:
Every American ought to be outraged about what is happening to one of our great public assets - the National Institutes of Health.
The N.I.H. is to medical research what NASA is to space exploration: uncontestedly the best in the world. Unfortunately, we're letting this great national resource run down badly. To picture the seriousness of the situation, imagine that the N.I.H. is not a public agency but a private corporation. 
This hypothetical 100-year-old ''company'' has an unparalleled reputation for discovery. From the beginning, it has been at the forefront of technology development. It holds innumerable patents and has a closet full of Nobel Prizes. Its basic research has spawned the commercial success of many other companies.
The market for its output is of vital importance to the health of every person now alive or yet to be born. In its long history it has developed a proud tradition and a fierce sense of pride. As a financial investment, it has been the bluest of chips, producing a tremendous return on investment for its shareholders.
In recent years, however, it has fallen on hard times. Senior managers are leaving in droves, lured by the promise of greener pastures. Worse yet, it is failing to attract the bright young people who are the lifeblood of any organization.
Management is doing its best to cope, but there isn't enough money for salary increases, and cash flow is insufficient to continue operations at acceptable levels. Despite across-the-board cutbacks, layoffs may be needed to close budget gaps.
Deeply in debt, the parent company has been unable to raise money for new plant and equipment or to modernize its outdated facilities. Foreign competitors have begun eyeing the company's traditional markets and investing heavily in new equipment, technology and research.
On top of all that, the company's chief executive officer resigned more than six months ago, and no replacement has yet been found. Search firms have found several highly qualified candidates who, for philosophical reasons, were unacceptable to the company's chairman.
This hypothetical account pretty well describes the actual plight of our National Institutes of Health.
We should come to the rescue, as we did for the Chrysler Corporation. If we don't, we will be turning our backs on the best science that money can buy and on millions of people with incurable diseases whose only hopes are discoveries from the medical laboratories of America.
Preserving the N.I.H. is a matter both of national prestige and personal importance to every American. It is also a matter of considerable economic significance. Biomedicine is one of the few areas where we still outshine foreign competitors and enjoy a highly favorable balance of trade.
There's no better time, and no more urgent cause for Americans to rally around than medical research. There's no more deserving Government enterprise than the N.I.H.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Bush Won. Who Lost?

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The President won. Oh, yes, the President won - no question at all.
The man knows how to play hardball, no question about that either. When it came right down to it, down to showing who was boss and who would decide what was right or wrong, moral or immoral, no matter what Congress or the American public thought, the President knew how to throw that old ball right for the head. 
What a show he put on. Professionals will talk about it for years.
He threatened, warned, cajoled, made deals, called in every chip, summoned the help of every ally and vassal, until he whipped those Republican senators into line - all but eight of them. Thus did he prevent an override of his veto on a bill guaranteeing Chinese students the right to stay in this country.
Everybody knew the bill was a mark of Congressional outrage against the Bush policy of dumping the democracy movement in China to go along with the Communist Government that gave us Tiananmen Square.
So the President fought real hard and won. Now all that remains is to answer a couple of questions, which become more important every day. What did he win? That is a bit complicated. Certainly not the support of the American public on China. Certainly not the affection of the senators he turned around. Nobody forgets being forced publicly to go back on his word.
A few days after the Bush victory, the Senate, 98 to 0, passed a bill supporting the economic and military sanctions he seems so inclined to wipe out. But the bill permits Mr. Bush to drop the sanctions if he really wants to. The Senate stuck its tongue out, but its gums looked toothless.
But Congress did show the country once again that its members, even the turnabouts, do not have a stomach for the President's China policy.
Members of Congress would much rather have their constituents identify them with that young Chinese who put his body in the way of the tanks than with the wicked men who ordered the tanks in.
But, yes, it can be said that Mr. Bush won a couple of things. He showed Republican senators he could connect his power to their heads, and in Washington that commands respect if not affection.
Also he certainly made the butchers of Beijing happier. Now they should come across with one or two political favors; they owe him.
The pro-Beijing crowd in the U.S. coos with pleasure when the Chinese Communists disdainfully toss Washington a morsel - like ''lifting'' martial law imposed at the time of Tiananmen.
But other Americans, the rest of us, may be getting smarter. We have seen that when the Chinese Communists lift martial law, what is left under the lid is not legal freedoms but the same old ugly stew of kangaroo courts, police power, arbitrary arrest and forced labor. Under the martial law lid is martial law.
And surely most Americans will contemptuously dismiss the main Bush argument that we cannot boycott a billion Chinese. Nobody ever said we should.
We have an Ambassador in Beijing and did not need the high-level delegation the President stealthily sent over, the fawning toasts, the promises abandoned. All those were meant not as a message to the Chinese people but to the Chinese tyrants who rule over them. The message to these men, who ordered the shooting at Tiananmen Square, was: Murder may out, but it pays, boys, it pays. That leads to the second question. Who lost? Who will pay the price for the Bush victory?
Perhaps a few of the turnaround Republican senators may lose their seats. At primary or election time you don't have to remember all 34 of them, just your own man. For New Yorkers, the name is Alfonse D'Amato.
Eastern Europe has shown the only way to reform Communism is to end it. That is difficult for Americans who have spent years apologizing for one Chinese Communist Government after another to accept. They have too many political, economic, career or emotional interests at stake. In his State of the Union Message the President talked about the struggle for freedom in Europe but had not one word for the struggle in China.
But in China that lesson, reinforced in blood at Tiananmen, has been learned by the democracy movement - and by the Communist regime itself.
The struggle will continue. Because of Mr. Bush's Beijing veto victory it may be longer, and more Chinese will go to the horror camps, more will die.
So, Al, that answers the second question.

From Rohatyn, Unlikely Praise For New Mayor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
David N. Dinkins was Felix G. Rohatyn's second, maybe third, choice last year to be mayor of New York City. Now Mr. Rohatyn pays Mayor Dinkins what appears to be the ultimate compliment.
Yes, says Mr. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, there would have been stylistic contrasts had Edward I. Koch or Richard Ravitch, putatively Mr. Rohatyn's first choice, been elected instead. Also, each offered different strengths and weaknesses. 
''On balance,'' Mr. Rohatyn said, however, ''I can't see that anybody at this stage of the game would have done better than David.''
His tentative assessment, which many skeptics seem to share, reflects several factors that have defined Mr. Dinkins's first month as mayor:
Low expectations. One measure of just how low was that within two days of promising to be the toughest mayor on crime, Mr. Dinkins was roundly applauded for delaying the planned hiring of 1,848 police officers, thereby demonstrating the fiscal prudence that some feared he lacked.
''I don't think expectations were low,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, a former state official. ''I think there were concerns about how he would function in an executive capacity.'' Mark Green, the incoming Consumer Affairs Commissioner, offered another analysis, which repeatedly proved correct during the campaign: ''David has one asset: he's invariably been underestimated.''
High demands. This David was magnified as he immediately rose to the challenge of a budget-gap Goliath. Apparent preoccupation with the budget also bought more time to organize the government.
''David Dinkins has made in a timely fashion what are obviously painful decisions without drama, without histrionics and without flinching,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''He has given the lie to people who thought he would be paralyzed by an inability to act and torn by his compassion coming into brutal connection with economic realities.''
High time. ''Enough already!'' was a major factor in Mr. Dinkins's defeat of Mr. Koch. This mellower mayor, said Richard C. Wade, an urban historian and former Ravitch campaign adviser, has assembled a cabinet that is ''the most representative demographically that I've ever seen in any city.''
More blacks and women, in particular, predominate; white Catholics constitute a minority. Lucius J. Riccio, the Transportation Commissioner, is Italian-American but Protestant; Sanitation Commissioner Brendan Sexton, who hopes to remain in the administration, might be the last vestige of the Irish hegemony in New York City government.
That the crucial human resources commissionership remains vacant is as much a reflection of the lack of willing candidates as of Mr. Dinkins's deliberateness. Yet, even with so many new faces, his administration is considerably more conventional than that of Joseph A. Fernandez, the new Schools Chancellor. This reflects, in part, different mandates: Mr. Fernandez's, to brutalize the inefficient bureaucracy; Mr. Dinkins's, to soothe the city.
Mr. Dinkins's naming yesterday of Justice Milton Mollen as a fifth deputy mayor suggests that the fledgling Dinkins administration is still evolving. With policy largely driven by the budget, Norman Steisel is emerging as First Deputy Mayor in title and fact.
Has Mr. Dinkins made mistakes? A few. He failed to persuade the City Planning Commission to let the Board of Estimate vote on Brooklyn's biggest unsubsidized housing development in decades. He allowed opposition to his choice for health commissioner to fester, but again demonstrated he was not the captive of any single constituency.
Other tests loom larger. Today, he will signal his priorities in a preliminary budget. He resisted suggestions to scrap separate athletic programs for disabled students and raise class sizes in early grades, but delayed planned expansion of day care. Disparate cuts among agencies contrast with the review of possible across-the-board reductions that he suggested during the campaign. His next scheduled test will be labor negotiations in late spring.
On the surface, at least, Mr. Dinkins has surpassed the expectations of skeptics, but his term is only 2 percent complete.
''It's like the fellow who is falling out of the 12-story window,'' said Mr. Wade. ''Nothing's happened yet.''
So far, actually, Mr. Dinkins has landed on his feet. Soon, though, comparing him favorably with the candidates he defeated may continue to comfort lingering skeptics, but may no longer mollify supporters thirsting for change.
''In six months or a year,'' said Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn, ''that certainly won't be a compliment.''

HEADLINE: Threat of 455 Layoffs in Westchester

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Westchester County Executive said today that layoff notices would go out to 455 county employees starting on Thursday. But county officials said that it was uncertain how many would eventually be forced from their jobs to balance the county's budget, or which programs and services would be cut.
In a news conference, the County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said the notices would include a ''cautionary statement'' asking employees ''not to make career changes'' because he will propose budget amendments to the County Board of Legislators that could avert some or most of the layoffs.
The threat of the county's first layoffs since 1979 arose late last year, when the Board of Legislators rejected a 1990 budget proposed by Mr. O'Rourke that would have sent property taxes soaring an average of 27 percent. The budget that the board approved, the largest in the county's history at $1.008 billion, will still require an average property tax increase of 17 percent, but it is $37.5 million less than the original. 
The budget troubles, a result of the economic slowdown in the region and cutbacks in state and Federal aid, have spawned a political struggle between the legislators, who insist that the money can be saved by eliminating unfilled positions, and the County Executive, who has in recent weeks maintained that such amounts could not simply be ''taken out of pencils.''
 
Compromise Possible
A listing of all areas to be affected, which Mr. O'Rourke prepared earlier this month, included the closing of several parks, the elimination of all county dental clinics, the loss of $500,000 in overtime for corrections officers and a one-third reduction in the Department of Social Services's daycare unit.
The Westchester County District Attorney, Carl A. Vergari, said that his office, told to trim $1 million from its budget, will now drastically cut back on prosecuting misdemeanors.
Though hundreds of pink slips are ready to go out, it appears that Mr. O'Rourke and the Board of Legislators might reach a compromise, at least on the issue of layoffs. The budget amendments Mr. O'Rourke will propose either late this week or next, include spreading $12.7 million in personnel cuts throughout the entire budget, eliminating the need for as many layoffs, and taking out short-term loans.
His statements today were little comfort, however, to the hundreds of employees who were to receive the layoff notices. Even if many positions can be saved, county residents will almost certainly see the elimination of some programs and services.
 
'Our Patients Are Worried'
At the Westchester County Medical Center's Psychiatric Institute in Valhalla today, the mood was especially somber because the center was scheduled to be shut down under a recent money-saving proposal by the County Executive's office.
''I'm sick about it,'' said Michelle Turturro, from Yonkers who works there as a secretary. ''It's not just the paycheck. It's the emotional security that comes from working in a place you feel good about.''
Dr. Juliet Lesser, a staff psychologist, said the center was support for thousands of children and adults. ''There is no place else in the county that serves our patient population, which is largely poor,'' she said. ''Our patients are extremely worried. These people are really in grave danger.''
Farther north in Croton Point Park, a 550-acre finger of land jutting into the Hudson River, park employees were similarly anxious. Croton Point has been targeted to close. George Smalls, the 70-year-old assistant parks superintendent who has worked there since 1960, said, ''I wouldn't want to see the park close down completely, because after 30 years it's like home - aside from the job.''
 
'Bump-and-Retrieval'
Some members of the Board of Legislators point to Mr. O'Rourke's proposal to close 20 percent of the county's parkland as an example of his overreacting to their slimming down his original budget.
''Although they originally wanted a 19 percent increase in spending, the Parks Department is still getting a 12 percent increase over last year,'' said Sandra R. Galef, the Democratic minority leader on the 17-member board. ''I just don't see how they can't live on that.''
The people who receive layoff notices in the coming days will in all likelihood not be the ones ultimately to lose their jobs because of a process known as ''bump-and-retrieval'' in which seniority and rank are taken into account. Even though notices will go to the least senior person in an affected office or department, that person may have seniority over an employee in a similar position in another department. In that case, veteran workers would assume the jobs in another department held by employees of lesser seniority, who would then be laid off.
Priscilla Wheeler, 44, a district manager in the White Plains health department, is sure a notice will eventually float down to her. The Health Department's district office in Peekskill is scheduled to close, along with the district manager's job there, and of the half-dozen such managers in the county, she is the newest.
Other county governments in New York are also experiencing budget contraints.
The Suffolk County Executive, Patrick G. Halpin, recently projected a $20 million to $25 million shortfall for this year's $1.3 billion budget. The county has begun an austerity program, including a hiring freeze for all positions that do not concern public safety or produce money. Out-of-county travel is off-limits, as is most overtime there.
''Layoffs are not being considered at present, but certainly that's something we have to look at,'' said the Suffolk County Executive's spokesman, Bradford W. O'Hearn.

HEADLINE: Suffragist's Birthplace Is Bought

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOUNT LAUREL, N.J., Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Alice Paul Centennial Foundation has completed the purchase of Miss Paul's birthplace here, said a spokeswoman for the foundation, Janet Tegley.
The Moorestown-based group exercised its option to purchase the suffragist's 19th-century farmhouse and protect it from development in Mount Laurel, a booming community in Burlington County, Ms. Tegley said.
The foundation, formed in 1984 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Miss Paul's birth, had raced to raise about $500,000 to acquire the Greek Revival house, formally known as Paulsdale. 
Dozens of politicians, feminists and celebrities loaned their names to the cause, including Marlo Thomas, Bella Abzug and Shirley Chisholm, but the group raised only about $50,000.
In November, a consortium of seven New Jersey banks, backed by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, loaned the foundation $365,000. The foundation has three years to repay the loan, Ms. Tegley said.
''The fund-raising must continue,'' she said. ''There is still a lot yet to be done.''
The 12-room house, which was built in 1840, will be refurbished, and its broad wraparound porch will be restored.
The three-story white house, with its well-kept exterior and blue shutters, is listed on both the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places. It will be used as a conference center where the work of the suffragist can continue, and leadership seminars for women can be held.
Miss Paul was born in an upstairs bedroom in 1885 and lived in the house until she left for Swarthmore College in 1901. The house once overlooked the Paul family's 173-acre farm. It now sits on six and a half acres with a few crumbling outbuildings.
Miss Paul, who died in 1977 at age 92, founded the National Women's Party in 1916 and is widely credited with keeping the suffragist movement alive during World War I, when other advocates switched to the war effort.
She took the fight for enfranchisement out of parlors and into the streets when she organized a demonstration of 5,000 women to march during Woodrow Wilson's inauguration in 1913.
She also wrote the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, which was first introduced in Congress in 1923, and lobbied successfully for a clause barring sex discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

HEADLINE: 'Roger and Me': Documentary? Satire? Or Both?

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The first among the many questions that could be raised these days about Michael Moore's ''Roger and Me'' is this: Why has this low-budget muckraking documentary, with no box-office stars, no glamour and none of the content that normally draws the moviegoing public, achieved such popularity and profitability?
The answer embodies an irony. Mr. Moore's success is almost certainly due to his style of deadpan facetiousness, a style of black humor that has been likened by some admirers to Voltaire's ''Candide'' or Jonathan Swift's ''Modest Proposal.'' ''Roger and Me,'' as the critics have pointed out, is plainly entertaining, and moreover, it is a kind of David and Goliath revenge story, in which a modest, plain-speaking nobody triumphs morally over an evil corporate giant.
But lately some dissenting voices have arisen amid the general chorus of praise for ''Roger and Me,'' and that is where the irony lies. These critics - notably Harlan Jacobson, writing in Film Comment magazine, and Pauline Kael, in The New Yorker - have complained that Mr. Moore's film, although funny, is factually inaccurate. The film maker, they say, is guilty of manipulating the sequences of events and compressing them for the sake of emotional and political impact. ''Roger and Me,''in their view, is thus biased and misleading. 
 
Satire Is Exaggeration
What Mr. Moore's detractors are saying, in a sense, is that the very qualities that made the film successful - the elements of irreverence, satire, ridicule - are the very ones that make it misleading, since satire inevitably depends on a certain partiality and exaggeration, the creation of a villain, an artistic deformation of the real world.
And that in turn leads to a deeper issue regarding the genre of documentary film that Mr. Moore, an experienced advocacy journalist but a man with no film experience, seems to have defined anew. The complaints of unfairness are based on the assumption that a documentary is a piece of filmed journalism, and that it should obey the same rules of balance and objectivity that newspapers and television news are supposed to obey.
This does not mean that a good documentary can have no strongly held point of view, no quality of idiosyncracy. Some of the most celebrated examples of the genre, like Marcel Ophul's ''Sorrow and the Pity,'' Claude Lanzmann's ''Shoah,'' and Frederick Wiseman's 'Near Death,'' clearly embody the film makers' personal views of their subjects, just as Mr. Moore's film does.
 
A Question of Standards
Mr. Wiseman - whose 1967 documentary ''Titicut Follies,'' about conditions at a Massachusetts state prison for the criminally insane, still remains under a modified ban imposed by that state - says the question is really one of standards.
''I readily acknowledge that my films are biased, subjective, prejudiced, condensed, compressed,'' the experienced and well-regarded documentary film maker said in a telephone interview. Indeed, he said, all documentaries are necessarily distortions of reality, since, obviously, they are filmed through a lens and edited. Events that might have taken place over weeks, months or years are reduced to a presentation of, at most, a few hours.
''But I think that my films are fair,'' Mr. Wiseman continued, ''and by fair I mean that they are an accurate account of the experience I had when making the film rather than an imposition of a preconceived point of view.''
But does this apply to ''Roger and Me?'' Is it really a documentary like any other, or is it more like a Swiftian satire - with the audience knowing it is satire - and therefore dependent on intentional exaggeration in order to call attention to what might be seen as the higher truth? Moreover, if ''Roger and Me'' had hewed to standard, impartial journalistic practices, could it have been as entertaining, as personal, as sharply targeted and therefore as successful as it has become?
 
Finding a Target
Mr. Moore's film focuses on his hometown, Flint, Mich., once known as Pontiac City, where, according to ''Roger and Me,'' the closing of 11 factories and the layoff of 30,000 workers by a callous General Motors management created unspeakable hardship and decline.
Mr. Moore, who is the film's narrator, interviewer and chief screen presence, not only traces the deterioration of Flint, but also finds a target for his satire. This is Roger Smith, the General Motors chairman, who, protected by a blindly obedient bureaucracy of guards and public relations agents, rejects all of Mr. Moore's efforts to interview him or to bring him to Flint to see for himself the suffering that his policies - portrayed as greedy and unnecessary by Mr. Moore - have allegedly brought about.
The criticisms of Mr. Moore, which were first outlined by Mr. Jacobson and then were picked up by Ms. Kael in a sharply critical review, are based on several points. First, as Mr. Jacobson wrote, the film compressed events that actually took place over a long period of time and altered the sequence of some of them. The 11 plant closings affected 4 states, not just Flint. The 30,000 jobs lost in Flint were lost over 12 years, not the far shorter span suggested - though never explicitly stated - by Mr. Moore in ''Roger and Me.''
 
Assumptions Are Inevitable
Aside from the factual complaints - most of which are deemed innacurate by Mr. Moore - Ms. Kael argues that ''Roger and Me'' is a piece of ''gonzo demagoguery'' in which most of the people who appear, with the exception of Mr. Moore, are portrayed as just a bit idiotic, as though they have been ambushed by the camera. At the same time, there is no effort to explore in any depth at all what might be seen as General Motors's and Mr. Smith's side of the story, no accounting, for example, of why the plant closings took place and what General Motors tried to do to cushion the blow suffered by its workers.
Mr. Moore is thus assailed for making, by clever cutting and editorial work, some people appear more ridiculous than they might otherwise have appeared, while at the same time giving a false impression of Flint's economic calamity. ''Roger and Me,'' these criticisms imply, make it appear that the city underwent a brutally sudden collapse, all due to the uncaring, inhumane policies of General Motors's Mr. Smith, who is protected by a phalanx of guards and public relations agents who exempt him from having to justify his policies or decisions.
Mr. Moore has said in interviews that he did compress events, but that his film nonetheless is true to what actually happened in Flint, his hometown, where, he believes, General Motors did abandon its social responsibility to help workers it was laying off.
 
'All Art Manipulates'
''I am partial,'' Mr. Moore said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''The film has a point of view, but I did not distort the facts or, as Harlan Jacobson says, play fast and loose with the truth in order to make my political point. There's a certain comedic license that is being taken with the film.''
Pressed in his interview with Mr. Jacobson about his presentation of events, Mr. Moore said: ''All art -listen, every piece of journalism -manipulates sequence and things.''
''It's a movie, you know,'' he said. ''You can't do everything. I was true to what happened. Everything that happened in the movie happened. It happened in the same order that it happened through the 80's.''
It is possible to end up in a middle position on the question of ''Roger and Me'': a belief that the film was clearly intended to poke fun, to be satire rather than conventional documentary and thus should not be condemned for its partial and even biased presentation of the data. But mingling with that idea is an unease that, in the end, some of the impact of the film is dissipated precisely because the audience cannot rely on the history of Flint as Mr. Moore presents it. The basic question -what was the responsibility of Mr. Smith and General Motors for Flint's decline? - is obscured by the very mode of comic exaggeration that Mr. Moore employs.
''I think the criticism is carping,'' said William Wolf, a former film critic who teaches at New York University, ''because I do think the film is special. Moore might have been a little more savvy in guessing that he would have some criticisms and in guarding against them, but he was doing a personal essay and should have a lot of freedom to raise all sorts of hell.''
 
Parody Is Attention-Getting
Mr. Moore, this argument could continue, was no more operating within the standard framework of journalism than was Jonathan Swift when he wrote his ''Modest Proposal,'' in which he suggested that a cure for the Irish famine would come if people started eating their babies. Swift's parody was aimed at calling closer attention to the famine than yet another even-handed, judicious piece of reporting could have, and so, it could be argued, was Mr. Moore's.
What makes ''Roger and Me'' different in this regard is its clear message from the beginning that it is going, as Mr. Wolf put it, to be ''a highly effervescent expression of a film maker who is sounding off on a topic that films don't usually treat.'' Mr. Moore in this sense signals from the very beginning - indeed, from the title itself - that he is fashioning a highly personal document, not a dispassionate academic treatment of a complex subject.
If, for example, Mr. Moore had entitled his film something like ''General Motors and Flint: The Making of a Calamity,'' he would have been signaling a conventional journalistic treatment. To his supporters, the title ''Roger and Me,'' clearly shows in advance that irreverence, eccentricity and a highly personalized view are all among his primary intentions.

HEADLINE: Policy Shift On Bailouts Is Explored

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The chairman of the agency created to manage the bailout of the savings industry said today that the number of ailing institutions had soared to such an extent that the Government should consider keeping some of them open rather than taking them over.
''The whole point is to find the lowest-cost way to handle this problem,'' L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. ''The problem is that once an institution is taken over, the costs of selling it off rapidly goes up.''
Later in the day, Federal regulators seized control of Merabank, Arizona's largest savings institution. Merabank is the fourth largest of the more than 300 institutions seized so far by regulators. [Page D5.] Abrupt Change in Policy In an interview after the session, Mr. Seidman said he had asked the oversight board of the trust corporation to consider trying to revive some ailing institutions. He said the board had told him to conduct a feasibility study, which is under way. 
Such a strategy, if adopted, would represent an abrupt change in how the Government deals with ailing savings institutions. Mr. Seidman is the first regulator to raise publicly the possibility of trying to nurse ailing institutions back to health.
Congress and the Bush Administration decided last year that the best way to control the cost of the savings crisis was to take over all the problem institutions as quickly as possible and sell them or close them to prevent further losses.
Some members of Congress had repeatedly criticized savings regulators for delaying the closing of ailing savings institutions, arguing that doing so increased the cost of the crisis.
Those critics say that keeping ailing institutions open is expensive because they must pay higher interest rates than competitors to attract deposits. In turn, those higher rates force healthy institutions to offer higher interest rates to hold their depositors.
 
Reputation for Straight Talk
Considering that vehemence in Congress, Mr. Seidman is perhaps the only regulator who could credibly propose such a change in strategy. A longtime Washington hand who served as President Gerald R. Ford's chief domestic policy adviser, Mr. Seidman has a reputation in Congress and in the banking and savings industries for straight talk and skillful management.
Members of the banking committee did not make much of Mr. Seidman's statement, which came at the end of a three-and-a-half-hour hearing on the progress of the savings industry cleanup.
In suggesting that the takeover policy be re-examined, Mr. Seidman seemed to imply that the risk of further losses from institutions kept open was more acceptable than the ultimate cost of taking them over in the next year.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady estimated a year ago that $50 billion would be needed to take over and sell 300 insolvent institutions.
But regulators now warn that the number of such institutions is almost certain to exceed 600, and might go as high as 800 institutions, with assets approaching $500 billion.
Last week, Mr. Seidman testified before Congress that the cost of the savings bailout was likely to far exceed the $50 billion allocated by Congress last year.
Regulators have estimated that once the Government takes over an ailing savings institution, investors reduce the amount they are willing to pay for the institution by as much as 20 percent.
When the Government intervenes, there is generally a certain disruption of continuing business activities, as regulators impose restraints and perhaps foreclose on some income-producing properties.
 
'This Is Total Heresy'
Banking experts who know Mr. Seidman described his statement as a subtle but highly significant admission that he fears the potentially astronomical cost of the bailout plan.
''For a Republican Administration, this is total heresy,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. ''But, thank God, Seidman is leaving ideology behind and going with a new approach, which may be less expensive to the taxpayer.''
Eric I. Hemel, a securities analyst at the First Boston Corporation and former director of economic policy at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, commented: ''It is a very plaintive cry by Seidman. He is saying that the R.T.C. does not have enough resources and operating flexibility they need to get the job done and that they are being badly taxed by the job they have to do. He is being forced into this position.''
 
Not a Return to the Mid-1980's
Mr. Seidman noted that he was not advocating a return to the regulatory approach of the mid-1980's, when savings and loan officials kept hopelessly insolvent institutions open in the hope that the economy would turn around.
Rather, he said his agency would focus on distressed institutions that were still profitable and had some hope of survival. He added that any institutions that might be left open would be subject to heavy scrutiny by the regulators.
He would not estimate how many institutions that might be, but suggested that they might be treated like the New York savings banks were in the early 1980's.
Because of soaring interest rates, the savings banks found they were paying 15 percent and more on deposits, while earning only about 7 percent or so on mortgage loans, a situation that is called an interest-rate mismatch.
''In effect the entire industry was broke,'' Mr. Seidman said.
Regulators thought that interest rates would eventually fall and that the banks could return to profitability as long as they could be prevented, through growth restraints and other management controls, from making high-risk investments out of desperation.
 
'We Kept Those Banks Open'
For the most part, the savings banks did recover, and Mr. Seidman said the ultimate cost of the New York crisis to the nation's bank insurance fund would be about $2 billion.
''We kept those banks open, helped them out and eventually got them back on their feet,'' Mr. Seidman said.
Mr. Guenther of the Independent Bankers Association said the approach Mr. Seidman was studying was similar to that taken in the 1930's by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which injected aid into hundreds of ailing banks, kept them open and eventually nursed them back to health when the country came out of the Depression.
''We suggested an R.F.C.-type approach last year and were rejected by the Treasury,'' Mr. Guenther said. ''We were told it was a Democratic idea.''
The cost of the bailout continues to concern both lawmakers and regulators, and members of the panel tried to get Treasury officials to acknowledge that the $50 billion allocated to the R.T.C. over a three-year period would not be enough to handle the task of cleaning up the industry.
''I don't want to sit here and have everybody say, 'Robson came up here and told us it was $50 billion, period,' because it could be more,'' said John Robson, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. ''Circumstances of the economy, circumstances of interest rates and a variety of things can affect that.''

HEADLINE: Stocks End 5-Day Slide; Dow Up 47.30

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
After five losing sessions, stock prices rose yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 47.30 points, or 1.9 percent higher, to 2,590.54.
The jump on the Dow was the biggest since it climbed 56.95 points on Jan. 2, to a record 2,810.15. Between that rise and yesterday, prices had moved lower, and the Dow ended the month down 162.66, a drop of 5.9 percent. It was the Dow's worst month since it fell 8 percent in November 1987. 
Secondary averages moved up less briskly, with the American Stock Exchange market value index gaining 4.57 points, or 1.3 percent, to 350.07. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index moved up 5.09 points, or 1.2 percent, to 415.81. For the month, the Amex index fell 7.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 8.6 percent. 1,116 Issues Up Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1, with 1,116 issues higher in price and only 449 lower.
Analysts said the market's rally was technical in many aspects, after its slow selloff during January.
Investors, traders said, were also encouraged by speculation that President Bush's State of the Union address would call on the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce their military forces in Europe. The President, in fact, did make such a recommendation last night.
That speculation also helped prompt a rally in bond prices that pushed yields down and, traders said, encouraged buying in the stock market.
''Despite the final outcome, the market had the same problems today that it faced yesterday - an unyielding Federal Reserve Board, reduced corporate earnings, disappearing mergers and acquisitions, and widespread pessimism,'' said Gene Jay Seagle, chief technical analyst at Gruntal & Company. ''But what a difference a day makes.
''Sentiment is depressed as we get to important bottoms,'' he added. ''With the market down for five straight days, a normal retracing of the decline would mean about a 150-point rally back to 2,650 before the selling overhead resumes.''
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.10 points, to 329.08, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.07 points, to 181.50.
A total of 189.7 million shares changed hands, up from the 186 million traded on Tuesday.
''It appears that rising interest rates and already announced fourth-quarter earnings reports, which dragged stock prices lower throughout most of January, have at least temporarily come to a halt,'' said Robert E. Walsh, a portfolio manager at Jenswold, King & Associates in Houston. ''After a four-week decline, the market was oversold from a technical standpoint.''
Mr. Walsh said the four-day advance in the interest-sensitive Dow Jones utility average indicated that interest rates are not likely to move appreciably higher over the near term. ''Other positives include a high institutional cash position and net buying by insiders for the past 10 out of 12 weeks,'' he added.
 
Occidental Most Active
Among individual issues, Occidental Petroleum was the most active stock, ending unchanged at 26 5/8, on a volume of 6.3 million shares. Oil industry officials said Occidental's chairman, Armand Hammer, had held talks with Moroccan officials on an oil exploration agreement.
Dow Chemical dropped 1 3/4, to 63 7/8. The company reported lower than expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.59 a share, down from $2.29 a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Some analysts had expected profits to be about $1.95 a share.
Philip Morris rose 7/8, to 37 7/8. The company reported that net earnings for 1989 rose 26.1 percent on an operating revenues rise of 41 percent.
Xerox climbed 2 3/8, to 55 1/2. The company reported higher than expected earnings of $2.01 a share. Most Wall Street estimates had been in the range of $1.25 to $1.75 a share.
Active glamour stocks included A.T.& T., up 1 1/4, to 39; Chase Manhattan up 3/8, to 30 3/4; I.B.M., up 1 3/8, to 98 5/8, and General Electric up 1/2, to 62 1/4.

HEADLINE: School Reform: Business Moves In

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
When it comes to reforming the nation's schools, these days the leading radicals are likely to be wearing pin-striped suits and come from oak-paneled board rooms rather than the ivy-covered walls of academia.
Many of these corporate leaders have for years had tutoring and ''adopt-a-school'' programs that put computers in classrooms and lent employees to help students with lessons. But now companies are moving into a second phase, some experts say, one that emphasizes core structure - how the schools are run -over core curriculum in their aid to education.
In doing so, companies are trying to transfer to schools some of the organizational, management and free-market approaches that executives have used to meet the challenge of foreign competition.
Now, concerned about losing business to foreign companies with better-educated workers and dismayed by the slow pace of educational progress in this country, Xerox, Chevron, I.B.M., A.T.&T., Exxon and other corporations have recently spurred some of the most fundamental revamping of schools in decades:
* In this city, Eastman Kodak and other businesses have strongly backed reforms that are turning the local school system into a national prototype for modern education. The changes have sharply raised the salaries of teachers and set up programs to help them do their jobs better. At the same time, they are held more accountable for students' performance and can be dismissed more quickly for incompetence. 
* In Chicago, a coalition of businesses successfully led the lobby to pass perhaps the most sweeping school decentralization plan in this country. Now each of that city's nearly 600 schools is a semi-independent operation run by its own governing board.
* In Milwaukee, a group of corporations is providing management experts to help individual schools take into their own hands more decision-making on curriculum and other policies. New York City has a smaller version of the plan, using retired executives.
* And in at least two cities, companies have even started their own elementary and secondary schools, offering them as models of progressive education on a limited budget.
''Corporate involvement in education, historically, has been a grip and grin kind of thing,'' said John Lennes, director of governmental relations for the Minnesota Business Roundtable. ''You would go out, shake a lot of hands and give out certificates and a $500 check at the local high school. It was all one big photo op. What's changing is that the private sector is talking about sharing ideas and experiences.''
The companies are pushing such ideas as allowing principals and teachers to make more policy decisions; increasing perfomance incentives for teachers; making teachers and administrators more accountable for student achievement, and raising the competition among public schools for students. Some companies are supplying technical expertise and contributing research and development money.
Companies are also banding together to put pressure on state legislatures and school boards to adopt more business-like approaches to education. But so far there has been more talk than action.
 
A Fear of Mistrust
Many executives are moving tentatively, and for the most part are avoiding curriculum issues, aware that they lack knowledge of many basic educational issues. Some are also concerned that their efforts may breed mistrust among educators and local politicians.
''I think that one of the things that is holding business back is that they are not quite sure what to do,'' said Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco Inc. ''There have been traditional responses such as adopt-a-school and internship programs. They are terrific, but they perpetuate the status quo. When you talk about being an agent of fundamental change, of helping the reformers shake up the educational establishment, that becomes more difficult for business.''
Still, despite these concerns, there is enough activity to indicate a nascent trend.
In November, RJR Nabisco announced it was giving grants totaling $30 million over a five-year period to school systems that develop innovative, yet practical, ways to improve education. RJR said it wants to finance programs that bring more control and accountability to the individual school, provide more options for students, make greater use of technology and employ non-traditional concepts, like longer school days and alternative and speedier ways to license teachers.
''We want to fund the china-breakers,'' Mr. Gerstner said, ''people who want to try very different things that bureaucracies traditionally don't want to fund.''
 
Inner-City School Started
In Chicago, whose schools were once described by former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett as the ''worst in the nation,'' a group of businesses including Quaker Oats, McDonald's, Baxter International and Sears, Roebuck has started its own private school for poor, inner-city children as a demonstration laboratory for educational innovation.
The Minnesota Business Partnership, an organization of 87 corporations, was a prime force in getting that state's Legislature to approve a plan to spur competition among schools. The main part of the plan gives children the choice of attending any public school in the state.
Supporters of the plan say marginal schools will have to improve to attract students - and state aid - or go out of business. Critics say the bad schools will remain, filled with poor and probably minority students unable to move as freely as more affluent ones.
The California Roundtable, whose lobbying efforts in 1973 helped pass legislation to toughen high school graduation requirements, is now promoting a bill that provides $57 million for local school districts to design and carry out demonstration projects that involve early childhood education, provide more autonomy for individual schools and develop student and school performance standards.
 
A Fight on Tenure
In New York, New York City Partnership Inc., a business and civic organization, plans to lobby the State Legislature to abolish school-based tenure, which prohibits the transfer of a principal unless he or she is guilty of gross incompetence.
In September, the National Alliance for Business issued a ''Blueprint for Business on Restructuring Education,'' a primer to help business develop strategies to pass fundamental changes in their local or state school systems.
Among the changes supported by business leaders in Rochester were improved salaries that allow some teachers to earn nearly $70,000 annually; a peer review process to help teachers who are performing poorly and to make it easier to dismiss incompetent ones.
One of the biggest changes made in any school system is a requirement that Rochester teachers take responsibility for small groups of students, including making home visits to see if problems outside of school are affecting classroom performance.
Rochester has also set up management committees of teachers, parents, administrators and some students to run each school.
 
Better Skills Required
The impetus behind the corporate embrace of education reform is concern about the quality of the American labor pool. As robots and computers increasingly take over rote manual work, even entry-level workers will require better reading, math and problem-solving skills than are now the norm, labor experts say.
The most recent comprehensive Federal reports show only slight improvement in reading skills since 1971, and virtually no change in writing proficiency since 1974.
Further worrying corporations is that within 10 years white males, who tend to score the highest on standardized academic tests, will constitute less than 10 percent of the net growth in the work force. While minorities, especially blacks, have made significant progress in cutting their dropout rate, and improving their performance on standardized tests, they still lag far behind white pupils.
 
Giving Schools Independence
Key to the changes promoted by many business leaders is decentralized decision-making; an idea often summed up by the phrase ''school-based management.'' Under this theory, teachers, principals and parents at individual schools are given much more independence in areas like budgeting, designing curriculum and contracting for services. Proponents say they have a clearer idea of the needs of the school and students than do administrators at a central school board. By treating pupils more like consumers, local schools can move much quicker to improve in the areas most needed by their students.
''School-based management is a concept that appeals to business executives who have gone through two decades of organizational thought that stresses decentralized decision-making,'' Mr. Gerstner said.
Skeptics note that a form of decentralization has been in place in New York City for 20 years, during which time the schools have deteriorated. Recently, the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, decreed that because of scandals and allegations of widespread corruption, the city's 32 local school boards had to let him review all candidates for district superintendent.
But Mr. Fernandez is a strong proponent of school-based management, making the concept the centerpiece of his first budget.
 
Accountability Stressed
Executives and reformers who advocate school-based management say the concept will work, as long as the success or failure of the local governing councils can be measured and they are held accountable for their school's performance.
Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, an educational study group in Rochester, said that one way to inject a measure of accountability was to make schools compete by allowing students to choose their schools.
''We need to decentralize for a lot of sound management reasons,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''But we also need a free-market system because of the incentives it provides.''
For local management to work, many reformers add, individual governing councils will need training in budgeting, planning and other skills needed to run a small company. Businesses can provide expertise to schools in many of these areas.
The biggest worry, executives involved in school reform say, is public and corporate impatience. In recent years, American businesses have been criticized for concentrating on short-term profits and neglecting long-term investments. Reformers say it will take years before educational restructuring produces real gains.
''The big unanswered question is whether these guys have the staying power to hang in there,'' said Denis T. Doyle, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a co-author of a book on educational reform written with David T. Kearns, chairman of the Xerox Corporation.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Climb 0.8%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Government's most widely followed economic forecasting gauge rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in December, the biggest gain since April, the Commerce Department reported today.
The rise in the index of leading indicators was somewhat larger than anticipated and was regarded as pointing to continued growth, even though some of the advance represented a statistical rebound from a 48-day strike at the Boeing Company that ended in late November.
''It's a good, solid, respectable increase,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company, adding that the report was ''a welcome change of pace from the flatness'' registered by the index since early summer.
But a report today on home sales offered something of a counterpoint to the leading indicators. The Commerce Department said sales of single-family homes fell 9.6 percent in December, ending the worst year for home sales since 1984. [Page D6.] Greenspan Testimony The leading indicators report followed assertions on Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the chances of recession had waned. In his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan cited the index, whose historic patterns had been scrutinized by Fed analysts, as signaling only a one-in-five chance of a recession during the first half of 1990. 
In another report today, the National Bureau of Economic Research said its experimental recession index now registers a 6 percent chance that the economy will be in recession at midyear, down from a 9 percent chance a month ago.
The research bureau, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a private organization headed by Martin S. Feldstein, former top economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Economists consider the bureau the nation's quasi-official designator of a recession, which is usually defined as two straight quarters of contracting economic activity although shorter or longer periods could be deemed recessions.
 
Research Firm's Outlook
Another private-sector forecasting index, one compiled by Safian Investment Research in New York, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month after showing little change in November. Eleven of the 22 components making up the firm's Composite Forecasting Index rose during the month.
A less optimistic reading, however, came from Jesup & Lamont's Macro-Economic Index, which rose slightly to minus 70 from minus 72 but still maintains the recession prediction it first signaled in August.
In addition, the leading index compiled by the Columbia Business School of activity in the service sector of the economy fell again in December, reducing its annualized growth rate to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent in November.
The rise in the Commerce Department's index followed a November increase of one-tenth of 1 percent and matched the gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent in April 1989 and August 1988. Not since June 1988, when there was a 1.6 percent jump, has last month's rise been exceeded.
For the year, however, the index rose a scant four-tenths of 1 percent, down sharply from the 3.9 percent increase in 1988. This was the weakest performance since 1984, when there was a 1.5 percent decline, and suggested that although economic growth is expected to continue this year, it will probably be sluggish.
Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 1989 slowed to an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, or to 1 percent, after adjusting for the strike at Boeing.
 
Increases in Factory Orders
Six of the 11 elements in the leading index contributed to the December advance, paced by a rise in manufacturers' unfilled orders and contracts and new orders for plant and equipment. Both of these were higher largely because of the end of the strike at Boeing, which is enjoying a boom in commercial airliner orders.
The other four advancing elements were higher stock prices; more rapid growth in the M-2 money supply, which measures currency plus checking accounts and some time deposits; a rise in building permits, and a strengthening of consumer expectations.
Restraining the index were a decline in prices that are particularly sensitive to swings in the business cycle, like copper prices; a rise in initial claims for state unemployment insurance; lower new orders by manufacturers for consumer goods and materials, and a speedup in the delivery of goods by suppliers.
The 11th component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged at 40.7 hours.
 
Previous Predictions
Since most of the items making up the index have been previously reported in one fashion or another, analysts generally are able to predict the figure with some confidence.
The consensus estimate, of a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent, was a bit low in part because of an upward revision in building permits. There was no revision, however, of the index itself for October or November, a rare occurrence.
By quarters last year, the index rose seven-tenths in the winter, fell five-tenths in the spring, fell one-tenth in the summer and rose two-tenths in the fall, today's report showed.
The leading index now stands at 145.7, or 45.7 percent higher than its 1982 base of 100.
Two companion economic indexes also gained in December, today's report showed. The index of coincident indicators, which tracks current economic conditions, rose four-tenths of 1 percent, to 134.2, while the index of lagging indicators, which is intended to confirm turning points in the economy after they have occurred, rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to 120.9.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Is Urged to Sell Gold as Hedge Against Bad Loans

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The United States has proposed that the International Monetary Fund sell about three million ounces of gold, which at current market prices could raise more than $1 billion, to buttress the global lending agency against the growing problem of delinquent payments by its members.
Reports that the Treasury had made such a proposal roiled the futures markets, pushing down gold prices. [Page D17.] A Treasury official said tonight that the idea had been put forward in discussions among the fund's members over increasing the capital of the organization to meet expected increases in demand for its resources. 
The American position is that any decision on increasing resources must also address the problem of overdue payments by 15 of the agency's 152 member countries, the official said. The arrears total $4 billion.
 
Broad Support Lacking
Under the American proposal, which does not have wide support on the fund's board, the countries in arrears would bear part of the cost from their failure to fulfill obligations. The nations include some of the poorest countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
The plan calls for the gold holdings subscribed by these countries to be ''mobilized,'' the official said. This could mean sales in the market or sales to other governments.
The I.M.F.'s gold resources have accumulated through original membership requirements under which a portion of a country's borrowing rights are paid in gold.
The 15 countries had paid in something less than 3 percent of the 103 million ounces of gold now held by the agency.
The fund last sold gold in the mid-1970's. The agency had disposed of 50 million ounces, half of which was sold in the market and the other half to its members in proportion to their borrowing rights.
The purpose of the transactions was to raise money for a trust fund to help the poorest countries.
The American proposal, the monetary officials said, does not have broad support on the I.M.F.'s board and is opposed by the agency's managing director, Michel Camdessus, a former governor of the central bank of France.
Mr. Camdessus, the officials said, believes the I.M.F.'s gold resources reinforce its financial strength and should be left intact.
 
Administration Sees Problems
But the Bush Administration contends that the agency has not taken strong enough action to clear up the arrears and that the arrears will pose a problem in trying to convince Congress to back a new increase in the agency's resources.
The fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, were formed after World War II in efforts to stabilize the postwar world.
To qualify for the fund's credits, borrowers must meet certain financial conditions aimed at strengthening their economic performance.

HEADLINE: Profits Fall At 2 Steel Companies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest steel producer, and Armco Inc. the fifth-largest, reported lower earnings yesterday, reflecting softer demand for steel products and higher operating costs, the companies said.
Bethlehem Steel's earnings dropped by 23.9 percent in the fourth quarter, to $50 million, or 57 cents a share, from $65.7 million, or 77 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. The company's revenues were down by 14 percent, to $1.14 billion from $1.33 billion. 
For the year, Bethlehem reported a net income of $245.7 million, or $2.93 a share, down by 39 percent from $403 million, or $5.32 a share, in 1988. Its revenues were down by 4 percent, to $5.25 billion for last year from $5.48 million in 1988.
Walter F. Williams, the chairman and chief executive, said Bethlehem's production costs were higher for the year, largely because of increased prices for alloys and other raw materials. The results were also affected, he said, by work stoppages by union employees at the company's coal plants.
The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., said its basic steel operations unit had an operating income of $63 million for the quarter, down by 19 percent from $78 million.
''Domestic steel consumption remained relatively strong in 1989, in spite of a sharp decline in the automotive market during the second half of the year,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Consumption in the construction, machinery, energy-related and rail transportation markets increased moderately.''
 
Armco
Armco, based in Parsippany, N.J., said its fourth-quarter income dropped by 51.6 percent, to $15.5 million, or 15 cents a share, from $32 million, or 34 cents a share. Its sales fell by nearly half, to $416.2 million from $831.3 million.
The sales decline resulted from the sale of 40 percent of the company's Eastern Steel division to the Kawasaki Steel Corporation of Japan.
The quarterly results also included a charge of $3.3 million for work force reductions at a plant in Kansas City, Mo., and a $2.9 million reduction of a previously recorded gain on the Kawasaki Steel sale.
For all of last year, Armco's net income totaled $165 million, or $1.78 a share, up by 13 percent from $145.4 million, or $1.57 a share, in 1988. The company's sales were down by 24 percent, to $2.42 billion from $3.22 billion.
Robert E. Boni, Armco's chairman and chief executive, said the weakness in the second half of last year ''was worse than anticipated, as the fourth quarter never rebounded from the seasonal weakness of the third quarter.''
He said the results were also affected by a slowdown in the economy, particularly in the automotive industry. Mr. Boni also cited ''soft demand, a poor product mix and lower prices.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seizes Arizona's Biggest Savings Institution

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The collapse of the real estate market in Arizona claimed another victim today when Federal regulators seized control of Merabank, the state's largest savings and loan institution, from its parent company, the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation.
Merabank, with $6.5 billion in assets, is the fourth-largest of the more than 300 institutions seized by regulators as they try to cope with the savings and loan crisis.
Regulators said that Merabank could not meet any of the Government's new standards for financial health and that the institution would record additional losses, plunging it so deeply into insolvency as to leave it no chance of recovery.
 
Effect of Real Estate Market
''This reflects the continued deterioration in the Arizona real estate marketplace,'' said Eric Shand, the deputy district director of the San Francisco branch of the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
The Government's action was not unexpected because Pinnacle West had agreed with regulators in December to inject $450 million in additional capital into Merabank in return for the Government assuming responsibility for any further losses, a clear indication that the Government would eventually take control of the institution.
The collapse of the Arizona real estate market has had nearly as much impact on financial institutions as the collapse in Texas. A number of savings-and-loan institutions in the state, including Western Savings of Phoenix, have already been taken over, and the troubles in Arizona have contributed to the failures of other institutions, including the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was owned by the Phoenix developer Charles H. Keating Jr. but was based in California.
Banks, too, have suffered because of their exposure in Arizona. Several weeks ago the First Interstate Bancorp reported a $124 million loss for 1989 that it attributed partly to Arizona's woes.
 
End of a Failed Effort
The seizure closed out the failed effort of Pinnacle West, an electric utility company based in Phoenix, to expand and diversify by acquiring Merabank and moving aggressively into real estate development and lending. The utility paid $421 million for the institution in 1986 and then pushed it to grow rapidly just as a long economic boom in Arizona ended and the real estate market turned down.
Merabank lost more than $200 million in 1988 and posted losses of $190.1 million for the first nine months of last year. Mr. Shand said regulators had determined that the institution would suffer further losses of $390 million on its direct real estate investments, land and construction loans and other real estate-related lending.
Regulators said the institution is also losing a substantial amount of money on an operating basis because so many of its loans are troubled that the interest it takes in on its loan portfolio is not enough to cover the interest it pays out on deposits and its other expenses.
 
Negative Capital
Pinnacle West executives said they would proceed with plans to inject the additional $450 million into the institution, which they must do by March 31. Even with the new capital, however, the institution's most basic measure of financial health, the tangible capital, would stand at negative $280 million after accounting for all the expected losses. That situation means Merabank, with its $6.5 billion in assets, would have needed to raise nearly $500 million in new capital over the next few years to bring it into compliance with the new Government standards.
The seizure is a blessing in disguise for Pinnacle West, which has seen its earnings and stock price dragged down by the problems in the savings unit. Last year, Pinnacle West received a takeover offer from Pacificorp, another large utility company, based in Portland, Ore. Pinnacle West rejected the bid as inadequate in December.
A spokesman for Pacificorp, Mike Nelson, said the company had not been aware of the Merabank seizure and that it was too early to say what effect, if any, the action might have on its further interest in Pinnacle West.
The announcement of the Government's action came after the markets closed yesterday. Pinnacle's share price ended the day up 12.5 cents, to $10.875 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Write-Off Planned
Henry Sargent, Pinnacle West's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company expects to account for the planned $450 million capital injection as a charge for discontinued operations in its financial results for the last three months of 1989.
He said that charge would result in Pinnacle West posting a net loss for the year in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But he said that Pinnacle West would not have to account for any of the new losses uncovered by the Government following the agreement with regulators in December to inject the new capital.
''We see this as a neutral event for Pinnacle West,'' Mr. Sargent said.

HEADLINE: December New-Home Sales Off 9.6%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell 9.6 percent in December, ending the worst year for new-home sales since 1984, the Commerce Department said today.
For all of 1989, sales fell 3.8 percent, to 650,000 units, from 676,000 units in 1988. It was the weakest year since 1984, when sales totaled 639,000 units. 
Analysts attributed the pullback to a sluggish economy, sated demand after a six-year housing boom, relatively high interest rates and climbing prices for homes.
The median sales price for the full year rose 6.7 percent, to $120,000, from $112,500 in 1988. At the median price, half the homes sold in the United States cost more and half cost less.
The Commerce Department revised November sales to show an increase of 9.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 696,000 units, instead of the previously reported 9.6 percent rise. In December, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was 629,000 units.
The sharpest drop in December sales occurred in the Midwest, where they were down 28.3 percent from November.
Sales fell 9.1 percent in the West from November levels and were down 6.2 percent in the South.
But in the Northeast, December seasonally adjusted sales rose 4 percent from November levels.
In December, sales before seasonal adjustment fell to 39,000 units, from 47,000 in November and 51,000 in October.
The median sales price in December rose 4 percent, to $130,100, from $125,000 in November.
The National Association of Realtors said its index for measuring housing affordability rose to 108.2 in December from 105.5 in November. The measure is based on existing homes, not newly built homes, as was the Government report.
The December reading of 108.2 meant that a family earning the national median income of $33,600 had 108.2 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 80 percent of a home priced at $92,500.
The association said the affordability index rose because interest rates fell, as did national median home prices, while median family incomes rose.
It said the median price of an existing home fell to $92,500 in December from $93,200 in November, while average mortgage rates were down to 9.96 percent, from 10.12 percent in November.
Median family incomes increased to $33,600 in December from $33,483 in November, the asociation said. And the average monthly payment for principal and interest on a mortgage fell in December to $647 from $661 in November, according to the association.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Increase 2.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Prices that farmers get for raw products rose 2.7 percent from December to January, leaving the monthly average 2.7 percent above the level a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.
Higher prices for tomatoes, lettuce and broilers were mostly responsible for the increase from December, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
''Tomato prices more than doubled due to short supplies brought on by the freeze in Florida in December,'' the report said. ''Lettuce prices were nearly double for the same reason.'' 
Commercial vegetables as a group were up 68 percent from December and 32 percent from a year ago.
 
Some Declines Posted
Lower prices were reported for soybeans, strawberries and oranges.
Milk prices at the farm, which had risen to record levels late last year, were unchanged in January. Economists at the department have forecast that milk prices would level off this year.
Prices paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 1.1 percent from October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9 percent above a year ago, the report said. The ''prices paid'' index is revised every three months.
The report said prices farmers paid for feeder cattle and calves, feeder pigs, diesel fuel and liquid propane gas were up from October.
Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with about $53 billion in 1989.
 
Income and Expenses
Net cash income is the money that farmers nationally have left from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash expenses. It includes Government payments and proceeds from crops grown previously but sold during the year.
Another method, taking into account changes in inventories, depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year, shows that 1990 net farm income may be in the range of $44 billion to $49 billion, compared with $48 billion last year.
Consumer food prices are estimated by department economists to have risen about 5.7 percent last year, the sharpest rise since 1981. They project that food prices will rise 3 to 5 percent in 1990.
 
Livestock and Poultry Data
Based on the preliminary figures, the January price index for livestock and poultry was unchanged from December but averaged 7.6 percent more than a year ago.
Crop prices over all rose 6.3 percent from December but averaged 4.3 percent below a year ago. The rise in the price of vegetables caused most of the increase from December, the report said.
The fruit index dropped 9.3 percent from December and was 9.8 percent below a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Move Up Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher for the second straight session yesterday, as bargain-hunters bought securities that had been battered over the last six weeks. Gains of as much as a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, were recorded.
Buying was helped by speculation that President Bush would announce additional cuts in American military personnel in Europe - which he did in his State of the Union address last night - and by economic reports during the day that were weaker than anticipated.
Yesterday afternoon the Treasury also announced the size of next week's refunding auctions. It said it would sell a total of $30 billion worth of securities, with auctions of $10 billion each of new 3-year notes on Tuesday, new 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday. 
 
Signs of Weak Conditions
Some market participants said yesterday that reports that sales of new homes fell by more than 9 percent in December and a survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area showed that economic conditions remain weak. A weak economy, they reasoned, would discourage the Federal Reserve from tightening credit by raising interest rates. It might even lower rates to spur the economy, thus making current rates relatively attractive.
The Chicago report, which precedes by one day the issuance of the results of a closely watched monthly survey of purchasing managers across the country, suggested that activity in the manufacturing sector declined in January from December.
''The economy is distinctly weak, but that does not mean it is recessionary,'' said William Melton, a vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis.
Mr. Melton said he is currently estimating the economy will grow by an inflation-adjusted rate of 1 percent in the first quarter, but that growth will be almost flat in the second quarter.
''We have revised the second-quarter number down as interest rates have barreled up,'' he said.
In contrast, a report that showed an unexpectedly large eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Government's index of leading economic indicators was largely ignored.
''When the leading indicator number was revised about a year ago it lost most of the vestigal characteristics that made it an accurate predictor of where the economy is going,'' Mr. Melton said. ''We tell our guys to ignore it.''
The bulk of the session's price gains were recorded by longer-term note and bond issues.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 96 18/32, up a full point from Tuesday, to yield 8.44 percent, compared with 8.54 percent Tuesday.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 15/32, up 5/8 of a point, to yield 8.40 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 97 5/8, up 9/32, to yield 8.32 percent.
Treasury bill rates eased slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.72 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates dipped by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.68 percent.
 
Skeptical on Momentum
Despite the rally, with the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions less than a week away, some market participants said they were skeptical that the firmer tone would be maintained.
''The Street tends to hurt itself when it rallies into supply, but then again this isn't much of a rally,'' said David Green, manager of Government bond trading at Chemical Bank. ''I would be surprised if the market didn't try to sell off as we get closer to the refunding.''
The size of the Treasury's next auction was in line with traders' expectations. In when-issued trading after the announcement, the 3-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.28 percent; the 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.36 percent, and the 30-year bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.40 percent.
A sharp rise in stock prices helped to push up prices of RJR Nabisco securities for the second straight session in the high-yield market for ''junk bonds.'' For example, the company's convertible bonds of 2003 rose by 4 3/4 points, to 73 1/4.
The run-up in Treasury securities spilled over into the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipqal bonds. Corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues rose by anywhere from 5/8 of a point to 3/4 of a point.
Meanwhile, actively traded municipal bond issues were higher by between 3/8 and 3/4 point.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Decline Sharply On Report of Plan for I.M.F.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices tumbled yesterday after word leaked out that the United States had asked the International Monetary Fund to consider using its gold holdings to wipe out past-due loans to some member countries.
Yesterday evening, a Treasury official confirmed the reports, saying such a step could help the I.M.F. meet expected increases in demands for its resources.
Traders feared that such a plan could lead to the sale of several million ounces of gold on the open market. 
Gold futures settled $5.70 to $6.40 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in February off $5.70 at $412.40 an ounce.
Silver futures followed gold, ending 1.1 cents to 1.7 cents lower, with March at $5.228 an ounce.
The plan calls for the gold holdings subscribed by these countries to be ''mobilized,'' the official said. This could mean sales in the market or sales to other governments.
Fred Demler, a metals analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, ''Even if you use it as collateral, a default could end up being a gold sale.''
Analysts said the gold market's weakness also reflected a strong rally in the stock market and the prospects for steady, rather than lower, interest rates.
On other commodity markets, oil futures were mixed, livestock and meat futures were lower, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
Petroleum futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in quiet trading.
Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., said traders had sold heating oil and gasoline contracts after a report late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute that showed higher-than-expected inventories of those products last week.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 22 cents higher, with March at $22.68 a barrel; heating oil was 0.13 cent to 1.64 cents lower, with February at 58.87 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.02 cents lower to 0.40 cent higher, with February at 61.71 cents a gallon.
Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with much of the selling linked to weaker spot markets and to positioning by cattle traders ahead of the semiannual Agriculture Department cattle inventory report due tomorrow.
The report is expected to show a continued modest growth in the nation's cattle herd.
Live cattle futures settled 0.30 cent to 1.05 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in February at 79.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.20 cent to 0.75 cent lower, with March at 82.52 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.10 cent to 0.72 cent lower, with February at 48.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.12 cent to 0.45 cent lower, with February at 50.45 cents a pound.
Grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans up, corn down and wheat nearly unchanged.
Wheat settled 1/2 cent lower to 1/4 cent higher, with March at $3.75 3/4 a bushel; corn futures were 1/4 cent to 1 3/4 cents lower, with March at $2.38 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents to 2 1/4 cents lower, with March at $1.35 1/4 a bushel; soybeans were 1/4 cent lower to 2 1/2 cents higher, with March at $5.61 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Down; Jump in Indicators Ignored

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most major currencies in thin trading yesterday after the markets discounted a report that Mikhail S. Gorbachev would resign as chairman of the Soviet Communist Party.
In New York, currency traders said there was little reaction to the Commerce Department's release yesterday morning of the index of leading indicators for December. The figure, regarded as the Government's main economic forecasting gauge, jumped a strong eight-tenths of 1 percent, indicating that the economy might avoid a recession this year.
Walter Simon, a vice president in the New York office of Bank Julius Baer & Company, said traders expected the robust figure. He said the dollar traded in a narrow range most of the day.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.40 Japanese yen, up from 143.25 on Tuesday. In London late Wednesday the dollar closed higher at 144.45 yen. In New York it closed at 144.45 yen, down from 144.65 yen late Tuesday.
 
Pound Climbs
In London, the pound rose to $1.6870 late yesterday from $1.6830 late Tuesday. Later, in New York, it sold for $1.6792, up from $1.6725 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday rates, were: 1.6848 West German marks, down from 1.6990; 1.5010 Swiss francs, up from 1.5005; 5.7250 French francs, down from 5.7600; 1,251.75 Italian lire, down from 1,260.50, and 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1865.
Other dollar late rates in Europe, compared with those on Tuesday, were: 1.6800 marks, down from 1.6805; 1.5025 Swiss francs, up from 1.4890; 5.7275 French francs, up from 5.7040; 1.8950 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8880; 1,252.75 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50, and 1.1856 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1902.

HEADLINE: Hollinger Stake In Paper Chain

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The chief executive of Hollinger Inc. said Tuesday that the Canadian newspaper chain wanted to continue raising its stake in United Newspapers P.L.C. but was not planning a hostile takeover bid for the giant British publisher.
 
The chief executive, David
Radler, said, ''We're not launching a hostile bid for United.'' But he added, ''That doesn't mean we couldn't buy United, depending on market and economic conditions.''
Mr. Radler said the Toronto-based Hollinger, whose flagship paper is The London Telegraph, is the largest shareholder in United Newspapers, with about 9 percent of the stock. United publishes The London Express. Hollinger started buying stock in the British company a year ago.
Hollinger, which owns 242 papers with a combined daily circulation of nearly 1.9 million, has $170 million in cash and is interested in making further newspaper acquisitions, especially in Western Europe and the United States, Mr. Radler said.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
Transcript of Bush's State of the Union Message to the Nation

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of President Bush's State of the Union Message to a joint session of Congress last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
Thank you very much. Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress, I return as a former President of the Senate and a former member of this great House. And now, as President, it is my privilege to report to you on the State of the Union.
Tonight, I come not to speak about the ''State of the Government,'' not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the challenges we face. And what that means for America.
There are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of progress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world. 
 
The Revolution of '89
Nineteen forty-five provided the common frame of reference, the compass points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And that was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.
Think back, think back just 12 short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began.
One year, one year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb of a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.
''Operation Just Cause'' has achieved its objective. And the number of military personnel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began. And tonight I am announcing that well before the end of February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.
A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to open a dialogue with the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish Government.
And a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia.
And one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide. And he predicted the Berlin wall would last another hundred years. And today, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.
Remarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals of American policy, a policy based on a single shining principle: the cause of freedom.
America, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of people everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.
Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation, this idea called America, was and always will be a new world, our new world.
At a worker's rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words, words of a distant revolution:
''We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
It's no secret that here at home freedom's door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship, and, of course, leadership.
 
The Challenge for America
And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system second to none, and make it better:
A better America where there's a job for everyone who wants one, Where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child care alternatives for parents, Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy, Where ''Made in the U.S.A.'' is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress, And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens, Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity, Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and where all of them make the grade, Where, where every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free, And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts.
That's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our horizon, commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts today.
In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make some fundamental changes, some crucial investment in ourselves.
Yes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical capital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And, of course, our human capital: the talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.
And let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity, the spirit that is the hallmark of the American worker, that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.
 
A Family Savings Plan
We need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea behind a new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to Congress tomorrow.
We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers, especially those in our small businesses, to take those steps that translate into economic reward, jobs and a better life for all of us.
We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment is there. The money is there. It's there for research and development, R and D, a record high. It's there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E, to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space exploration, and it's there for education, another record high.
And one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an extra half a billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head Start.
Education is the one investment that means more for our future, because it means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from the nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor Campbell, all of whom were a very key in these discussions, these deliberations, are with us here tonight.
 
Education Goals for Year 2000
By the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth and 12th grades, we must assess our students' performance.
By the, by the year 2000, U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And every school in America must be drug-free.
Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education.
These investments will keep America competitive. And I know this about the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our energy, our experience and technology, our spirit and enterprise against anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America is ready.
Since we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet that challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of G.N.P.
 
Balancing the Budget by 1993
That budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the Gramm-Rudman target. It brings that deficit down further. And balances the budget by 1993, with no new taxes.
And let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.
And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and our grandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national debt.
And there's something more, and there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance.
 
Commitment on Environment
As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red tape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.
This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new initiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.
And something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for generations to come, the money too plant a billion trees a year.
And tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit of cooperation, I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do the will of the people - clean air, child care, the educational excellence act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act together.
 
Pledge on Social Security
And there's one thing I hope we will be able to agree on. It's about our commitments. And I'm talking about Social Security. To every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they retire. we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.
We, we rescued the system in 1983, and it's sound again, bipartisan arrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits, and it assures that future benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.
 
New Look at Health Care
There's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control.
 
Living Up to Our Ideals
The State of the Government, the State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single one of us.
The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the problems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we learned as children. And that's how we sustain the State of the Union. Every effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.
And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound and strong.
 
Letter From a Medic in Panama
And to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic of the First Battalion, 75th Rangers. It's dated Dec. 18, the night before our armed forces went into action in Panama. It's a letter servicemen write -and hope will never, never be sent. And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it along to me out there in Cincinnati. And here is some of what he wrote: ''I've never been afraid of death, but I know he is waiting at the corner. . . . I've been trained to kill and to save, so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and yet . . . do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give you. . . . But most of all, don't forget the Army was my choice. Something that I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and insure that you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely.''
Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama, and one of the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He carried the idea we call America in his heart.
 
Leadership for the Future
I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a need for leadership that only America can provide.
Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come. He said, ''As our world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the Communist world.'' Today, that change is taking place. For more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and insured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism crumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and growing commonwealth of free nations.
And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see.
Here in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas, North and South, to live in freedom.
In the Far East and Africa it's time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served as the engine of progress.
It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole and free.
It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity.
We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization. And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the strategic defense initiative.
But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with leaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just today.
And I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.
 
Cut in U.S. Forces in Europe
But our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.
This number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior military advisers. It's designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control talks - conventional, chemical and strategic - must now be our goal. And that time has come.
Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world tonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough, and sure enough, to defend our interests and our ideals. It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire this Revolution of '89.
And here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient symbol of hope.
 
Freedom, Faith and Family
The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.
In the last few days of this past momentous year, our family was blessed once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.
And now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a grandfather talking.
Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding young environmentalists I met this month, who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland, ready to go to, go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill or alone - and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and AIDS - and coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of dreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very future of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.
And so tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me start with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our living link to the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to tell.
And parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious legacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is helping others.
And to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the destiny that is yours and yours alone.
And finally, let all Americans, all of us together here in this chamber, the symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends on each and every one of us.
God bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United States of America.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
Excerpts From Foley Address on the Reaction of Democrats

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of a speech by Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House, last night on the State of the Union, as recorded by The New York Times:
Good evening. I'm Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House. Earlier tonight, you may have seen me sitting behind President Bush as he delivered his address.
In the 1990's, and well into the next century, the central challenge for America will be economic, not military. The greatest test of our strength will be our classrooms, not our missile silos. The gravest threat will come not from any nation's attempt at world domination, but from every nation's complicity in the worldwide destruction of the environment. 
This period of vast change will be a period of fundamental choice. Much of what the President said tonight I agree with. Some of what he said, I disagree with.
But my purpose here is not to debate point by point. I'm here to tell you what we as Democrats believe, where we stand, the values we hold, the vision we have and the choices we believe in. ...
As Democrats, we're not satisfied with a trend that has seen this nation drop from first to sixth in the standard of living. We're not satisified to be told that within 10 years the average West German worker may earn 150 percent as much as the average American worker. We're not satisfied to have American students rank near the bottom of the industrial nations in math and science.
We will set a national goal of making our schools once again the best in the world by the year 2000. On this issue the President's words seem to agree with us, but his actions say something else. You can't become the education President, with all the problems we face by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the education budget. That's a fact. And for all the talk, that's exactly what the President proposes to do.
We also believe that American corporations have the responsibility and should have the opportunity to re-invest in America. We believe that the wave of corporate mergers and leveraged buy-outs is a waste of resources. It leaves Wall Street raiders with large sums of money in their pockets, and it leaves our companies overburdened with debt and weakened in competing for world markets.
This issue represents another real difference between us and the Republicans. For too many years their policies have encouraged debt and quick profit instead of investment and long-term growth. The result: the amount of private resources put into research and development has fallen in real dollars.
It's imperative to reverse this trend and to secure America's place on the frontiers of enterprise and invention.
At the same time, we must demand that nations trading with us give our products an equal chance in their markets. . . .
Make no mistake about it. We favor expanding trade, but we reject the idea of one-way free trade. We believe this nation should be in the business of exporting the goods our workers make, not the jobs our workers need.
 
Encouraging Savings
We also believe in encouraging a rise in savings, which have collapsed to a record low during the 1980's. The Republicans say they want to do this, in part, by cutting the capital gains tax, a cut which would give 80 percent of the benefits to the richest 1 percent of Americans. Instead, we are fighting to restore I.R.A.'s - so middle-income families can save as much as $2,000 a year tax-free. . . . .
We took on the struggle against capital gains when the odds were against us. We won last year, and this year we will do all we can to make sure that the greatest part of any tax cut, of any kind, goes to those of you who live on a paycheck, not just the few who have the highest incomes.. . .
This issue goes to the heart of the reason we are Democrats: above all else, we stand with you, the people who go to work and pay the taxes. It is your cause to which we are committed and your side on which we fight.
So we will also fight for the most effective clean air bill, even though that may offend entrenched and powerful interests.
We will fight for child care, so that working parents don't have to choose between their family's standard of living and their children's standard of care. ...
And there is another issue on which we have only just begun to fight: this Administration's practice of misusing the Social Security trust fund to hide the size of the Federal budget deficit.
 
No Privatizing Social Security
Social Security involves more than a trust fund; it involves the basic bond of trust between our people and our Government. From the beginning, Social Security has been the Democratic Party's proudest achievement. We reject the suggestion of some Republicans to privatize the system. . . .
Finally, as Democrats, we believe that there are areas where the Government simply does not belong. We will continue to defend a woman's right to choose - for we are convinced that politicians cannot and should not attempt to make the choice. ...
The reason we have so many homeless in America today is not because government has cared too much, but because it has cared too little. We have to do better than that - on a whole range of critical needs.
We will seek to secure the right of all our children to learn in better schools and to earn a better life.
We will seek to secure the civil rights of all our people. We can't celebrate freedom abroad and then deny freedom at home.
We are also committed to the strongest possible attack on the drugs that are attacking our society and our families. On this we are all united. Narcotics destroy the children of Democrats and Republicans alike.
Let me say it again. We will work with the President wherever and whenever we can. On some issues, we will have differences because we care deeply about certain principles and about the people who have been the abiding concern of the Democratic Party. Today, we Democrats stand, as we have before, for working families. We stand for both economic justice and economic opportunity. For protecting the environment. For senior citizens and the soundness of Social Security.
And where we must, we will disagree with this Administration. We will stand our ground when that is the only way we can stand for you.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
EAST BERLIN CHIEF PRESENTS HIS PLAN TO UNITE GERMANY

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Prime Minister Hans Modrow today presented for the first time an East German program for the reunification of Germany, which he said should be neutral.
The plan, which the Prime Minister put forward as his personal concept, followed his meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during which the Soviet leader for the first time appeared to give his cautious blessing to discussion of reunification.
Mr. Modrow's concept foresaw the process of reunification as advancing in slow stages, during which both German nations would cease to be members of military pacts and become neutral.
 
Kohl Rejects Terms
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany quickly rejected Mr. Modrow's proposal for a neutral German state, saying a reunited Germany could not afford to be isolated in the center of Europe. 
The plan also runs counter to Washington's stand, which specifies that in exercising their right of self-determination, Germans remain firmly tied to the West through membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d presented that view when he visited here in December. Chancellor Kohl emphasized West Germany's continuing links to the West in presenting a 10-point reunification proposal last year.
 
Discussion After Elections
In dismissing Mr. Modrow's vision and agenda, Mr. Kohl declared at a news conference in Bonn today that he would discuss reunification only with the East German government that is to be selected in March elections and that military neutrality was inappropriate.
''Such a proposal contradicts the logic of the pan-European process of unification,'' he said, adding that a single Germany at the core of the Continent could not afford to be isolated.
On Wednesday, West Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, had similarly insisted that a reunited Germany should remain a NATO member. But he suggested that the alliance's military structure would be limited to only that territory that constitutes the present West Germany. Mr. Genscher is scheduled to fly to Washington on Friday for talks with Secretary of State Baker.
Mr. Modrow's vision implicitly rejected such ideas.
In announcing his concept at a news conference, he said: ''In logic and sense, the process of German reunification is closely linked with the construction of the all-European house and European confederation. In this all-European house there must be no place for a policy of force.''
Alluding to the image of a common European house that had first been projected last year by Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Modrow said: ''It must be founded on the idea that already in the stage of confederation, both German states will step by step detach themselves from their obligations of alliance toward third countries and attain a state of military neutrality. The border between the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic will then have ceased to be the dividing line of the two military groupings, with all the consequences that derive from this.''
Mr. Modrow specified four stages leading to reunification and stressed that he was offering his concept for discussion without any timetable.
In the first stage, a treaty of cooperation and good neighborliness would be concluded, with provisions for the melding of the economies, currencies, transport, and judicial systems of both Germanys.
The second phase of the plan would be the establishment of a confederation with common institutions, such as a joint parliamentary committee and joint executive organs in specified areas.
 
The Last Two Stages
The next step in the Modrow concept would be the transfer of some sovereign rights of the two republics to institutions of the confederation.
Mr. Modrow described the final stage as ''formation of a unified German state in the form of a German Federation or German Union through elections in both parts of the confederation, the convening of a unified Parliament, which will decide on a unified constitution and unified government with its seat in Berlin.''
Mr. Modrow presented his proposal under the motto ''For Germany, united fatherland.'' That is a line from the national anthem. Until the overthrow of the old regime last October, this line was the reason why the anthem could only be played or hummed rather than sung. Under the former leaders, Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, it was the official line that the division into two states had become permanent and reunification was ruled out.
The Prime Minister set several conditions that he said would have to be fulfilled on the way to unity. They specified that both states must maintain their respective obligations to other countries or blocs without any interference by either in the affairs of the other.
This was a clear reference to the ever-increasing political activities of West German parties in the present struggle in East Germany leading up to this country's first free elections March 18. The other putative parties in East Germany have not yet formally stated their views on reunification.
Another condition set by the Prime Minister was ''maintenance of the interests and rights'' of the four major victor powers of World War II, which have residual rights in both Germanys. They are the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
''The four powers should declare their intention to settle finally all questions arising from World War II and the postwar period after the formation of a unified German state, including the presence of foreign troops on German soil and membership in military alliances,'' Mr. Modrow declared.
He said military neutrality of both nations as federation approached was another condition.
Replying to questions, he said that although his concept was in keeping with Mr. Gorbachev's ideas expressed during his Moscow visit and had been discussed with the Soviet leader, he had not put it to him for approval.
 
Public Pressure Growing
A Western diplomat said it was likely that the Prime Minister had told Mr. Gorbachev that growing public pressure in East Germany for reunification made necessary a statement that put his Government on record as favoring it, but only on the conditions that would preclude NATO's gaining a vital military asset.
The Soviet Union bases more than 350,000 troops in East Germany. Even under partial Soviet withdrawals, which began last year, NATO specialists are reported to foresee that that figure will not significantly decrease by the end of this year.
Mr. Modrow stressed that unity should be achieved only under conditions that would still all possible fears among Germany's neighbors.
''Germany shall again become a united fatherland for all citizens of the German nation,'' he said. ''So that never again danger for the lives and property of its neighbors shall emanate from it, a sense of responsibility, prudence and comprehension for what is feasible and what is bearable for Europe are required.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Bush's Quandary on Forces in Europe

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Bush Administration insisted today that it will maintain American troop strength in Europe at 225,000, the new level proposed by President Bush in his State of the Union address Wednesday night. But the pace of political change at home and abroad seems likely to make that position untenable in short order.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning that even if all Soviet forces left Europe, 225,000 Americans would be needed there, 195,000 of them in central Europe, which means primarily West Germany. Caution is needed, he said, because ''the Soviet Union remains the only nation on earth capable of destroying the United States.''
Administration officials conceded that they had a tough case to sell. But for the moment at least, they said, the President feels that he must mollify the allies and keep the North Atlantic Treaty Organization healthy, with West Germany firmly linked through NATO to the West at a time when East Germany's leaders are talking of a unified Germany linked neither to East nor West. 
 
A Key Qualification
Partly at the insistence of the British and French and partly because of his own concerns, senior officials of several countries reported, Mr. Bush tucked into his speech this key qualification, ''I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential, and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.''
What then should it be tied to? How should it be justified, when its whole purpose has been to deter or contain a ground attack by the Soviets and their erstwhile allies, which almost everyone now considers improbable? What do ground forces have to do with the nuclear threat to which Mr. Cheney alluded?
James R. Schlesinger, a Democrat who was Defense Secretary in the Ford Administration, called even before President Bush's speech for elimination of all but a ''residual'' American force of perhaps 50,000 troops in Europe. Abandoning his longstanding commitment to a large-scale American deployment in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent, he said that ''the rationale for our European deployments is up for review and debate'' because the Warsaw Pact's ''role as a military alliance and a military threat has been largely broken.''
 
Negotiating Leverage
''American deployments,'' Mr. Schlesinger told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ''have been justified as a symbol of American commitment and, since the 70's, as a part of a stalwart conventional capability intended to help deter Soviet or Warsaw Pact attack. That role for the American forces has now been superseded. The new and substantially reduced role for those forces is to provide negotiating leverage.''
In fact, that leverage may not be very important, at least in getting Soviet troops out of central Europe. The central Europeans are already clamoring for them to go home, and Mr. Cheney conceded that the Soviet Union was likely to comply with that request by 1995.
While Mr. Cheney said that even that would not persuade the Administration to budge from its 225,000 figure, a senior Administration official was considerably less firm at a briefing on Wednesday. He said that 225,000 would stand ''for the foreseeable future,'' but conceded that he didn't know how long that would be.
 
Prospect of Greater Cuts
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged Mr. Cheney at a committee hearing not to exclude the prospect of greater troop cuts if Moscow withdraws all of its forces from Eastern Europe and the two Germanys are reunified. After being pressed by Senator Nunn, Mr. Cheney said he would be willing to ''take another look'' at the Administration's troop-cut plans if such dramatic changes occurred. But his response appeared to be intended to avoid the appearance of inflexibility. In addition to the strategic arguments, Mr. Cheney said the United States needed a sizable military presence in Europe to maintain American political ties with Western Europe.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who appeared with Mr. Cheney at the committee hearing, also argued that a force of 195,000 American troops in central Europe was the minimum to carry out NATO's plans to defend itself against attack.
Pentagon officials said the figure of 195,000 troops represents the smallest-size force that the military thinks it could keep in Europe and still be able to fight a defensive war of limited duration if there were an attack on NATO. They said they considered, but rejected, the idea of having a smaller force to use as a kind of ''trip wire'' that could blunt the first wave of an attack but would have to rely on immediate reinforcements.
Senator Nunn said in an interview today that ''we need to be thinking right now about how far down we want to go in troop strength in Europe, and what we want our troops there to do.'' If progress is made toward German reunification, if the conventional arms talks in Vienna are concluded later this year, and if the East Germans and the Czechs ''throw the bums out,'' Mr. Nunn said, ''then we face a complete rebuilding of the policy we've been following since 1945.''
''It could all be happening by this time next year,'' he added.
 
France and Britain Insistent
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and, to a lesser degree, President Francois Mitterrand of France have repeatedly expressed concern about too-rapid shrinkage of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, not least because of their belief that the best chance of taming a reunited Germany would be to keep it within NATO. Diplomats reported that France and Britain had insisted on setting a floor at 225,000 troops as a condition of their support.
''Forget about any guarantees Bush gave the allies,'' said Daniel Hamilton of the Carnegie Endowment, a leading German specialist. ''He will be under fierce pressure in a matter of months to go farther, at least to 100,000, maybe to 75,000. The real agenda these days is being set by the people in the streets of Eastern Europe, not by the politicians in Washington and Moscow.''
In part, the allies and the Pentagon are concerned about what might happen in central Europe if Mikhail S. Gorbachev were to lose control of events in the Soviet Union, or if economic reform produced extreme social discontent in Poland or Rumania. A British minister said recently that he thought the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's remaining in office a year from now were only 60-40.
In part, they are fearful that the fast pace of change could produce the ''unraveling'' of NATO, weakening Atlantic unity. Some European members of the alliance, including Belgium and the Netherlands, have discussed pulling some of their troops out of Germany.
Those harboring such fears think rapid troop reductions in Europe now would be a mistake. Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, is one such person, and he argued today that ''this is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in strategy.''
Largely unspoken, but at least as important in allied calculations, is the belief that if the United States pulls most of its forces out of Europe, it will revert to its historic isolationist tendencies, at least insofar as abandoning any pretense of guaranteeing the security of Western Europe.
 
A Question of Influence
Likewise, there lurks beneath the surface of American policy the notion that any further pullback would rob the United States of whatever influence it is likely to have in the shaping of the new Germany. Further cuts ''would cost us our place at the table, wherever and whenever the table is set for the big decisions,'' a senior United States policy maker commented bluntly.
The logic of German reunification, or at least federation, which Mr. Bush has repeatedly said he welcomes, works against the maintenance of significant foreign NATO forces in West Germany or of Soviet forces in East Germany. A unified or federated state could hardly exist with rival armies camped within it, and some animosity to American forces has begun to develop in West Germany as the threat from Moscow has seemed to diminish to the vanishing point.
In addition, the logic of the Soviet position works against the maintenance of large forces abroad. Having permitted its former client states to adopt multiparty systems, having in essence blessed an anti-Soviet revolution, there is little justification for forcing Russian troops on those same states.
Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said that ''events in Europe'' ran ahead of diplomatic discussions and that Mr. Bush's insistence ''that he needs American troops in Europe from here to eternity'' was ''not a good sign.'' The 225,000 figure ''must be the ceiling, not the floor,'' the Soviet official said.

HEADLINE: LEGISLATION EASES LIMITS ON ALIENS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In yet another sign of diminishing world tensions, the Senate this week gave final Congressional approval to repealing a provision of a McCarthy-era law that bars foreigners from visiting the United States because of their political beliefs.
The restriction has been anathema to civil liberterians and others for decades, but only in recent years have they gathered enough support in Congress to kill it.
The law, the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, was passed in 1952 over the veto of President Harry S. Truman. In that period 38 years ago, conservatives said it was needed to protect American citizens from subversive ideas, mainly communism. 
Over the years, the law has been used to deny entry to such acclaimed figures as the writers Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Graham Greene, the actor Yves Montand, the naturalist Farley Mowat, and Ian Smith, the former Prime Minister of Rhodesia.
 
'Fearful, Muddled, Intimidated'
''For a generation and more these miserable provisions made the United States present itself to other nations as a nation of fearful, muddled, intimidated citizens,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who sponsored the repeal legislation. ''We were not that; we are not that, and now at last our statutes accord with the facts.''
The measure was passed 98 to 0 by the Senate on Tuesday, as an amendment to a State Department spending bill. It was approved by the House in November and President Bush is expected to sign it, Republican Senate aides said.
Legislation temporarily repealing the restrictions was passed in 1987 and again in 1988. The State Department objected, warning that repeal could have ''potentially serious adverse consequences'' for the conduct of foreign policy.
But this time the State Department has raised no objections to permanent repeal of the section of the McCarran-Walter Act that excludes aliens for ideological reasons.
 
Only Short Visits Affected
The Senate action was praised by civil libertarians and advocates of immigration law revisions, but other people contended the legislation does not go far enough.
The measure covers only aliens seeking to enter the United States for short visits. Those seeking permanent status can still be barred because of their beliefs or memberships.
Over the years thousands of foreigners have been barred by the provision in the McCarran-Walter Act. In 1984, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that it blocked 8,000 people from 98 countries because of their beliefs or political affiliations.
Among those who have been denied entry are Hortensia Allende, widow Salvador Allende Gossens, the former President of Chile; Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization; Dario Fo, the Italian satirist and playwright, and Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada, whose attendance at an economic conference in Moscow in 1952 prompted immigration officials to brand him as a Communist sympathizer. Mr. Trudeau's name was struck from the list after immigration officials interviewed him in Montreal in 1954. He wasCanadian Prime Minister from 1968 to 1979, and 1980 to 1984.
''Pierre Trudeau!'' said a theatrically incredulous Mr. Moynihan in a telephone interview. ''Graham Greene! There is not a college in this country that does not assign his book.'' Among the British author's books is ''The Quiet American,'' which was set in South Vietnam.
 
Terrorist Exception
Mr. Moynihan's legislation still allows the Secretary of State to deny entry an alien who is identified as a terrorist or is seen as likely to engage in terrorist activity. Under this section, someone like Mr. Arafat can still be barred.
Another portion of the act, dealing with resident aliens, is under legal attack.
In Dec. 1988, a Federal District Court judge in Los Angeles barred the immigration service from deporting seven Jordanians and one Kenyan. The Government had charged them with being members of a group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which had claimed responsibility for airline hijackings and other terrorist acts.
In preventing the deportations Judge Stephen V. Wilson declared the language of four the sections the act ''unconstitutional on its face'' as a restriction on the right of free speech.
The ruling applied only to the Central District of California and has been appealed by the Government.
 
Little Change Expected
A State Department spokesman said the legislation would not markedly change policy. A 1977 measure sponsored by George McGovern, the former Senator from South Dakota, required that people denied entry based on their beliefs be granted waivers unless it could be shown that they posed a threat to national security. Since then, most people initially turned away have been admitted, officials said.
''It's no longer a practical fact that people are kept out of the United States for their ideological beliefs,'' said the spokesman, Philip Covington.
The McCarran-Walter Act sets up 33 categories for excluding visitors and those seeking to become residents. They range from espionage and drug trafficking to believing in polygamy and practicing ''deviant sexual behavior.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: U. S. POLICY;
Economic Effect of Cutting Troops in Europe Assessed

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Troop reductions of the type proposed by President Bush would temporarily disrupt the local economy in parts of West Germany, but would have negligible effects on the civilian economy of the United States, experts said today.
The effects in the Soviet Union would depend on how military manpower and resources are redeployed, the experts said.
John P. Hardt, associate director of the Congressional Research Service, said the demobilization of Soviet troops could benefit the Soviet economy ''if military resources - manpower and factory capacity - are effectively redeployed to produce food, consumer goods and housing, and to improve the delivery of food from farm to market.''
But the ex-servicemen could also cause short-term economic problems for the Kremlin if jobs and housing are not available for them, experts said. 
 
Impact on Parts of Germany
In parts of Germany, including the Frankfurt area and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, tens of thousands of people depend for their livelihoods on the presence of United States military units, which buy some of their supplies in Germany. In addition, service personnel buy large amounts of local beer, clothing and appliances.
If American troops begin to leave Europe, some regions of West Germany would feel the loss, but the national economy is so strong that it would not be damaged to any significant degree, experts said. Clarence Hill, an economist for Deutsche Bank in New York, said the withdrawal of 60,000 to 80,000 American servicemen would probably occur gradually and would have ''a negligible depressing effect'' on West Germany's trillion-dollar economy.
In economic terms, he said, the exodus of American troops would be more than offset by the influx of East Germans and of ethnic Germans from Poland and the Soviet Union. The newcomers arrive in West Germany with few possessions and need to buy many consumer goods, alhtough they have significantly less money with which to make those purchases. In the last year, according to the West German Embassy here, 343,850 East Germans and 377,000 ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe settled in West Germany, and Bonn expects similar numbers this year. #80,000 Troops Could Go In his State of the Union address on Wednesday, Mr. Bush proposed sharp new reductions in the numbers of Soviet and American troops in Europe. American troops, which now total 305,000, would be cut by 80,000, to 225,000. Most of the American troop reductions would come in West Germany. Soviet troops, which now total about 565,000, would be reduced to the same level.
American officials say they hope that Soviet and American troops withdrawn from Europe would be demobilized and released from the armed services.
Stephen M. Meyer, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said today that the demobilization of more than 300,000 Soviet troops would, in the short term, have a ''negative impact on the economy of the Soviet Union.''
There would be ''tens of thousands of troops with no place to live, no place to work, no accommodations of any kind,'' Professor Meyer said. ''To release them from the army right away would create social and economic problems.''
In the long run, he said, such troop reductions could save money for Moscow, because the Soviet armed forces would presumably buy fewer weapons and supplies and would have lower operating costs. Soviet officials could minimize the economic problems by keeping soldiers in garrisons for a while after they return to the Soviet Union, said Profssor Meyer, a consultant to American military and intelligence agencies.
 
'Destabilizing Factor' Possible
Mr. Hardt, an expert on the Soviet economy, said that if substantial numbers of Soviet military officers are demobilized, they would lose housing privileges and access to special military stores and might become dissastified. They could then be a ''destabilizing factor'' in Soviet politics, he said.
In any event, he said, money saved in the Soviet military budget would have to be used to build housing and to train army veterans for civilian jobs. ''The peace dividend would be small,'' he said.
In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Pentagon would eventually save $7 billion to $8 billion a year if it demobilized 80,000 troops, as Mr. Bush proposed.
For more than a decade, the United States has had a volunteer army, and in recent years, the vast majority of army recruits have been high school graduates. Economists said that most of those recruits could probably get civilian jobs.
With a labor force of more than 125 million, the United States could absorb 80,000 people released from military service without much difficulty, economists say. Their ''effect on the overall economy would be fairly minor,'' said James P. Markey, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
Jobs for Ex-Servicemen
Sar A. Levitan, a labor economist who serves as director of the Center for Social Policy Studies at George Washington University, said that servicemen might have some difficulty in finding civilian jobs in certain parts of the country with higher unemployment rates, like West Virginia. If the national economy weakens and companies lay off workers, that could make it more difficult for veterans to find jobs, he said.
Others researchers said the American economy was stronger now than when the United States curtailed military spending in the later years of the Vietnam War, from 1968 to 1975. As military spending slows, they said, many companies can be expected to diversify their work and emphasize commercial activities so that the adverse effect, if any, on the gross national product would be temporary.
West Germany benefits financially from the stationing of American troops on its territory, economists say. There are more than 225,000 G.I.'s with perhaps 75,000 dependents in West Germany.
A recent study by the Institute for the German Economy, an industry-supported research center in Cologne, estimated that the American troops generated $5.6 billion a year in economic benefits for West Germany. That includes, among other things, $1.8 billion in goods and services purchased by the military, $903 million in goods and services bought by individual servicemen, $590 million worth of construction and $353 million in rent paid for houses and apartments.
Thomas Vajna, an economist at the institute, said that costs to West Germany resulting from the presence of American troops totaled $1.4 billion a year. That figure includes damage to property resulting from military maneuvers. The net effect, he said, is $4.2 billion worth of benefits for the West German economy.
Robert Gerald Livingston, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the departure of American troops could ''cause dislocations in some of the poorer parts of West Germany.'' In such areas, he said, unemployment has been rising, partly because of the influx of East Germans and ethnic Germans, and some people who lose jobs at American military installations might have difficulty finding work.
On the other hand, he said, the departure of American troops would make housing available for Germans at a time when there is a shortage of low-cost housing.

HEADLINE: BUSH SEEKS A RISE IN AID TO SALVADOR

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Bush met today with the President of El Salvador, Alfredo Cristiani, and offered him a strong statement of support, hoping it would signal to Congress that the United States should not cut back more on aid to the country.
Although the Administration plans to cut its aid this year to Central America while giving more to Eastern Europe, the State Department today proposed an increase of about $50 million for El Salvador next year.
In fiscal year 1989, El Salvador received $185 million in economic aid from the United States. This year, it is getting $130.6 million. The Administration has asked Congress to increase the total to $180 million in the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1. El Salvador is getting $84.6 million in military aid this year, about the same as the $85 million it received last year. 
 
Cristiani's Reaction
Mr. Cristiani said after the meeting with Mr. Bush that he thought a cut in aid to El Salvador would send ''negative signals, especially to the armed groups,'' as he seeks to build up his country.
But he did note that it ''is not necessarily a cut in Salvadoran aid in itself, but rather a cut across the board for the region,'' adding, ''since we have the highest package in the region, we have the highest cuts in the program.''
At a photo session with Mr. Cristiani in the Rose Garden before their meeting at the White House, Mr. Bush defended the Salvadoran from Congressional criticism over the involvement of military officers in the killing last November of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and the housekeeper's daughter. The President praised Mr. Cristiani for pursuing an investigation that recently resulted in the arrest of a colonel, two lieutenants and five lower-ranking military men.
''I know of his commitment to democracy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The success of democracy in Salvador is a very important thing to us, to this country. And I have been very impressed with the courage he has shown in going after those who have broken the law in his country. And that's been a shining example to all of us.''
 
Walking 'a Very Fine Line'
One Administration official said the message to Congress was that ''Cristiani's walking a very fine line on the investigation and the peace process and right now we have to accept him for what he's doing and not tell him what he should be doing.''
The slayings spurred an international outcry and prompted threats to cut American aid.
Mr. Cristiani said the arrests of the military officers showed that El Salvador was making headway in bringing the military, once immune to prosecution, under the sway of the civilian Government.
But some members of Congress remain dubious about how far the investigation will go in the hands of the criminal justice system in El Salvador.
 
Visit With Democrats
Before going to the White House, Mr. Cristiani tried to mend some fences with Democrats on Capitol Hill, attending a meeting with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley; the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and Representative Joe Moakley, who is the head of a House task force on El Salvador.
The members of Congress described the meeting as friendly and agreed that Mr. Cristiani had helped his cause with the arrest of the officers. But Mr. Moakley warned Mr. Cristiani that he must pay more attention to human rights, noting that ''votes for El Salvador aid have been diminishing over the years.''
The Salvadoran leader was scheduled to meet with members of the American Catholic community on Friday, also in an effort to calm their fears about his ability to press the case of the Jesuit murders.
In the 45-minute White House meeting, one top Administration official said, President Bush again ''congratulated President Cristiani on the way he's proceeding with the investigation and underscored the fact that it must continue forward.''
 
Talks With Leftists Urged
Mr. Bush spoke of a need to continue negotiations with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the leftist guerrillas battling Mr. Cristiani's Government, and said the United States would do whatever it could to help the peace process.
The two leaders also spoke of how their countries could cooperate in the war on drugs by sharing information on selling and trafficking.
After the meeting, Mr. Cristiani told the press that he had asked Mr. Bush for financial aid for a new anti-drug program in El Salvador. ''We think that, although it is not a big problem in El Salvador, I think it's better to stop it when it's not big than to wait until it's very big and then it's harder to get rid of.''
He said he was ''willing to open up a dialogue process'' with the guerrillas with the help of the Secretary General of the United Nations, but could not say exactly when that would happen.

HEADLINE: Budget for the Space Agency Sets a Broader Course in Exploration

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
The proposed 24 percent increase in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget, which would be the biggest increase for any major agency, represents a critical step in expanding the nation's civilian space program, opening the way finally to building an orbiting space station, initiating two ambitious efforts in Earth and planetary exploration, and setting the agenda for space flight well into the next century.
The request, for $15.1 billion in fiscal 1991, an increase of $2.8 billion over the current year's spending, is being presented by space agency and Administration officials as a clear signal of President Bush's intention to put money behind his pledge last July to insure American leadership in space. In a speech on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, he spoke of committing the nation to return astronauts to the Moon and to the eventual exploration of Mars by humans.
The officials pointed to the lyricism of the budget message on the subject of space. Besides noting the payoffs in the development of new materials and technologies, the message said ''no quantitative measure of any kind can capture the benefit of expanding human horizons, human dreams, and the human domain.'' 
Congressional leaders and budget experts said the NASA request undoubtedly would be trimmed, perhaps by a billion dollars or so. But they indicated that, as in recent years, both the House and Senate were probably predisposed to approve much of the space budget. Last year Congress cut almost $1 billion from the $13.3 billion budget request.
''This is a most important budget for us,'' said Richard H. Truly, the NASA administrator, in an interview. ''It's going to set our course, if we're successful, for many years to come and over a wide range of programs.''
 
A Steady Rise in Funds
Actually, the space agency has enjoyed a steady rise in financial support since the Challenger accident in 1986; a large share of the support was used to modify the space shuttles and get them back into service in late 1988.
Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said: ''The new budget is a continuation and acceleration of the post-Challenger trend. We realized we had expectations in space but were not providing NASA with the resources to fulfill them.''
If the budget request does survive more or less intact, much of the additional money will go for the ''critical transition,'' in the words of the President's budget message, from design to construction of the Freedom space station. Space officials say they are committed to a schedule in which the first components of the modular station would be placed in orbit in 1995 and occupied by astronauts as early as 1997.
The request is for $2.45 billion for the space station, an increase of $700 million. The program, endorsed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, has suffered repeated budgetary setbacks and has been scaled down in response to Congressional criticism. Even so, the station is expected to cost about $30 billion by the time it is fully deployed in 1999.
The two new programs provided in the budget request include space platforms as the first elements of the Mission to Planet Earth, an ambitious plan to study Earth and its threatened environment from orbit, and the ''human exploration initiative.'' the response to Mr. Bush's call for a long-term program of exploration by humans of the Moon and Mars.
 
Price Tags for New Programs
The Administration is proposing to spend more than $1 billion next year in studies of global environmental change. Of that, $636 million is to be spent by NASA to begin building two unmanned scientific platforms and other research related to the Earth's environment. The program is known as the Earth Observing System.
For the human exploration program, NASA is proposing to spend $1.3 billion on developing new technology for flights to the Moon and Mars, preliminary studies of an aerospace plane and two robot spacecraft to orbit the Moon and investigate the effects of long-duration flight on biological systems. However, space policy experts point out that only about $300 million of this constitutes new undertakings; the rest consists of existing programs included in the new category.
Although the proposed spending in 1991 on the two new programs, for Earth observation and human exploration of the Moon and Mars, is relatively modest, their cost presumably would multiply many times in the years to come. The Earth Observing System could cost as much as $15 billion over the next decade, and sending humans to Mars could carry a price tag of several hundred billion dollars over the next two or three decades.
''The future is starting to arrive,'' said John E. Pike, a space policy analyst with the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. ''There's a danger with all these big projects just getting started. They could just about devour everything else in the space program.''
An Administration official said the strategy for the expanding space program, as developed by the White House's National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, includes developing new launching capabilities; opening up frontiers for manned and unmanned exploration, first by investigating the new technologies required for more distant space travel; using space as a vantage point for studying problems on Earth; taking advantage of the economic and international trade potential of space technologies, and insuring that the space program contributes to the nation's military security.
 
Some Costs Are Secret
The official said that spending on the even larger military space program also would be increased, by about 8 percent. Because many of these programs are classified, budget figures are not published, but the military space budget is believed to exceed NASA's by a large margin.
Mr. Truly, the NASA administrator, acknowledged that the new programs supported in the 1991 budget proposal would require even greater appropriations in coming years.
''Even with these large programs,'' he said, ''our budgets are running only a little more than 1 percent of the total federal budget, and in the Apollo days in the 1960's, the country invested as much as 3.8 percent of the Federal budget on the civilian space program.''

HEADLINE: Schools Plan: Big Goals, Little Money

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Meeting the education goals that President Bush outlined Wednesday night would be as hard a task as any the United States has faced, requiring a commitment to new ideas and new money that many educators say the President has so far failed to demonstrate. By the year 2000, Mr. Bush said, the United States should lead other nations in math and science, drastically reduce dropout rates, eliminate illiteracy, insure that every child is ready to enter school and make sure schools are disciplined and drug-free.
The President won virtually unanimous praise for using his ''bully pulpit'' to proclaim an educational crusade, particularly since his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, began his term in office by trying to abolish the Education Department. Educators applauded Mr. Bush's pledge to increase by $500 million the budget for Head Start, the program founded 25 years ago to help prepare poor children for school. And they praised his proposal to provide more money for educational research. 
 
Daunting Goals, Some Say
But many educators said that most of the goals Mr. Bush set were daunting and that he has offered no blueprint for reaching them. American students usually rank at or near the bottom among industrialized countries in math and science scores; Mr. Bush would have them leapfrog to the top in just 10 years. He wants to see graduation rates of 90 percent by the year 2000; the national average is now 72 percent, with major cities like Baltimore graduating about 55 percent.
Moreover, these educators faulted Mr. Bush for ignoring the connection between poverty and school failure. ''The math and science goal is critical,'' said Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center for Education and the Economy, ''but reaching it with 20 percent of our kids living in poverty is ludicrous.''
But the educational community was not unanimous in criticizing Mr. Bush's speech. Some school reformers, in fact, believe the President is doing what he should by setting national priorities and that more Federal money is not the answer in a system in which states and cities provide 94 percent of all money for education.
But many educators said Mr. Bush's budget, with the exception of more money for Head Start and educational research, belies his words.
''When we wanted to put a person on the moon, to eradicate polio, and win World War II, we had a concerted approach and a substantial investment,'' said Bill Honig, California's State Superintendent for Public Instruction. ''He has to commit the resources.'' The Problems, the Budget Mr. Bush did propose substantial increases in many school programs. But in the opinion of many educators, experts in Congress and advocacy groups, including the Council of Great City Schools and the American Federation of Teachers, the amounts were so paltry to begin with that those increases will not begin to meet the President's goals.
For instance, some educators said, the Bush budget set aside only $45 million specifically to prevent dropping out of school, and $5 million for research on the dropout problem despite Mr. Bush's call for cuts in the dropout rate. Samuel B. Husk, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents most of the nation's largest cities, said the dropout money should also go to middle schools, where many students decide to leave school.
And some educators noted, the budget includes aside just $239 million for adult literacy programs. While this represents a rise of 25 percent, education groups say it is not nearly enough to meet Mr. Bush's goal of wiping out adult illiteracy. It is estimated that 13 percent of adults in this country cannot read well enough to perform daily activities.
Last year, an international survey ranked 13-year-old Americans last in math and near the bottom in science. The budget allocates $230 million to a teacher training program in math and science, up 70 percent, and $460 million to the National Science Foundation for educational programs, an increase of 28 percent.
Overall, Congressional Democrats calculate that the Education Department's budget would actually expand less than the current inflation rate of 4.2 percent. But Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos argues that when discretionary spending is included, the increase is 6.2 percent, or 2 percent above inflation.
 
Helping Poor Children
But educators said Mr. Bush had gone far toward addressing two of his other goals: preparing poor children for school and measuring students' progress. Head Start, which now reaches about 20 percent of eligible children, could enroll 180,000 more children with the extra money Mr. Bush wants. The budget also allots substantially more money for educational research and for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which surveys student performance.
Still, several educators said Mr. Bush had missed a chance to lead the way in channeling more money to poor school-age children. Money for Chapter One grants, which go to remedial programs for low-income children, would rise by 8 percent, to nearly $5 billion in the Bush budget. But Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said that total fell far short of the need. ''It's great giving somebody a head start, but then dumping them into an impossible school later on won't do very much,'' he said.
But other educators said they believed the Federal role should be one of inspiration, not largesse.
''The most important thing the President can do he's done - make education a national issue,'' said Jack A. MacAllister, chairman of US West, whose company is one of many businesses giving grants and loaning executives to schools across the country. ''This will encourage creative thinking throughout the nation. I don't want anything more from the Federal Government.''
Chester E. Finn Jr., an advocate of school reform, said those who are clamoring for more money are the same people largely responsible for America's poor educational performance. He and Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based group that coordinates state education reform efforts, praised the President for prodding the nation to reach ambitious goals, even if they seem unattainable.
But they said Mr. Bush should be attacking the complacency of many Americans about their children's mediocre educational performances and offering fresh ideas about how to improve.
''The plain fact is the President of the United States has not put forward clear-cut ideas on how we can move ourselves forward,'' Mr. Newman said. ''The Federal government has a history of new ideas - Head Start, Chapter One, the G.I. bill. I don't think the President is having a transforming effect.''

HEADLINE: New Player in Debate Over National Health Insurance: Bush

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
By calling for a review of the nation's health care system, President Bush has brought the White House into the the debate over national health insurance and raised the possibility that he might offer his own proposal, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
In his State of the Union address Wednesday, the President called for ''careful consideration'' of the recommendations of several health care studies now under way. He assigned Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a review of ''recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost'' of health care in the United States.
Until now, the Administration has considered such broad questions only at lower levels in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Domestic Policy Council, where this new review will take place, is a White House advisory group that is critical to forming Administration policy. 
 
Report Expected by Fall
A Congressional staff aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ''The significance of his statement is that universal health care has been elevated to a Presidential matter. He has put himself out there for the first time, saying that he wants an Administration position on the issue, one that will come from the White House directly.''
In an interview today, Dr. Sullivan said the President intended to give him ''the public and official responsibility and leadership for pulling together all the recommendations and options.'' He said his review would deal not just with cutting medical costs but also with quality of care and access to care, as well as the needs of people who have no health insurance.
Dr. Sullivan said that he was not sure what form his final recommendations would take but that they would be ''intended for specific actions.''
''What we are coming up with is an overview of the entire system,'' he said. ''My position will be to develop real improvements in the health care system and to control costs.''
Several commissions are already studying the issues. The Bipartisan Commission on Health Care, led by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, is expected to issue a report in March. The Advisory Committee on Social Security is expected to report in July. A task force on the health care system led by Constance Horner, Under Secretary of Health and Human Services, is expected to report in October. #37 Million Without Insurance These panels have focused on two issues: the 37 million Americans, most of them employed, who have no medical insurance; and long-term care for the elderly. At least some of the panels' reports are expected to suggest some way of assuring that Americans can get health insurance through their employers.
In Congress, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, are developing a proposal that employers be required to offer health insurance and to pay for a substantial part of it. A public program would cover the unemployed.
Senator Rockefeller said Mr. Bush's comments were encouraging but added, ''I only hope the President agrees that it's time to provide leaderhsip aimed at results and real solutions to our health care problems, instead of spending too much more time studying those problems.''
The United States' health care system is the most expensive in the world. But health care experts say it offers services to far fewer people, in proportion to the population, than do those in most Western countries.
Humphrey Taylor, president of the polling concern Louis Harris & Associates, said that while Americans were satisfied with specific health services, their dissatisfaction with the system was also the highest in the world.

HEADLINE: Modest Medicine for the City

 BODY:
New York's Mayor, David Dinkins, has produced a financial plan that begins to come to grips with the city's troubled finances. But that grip may not be tight enough.
The plan represents a credible effort to deal fairly and humanely with New York City's wilting economy. Mayor Dinkins appropriately calls on everyone concerned - state legislators, the City Council, the business communty, city agencies and the public - to share the onerous burden of diminishing resources. Yet the Mayor's plan looks unfinished; it depends too heavily on unknowns and incompletes. 
To close an estimated budget gap of more than $1 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1, the Mayor relies on a mix of service cuts, productivity savings, higher taxes and one-time revenues. The service cuts are bound to hurt, though Mr. Dinkins tries to limit their impact on the needy. Especially painful, if necessary, will be the slowed growth of the police force.
The tax package is bound to hurt, too, and raising taxes always risks sending the wrong message to business. Still, the proposal is reasonable, given the option of even deeper service cuts; they wouldn't enhance the business climate either.
The problem with the tax package, which includes a property tax increase, a three-year surcharge on personal income tax and a gasoline tax of 8 cents per gallon, is that Mr. Dinkins can't determine its fate. The City Council and the State Legislature have authority over different taxes, and both legislatures traditionally oppose tax increases. To his credit, Council Speaker Peter Vallone this year hasn't ruled out increasing property taxes, which are still comparatively low in New York City.
But even if the Council cooperates, Mr. Dinkins can't count on state legislators, up for re-election this year, to do the same. For instance, the city has tried unsuccessfully to get the Legislature to approve one of his requests - extending the mortgage recording tax to co-ops - for four years. What makes this year different?
Finally, the one-shot revenue raising devices, dubious measures in any case, may generate enough criticism from bond raters or fiscal monitors to kill them. The plan includes $330 million from the sale of the Coliseum, which is still in litigation, and the use of $150 million from the sale of new Battery Park City bonds. That borders on fiscal gimmickry.
The fate of the tax package and the one-shots, the unknown future of the economy and of the city's labor settlements later this year all make this spending plan even more speculative than usual. Mr. Dinkins will present his formal executive budget in April. By then he and his budget advisers will know more about the economy and the probable success of their proposals, enough to give more substance to a basically practical approach.

HEADLINE: Every Leveraged Buyout Shakes the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Robert Campeau's Special Genius'' (editorial, Jan. 17) has as weak a grasp on Robert Campeau as he once had on the Allied and Federated department store chains.
I find it incomprehensible that Mr. Campeau alone exhibited the ''special genius,'' ''overreaching grasp'' and ''oversized ego'' to bankrupt 258 profitable stores. What of the exorbitantly paid Wall Street organizations that advised Mr. Campeau to purchase Allied and Federated, certified for him their ''due diligence'' and transacted the deals? Nowhere did you mention them, let alone find them responsible for the conditions that led to this bankruptcy. For the Federated leveraged buyout, Wall Street investment banks and law firms generated $250 million in fees. In return, they delivered to the Campeau Corporation, as a buyer, and Allied and Federated, as sellers, the largest retail bankruptcy in United States history. 
Robert Campeau did not invent the leveraged buyout. It was a Wall Street product to turn black ink into red ink for tax purposes. Perhaps more important, Wall Street found leveraged buyouts generated enormous fees, while creating for investor groups levels of debt that necessitated divestiture and reorganization programs.
The leveraged buyout ''successes'' of the early 1980's reflected astronomical returns to a very small community of ''investors,'' who ''risked'' other people's money and were rewarded by a fourfold rise in the Dow Jones average. The true ''cost'' of such successes to the United States Treasury and state coffers, to the taxpayer, to employees and American productivity and competitiveness is incalculable.
As the 1980's drew to a close, the Dow quaked, and several billion-dollar leveraged buyout failures gave the public its first hint of the role of leveraged buyout tycoons. They walk away, leaving a pile of corporate and financial junk behind. As with the successes, leveraged buyout failures were paid for by the Treasury, state coffers, taxpayers, employees and American productivity and competitiveness.
Your suggestion that ''the big losers are investors, grown-ups'' and that ''The rest of the public has little at stake'' is dangerously simplistic. We all have a stake in the banks, pension funds and insurance companies that purchased the Allied-Federated debt. We will bear their losses through lower returns, lower taxes, employee cutbacks or destabilized pension or benefit programs.
Equally dubious is your contention that suppliers will be hurt only temporarily, though this may be so for some. More likely, smaller or less sophisticated vendors (those who did not fly out in Lear jets to clear payment checks drawn out of state ahead of the bankruptcy announcement) will go out of business at the cost of more tax dollars and more jobs.
Your argument that cutbacks arising from bankruptcy would have been inevitable contradicts your assertion that the stores are well run and profitable. Well run, profitable stores grow, adding jobs to the economy. Cutbacks in one area are more than offset by gains in another. Contrary to your conclusion, I believe the typical shopper, employee and taxpayer have every reason to feel deep, growing concern about the financial fallout in the 1990's of the overleveraging of corporate America. With their overreaching grasp and oversized egos, Wall Street organizations and the raiders they nurtured have put corporate America in a predicament from which a skyrocketing Dow Jones average is unlikely to rescue it.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 17 editorial shows a surprising lack of understanding of the the Campeau Corporation bankruptcy. The big losers are not the ''grown-up investors,'' but rather the thousands of employees who were fired to lower costs in the face of high debt obligations; the communities that once benefited from the human and financial contributions of these previously strong companies; suppliers who may fail to be fully paid; the customers who find these premium department stores unable to provide the service they once did, and the United States taxpayer who is financing the bailout of those failed savings and loan institutions that invested in the junk bonds sold to finance the takeover.

HEADLINE: In Africa, Democracy Needs Some Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There are two unfortunate aspects of the Kenya Government's decision to build a 60-story prestige building (news article, Dec. 29). First, the scarce resources amounting to $200 million slated for this skyscraper can be put to much better purposes, like assisting the credit-starved agrarian sector in Kenya. This kind of conspicuous expenditure on Kenya's urban sector is shortsighted in the extreme. 
An equally unfortunate feature of the proposed 60-story skyscraper is the Kenya Government's systematic repression of voices critical of this fantastic decision. Kenya's leading woman scientist, Wangari Maathai, a professor of veterinary anatomy, lost an environmental impact suit against the skyscraper project. She then appealed to the Kenya Attorney General, whose office said it would not even reply to her.
Subsequently, the President of Kenya, Daniel Arap Moi, attacked Professor Maathai in an independence day speech last Dec. 12. In addition to charging her with being an il-legitimate critic of the government by virtue of her sex, he also called on women associated with the government-linked national women's organization - the Maendeleo ya Wanawake - to ostracize Professor Maathai. Within days, the leaders of the organization requested that the government party, the Kenya African National Union, expel Professor Maathai from membership.
Though this kind of repression of legitimate political dissent is common in the typical African authoritarian state - in Zaire, for instance -Kenya is a relative newcomer to such behavior. With the winds of political change blowing through Eastern European Communist regimes and bringing a resurgence of participatory politics and civil rights, we find it unthinkable that the repression of political rights in African authoritarian states will go unchallenged by the international community. It is now necessary, we believe, that global financial agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the foreign-aid agencies of major states like our own, Japan, Britain, France and West Germany, be increasingly used to improve participatory rights and practices in African states.
Liberal forces in the United States have long insisted, and rightly, that such pressure be used in South Africa, and we believe it is time to insist that participatory rights be thus improved elsewhere in Africa, Kenya included.

HEADLINE: A Familiar Budget;
Much of Spending Plan From Dinkins Is Reminiscent of the Koch Approach

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Presenting a preliminary New York City budget that would not have struck Edward I. Koch as unfamiliar, the Budget Director for Mayor David N. Dinkins acknowledged yesterday that ''there aren't a whole lot of brand-new, unthought-of solutions.''
That truism - uttered by the director, Philip R. Michael - is a testament to both the inflexibility of a budget that must provide many services most other cities do not, and to a stagnant local economy that has hemmed in the city's spending for new programs for the last two years.
To be sure, there were shifted priorities at the periphery - modest new spending for some health, education and social-service programs. Unexpectedly large shortfalls in tax revenues, the biggest in years, prompted a call for unusually large tax increases, $550 million in all. 
 
Gloomy Forecasts
But in its reliance on some taxes that have repeatedly been sought without success, in its proposed delay in hiring police officers, in its gloomy forecasts to force the City Council and Albany to help, and in its warning that things could get worse, the plan is not so different from those proposed in recent years by Mr. Koch while he was Mayor.
''I don't think this budget document would have been much different if Mayor Koch had been here,'' said Hyman C. Grossman, managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which rates the city's bonds. ''I think that David Dinkins, as far as fiscal policy goes, has built on the track record Koch has made in the last several years, and that is: raise taxes when you've got no choice, cut services where you have to.''
Charles Brecher, director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private monitoring group financed mostly by the business community, said: ''It's similar in the sense that it is realistic. They're facing up to what has to be dealt with.''
The similarities of this plan with those of the past came in part because the Dinkins administration had only a month to prepare it. Actions taken by the Koch administration, like the decision to include $300 million from the sale of the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle in the operating budget, left Mr. Dinkins ''somehwat captured by what had preceded us,'' Mr. Michael said.
At the same time, a marked decline in revenue growth, from an annual average of 9.8 percent from fiscal 1980 through 1988 to 2 percent in the current fiscal year, meant Mr. Dinkins had to worry more about cutting than adding.
 
'Easier to Express'
''It's always easier to express your priorities when you can add,'' said Alair A. Townsend, one of Mr. Michael's predecessors as budget chief and now publisher of Crain's New York Business. ''Frankly, with so much of the budget uncontrollable in the short term, there are only so many places to look for cuts. You can protect some things, but all that's at the margin.''
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said it is the margin that counts.
''For me, that's only a way of saying the glass is half-empty,'' she said. ''What is full is that with only four weeks to make a budget that reflects perilous times, the Dinkins administration has made some hard choices in revenue proposals and approached the issue of service protection and service reduction with a scalpel.''
About 70 cents of each dollar in city revenue is effectively spoken for by the time it arrives, to pay for programs like Medicaid and welfare and social-service caseworkers and jail guards that are required. That means a mayor seeking to save lots of money must almost inevitably choose options like postponing the hiring of police officers, something Mr. Koch did repeatedly.
The plan announced yesterday would postpone from June until June 1991 the goal of having 28,054 officers on the main city police force, which now has just under 26,000. Even if the 5,000 officers needed to keep pace with attrition and meet that target were hired, Mr. Michael acknowledged, the last of them probably will not be hired until after July 1, 1991, to save money by pushing them into the next fiscal year.
 
'Phantom Cops'
During the mayoral campaign, Mr. Dinkins often accused Mr. Koch of creating ''phantom cops'' by claiming credit for officers included in the budget but never hired. Yesterday, Mr. Dinkins did not even mention the police hiring plans in his speech about the budget, and detailed them only in response to questions.
''I accused the Mayor of counting those when they weren't there,'' he said yesterday. Asked how his approach differed, he said, ''I don't count them.''
In proposing a $150 million bond issue by the Battery Park City Authority to give the city a one-time cash influx to help close a budget gap for the rest of the current fiscal year, Mr. Dinkins is, at best, relying on a one-time revenue source, like the Coliseum sale he faulted Mr. Koch for depending on.
 
A Tax Surcharge
In asking the Legislature for a three-year surcharge on the personal income tax that would cost the city's average resident about $70 a year, the Mayor returned to a measure used from 1982 to 1985, when the city also faced unexpected revenue shortfalls in the wake of a national recession. Mr. Michael said he was confident the current proposal would be equally temporary.
But in asking the City Council to delay cuts in energy taxes, Mr. Dinkins again sought to postpone tax breaks that were delayed two years ago. And in asking the Legislature to extend the mortgage recording tax to the sale of cooperatives, he reached for a chestnut that has been proposed each of the last five years without success.
Perhaps the biggest similarity of Mr. Dinkins's plan with those of the past is that it is only the start of process that will stretch until the Council passes a final budget this summer.
''It's preliminary, a point of negotiation with Albany and the Council,'' Mr. Brecher of the citizens group said. ''As in the past, a lot of things are going to change between now and June.''

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:

La Cite
New York is the great magnifying glass. It picks up trends from around the world - in fashion, food, music, art - blows them up into caricatures, attaches high price tags and hawks them to the moneyed elite. Then they are jettisoned to make room for the next fads. This came to mind after repeated visits to La Cite, the new rococo extravaganza on West 51st Street that bills itself as a brasserie.
To be sure, New York could use some authentic brasseries along the lines of Paris's Vaudeville and Bofinger: fast-paced, drop-in, casual restaurants that serve traditional food at economical prices. While La Cite makes some earnest gestures to the genre, this place is to an authentic brasserie what a Citroen is to a bicycle.
The grand, multi-level setting has two main dining arenas and a cozier grill room, which serves essentially the same food at slightly lower prices. The main rooms evoke all the festive garishness of grand European brasseries: Art Deco molding, immense cylindrical chandeliers, tall mirrors, red velvet banquettes and waiters in spiffy black jackets and long white aprons. 
Some attempts at typical brasserie cooking succeed; others don't. And prices are all over the board, from $16 for rubbery-skinned blood sausage and mashed potatoes to $29.50 for excellent sirloin steak and french fries. Count on $100 for two, especially if you dip into the astutely chosen but expensive wine list (of more than 150 labels, only 8 are under $20; even the humble Bourgeuil and Chinon from the Loire are $25). And considering that brasseries are historically built around beer - the word means brewery in French - it is surprising that no beer list is offered.
The much ballyhooed choucroute, made with quality ingredients, has improved over the course of my visits, but it still lacks a deep, integrated flavor. The same goes for the decent if shallow-tasting cassoulet. One of the best entrees sampled is the golden-skinned, spit-roasted chicken with raisins, pearl onions and button mushrooms. Grilled salmon with a fresh dill vinaigrette is better than the roasted monkfish, which came coated with so many green peppercorns we couldn't eat it. At lunch in the handsome grill room, a huge juicy lamb steak came with delicious white beans cooked in chicken stock with basil. As for our side dish, I don't know whether to call it mashed potatoes with butter or butter with mashed potatoes -whatever, it is unrepentantly good. A thick slab of swordfish was deftly turned out, too, embellished with tissue-thin homemade potato chips.
Petit sale, which usually connotes cured pork, is made with breast and leg of duck. The rendition here, served with green cabbage, did not go over big at my table: it lacked a saline-cured flavor and had no perceptible seasonings. Thursday's special is duck confit with sauteed apples and lentils. The crispy-skinned leg is tasty and tender for sure, but not at all complex and buttery like a real confit.
For starters, shellfish of all sorts, especially oysters and intensely oceanic sea urchins, are excellent. A salad pairing confit of chicken with sun-dried cherries is a felicitous combination. I would go back to the grill room just for a sizzling batch of small, incredibly sweet mussels served in a skillet.
La Cite, which is owned by Alan Stillman (of the Post House, Smith & Wollensky and the Manhattan Ocean Club), took off from Day 1, and the service staff has had little time to get its sea legs. Lunch service on one occasion was much too slow for the business crowd, while another time in the grill our waiter yanked away my finished plate while my companion was halfway through her entree.
Desserts are the most consistent course: prune Armagnac ice cream with walnut cake and fruit compote, sublime banana ice cream crowned with a light chocolate mousse and thin coconut cookies, intense chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.
If you only try one, get the cappuccino mousse topped with granite of espresso.
La Cite is not the insouciant, unassuming brasserie one might have hoped it would be - I would call it a brassaurant - but if you take it on its terms, it can be a diverting addition to the midtown dining scene.
 
Siracusa
Five years ago, a friend and I wandered into a little Italian delicatessen near Astor Place and noticed several Formica tables in one corner. From under a door came the deep, rich aroma of something simmering on the stove. When I asked what was cooking, the man behind the counter said his mother was making pasta sauce, and asked if we would like some lunch.
We sat on the flimsy chairs and ate ourselves silly on fettuccine with fresh porcini and ground veal, spaghetti all'amatriciana, fresh mozzarella with sun-dried tomatoes, caponata, glasses of Barbera d'Alba and, for dessert, four kinds of gelati. The bill was under $35. Since then, the Cammarata family - Gino, his mother, Maria, and father, Giuseppe, all of whom share kitchen duties, and Enzo, the maitre d'hotel - has built a cozy 40-seat restaurant in the back room, complete with a long, well-stocked wine bar, antique cupboard, well-spaced tables and soft lighting. The pastas still excel, and, naturally, prices have inflated. But Siracusa is still as warm and genial as ever.
The best way to start is with a sampling from the changing appetizer platters that are on display near the bar. One evening, the platters could have squares of light fennel-filled pastry; wonderful caponata; asparagus wrapped in prosciuttto, and tender baby octopus in a peppery fresh tomato sauce. Another time, the assortments might feature glistening rape in strong olive oil and flecked with prosciutto; mozzarella with sun-dried tomatoes; mussels on the half shell stuffed with rice and peas, and a simple but sublime Sicilian specialty called panelle, which is chick-pea-flour bread filled with ricotta and baked until toasted. Every tidbit was not a winner, though: swordfish carpaccio, which came with the assorted appetizers one evening, was so swamped in capers and vinaigrette that the fish was undetectable. Two specials to watch for are scacciata, a delicious thin-crusted pie filled with fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and capers, and the cleanly fried codfish fritters.
It seems that half of the customers are on a first-name basis with the Cammarata family, which makes for a neighborly atmosphere. Waiters are sincere and professional. Siracusa has a well-rounded Italian wine list, starting at $18.
Main courses are restricted to pastas. Outstanding winter specials include fettuccine with a thick, lusty lamb and potato ragu, and curri curri, which is simply homemade pasta tossed with a clean, fresh sauce of tomato and prosciutto. The seafood pasta is noteworthy, too, combining baby octopus, squid, shrimp and a changing roster of other ingredients in a light, oregano-scented tomato sauce.
The Sicilian specialty of spaghetti with fresh sardines, raisins, pinenuts, dill and toasted breadcrumbs is extremely rich and assertive from the abundance of sardines: too rich to my taste. And cappellini puttanesca - olives, capers, anchovies and olive oil - suffered only from undersaucing.
Mrs. Cammarata still makes the tiramisu, and it is relatively light and dusted with chocolate powder. Lemon sorbet is a fine cleanser, but most regulars go for the marvelous homemade gelati, either ricotta, hazelnut, espresso or vanilla (Siracusa sells its gelati to many Italian restaurants in town and has a gelateria next door that is open from spring to fall).
In a way, I still miss that obscure little delicatessen with the Formica-topped tables and Mom in the galley kitchen. To the Cammaratas' credit, the setting has changed but the spirit remains.

HEADLINE: Is Campeau Himself Bankrupt?

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Robert Campeau's audacious, but characteristic, move in betting his financial empire on the value of his Campeau Corporation stock now seems to have been his undoing. By most available accounts, his personal fortune of $500 million has all but evaporated before his eyes as the stock, worth $41 a share (Canadian) two and half years ago, is now at $2.40 on the Toronto exchange.
Yesterday there was another indication of the troubles the Toronto real estate developer faces: The Bank of Montreal said it was suing Mr. Campeau for defaulting on $21.2 million remaining on a $25 million personal loan. The bank said he borrowed the money two and a half years ago to help buy Campeau voting shares and debentures. To secure the loan Mr. Campeau had pledged 425,000 shares of stock from his personal account and the principal of millions of dollars in debentures.
That default follows a very similar but much larger loan default in January to the Montreal-based National Bank of Canada. That bank said Mr. Campeau had failed to make an interest payment on an estimated $160 million loan. 
The result is that along with the retail chains in bankruptcy - the Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores owned by his company - Mr. Campeau may himself be insolvent, according to public information about his holdings and to people who have long tracked his finances.
They calculate that Mr. Campeau's assets in stock and personal property total about $35 million, against loans and other liabilities of at least $120 million.
''Bob is as broke as his company,'' said Ira Gluskin, a Toronto money manager who has followed Campeau financial dealings for 25 years.
To be sure, Mr. Campeau is hardly destitute, and the precise depth of his financial wounds is impossible to determine. Since the multibillion-dollar financial collapse of the American department store companies was disclosed, he has become a virtual recluse. He declined to be interviewed for this article, and like other private citizens he does not have to disclose information about his personal affairs.
Still, these are some things that are known about his situation:
Mr. Campeau owns 6.6 million Campeau Corporation shares worth about $15.8 million (Canadian). He and his wife, Ilse, own a baronial, Norman-style estate in the exclusive Bridle Path district of Toronto that is their primary home and is worth at least $10 million. They also have a home in Tequesta, Fla., near Palm Beach, assessed by local tax officials last year at $462,400, and a recently acquired large home in Austria.
Property records show that Mrs. Campeau has sole title to the Toronto estate and the Florida vacation home. While that gives Mr. Campeau no claim to the property, it also means his creditors cannot lay claim to it.
But even ignoring who holds the house titles, the properties are worth at most $20 million, real estate experts say, making Mr. Campeau's personal property and stock assets total around $35 million.
On the other side of the ledger are the loan defaults to at least the two Montreal banks by his personal investment companies, which serve largely to manage his stock portfolio.
 
Stock Seized
Although the National Bank, with the larger default claim, will not disclose the terms of the loan, banking experts say that in all likelihood Mr. Campeau is personally liable.
On declaring him in default, the National Bank seized 13 million Campeau Corporation common shares and 4 million convertible preferred Campeau shares that Mr. Campeau had posted as collateral. But since the collateral, along with notes and bonds Mr. Campeau also posted, is now worth only about $60 million, the developer still probably owes the bank $100 million.
''If Bob is on that National Bank loan with his personal covenant, he is bankrupt,'' said Harry Rannala, a Toronto-based stock analyst who has followed Mr. Campeau for years.
Since the troubles at Federated and Allied arose, Mr. Campeau has shunned the limelight and is not the social butterfly he once was, those who know him say.
''It's safe to assume he has not been out partying,'' said a spokesman, Richard Wertheim.
It is quite possible that Mr. Campeau has squirreled away substantial wealth in foreign banks, where it would be hard to track, or through private investment partnerships, which would also be difficult to trace.
But business associates, family members and analysts who know Mr. Campeau find that unlikely. And National Bank officials suggested that he failed to make his payment simply because he did not have the cash.
''Otherwise he would not have defaulted and relinquished control of his company,'' said Leon Courville, a National Bank executive vice president, in a telephone interview last week. $1 Million Salary Halted Just a few days after Mr. Campeau defaulted on his loan, Campeau Corporation directors moved to establish a voting trust that would manage the affairs of Allied and Federated, which operate the Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and Abraham & Straus chains, among others. That not only removed Mr. Campeau from the seat of power, but also halted his $1 million-a-year salary.
How could such a hugely successful entrepreneur be broke? After all, his real estate company built 20 percent of the new houses in Ottawa in the last 25 years and owns 40 percent of the office space leased by the Canadian Government. The answer appears to be that Mr. Campeau believed in himself and his company to such an extent that he never hesitated to put most of his money back into Campeau Corporation stock. At one point he owned more than 75 percent of the outstanding common.
 
Several Private Companies
Incorporation certificates at the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations show that in the last 20 years Mr. Campeau has established several private investment companies. But Ontario Securities Commission records show that the companies were formed to hold Campeau securities and have virtually no outside investments.
Analysts who have followed Mr. Campeau are not surprised by his view that there could not be a better investment than Campeau stock. They say that since its early days of building modest single-family homes in Quebec, the company and Mr. Campeau have been almost indistinguishable, even after the corporation went public in the late 1960's.
''I'm not saying he did not have other investments,'' said Michael Babad, a Toronto-based journalist who wrote a biography of Mr. Campeau. ''What I am saying is that Campeau Corporation was Bob Campeau's life and that the great bulk of his wealth has been tied up in the company's stock.''
Even as recently as last September, Campeau shares traded at $18.625. Since then, as the company's troubles grew and the stock was handed out to various parties lending financial aid, the family's ownership has slipped to 30.3 percent worth $35 million, down from 51 percent worth more than $500 million.
''He gambled almost everything: his own personal stuff plus the children's trusts,'' said Robert Archambault, Mr. Campeau's son-in-law. ''It is quite devastating.''
Mr. Archambault should know. His wife, Rachelle, Mr. Campeau's daughter, received at the age of 35 a total of 1.6 million Campeau shares held in trust. Those shares are now worth $3.8 million, compared with $65.6 million two and a half years ago.
Two of Mr. Campeau's sons, Robert Jr. and Daniel, still have Campeau shares in trust that are worth $10.6 million, down from $180.4 million. A third son, Jacques, who received 1.9 million shares before his father sued him for the right to vote the stock, has seen the value of his holdings decline to $4.6 million from $77.9 million.
Making matters worse for the family is that their shares have not paid dividends since the Campeau Corporation suspended them last fall when its American retailing operations had to be bailed out by Olympia & York Developments Ltd., a Toronto-based real estate giant.
''Robert Campeau was being squeezed even before the National Bank of Canada called its loan,'' said Frank Mayer, an analyst at BBN James Capel, a securities firm with offices in Toronto.
Mr. Campeau still has some income. He receives a salary as chief executive of the Campeau Corporation, which is not disclosed. As chairman of Campeau's board, he is paid $12,000 a year in directors' fees plus $750 per meeting. Balanced against that, Mr. Campeau owes the Campeau Corporation $4 million on a $5 million interest-free loan he received to buy personal real estate.
Mr. Campeau has not filed for personal bankruptcy, although speculation is rising in Toronto that he might have to do so to keep creditors from closing in on his remaining assets.
Despite the setbacks no one is saying that Mr. Campeau's career is over. Friends believe that Mr. Campeau, who rose from a hardscrabble existence as a factory worker in a nickel plant, has simply put his ambitions on hold.
''Bob's irrepressible, so, yes, he'll be back,'' said a friend of the developer and a former Campeau Corporation director. ''Bob will always find something interesting to do and a way to make money. He's a survivor.''

HEADLINE: Good Gains For Stores Last Month

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Many of the nation's biggest retailers reported yesterday that their fiscal year ended with generally good sales gains in January.
Two exceptions to the strong showing were Sears, Roebuck & Company, which posted a 2.2 percent increase in sales for the month, and Montgomery Ward, where sales showed a decline of 3.8 percent.
In other reports on business activity, the nation's purchasing managers said that the economy declined in January for the ninth consecutive month. And the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in December, ending a year that saw the slowest growth since 1982. [Page D2.] Apparel Sales Up Clearances of apparel were a big factor in January retailing, and chains that emphasize clothing, like the Limited Inc., Charming Shoppes and the J. C. Penney Company, had a better January performance than the retail industry in general. 
But the percentage gains of sales at stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, increased less in January than for the fiscal year.
The January sales trend was seen as evidence of continued economic growth but at a moderate pace. ''There will be no recession; that's the overwhelming conclusion we get now,'' said Monroe Greenstein, senior analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. ''But the evidence of a continued sluggish pace of consumer buying augurs for a relatively tough year in 1990.''
 
Outlook Called Sluggish
Jeffrey Feiner, retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch, said, ''Weakness in both the housing and financial markets makes the outlook for consumer spending in retail stores likely to be quite sluggish, at least over the near term.''
As Mr. Greenstein noted, ''Where there was strength in January, it was in apparel, where clearances included deep discounts.'' But there was some evidence, too, that price-cutting of clothes and related items had been so prevalent in recent months that consumers had already snapped up many goods and did not need many more, analysts said.
Sears, the nation's biggest retailer, said its merchandise group had revenues in January of $2.16 billion, up from $2.12 billion the year before; same-store sales were up 3.3 percent. For the 52 weeks ended Jan. 27, sales rose 3.7 percent, to $33.5 billion, from $32.3 billion the year before, and same-store sales rose 2.5 percent.
Michael Bozic, the chairman of Sears's merchandising group, said double-digit gains were recorded in children's and junior apparel, home appliances, sporting goods, lawn mowers and business equipment. But the increases were largely offset by soft sales in other lines, he said.
The K Mart Corporation, the second-largest retailer, said sales in January totaled $1.79 billion, up 13.3 percent from $1.58 billion the year earlier; same-store sales rose 3.1 percent. For the year, sales rose 6.6 percent, to $29.1 billion from $27.3 billion; same-store sales increased 2 percent.
''We are encouraged by the continued sales increases in both the hard-line and apparel businesses,'' said Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive of K Mart.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has been the nation's fastest-growing retailer for several years, registered bigger sales in January than K Mart, moving closer to capturing the No. 2 position. Wal-Mart's January sales rose 24.3 percent, to $1.84 billion from $1.48 billion; same-store sales were up 10 percent. Sales in the year increased 25.2 percent, to $25.8 billion from $20.6 billion; same-store sales rose 11 percent.
Penney reported an 8.5 percent sales gain for January and said its sales for the year rose 8.4 percent.
Following is a list of the sales of other large retailers:
 
Ames Department Stores down 4.2 percent, to $230 million. Same-store sales rose 1.9 percent in the Ames' discount stores but dropped about 16 percent in the Zayre stores acquired in October 1988.
Dayton Hudson Corp. up 12.2 percent, to $711 million; same-store sales rose 5.2 percent.
For the 52 weeks, sales rose 14 percent, to $12.7 billion; same-store sales up 6.4 percent.
The Limited up 11 percent to $285.6 million; same-store sales rose 9 percent. For the 52 weeks, sales rose 12 percent, to $4.57 billion; same-store sales up 9 percent.
May Department Stores Co. up 5.2 percent, to $471.7 million; same-store sales rose 2.6 percent. For the 52 weeks, sales rose 12.1 percent, to $9.42 billion; same-store sales up 5.7 percent.
Montgomery Ward down 3.9 percent, to $278.2 million. For the 52 weeks, sales rose 2.8 percent, to $5 billion.
J. C. Penney up 8.5 percent, to $779 million; same-store sales rose 7.3 percent. For the 52 weeks, sales increased 8.4 percent, to $15.1 billion; same-store sales rose 7.2 percent.
Woolworth Corp. up 8.5 percent, to $283 million; same-store sales rose 4.5 percent. For the 52 weeks, up 9.5 percent, to $5.12 billion; same-store sales rose 5.3 percent. Including foreign operations, sales rose 9 percent, to $8.76 billion for the year.

Four Pathways Japan Might Take

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE traffic jams here beat anything New York has to offer, and so does the concentration of capital. Japan's investors, having bid the prices of buildings, land and stocks to stratospheric levels, are going overseas for cheaper assets, cheaper labor and higher rates of return than they can earn at home. Lenin said, ''Imperialism is the final stage of capitalism,'' and the Japanese, bursting forth from their resource-poor islands, seem to be acting out Lenin's script.
With incredible speed, Japan has already built up huge holdings abroad. Its net external assets, the amount by which Japanese holdings abroad exceed foreigners' holdings of Japanese assets, have increased 25-fold during the last decade and will reach $380 billion this year. Kenneth S. Courtis, a professor at the University of Tokyo and Deutsche Bank's chief economist here, estimates that Japan's net external assets could well reach $1 trillion by the end of the 1990's. 
Having risen from the ashes of World War II to become the world's most capital-rich nation, the Japanese face a spectrum of accusations, from arrogance and ethnocentricity to materialism and insecurity; they seem obsessed with the question of what their role in the world of economics and politics should be.
They can choose among four basic scenarios. The first is to become the world's dominant power, replacing the ''Pax Americana'' with a ''Pax Nipponica.'' But a hegemonic strategy would encounter many problems. The Japanese could scarcely expect to achieve world dominance without the military means of enforcing control over other areas; one would have to assume that in the brave new world of the future, peace would be automatic and self-enforcing, with military strength counting for naught, or that economic strength could buy mercenaries elsewhere to enforce the peace.
Even if Japan were to renounce its constitutional restraints on military power, other nations, in Asia or the West, would not permit a militarily dominant Japan to emerge. Setting aside the question of force, a Japanese bid for hegemonic power through economic means alone would doubtless provoke strong political resistance, protectionist moves against Japanese exports and barriers against investment.
The second scenario would be for Japan to join forces with the United States to assume a joint hegemony. Working closely together, Japan and the United States would constitute a formidable team, economically, militarily and technologically. But the strong rivalry between the countries is likely to persist. The relationship has long been a strained and troubled one, especially after Japan discarded its early postwar humility and self-abasement. Even if Japan and the United States established some sort of duopoly in the Pacific, they would encounter powerful resistance from Europe, the Soviet Union and whatever remains of the Soviet bloc - the vast domain that George Orwell, in his novel ''1984,'' called Eurasia.
That leads to a third scenario, which some economists think is already emerging: a world divided among three major blocs paralleling Orwell's Eastasia, Eurasia and Oceania. But a brave new world split into such blocs could be as unstable and dangerous, economically and politically, as the old world of blocs between World Wars I and II. As Prof. Paul Streeten of Boston University has observed: ''The exclusion of the Japanese from South and Southeast Asia by the British, French and Dutch was a major cause of Japanese aggression. The exclusion of Germany from the Western blocs contributed to World War II.''
Groups of three tend to break into coalitions of two against one. Some of the Japanese one encounters in Tokyo voice fears that a ''white Christian'' America and Europe would form a coalition to contain Japan. But this fear appears to underrate the importance the United States attaches, for the sake of its own economic and political interests, to maintaining close relations and two-way trade and capital investments with Japan and the other rapidly growing nations of the Pacific.
Hence, though it may seem visionary, the scenario that appears to make the most practical sense for Japan, the United States and the rest of the world is the fourth one: a global strategy. This was the strategy the United States and its allies pursued at the end of World War II through the creation of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and what was to have been a World Trade Organization, now reduced to a rather ineffectual General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. With the Communist empire breaking down, there may be an opportunity to rebuild the global system in larger terms.
The Japanese are coming to see their interests as global - and best served by an open system of world trading and investment. That is why they are investing so heavily abroad: Last year direct Japanese investment in North America totaled $44.3 billion; in Europe, $24.9 billion; elsewhere in Asia, $12.9 billion, and in other areas, $17.9 billion.
The global strategy is emerging as Japan's prime scenario for the 21st century. It is why Prime Minister Tashiki Kaifu went to Eastern Europe last month, and was criticized at home for not visiting China and other parts of Asia.
But the global strategy will have to involve greater aid, not just trade and private investment. In Tokyo last week, Robert S. McNamara, the former president of the World Bank, criticized Japan for devoting only 0.31 percent of its gross national product to aid for developing countries during the last five years. Although Japan has said it will double its aid to the third world during the next five years, Mr. McNamara said Japan's level of aid would continue to fall below that of most other industrial countries, though the country's per capita income is 20 percent greater, on average, than the others'.
''Surely,'' he said, ''Japan will feel a responsibility to carry a larger share of our common burden.''

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Off 0.6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Construction spending advanced last year at its slowest pace since the 1982 recession, the Government said today as it released December data showing that spending declined by six-tenths of a percent that month.
Analysts said high interest rates, overbuilding and a sluggish economy contributed to the weakness last year.
The Commerce Department said residential, nonresidential and government construction spending last year totaled $414.7 billion, a 1.2 percent increase over 1988 but the weakest performance since a 5.1 percent decline in 1982. 
 
Offsetting a Gain
For December, spending was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.6 billion, a decline that nearly erased the gain of seven-tenths of a percent in November.
The December activity, the worst monthly performance since a decrease of 1 percent last June, was affected by record cold weather in most of the nation east of the Rockies.
As for the year, analysts said actions by the Federal Reserve that kept interest rates relatively high through most of 1989 not only made construction more expensive, but also slowed the economy and thus made sales more difficult.
''Plus, you had a number of good years of construction'' leading up to 1989, said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. ''Eventually, you have all the houses and office buildings that you need. You run out of pent-up demand.''
Because of the lessening demand and the state of the economy, Mr. Berson said, ''1990, at best, will be about what it was in 1989 and could even fall a little bit.''
 
Worries About Financing
Another factor beginning to worry builders and analysts is the effect that the Government's bailout of the savings and loan industry will have on the availability of construction financing.
''The law limits the amount that savings and loans can lend to any one construction company,'' said Steven Cochran, an economist at WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., who added that efforts were under way to change that aspect of the bailout law.
Analysts said the nonresidential sector continued to grow last year even though widespread vacancies in office buildings provide evidence of overbuilding.
Nonresidential spending rose 2.4 percent, to $99.4 billion, in 1989, and 4.3 percent, to an annual rate of $96.7 billion, in December.
 
Slump in Housing
Residential spending, representing 50 percent of construction spending, was off 1.1 percent, to $195.9 billion, last year, and down seven-tenths of a percent in December, to an annual rate of $191 billion.
But single-family construction rose four-tenths of a percent, to an annual rate of $144.3 billion, in December, the third straight advance after falling for eight months. Multifamily spending, which has fallen every month since July, was down 2.8 percent, to a $20.6 billion annual rate.
The usually volatile government sector rose 3.8 percent, to $84 billion, in 1989, and 2.9 percent, to a $91.1 billion annual rate, in December, when it was bolstered by a 9.3 percent gain in highway and street projects. Government projects account for about 20 percent of construction spending.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Down

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the United States fell in January for the third straight month, but buying plans remained virtually unchanged, the Conference Board, a private business research group, said Wednesday. 
The January consumer confidence index fell about 8 points from where it stood in December, to 105.1, its lowest level since November 1987, just after the October stock market crash.
In the latest survey, people were less comfortable with current conditions and less optimistic in their expectations for the next six months, but their buying plans were little changed. The monthly survey covers 5,000 households throughout the United States.
In January, 18.5 percent of the respondents said business conditions were bad, a slight increase from December.

HEADLINE: Dow Slips In Slower Trading

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices ended narrowly mixed yesterday amid sharply slower trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average, slipped 4.28 points, to 2,586.26, but advances on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded declines by 881 to 651. Yesterday's performance was in sharp contrast to Wednesday's 47.30 gain.
Traders said that news of a drop in an economic index of the National Association of Purchasing Management to 45.2 percent in January from 46.7 percent in December had little impact on stock prices. A reading below 50 percent means the economy is declining, while a reading above that figure means the economy is expanding. 
A report by the Commerce Department that showed construction spending fell six-tenths of 1 percent in December also had little impact on traders.
 
Phelan Resignation
Perhaps the biggest news coming from the Big Board today was the announcement that John J. Phelan Jr. would retire as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange at the end of the year. Mr. Phelan denied rumors that he might be named Treasury Secretary, saying that he had no interest in going into Government service.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 0.29, to 328.79, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up 0.02, to 181.52.
Volume on the Big Board shrank to 154.6 million shares, from a heavy 189.7 million on Wednesday.
The Dow transportation average continued to rebound from its recent weakness, with UAL, making another strong showing. The parent of United Airlines soared 8 3/4, to 129 3/4, and was one of the biggest net gainers on the Big Board.
Traders said that company was meeting with commercial bankers, Coniston Partners and others who are believed to be forming a new bid for the company at about $180 a share.
Among individual issues, USX rose 3/8, to 33 7/8. Charles A. Corry, the company's chairman, said this week that USX had altered its bylaws to require anyone planning a proxy contest at the company's annual meeting to give USX 60 days' notice. Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor who controls more than 13 percent of USX's stock, has said that he would like to buy 25 percent.
Hilton Hotels dropped 3 1/4, to 58 1/2. Traders linked the decline to disappointment that the company has made no decision on spinning off certain assets or restructuring.
Johnson & Johnson rose a point, to 53 3/8. Analysts said that the rise was helped by hopes that the pharmaceutical company could be developing a rival product to Wellcome P.L.C.'s anti-aids drug.
QMS, a Mobile, Ala., software manufacturer, rose 1/2, to 13 1/8. The company announced that it had authorized the repurchase of 500,000 of its more than 11 million shares outstanding.
 
Other Exchanges Advance
Chase Manhattan, in dividend-related activity, was the most active stock, slipping 1/8, to 30 5/8, on a volume of 5.4 million shares. The stock went ex-dividend on Jan. 26.
Other active glamour stocks included Texaco, off 1/4, to 58; Philip Morris, up 1/8, to 38, and A.T.& T. off 5/8, to 38 3/8. I.B.M. dropped 7/8, to 97 3/4, and American Express added 1/4, to 30.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 1.43 points, to 351.50, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index advanced 1.95 points, to 417.76.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed yesterday in fairly active trading.
A report from the nation's purchasing managers indicating that activity in the manufacturing sector declined for the ninth straight month in January tended to bolster bond prices somewhat. But prices of short- to intermediate-term securities eased modestly.
Market participants attributed the lack of reaction to the fact that traders were looking beyond the purchasing managers' survey to the employment report that will be released this morning. 
''The purchasing managers' number was important, but the employment data are critical,'' one Government bond trader said. ''That provides a very hard look at the economy and is the sort of number the Fed pays attention to.''
Because of a number of special factors, including layoffs in the auto industry and the expected return of large numbers of construction workers after an exceptionally frigid December, estimates vary widely on what the January employment report will show.
 
Various Forecasts
Most analysts are projecting that non-farm payroll employment rose by 150,000 last month. But forecasts of an increase as low as 75,000 and as high as 400,000 have also been made.
''An increase of more than 300,000 accompanied by a rise in wages of half a percentage point or more would be a pretty bad combination for the market,'' said James A. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities.
Treasury bond prices, which rallied by a full point on Wednesday, moved slightly higher again yesterday. By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 96 23/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.42 percent.
But short to intermediate Treasury notes were little changed. In late trading, for example, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 1/2, up 1/32, to yield 8.40 percent. Meanwhile, the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes dipped by 1/32, to a late offered price of 97 5/8, to yield 8.32 percent.
Treasury bill rates were little changed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.74 percent late yesterday, up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills were unchanged, at 7.69 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.52 percent.
 
At Least One Pessimist
Despite the recent run-up in interest rates, at least one noted portfolio manager remains pessimistic about the bond market's prospects over the next few months.
Earlier this week, Stanley D. Salvigsen, chairman and chief executive of Comstock Partners, which manages $2.3 billion in assets, advised the firm's clients to cut their bond holdings in half.
As of now, the portfolio mix recommended by Comstock is 30 percent invested in stocks, 35 percent in bonds and the remaining 35 percent in cash.
''We got into bonds in the summer of 1987 and have had a pretty good run,'' Mr. Salvigsen said. ''Long term we are still very bullish, but over the short term we are concerned.''
Rising interest rates in Western Europe and Japan, a factor that has already pushed up rates in this country, remain a major worry, Mr. Salvigsen said.
 
Quarter-Point Rise Seen
Mr. Salivigsen declined to predict how high interest rates might go. But he said that ''obviously, at this late stage of the day, we think they will go up by more than one-quarter of a percentage point.''
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very light, dealers said, with little or no change in prices. Prices of high-yield ''junk bond'' issues were also little changed.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most actively traded issues rose by 1/8 of a point to 1/4 of a point, traders said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Jan. 22. The report had no impact on prices.

HEADLINE: Mexico's President Urges Latin Investments by West

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico urged the industrialized nations of the West today not to forget Mexico and the rest of Latin America as they move to help the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
Addressing the opening session of the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of political and business leaders, Mr. Salinas said Mexico had already carried out many of the painful changes, including economic deregulation and privatization of state entities, that still lie ahead in Eastern Europe.
''We know that any economic reform takes time and demands sacrifices,'' he said, ''because if hopes are thwarted, the sense of future can be lost, only to be replaced by nostalgia for the past.'' 
 
Main Theme of Message
Turning to the main theme of his current five-nation European trip, he said, ''May these splendid signs of change not cloud Europe's global vision, nor turn its attention away from our continent - particularly Mexico - and from other regions of the world.''
So far, Mr. Salinas has carried this message to meetings with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn and to the headquarters of the European Community in Brussels. Mexican officials said his domestic economic program had been praised in all three capitals.
But his audience today was made up largely of senior executives of big European, Japanese and American corporations. And here he stressed that Mexico has relaxed its rules for foreign investment and warmly welcomed outside participation in new growth resulting from completion of the latest talks on its foreign debt.
 
Forum Focuses on Shift in East
This year's weeklong World Economic Forum seems likely to be dominated almost entirely by the challenges facing Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as they gradually move from centrally planned to market-oriented economies.
Probably no Latin American country is currently better positioned to speak for the third world to this audience than Mexico. Since taking office a year ago, the Salinas administration has not only obtained the best foreign debt restructuring deal to date, but has also taken steps to control inflation, reduce the budget deficit and trim the state apparatus.
Mr. Salinas said that development differences advised against linking Mexico to the United States in a common market in the foreseeable future. But he added that sector-to-sector agreements with the United States were working well and that similar arrangements would soon be worked out with Canada.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Session Mixed; Mark Dominates Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed yesterday amid generally bearish sentiment.
Currency trading was active in Europe, although the dollar held to a narrow range. Dealings slowed considerably when activity shifted to United States markets, and the dollar closed near its lows of the day against several currencies.
Traders were awaiting the release today of United States employment figures for January. The consensus is that the unemployment rate will register around 5.4 percent.
The figure ''is going to be a real key on the market,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at Bank of Boston's office in New York.
''We're looking for a fairly neutral number,'' he said, ''but if there is a jump in unemployment - an indication that the economy is slowing - we could see the dollar much lower.''
Traders said they expected American interest rates to decline further. Such a drop, coupled with relatively high West German interest rates, would put further pressure on the dollar.
The West German mark continued to dominate trading, dealers said, noting that the Japanese yen and the British pound lost ground against the mark.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6848 marks on Wednesday. But the dollar gained slightly against the yen, closing at 144.89 yen, up from Wednesday's 144.45 yen.
And the pound closed at $1.6840, up from Wednesday's $1.6791.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.4920 Swiss francs, down from 1.5010; 5.6940 French francs, down from 5.7215; 1,245.75 Italian lire, down from 1,251.75, and 1.1866 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1870.

HEADLINE: Two Media Companies Post Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Gannett Company reported yesterday that its profit rose 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter, and Knight-Ridder Inc. reported a 36 percent increase in net income.
McGraw-Hill Inc. reported a loss of $98.3 million for the quarter as a result of previously disclosed plans to take unusual charges.
Gannett said that despite a weakening economy, its earnings increased partly because of its diverse holdings. 
The Arlington, Va., company, which publishes USA Today and 81 other daily newspapers, said it earned $127.4 million, or 79 cents a share, for the 1989 quarter, compared with $117.8 million, or 73 cents a share, for the 1988 period.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 7 percent, to $968.6 million, from $905.3 million in the 1988 quarter.
For the year, Gannett earned $397.5 million, or $2.47 a share, up 9.3 percent from $364.5 million, or $2.26 a share, for 1988. Operating revenue for 1989 rose 6 percent, to $3.52 billion, from $3.31 billion for 1988.
The company said advertising revenue from USA Today rose 13 percent for the quarter. It did not report earnings results from the newspaper, but Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman, said it had an unspecified loss. She said the newspaper expects to post its first annual profit in 1990.
Shares of Gannett fell 87.5 cents yesterday, to $40,125, on the New York Stock Exchange,
 
Knight-Ridder
Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, said its net income totaled $62 million, or $1.18 a share, up from $45.6 million, or 82 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Earnings from continuing operations rose to $55.1 million, or $1.05 a share, from $42 million, or 76 cents a share.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 5.8 percent, to $607.8 million, from $574.7 million a year earlier.
For the year, the newspaper and information services company said its earnings totaled $247.2 million, or $4.71 a share, up 58 percent from $156.4 million, or $2.76 a share.
Earnings from continuing operations rose to $179.8 million, or $3.43 a share, up from $146.8 million, or $2.59 a share. The 1989 results included a gain of about $30 million from the sale of a Pasadena, Calif., newspaper. The income reflected extraordinary credits of $7 million, or 13 cents a share, for the quarter and $66.9 million, or $1.27 a share, for the year.
Knight-Ridder owns 29 daily newspapers, including The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Detroit Free Press.
Knight-Ridder's shares rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $53.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
McGraw-Hill
McGraw-Hill said its fourth-quarter loss was in contrast to earnings of $55 million, or $1.13 a share, in the comparable period of 1988.
The latest loss reflects a charge of $152 million after taxes, reflecting a realignment of operations, write-downs associated with Data Resources and other units, the shutdown of its general books unit and reserves for severance payments associated with the elimination of more than 1,000 jobs.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8.2 percent, to $518 million, from $479 million for the 1988 quarter.
For the year, McGraw-Hill said it earned $47.8 million, or 98 cents a share, down from $185.5 million, or $3.83 a share, for 1988. Revenue for 1989 rose 6.9 percent, to $1.79 billion, from $1.67 billion for 1988.
McGraw-Hill shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $56.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Bennett Doubts Value of Drug Education

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
William J. Bennett, the nation's drug policy director, raised questions today about the effectiveness of drug education programs and said children were more likely to respond to aggressive law enforcement and assured punishment.
In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bennett rejected the argument espoused by leading Democrats and many outside experts that education was the major solution to the nation's drug problem. He offered an unsparing portrait of young drug abusers as knowing users, not innocent victims.
 
Position Is Challenged
''Should we have drug education programs or should we have tough policy?'' asked Mr. Bennett, who was Secretary of Education in the Administration of Ronald Reagan. ''If I have the choice of only one, I will take policy every time because I know children. And you might say this is not a very romantic view of children, not a very rosy view of children. And I would say, 'You're right.' '' 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of several committee members who challenged Mr. Bennett's position, said: ''I continue to be deeply concerned that the Administration underestimates the importance of treatment and education. We know that education can inoculate children against drug abuse.''
In response, Mr. Bennett asserted: ''I do not agree with Senator Kennedy's statement that you can inoculate children against drug abuse by education. I think that statement is refuted every day of the week. If there were a seminar or course which could inoculate, we would have put it in long ago.''
Acknowledging his very strong feelings on the subject of drug education, Mr. Bennett went on to say that the problem was not a failure to inform children about the drug problem.
''Look,'' he said, ''if ignorance is the problem, knowledge is the cure. I don't believe that for a large number of kids out there who use drugs, that ignorance is the problem.''
Some drug experts argue that there has been too little scientific evaluation of drug education programs to learn their value, and they say the Bush Administration has not provided enough money for such research.
 
Sought a Cut in Funds
Mr. Bennett sought a cut in drug education funds when he was Secretary of Education under Mr. Reagan, and he has sometimes been skeptical about the value of such programs. But his comments today were among his bluntest on the topic. Despite that, the drug plan proposed by President Bush last week called for increased spending on drug education programs.
At one point in his appearance before the committee, Mr. Bennett described drug education as ''a helpful auxiliary,'' but he said a better deterrent would be ''some palpable reason in front of them that something will happen if they take drugs.''
Responding to that, Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, said: ''You, today, have described education as a helpful auxiliary in the battle against drugs. I think it is much more than a helpful auxiliary.''
The debate over drug education came at the first of a series of Congressional hearings on the Bush drug strategy. The hearing was marked by an angry clash between Mr. Bennett and Mr. Kennedy, who criticized the drug chief for failing to advocate the prohibition of semiautomatic pistols favored by drug dealers.
Mr. Kennedy repeatedly pressed Mr. Bennett on why the Administration had not clamped down on importing of semiautomatic pistols. Last year, he noted, Mr. Bennett played a major role in barring the import of many foreign-made semiautomatic assault rifles.
''Has the White House told you to be quiet?'' Mr. Kennedy asked.
''No,'' Mr. Bennett replied sharply.
''Well,'' the Senator said, ''why are you quiet then with regards to these semiautomatic weapons that have all of the fire capability of those which are being banned at the present time?''
 
'Don't Know About Guns'
At one point, an agitated Mr. Bennett conceded, ''I don't know a damn thing about guns.''
In response to Mr. Kennedy's repeated questions, Mr. Bennett replied: ''The world is awash in guns, Senator. This is a cheap symbolic victory you're interested in. It has nothing to do with the real world.''
Mr. Kennedy replied: ''I reject that. You advocated the ban, and now you're saying it's a cheap trick!''
Despite his bitter exchanges with Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bennett's appearance before the Judiciary Committee was relatively cordial. The committee chairman, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who last week released his own drug plan, complimented Mr. Bennett's approach. But he said there needed to be more emphasis on hard-core drug users as well as ridding the Andean nations of their economic dependence on the coca crop from which cocaine is derived and offering more comprehensive drug education.
Mr. Bennett responded that the Administration had proposed more than ever for drug education. The Bush drug plan for the fiscal year 1991 calls for $617 million for drug prevention and treatment programs in the Department of Education, an increase from $562 million this year and $376 million in the fiscal year 1989. By contrast, Mr. Biden has proposed spending $1.135 billion in the fiscal year 1991 for drug education.
While he agreed that sanctions were important, Mr. Biden said that with current spending, no more than 40 percent of the grade school students can be in drug education programs on a regular basis.
''So this isn't arguing about whether we should have the sanction side,'' he said. ''It's a question whether education works at all.''
''Yes, it works some,'' Mr. Bennett replied.
Although he raised doubts about the effectiveness of drug education, Mr. Bennett was unusually optimistic about prospects for progress in fighting drugs.
''The war is by no means over,'' he said, ''but it is clearly winnable.''

HEADLINE: Jackson Asked Help for Donor, U.S. Aides Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson repeatedly sought meetings with Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp last year on behalf of an important Jackson fund-raiser and housing financier whose company has become the subject of an investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, agency officials said today.
The officials said Mr. Jackson pressed Mr. Kemp to meet with A. Bruce Rozet, a California housing investment executive, who was under pressure from H.U.D. to clean up slum conditions. ''There were lots of phone calls; there was a full-court press,'' , a senior H.U.D. official said, as Mr. Jackson sought to help Mr. Rozet clear up mounting problems with two of Mr. Rozet's federally subsidized projects in Tulsa, Okla.
 
Crucial Time for Jackson
On Thursday, H.U.D. suspended the company of which Mr. Rozet is president, the Associated Financial Corporation of California, from future dealings with the housing agency. The agency said the company and affiliates were under investigation for ''irregularities of a serious nature'' involving their operations. 
The details of Mr. Jackson's effort on behalf of Mr. Rozet at H.U.D., which were disclosed today in The Washington Post, came at a crucial time, just as the former Democratic candidiate for President was engaged in deliberations over his political future.
Mr. Jackson left today for South Africa, which last month granted him permission to enter the country for the first time. Mr. Jackson, who hopes his visit will coincide with the release from prison of the jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, is leaving behind a storm of speculation over whether he will run to succeed the District of Columbia's beleaguered Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr. The Federal Election Commission is reviewing Mr. Rozet's role in financing Mr. Jackson's 1988 Presidential campaign. The Post reported today that Mr. Jackson's campaign ''was released from a $30,000 debt'' at a Los Angeles hotel in which Mr. Rozet had an ownership interest and that the Jackson campaign had failed to report this as required by law.
 
Reduction Called a Discount
A Jackson aide, Frank Watkins, said in a statement that the Presidential campaign organization had not taken improper contributions from the hotel, the Hollywood Roosevelt.
Mr. Watkins declined to respond to questions about Mr. Jackson's dealings with the housing department.
Mr. Rozet, in a telephone interview from California, said The Post's account failed to make clear that the $30,000 reduction in the Jackson campaign's hotel bill was actually a discount.
The campaign incurred about $75,000 in bills at the hotel, Mr. Rozet said, but the bill was ultimately settled for $45,000.
The campaign had orginally been charged a full rate but was entitled to a bulk or corporate discount rate in line with the hotel's normal policy for such customers, Mr. Rozet said.
Questions about Mr. Rozet's role as a Jackson fund-raiser arose as Mr. Rozet's troubles increased at H.U.D. Since last summer, department investigators have been examining the agency's relationship with Mr. Rozet's company ''from every angle,'' a senior H.U.D. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 
Nation's Largest
Associated Financial Corporation has headquarters in Santa Monica and is the nation's largest investor in federally subsidized projects for low- and middle-income residents. The company has sold limited partnerships in about 45,000 apartments backed by H.U.D. and manages some of those units through a separate company.
Senior officials of the housing department, all Republican political appointees, confirmed today that Mr. Jackson sought meetings on Mr. Rozet's behalf both in letters and by telephone.
The officials said they were unaware of Mr. Rozet's problems with the housing department until last summer, when Associated Financial's name surfaced in Federal investigations into political abuses of the department's Moderate Rehabilitation program for subsidized properties under Samuel R. Pierce Jr., the Housing Secretary under Ronald Reagan.
Many properties controlled by Associated were enrolled in the program, which was intended to resuscitate low-income projects that had encountered financial problems.
''Jackson kept wanting to come in and meet with him,'' one official said. ''It wasn't until we got into the mod rehab stuff and this name Rozet came up that we said to ourselves, hey, wasn't this the guy Jackson was pushing?''
Mr. Rozet said today that he accompanied Mr. Jackson to one hand-shaking session with Secretary Kemp last spring. But he said he ''never requested Jesse to discuss anything with Kemp'' at that session, and said little if anything while he was there.
 
Asked Tulsa Involvement
He confirmed that he asked Mr. Jackson to become involved in one of the Tulsa apartment projects. Tenants there opposed plans by H.U.D. officials to raze it, he said, and he appealed to Mr. Jackson ''for the tenants' benefit.''
But H.U.D. officials said Mr. Rozet hired an Oklahoma lawyer for the tenants, who then asked H.U.D. to grant new subsidies to Mr. Rozet's company so the apartments could be remodeled.
Mr. Rozet, a 61-year-old Los Angeles resident, has held fund-raising affairs for Mr. Jackson's campaigns and said today that he had also given a birthday party for the candidate.
In 1969, Mr. Rozet resigned the top post of a Beverly Hills conglomerate, the Commonwealth United Corporation, after entering a series of unsuccessful business deals.
 
Barred From Securities Dealing
His next venture, the Income Equities Corporation, sold more than $60 million in subsidized housing tax shelters before being accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission and California regulators. The Federal housing department foreclosed on several of the company's projects in the mid-1970's. Mr. Rozet signed an agreement in 1977 that barred him for life from acting as a broker-dealer of securities.
Mr. Rozet later amassed thousands of units of subsidized housing during Jimmy Carter's Presidency and came under H.U.D. investigation at the time but was not charged with wrongdoing.
The company revived its ties with H.U.D. under the Reagan Administration, when it built its current base of 45,000 units. H.U.D. records show that Mr. Rozet had used the Thomas T. Demery, the Assistant Secretary for Housing at that time, as a reference.
Although Mr. Jackson pressed the President Bush's housing chief, Mr. Kemp, to meet with Mr. Rozet, Mr. Kemp refused, and Mr. Rozet and an aide eventually did meet with the housing department's general counsel, Francis A. Keating, to review the projects.
Mr. Keating said today that he was ''unimpressed'' with their presentation and later ordered H.U.D. to take over the projects.
H.U.D. officials in Oklahoma barred a subsidiary of Mr. Rozet's company from doing business in the state.
Mr. Keating, who said that he visited the projects and that they looked ''like the battle of Verdun,'' added that to his knowledge, Mr. Jackson played no role in arranging his meetings.
 
Role in Hotel Ownership
The hotel involved in the assertions about campaign contributions is owned by a partnership, and a corporation that is half owned by Mr. Rozet has a 2 percent interest in the partnership, Mr. Rozet said. The corporation, one of two general partners, oversees the operation of the hotel. Hotel officials, including John Eleftheriou, the controller, referred questions about the matter today to Mr. Rozet's company.
It is not uncommon for suppliers and campaign organizations to have disputes over billings, and businesses like hotels or telephone companies can provide discounts to campaigns as long as similar discounts are available to other customers, said Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission.
Even if the matter proves to be a violation of Federal regulations, it is unlikely to be judged major by itself. Campaigns often report their tangled finances inaccurately, and violations generally are regarded as serious only when repeated errors or large-scale fraud are discovered.
A statement by Mr. Jackson's Presidential campaign said that the ''committee reaffirms that to the best of its knowledge it has always operated within the spirit and letter of Federal Election laws.''

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column of Business Day on Wednesday, and a correction in this space yesterday referring to it, misstated the measurement by which the 286 computer chip processes data. It does so in bundles of 16 bits, not bytes or characters. A bit is the smallest unit of information; eight bits equal one byte, the minimum necessary in a computer to define a character (like a letter or a number). The more powerful 386 chip processes data in 32-bit bundles.
A front-page article in some copies on Saturday about the Rev. Jesse Jackson and one of his campaign fund-raisers misstated the history of Mr. Jackson's requests for permission to visit South Africa. The error also appeared in an Associated Press report published on Jan. 9 about a proposed visit by Mr. Jackson. South Africa granted Mr. Jackson a visa for a two-week visit in 1979.

Where Ancient Infants Lie, Grave Robbers Thrive

BYLINE: By James Brooke, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHANCAY, Peru

 BODY:
Dressed in safari shorts and a bikini top, the young Italian tourist could barely conceal her disappointment as she stood on a sand dune.
''A baby won't have any necklaces,'' she predicted, watching two Peruvian laborers as they lifted a small cotton-wrapped mummy from its centuries-old resting place.
Indeed, after unwrapping the ancient burial shrouds, the diggers found only the tiny yellowed bones of an Indian child who probably lived in this coastal valley 800 years ago.
''Maybe the next one will have a necklace,'' a grave digger said as his colleagues turned to a more promising spot, leaving the wind to scatter fragments of ancient baby bones across the desert like potato chips. 
 
A Growing Market
Cursed with one of Latin America's lowest standards of living and blessed with one of its richest archeological lodes, Peru has emerged as major center for grave robbery.
The practice, which has existed since the Spaniards arrived seeking gold almost 500 years ago, has gained momentum in recent years with a growing international market for pre-Columbian ceramics.
''The search for treasure in the tombs - for an El Dorado - really started with the Spanish in the 16th century,'' Federico Kauffmann Doig, a leading Peruvian archeologist, said in an interview in Lima, Peru's capital, 40 miles south of here.
''But as the prices of ceramic antiquities have gone up on the international markets, the practice has become widespread.''
In the most famous recent case, grave robbers protected by sentries and working round the clock looted a trove of gold and ceramics from a 1,500-year-old pyramid tomb in Sipan, about 450 miles northwest of here.
 
Appeared in United States
By the time an archeological expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society discovered the theft, in early 1987, the grave robbers had tunneled within three feet of what society experts now call the richest tomb in the Western Hemisphere: dozens of finely crafted jewelry pieces and more than 1,200 ceramic vessels with painted scenes of the Moche people, who lived along the desert coast about 1,500 years ago.
Since then, however, pieces from the Sipan tomb and from the Moche culture have appeared in the United States. Last June, David Rand Swetnam, a California dealer in Peruvian pre-Columbian antiquities, was convicted in a Federal court of fraudulent customs declarations and sentenced to six months in jail.
The United States signed a United Nations convention banning the international transfer of cultural property. In addition, the Peruvian authorities hope that President Bush will shortly sign an emergency measure banning the import of looted Sipan artifacts.
To encourage American collectors to return Peru's antiquities, a six-room museum of pre-Columbian textiles, ceramics and jewelry will open this April in the residence of Peru's Ambassador in Washington.
 
Seeking Lost Treasures
''It will be an instrument for the recuperation of lost treasures,'' Cesar G. Atala, the Ambassador, said of the new Peruvian Cultural Center.
The trail starts in places like this small down-at-the-heels coastal city, a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Lima on the Pan American Highway. Most residents derive their income, maybe $800 a year, from offshore Pacific currents, rich in fish.
Some residents grow corn, cotton and flowers on fertile river valleys, which have been a source of sustenance for millenniums. Others turn to the Lauri desert valley, mining the ancient Indian tombs as if they were a God-given natural resource.
Grave robbing has become so common that the practice has entered the vocabulary of Spanish spoken here. From the Quechua word ''huaca,'' or ''holy burial site,'' Peruvians now call ancient ceramics ''huacos.'' A grave robber is a ''huaquero.''
 
'Cordless Mummy Detector'
''This is my cordless mummy detector,'' a local huaquero said before throwing his weight on the wooden handle of a five-foot-long iron rod, pushing it deep into fine sand. ''When it hits hollow, it's a tomb.'' The rods frequently pierce ceramic pots, but the prospectors find that the system is more rewarding than the painstaking approach of professional archeologists. Working the outer edge of the valley, which has become pockmarked from digging, the team of four prospectors found three graves in six hours.
Local residents cannot remember when rain last fell in the desert. Consequently, freshly opened tombs often reveal remarkably well preserved textiles, tree leaves and human hair.
 
Swallowed Up by Incas
''The fabrics are conserved as if they were woven yesterday,'' said Francisco Iriarte Brenner, a Peruvian archeologist who excavated in the Chancay area in the 1960's.
Dating from 1200 to 1400 A.D., the graves are of a people who were later swallowed up by the Inca Empire. Chancay pieces are to be displayed in Peru's new Museum of the Nation, which is to open in Lima this spring.
''Today, the huaqueros practice archeology as if it were a sport,'' Mr. Iriarte said. ''Each tomb is like a sheet of paper in a history book. Once it is torn out, it cannot be replaced.''
In the past, the police regularly broke up antiquities markets that the huaqueros held every weekend at the edge of the expanse of tombs here. But in recent years, the police have been stretched thin to fight the rising threat from leftist guerrillas.
 
Tourism Has Dropped
''You would need two Peruvian armies to protect all our sites,'' said Mr. Iriarte, general director of patrimony at the National Institute of Culture, the state committee that has the legal responsibility for registering all pre-Columbian antiquities to prevent their export. ''It's like cocaine - if there were no buyers, there would be no huaqueros.''
Tourism has dropped here in recent years, meaning that there are fewer buyers in Peru for the antiquities.
''The terrorism has destroyed tourism here,'' a huaquero said.
The main guerrilla group, the Shining Path, is a highly violent movement marked by a deep streak of xenophobia. Recruiting largely from impoverished Indian and mixed race Peruvians, Shining Path leaders charge that outsiders have not respected Peru's indigenous culture.

HEADLINE: South Africa's New Era;
Excerpts From Address By de Klerk on Change

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an address by President F. W. de Klerk today before the South African Parliament, as provided by the South African Consulate in New York. The official Government translation was used for portions of the speech that were delivered in Afrikaans.
The general election on Sept. 6, 1989, placed our country irrevocably on the road of drastic change. Underlying this is the growing realization by an increasing number of South Africans that only a negotiated understanding among the representative leaders of the entire population is able to insure lasting peace.
The alternative is growing violence, tension and conflict. That is unacceptable and in nobody's interest. The well-being of all in this country is linked inextricably to the ability of the leaders to come to terms with one another on a new dispensation. No one can escape this simple truth. On its part, the Government will accord the process of negotiation the highest priority. The aim is a totally new and just constitutional dispensation in which every inhabitant will enjoy equal rights, treatment and opportunity in every sphere of endeavor - constitutional, social and economic. ... 
 
Relating to the World
The Government is prepared to enter into discussions with other southern African countries with the aim of formulating a realistic development plan. The Government believes that the obstacles in the way of a conference of southern African states have now been removed sufficiently.
The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.
Recently there have, indeed, been unusually positive results in South Africa's contacts and relations with other African states. During my visits to their countries I was received cordially, both in private and in public, by Presidents Mobutu, Chissano, Houphouet-Boigny and Kaunda. These leaders expressed their sincere concern about the serious economic problems in our part of the world. They agreed that South Africa could and should play a positive part in regional co-operation and development. ...
 
Limiting Death Penalty
The Government decided . . . that the death penalty should be limited as an option of sentence to extreme cases, and specifically through broadening judicial discretion in the imposition of sentence; and that an automatic right of appeal be granted to those under sentence of death.
Should these proposals be adopted, they should have a significant influence on the imposition of death sentences on the one hand, and on the other should insure that every case in which a person has been sentenced to death will come to the attention of the Appellate Division.
These proposals require that everybody currently awaiting execution be accorded the benefit of the proposed new approach. Therefore all executions have been suspended and no executions will take place until Parliament has taken a final decision on the new proposals. In the event of the proposals being adopted, the case of every person involved will be dealt with in accordance with the new guidelines. ...
 
Committing to Talks
I committed the Government during my inauguration to giving active attention to the most important obstacles in the way of negotiation. Today I am able to announce far-reaching decisions in this connection. ...
The steps that have been decided are the following:
The prohibition of the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party and a number of subsidiary organizations is being rescinded.
People serving prison sentences merely because they were members of one of these organizations or because they committed another offense which was merely an offense because prohibition on one of the organizations was in force will be identified and released. Prisoners who have been sentenced for other offenses such as murder, terrorism or arson are not affected by this.
The media emergency regulations as well as the education emergency regulations are being abolished in their entirety.
The security emergency regulations will be amended to still make provision for effective control over visual material pertaining to scenes of unrest.
The restrictions in terms of the emergency regulations on 33 organizations are being rescinded. The organizations include the following: National Education Crisis Committee, South African National Students Congress, United Democratic Front, Cosatu, Die Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging van Suid-Afrika.
The conditions imposed in terms of the security emergency regulations on 374 people on their release are being rescinded and the regulations which provide for such conditions are being abolished.
The period of detention in terms of the security emergency regulations will be limited henceforth to six months. Detainees also acquire the right to legal representation and a medical practitioner of their own choosing. ...
On the state of emergency I have been advised that an emergency situation, which justifies these special measures which have been retained, still exists. . . .
It is my intention to terminate the state of emergency completely as soon as circumstances justify it and I request the co-operation of everybody toward this end. ...
 
Releasing Mandela
With the steps the Government has taken, it has proven its good faith and the table is laid for sensible leaders to begin talking about a new dispensation, to reach an understanding by the way of dialogue and discussion.
The agenda is open and the overall aims to which we are aspiring should be acceptable to all reasonable South Africans.
Among other things, those aims include a new, democratic constitution; universal franchise; no domination; equality before an independent judiciary; the protection of minorities as well as of individual rights; freedom of religion; a sound economy based on proven economic principles and private enterprise; dynamic programs directed at better education, health services, housing and social conditions for all.
In this connection Mr. Nelson Mandela could play an important part. The Government has noted that he has declared himself to be willing to make a constructive contribution to the peaceful political process in South Africa.
I wish to put it plainly that the Government has taken a firm decision to release Mr. Mandela unconditionally. I am serious about bringing this matter to finality without delay. The Government will take a decision soon on the date of his release. Unfortunately, a further short passage of time is unavoidable.
Today's announcements, in particular, go to the heart of what black leaders - also Mr. Mandela - have been advancing over the years as their reason for having resorted to violence. The allegation has been that the Government did not wish to talk to them and that they were deprived or their right to normal political activity by the prohibition of their organizations.
Without conceding that violence has ever been justified, I wish to say today to those who argued in this manner:
The Government wishes to talk to all leaders who seek peace. The unconditional lifting of the prohibition on the said organizations places everybody in a position to pursue politics freely. The justification for violence which was always advanced no longer exists.
These facts place everybody in South Africa before a fait accompli. On the basis of numerous previous statements there is no longer any reasonable excuse for the continuation of violence. The time for talking has arrived and whoever still makes excuses does not really wish to talk.
Therefore, I repeat my invitation with greater conviction than ever: Walk through the open door, take your place at the negotiating table together with the Government and other leaders who have important power bases inside and outside of Parliament.
Henceforth, everybody's political points of view will be tested against their realism, their workability and their fairness. The time for negotiation has arrived.

HEADLINE: SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA;
BUSH WOULD WEIGH EASING SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 2

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would consider a relaxation of American sanctions against South Africa provided that the Pretoria Government follows through on promises to free Nelson Mandela and remove restrictions on the black population.
''I think when people move in the right direction, it's certainly timely to review all policy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But we haven't gotten into any specifics on that at this point. I mean, we want to see the policy initiatives go forward, and the release of Mandela. But I think everybody's viewing it now as positive.'' 
The President made his remarks to reporters as his plane took off from Andrews Air Force Base this morning. Mr. Bush spent the day visiting university laboratories in Raleigh, N.C., and Knoxville. The trip was meant to highlight the Administration's interest in competitiveness and technology.
Democrats in Congress have been pushing for tougher sanctions against South Africa and are unlikely to accept relaxation of the existing restrictions on trade and investment unless the South African President, F. W. de Klerk, takes further steps to dismantle apartheid in the very near future.
 
Sanctions Date to 1986
The sanctions were written into law in 1986, when Congress approved them over President Reagan's veto. In the 1988 Presidential campaign, Mr. Bush defended Mr. Reagan's position, saying, ''The political and economic effects of the sanctions have been marginal to negative.'' Today he said: ''I am one who has not favored additional sanctions, and so I'm perfectly willing to review things as new developments take place.
''I'm sure that we'll have a lot of debate and discussion inside the Administration as to what the next move by the United States ought to be.''
The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said the steps announced today by Mr. de Klerk were ''positive signs of change in South Africa.''
''I commend President de Klerk for his statement that negotiations are the only route toward a lasting peace,'' the Maine Democrat said. ''While the legal pillars of apartheid remain firmly in place, it is my hope that President de Klerk's speech represents a true first step toweard meaningful negotiations.''
 
Disappointment on Prisoners
Representative Howard Wolpe, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, also welcomed Mr. de Klerk's speech. He said it would improve the climate for negotiations in South Africa.
But Mr. Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat, expressed disappointment that at least 1,000 political prisoners would remain in detention. He also said it was unfortunate that Mr. de Klerk was retaining ''major elements'' of the state of emergency declared in 1986.
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Wolpe both said South Africa had not satisfied the statutory conditions for repeal of the American sanctions. Under the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, sanctions will terminate if Pretoria releases all political prisoners, ends rule by emergency decree, lifts the ban on leading anti-apartheid groups, ends residential segregation laws and agrees to enter ''good-faith negotiations'' with South African blacks.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The Germanys;
Baker and West German Envoy Discuss Reunification Issues

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
With the momentum seeming to build for unification of the two Germanys, the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, met today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to coordinate positions on the German question before Mr. Baker meets with Soviet officials next week.
After their two hours of talks Mr. Genscher said tonight that he and Mr. Baker agreed that a unified Germany would have to continue to be aligned with NATO, but that no NATO troops would be extended into what is now East Germany.
''We were in full agreement that there is no interest to extend the NATO area of defense and security toward the East,'' Mr. Genscher said as Mr. Baker stood by his side.
Mr. Genscher's meeting with Secretary Baker reflects the speed with which the German unification issue is evolving now that East Germany's Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, after meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has proposed a reunited German state, provided that it is neutral. That proposal, made on Thursday, has already drawn a cool response from Bonn and Washington. 
And today the Soviet leaders, perhaps worried that the drive for unification is proceeding too quickly, proposed an international referendum on the issue by the World War II Allies.
Administration officials are concerned that with East German elections set for March 18, East Germany will soon have a democratically elected government that will almost certainly begin seeking unification. They want to be certain that West German policies are meshing with their own.
 
'Faster Than We Anticipated'
One Administration policy maker said: ''Obviously things have started moving faster than we anticipated last November, when everyone was talking about a measured pace. History just didn't give us that. It looks like we're heading down the fast track. We had hoped to see deeper economic and political integration of West Germany within the European Community before all this happened, but that just is not going to be.''
Administration officials are not taking a public position on the form of German unity, in part because they still have no consensus and in part because they do not want to get ahead of the East German elections, or appear to be imposing a blueprint before the German people themselves have voted.
Nevertheless, Administration officials say they are are looking closely -and, it appears, quite sympathetically - at Mr. Genscher's latest unification proposal, which aims at countering Mr. Modrow's plan for a ''united fatherland,'' governed from Berlin but removed from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Mr. Genscher has suggested that a reunited Germany would remain a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but that the territory of East Germany would not be drawn into the Western alliance's military structure. In that East German territory, where the Soviets currently have 390,000 troops, Moscow would be able to continue its military presence.
 
Reunited but Still in NATO
Mr. Genscher's proposal, though, envisions much lower levels of both Soviet and American troops and suggests that they would engage in regular confidence-building exchanges.
While not endorsing the Genscher proposal, Administration officials acknowledge that the idea would take into account the security concerns of both the Soviets and Germany's other neighbors. It would also strengthen the ability of a new Germany to remain in NATO.
''The problem,'' said one State Department official, ''is that the plan sounds great on paper but how do you actually get it implemented - especially when you are dealing with a nervous and potentially unstable Soviet Union?''
Regarding Mr. Baker's trip next Wednesday to Moscow, the State Department announced today that the Secretary had been invited to testify before the International Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet on Feb. 10. It will be the first time an American official has ever testified before a committee of the Soviet Parliament.

HEADLINE: BUSH APPOINTS 13 TO SCIENCE PANEL

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 2

 BODY:
President Bush, citing the challenge posed by foreign technological competition, today appointed the 13 scientists and engineers who will make up his long-promised President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.
The council, which Mr. Bush vowed to create in a campaign speech two years ago, will report directly to him and is intended to function on the same high level as, for example, the Council of Economic Advisers.
Chosen as its chairman was D. Allan Bromley, who was already serving as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. 
The appointments came on a day when Mr. Bush flew to university laboratories here and in Raleigh, N.C., to highlight the Administration's hopes for enhancing national technological performance.
In Raleigh, at North Carolina State University's Surface Science Laboratory, Mr. Bush said: ''Competiveness. Education. We've got to keep our competitive edge. It all boils down to that.''
 
U.S. as 'the Defending Champion'
Later, in a speech before students at the University of Tennessee, where he toured the school's Environmental Biotechnology Program, Mr. Bush mused that ''some wonder if America has lost its competitive edge.''
Citing Japan's launching of a lunar rocket last week, the President noted that ''they forget that 26 years ago today - long before you were born - America's Ranger 6 landed on the moon.''
''The United States is the defending world champion,'' he added. ''But we have to defend our title day by day, week by week, year in and year out.''
In his budget for the 1991 fiscal year, sent to Congress this week, Mr. Bush proposed $71 billion for research and development, an increase of $4.5 billion over the 1990 level.
Science policy experts in Washington noted that with his new council, Mr. Bush has now raised science policy advice to the highest level since the Kennedy Administration. But they said it remained to be seen whether the new advisers would have any real influence on policy matters.
The President is to meet with the council for the first time at Camp David this weekend.
In addition to Mr. Bromley, the members are:
 
Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, a Nobel laureate and professor of agriculture at Texas A & M University.
 
Dr. Solomon J. Buchsbaum, senior vice president for technology systems at Bell Laboratories.
 
Dr. Charles L. Drake, a professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth University.
 
Dr. Ralph E. Gomory, President of the Sloan Foundation, and formerly vice president for science and technology at I.B.M.
 
Dr. Bernadine Healy, a cardiologist of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
 
Dr. Peter W. Likins, an engineer and president of Lehigh University.
 
Dr. Thomas E. Lovejoy, a conservation biologist and assistant secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution.
 
Dr. Walter E. Massey, a physicist and vice president of the University of Chicago.
 
Dr. John P. McTague, a physicist and vice president of research for Ford Motor Company.
 
Dr. Daniel Nathans, a Nobel laureate and molecular biologist at the Johns Hopkins Medical School.
 
Dr. David Packard, an engineer and chairman of the board of Hewlett-Packard Company.
 
Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, an economist and president of Princeton University.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports a Slight Decrease in the Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Aided by exceptionally mild weather, job growth quickened in January and the unemployment rate edged down one-tenth of a point to 5.2 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
Combined with some other recent data, this first broad look at economic performance last month suggested that the seven-year business expansion is intact despite a persistently weak manufacturing sector.
The Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that she saw ''no evidence'' in the employment figures to signal recession. The only signficant job losses, she said, were in automobile production, and many of these workers have already returned to work at plants that have reopened after temporary shutdowns. 
 
Jobs Increase of 275,000
The number of jobs, as determined by the department's monthly survey of business payrolls, increased by 275,000 in January, considerably more than expected.
In all, according to the department's survey of households, which is separate from the payroll survey, 119,560,000 Americans had jobs last month - 117,863,000 civilians and 1,697,000 domestically stationed members of the armed forces. The unemployed numbered 6,535,000 people, for a jobless rate of 5.2 percent. The unemployment rate for civilians alone was unchanged, at 5.3 percent.
The initial reaction to this news in financial markets was that the economy might be rebounding so smartly from a fourth-quarter growth rate of just five-tenths of 1 percent that further cuts in interest rates were unlikely. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, contended that the chance of near-term recession had waned to 10 or 20 percent. Next week, the Federal Reserve is to hold a key strategy-setting meeting.
On closer inspection, however, the employment figures are considerably less robust.
About 80 percent of the increase was accounted for by unusual surges in construction and retail trade. Construction benefited from unseasonably warm weather and retailing from a post-Christmas decline that was less than normal, apparently because fewer salespeople were hired for the holidays. Construction gained 104,000 jobs last month and retailing gained 117,000; the changes were greater than those the department normally takes account of in its adjustments for winter weather and post-holiday slumps.
 
Auto Jobs Off by 90,000
This was partly offset by a drop of 90,000 automobile-manufacturing jobs that spilled over into fabricated metals, rubber and other related industries. The fact that many of these people have already gone back to work mitigated fears that might have been set off by a 112,000 decline in overall factory jobs, the 10th monthly decline in a row.
Another bit of reassurance came from the department's diffusion index, which registers the percentage of industries increasing employment. Last month, 59.5 percent of 349 industries were increasing jobs, up from 52.6 percent in December. For 141 manufacturing industries, there was a rise to 48.2 percent from 45.7 percent.
Nonetheless, some analysts remained concerned, especially about manufacturing. Akira Akiyama, chief economist at Sanwa Bank, described the January figures as ''worse than expected'' and predicted the Federal Reserve would move to cut the overnight interest rate one-quarter of a point by month's end. But while the data reflect what he called a ''weakening economy,'' Mr. Akiyama said a recession was not in sight.
Rudy Oswald, director of economic research for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., agreed that weakness was largely confined to manufacturing while most other sectors ''show continued growth'' in employment.
 
Gains in Service Employment
Once again, it was services that provided the job gains, with 50,000 added in health, 25,000 each in transportation and wholesale trade and 10,000 in finance, insurance and real estate in addition to the gain in retail trade.
The total of 282,000 new service jobs, however, was slightly offset by a loss of 7,000 goods-producing jobs.
A month ago, jobs for December were estimated to have climbed 142,000, as measured by the survey of businesses, but this has now been revised to a gain of 96,000.
Meanwhile, the survey of households, on which the overall jobless rate is calculated, showed few significant changes as the labor force, people with jobs or actively seeking them, fell 152,000 while employment fell 28,000. This cut the ranks of the jobless by 124,000, to 6,535,000.
At 5.2 percent, the overall unemployment rate has returned to the level of September and October after edging up to 5.3 percent for November and December. The Labor Department considers monthly changes of less than two-tenths of a point statistically insignificant.
The number of people working part time because they could not find full-time jobs rose 180,000 last month to 5 million, the report showed. A year ago, the number of partly unemployed was 5.1 million.

HEADLINE: It's Time That Winds of Change Reached India

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Violent Protests Growing in Kashmir'' (news article, Jan. 10) and ''A Vale of Tears and Anger: Anti-Indian Militancy Is on the Rise in Kashmir'' (news article, Jan. 14), regarding Pakistan's ''alleged involvement'' in Punjab and Kashmir, tell only part of the story. More than a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, the problems of Punjab and Kashmir have important human dimensions. The Muslims of Kashmir, approximately 76 percent of the state's population, and the Sikhs, who make up 70 percent of Punjab, have been struggling for freedom, an inalienable human right enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Punjab and Kashmir were integral parts of the Sikh Commonwealth, which was annexed by the British in 1848. Their independence would usher in an era of a South Asian commonwealth of free nations, replacing the imperial systems that India and Pakistan inherited from British colonialism in 1947. Those systems have been reinforced with lethal military machines, which consume scarce economic resources of the subcontinent and unleash massacres.
Pakistan used brute force attempting to crush Bengali nationalism in 1971, but failed. India is repeating the attempt in the Punjab and Kashmir. If the winds of freedom could shatter the Berlin Wall and rock the foundations of the Soviet Empire, the imperial systems of the subcontinent - more brutal than British colonialism - are not likely to last out the 20th century.
The Western news media and academia can help a great deal to prevent genocide in the subcontinent. South Asians have experienced a series of bloodbaths - the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the two Kashmir wars in 1947-48 and 1965, the Bangladesh war in 1971, the massacres in Nagaland, Punjab, Assam, Kashmir and Sri Lanka, to mention a few.
It is time for the ruling establishments of India and Pakistan to stop this insane military response to national aspirations in the subcontinent. They should learn from Mikhail S. Gorbachev and understand that the era of colonial empires and dynastic rules is coming to an end along with the 20th century. We have a golden opportunity to enter into the 21st century as free nations, respecting one another's rights to fundamental freedoms and human dignity. True, idealism is easier said than done, but cynicism provides no hope for the future of humanity.

The political crisis in Kashmir, a strategically situated region that shares borders with India, Pakistan and China, must be of concern to all who care about human rights and freedom. In the last month alone, more than 30 civilians are reported killed, hundreds are in jail, most cities and towns are under curfew.
In 1947, when India became independent from British rule, it made a commitment to the people of Kashmir for a United Nations-supervised plebiscite. Before Kashmir's annexation by India, it was a princely state with a majority Muslim population ruled by a Hindu king under the protection of British colonial rule. The Kashmir issue has been debated in the United Nations many times. India and Pakistan have fought wars over the territory. In the United Nations, though all parties to the dispute agreed to a plebiscite, it never took place. Instead a United Nations observer force and about 50,000 Indian troops are stationed in Kashmir, much against the will of the people. 
India, the largest democracy in the world, continues to govern Kashmir undemocratically. Free elections do not take place in Kashmir; leaders and governments have been created and removed by India without regard for the popular will. Kashmir, once a breadbasket for the neighboring areas, is now a net importer of consumer and agricultural products. The real economic base of the area has not expanded.
What has expanded is the depth and breadth of corruption and nepotism. Whenever a voice is raised against such governance, it is dubbed traitorous, separatist and fundamentalist. The Government of India, and some in the news media, continue to portray the events in Kashmir as an uprising of religious forces against secular India.
India has a moral obligation, which it must fulfill, toward the Kashmiris. We must urge the United States Government to take steps to insure that pledges made by responsible governments in a world forum are honored. Kashmiris must have their human rights, beginning with free and fair elections.

The Economy
 The nation's unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a point, to 5.2 percent, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment rate for civilians alone was unchanged, at 5.3 percent. Business payrolls jumped 275,000 in January, considerably more than expected.
About 80 percent of the increase was accounted for by unusual surges in construction and retail trade. Construction gained 104,000 jobs last month and retailing gained 117,000. This was partly offset by a drop of 90,000 in automobile manufacturing jobs. [Page 13.] Factory orders posted a second straight increase in December, rising 1.9 percent because of a surge in orders for civilian aircraft, the Commerce Department said. [41.]

HEADLINE: Chrysler Workers Skeptical On Detroit Plant's Last Day

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation shut the doors of its crumbling downtown Jefferson Avenue assembly plant for the last time today, amid an atmosphere of uncertainty among laid-off auto workers. The 3,500 workers are awaiting completion of a factory less than a mile from the old one, and many hope to get jobs there.
Until recently, many of the workers at the Jefferson Avenue factory, which was built in 1907, had expected to continue on the job until the new plant opens in late 1991 and then move to fill the roughly 2,500 job openings there.
But the subcompact Omni and Horizon cars, built for a short while in the old plant, have sold poorly during the last year. And Chrysler served notice that it would no longer continue to produce what it could not sell. 
Last week, representatives of the United Automobile Workers made a final plea to Chrysler managers to let them help search for a way to revive the subcompact sales, but to no avail. The Omni and Horizon design is 12 years old, and most analysts regard it as technologically outmoded.
Now, faced with the reality of 18 months and possibly longer without a job, many workers are wondering whether the new $1 billion assembly plant will ever provide significant employment, even though Chrysler insists it will begin assembling a new line of utility vehicles by 1992.
One reason for worker skepticism is that Chrysler's future has been clouded recently by slow sales and plunging profits. The sales slump, to be sure, is an industrywide problem. But its impact is magnified at Chrysler, because it is weaker financially than its principal domestic rivals, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company.
Chrysler's latest troubles, reflected in Thursday's announcement of a permanent shutdown of a car plant in Fenton, Mo., only deepen the gloom among Jefferson Avenue workers. The experienced work force, accustomed to Detroit's streamlining, tends to be skeptical that there will be jobs for them in the new plant.
''With 23 years of seniority I don't think they're going to want us,'' said Tony Young, who is 44 years old. ''They think we're too set in our ways. Right now, though, I can't take a pay cut. I'm going to school and I'm going to wait'' for the new plant to open. Mr. Young, who has been laid off for a year, collecting about 95 percent of his pay as unemployment benefits, said he earned about $30,000 annually.
Chrysler officials insist that doubts about the the company's future are exaggerated. Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive, begins a six-city national tour on Feb. 21 to meet with analysts, dealers, suppliers and others in an effort to ''show there is a bright future full of innovative products,'' a spokesman said.
The Jefferson Avenue work force has a great emotional, as well as financial stake, in seeing the company and the new plant thrive, said Charles Ryan, 64, vice president of U.A.W. Local 7. ''Chrysler wouldn't have survived in 1980 without the U.A.W. working to secure the loan guarantee,'' he said. ''I spent 38 years here, the best part of my life, and I want to see the plant through to make sure it's built in the city, not in some cornfield in Ohio or Kentucky.''
 
Japanese Methods
 In recent years, Japanese auto makers have opened plants in this country, called transplants, that have hired younger, nonunion work forces and located in rural areas of the Midwest. The transplants have used production systems similar to those used in Japan, which stress worker involvement in decisions concerning quality control, productivity and business issues such as parts design.
Following in the footsteps of the Japanese, Chrysler workers at Jefferson Avenue for the last few years have been introduced to innovative work-place practices, such as more exacting quality-control procedures and the elimination of restrictive work rules. But all too often, some workers said, Chrysler supervisors have continued to stress speed and meeting production goals at the expense of quality.
''They say they want everything to be right, but if you stop the line to fix it you're fired,'' said Ted Grant, an assembler with 20 years' experience.
With the closing of Jefferson Avenue, only one car plant remains in the city of Detroit - the Hamtramck assembly plant operated by G.M.

HEADLINE: Bass-Owned California Unit Has Big Profit

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The once-troubled American Savings Bank today reported a large profit for 1989. The California savings and loan institution was acquired by the Robert M. Bass Group just over a year ago in one of the Government's biggest bailout deals.
American Savings said it earned $214.2 million for the year, giving the Bass group a healthy return on its $400 million investment.
The results provided fresh evidence of the improving business climate for savings institutions that have emerged in good health, by dint of Government rescues or superior management, from the industry's crisis. 
But American's profits are also likely to provoke renewed complaints in Congress that regulators gave away too much in selling a number of troubled institutions in California, Texas and other states in late 1988.
The Bass group acquired American Savings at that time by putting $350 million into the institution as fresh capital and spending another $50 million in acquisition costs. In return, the Government stripped the bank of nearly all of its troubled assets and provided tax concessions.
As part of the deal, the Government effectively retained a 30 percent stake, allowing it to share in any earnings or in profits from any eventual sale of the institution. At the time of the deal, the Government estimated its aid to American Savings at $1.7 billion.
The profits of American Savings are not actually being distributed to the Bass group or the Government. Instead, the company is retaining most of its earnings to add to its base of capital, which is its cash buffer against losses. Some of the earnings will be set aside for the Government under an arrangement that frees American Savings, which must report its profits to the Government each year, from paying Federal taxes but requires it to make payments to an arm of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Before the acquisition, the institution, then known as the American Savings and Loan Association, was the nation's largest troubled savings unit. It had a huge portfolio of foreclosed real estate and billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities that were worth less than they cost.
Healthy institutions are now able to attract deposits at lower interest rates than in previous years as public confidence in their financial strength and in the Government's insurance fund slowly returns since tougher regulations were imposed. The takeover of hundreds of insolvent institutions has also reduced competition.
American Savings finished the year with $16.3 billion in assets, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Mario J. Antoci, chairman and chief executive of American Savings, attributed the strong earnings to the sharp drop in interest rates the institution must pay to attract deposits and to deep cuts in operating expenses. The results were also helped by falling interest rates last year that allowed the company to sell many of its loans at a profit.
 
'Junk Bond' Setback
 But the gains were partly offset by an ill-timed program to buy $500 million worth of high-yield ''junk bonds.'' After the purchases last spring, before Federal legislation barred such investments, the market dropped sharply and a number of the bonds' issuers had trouble paying interest. American Savings set aside $65 million for possible losses and was forced to write down the value of its holdings by $100 million.
Of the $214 million in profits, about $53 million came from gains on sales of loans. In a telephone interview, Mr. Antoci said the company sold most of its fixed-rate mortgages, which had exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk, and replaced them with adjustable-rate mortgages, which are less risky.
Mr. Antoci said the company had reduced the rate it pays for deposits to the same level as the state's healthiest savings units. Before the Bass deal, American Savings, like other troubled institutions, had been forced to offer more for its deposits than its healthy competitors.
Mr. Antoci said that reducing its interest rates to depositors had caused significant net reductions in deposits last year but that the situation was now stabilizing.
 
Lower Operating Expenses
Mr. Antoci, who was hired away by the Bass group from Home Savings of America, the nation's largest savings institution and one considered among the best managed, said American Savings had reduced its operating expenses by consolidating duplicate functions into single offices and cutting personnel.
Expenses as a percentage of total assets, he said, declined to 1.82 percent, from 2.23 percent a year earlier.
After accounting for the profits it made last year, American Savings now has enough capital to meet all three tests of financial strength mandated by the industry bailout legislation signed by President Bush in August.

HEADLINE: Ohio Bank Buys Unit In Texas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Bright Banc Savings Association, one of the largest troubled savings institutions controlled by Federal regulators, was acquired today by the Banc One Corporation of Ohio, regulators announced late today. The deal is expected to cost the Government $1.4 billion.
The addition of Bright Banc would give Banc One's Texas unit $11 billion in assets, strengthening its fourth-place position in Texas banking, behind top-ranked NCNB Texas, Texas Commerce Bancshares, which is No. 2, and the First City Bancorporation of Texas.
Bright Banc, once a giant with more than $5 billion in assets, was controlled by H. R. (Bum) Bright, the former majority owner of the Dallas Cowboys, until it became insolvent a year ago and was taken over by the Government. 
In the deal announced today, Banc One agreed to pay $45 million in cash for $1.7 billion of Bright's assets. It will assume all $2.7 billion of Bright's deposits and other assets, which include 48 branches, mainly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
 
Federal Agency Involved
 The Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency dealing with insolvent savings institutions, agreed to advance $1.1 billion to Banc One's Texas unit, called Bank One, Texas. The agency will also keep $1.4 billion of Bright Banc's troubled assets.
In a similar deal, NCNB Texas agreed last October to pay $129 million in cash to acquire $3.5 billion in deposits from University Federal Savings in Houston, and assume $750 million in assets.
That transaction gave NCNB the option to return to the Federal agency any assets in the $750 million portfolio that NCNB considered too risky to own. In fact, NCNB handed back most of the properties.
In the Bright Banc deal, Banc One accepted a review period of 45 days that limits its option to return undesirable properties.
Steven Katsanos, a spokesman for the trust agency, said Banc One was able to accept a more limited option to return assets because it and other bidders had more time to analyze the loan portfolio at Bright Banc than bidders had in the auction for University Federal.
Protection from acquiring bad assets is important to bidders like NCNB and Banc One. The companies relied on large sales of their common shares to help finance their expansion into Texas, and they want to assure investors that they have not assumed huge new risks in adding to their deposit base and retail network, said Frank W. Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., in Little Rock, Ark.
 
A Special Procedure
 Bright Banc is one of the largest institutions the Resolution Trust agency has sold using its ''clean bank'' procedure, in which troubled assets are retained by the regulators for sale to private bidders.
Mr. Bright, a devoted believer in the Texas economy, formed Bright Banc through the merger of Dalllas Federal Savings and Loan and Texas Federal Savings late in 1985. Before the deal was completed, loan losses mounted and oil prices plunged, but Mr. Bright did not withdraw.
 
Powerful Ohio Bank
 Banc One, a strong regional banking company based in Columbus, Ohio, had assets of $26.6 billion at the end of 1989. Today's transaction is the second deal within the last year in which it has acquired a large Texas financial institution that had been brought to its knees by mounting losses on real estate loans.
Last June, Banc One acquired 20 banks controlled by Mcorp, then a large Dallas-based banking company. The deal gave Banc One the fourth-largest banking network in the state, with $13.1 billion in assets, and a pledge of an estimated $2 billion in Government aid.
Under the ''clean bank'' procedure, Banc One's Texas operation has transferred more than $2 billion in troubled loans to a separate subsidiary, with collections managed by it but losses covered by the Government. Such loans are not counted among the assets of Bank One, Texas.
Robert D. Rieke, an analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., a brokerage in Dallas, said that other bidders for Bright Banc included NCNB Texas; First Gibraltar Bank; a group headed by Lewis Ranieri, chairman of United Savings in Houston, and Citicorp.
 
Plans for Expansion
 John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive of Banc One, said, ''This acquisition will allow us to expand our retail distribution system immediately, which is a primary objective.''
In addition to the 48 branches, Banc One acquired a loan portfolio that includes $900 million of residential mortgages; $659 million in cash and securities; $145 million in consumer loans to 15,000 customers, and $20 million in various assets.
Some analysts have said that the Government should encourage bidders to acquire troubled assets, even though it would mean committing bilions of additional taxpayer funds, because private owners have proved more adept at selling depressed properties than the Government.
Paul M. Horvitz, a finance professor at the University of Houston, said such actions by Resolution Trust could eventually save taxpayers more money than the agency's plan to sell what analysts estimate will eventually amount to $300 billion in problem assets.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Planning Now For '90 Taxes

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
As taxpayers go over their financial records in this tax season, they should see what changes they can make in their personal finances to reduce their tax bill a year from now.
''Don't wait until the end of the year to do tax planning,'' said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of Price Waterhouse's Consumer Financial Institute, ''because opportunities will slip by you.'' He cited five areas where, he said, many taxpayers should focus their attention immediately.
Children. ''If you have kids over 14, consider transferring money to them'' to be used for their college educations, he said. If assets are put in the names of children under age 14, the first $500 is tax-free and the next $500 is taxed at 15 percent -meaning there is a total tax of only $75 on the first $1,000 of income - but anything over that is taxed at the parents' marginal rate, usually 28 percent or 33 percent. 
Once the child becomes 14, however, any interest, dividends or capital gains are taxed at the child's rate, rather than the parents', generally meaning college funds can accumulate with a lower tax bite. There is one important caveat: Children have legal control over assets in their names. So transfers should be made only to responsible children.
Alternative Minimum Tax. ''There are more and more surprises here,'' Mr. Barbee said. ''Even middle-income people'' are finding themselves subject to the A.M.T. since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 narrowed the spread between the A.M.T. rate of 21 percent and the top regular tax rate, he said. Particularly affected are people in states with high taxes like New York and Massachusetts, and it is important to assess the situation early in the year, when finances can be reorganized to work within the A.M.T. rules, if necessary.
The A.M.T. is actually a parallel tax system that is intended to insure that everyone with fairly substantial income pays some tax. While the rate is lower than regular tax rates, the A.M.T. denies a number of tax breaks that are allowed in the regular system. For example, some municipal bonds become taxable. And when appreciated securities are donated to charity, unlike the regular tax system, deduction is allowed only for their cost, not their market value.
''Make your calculation now and see if you are likely to be in the A.M.T. for 1990,'' he said, ''and then go over strategies with your accountant. You may want to do the opposite from normal,'' accelerating income into a year when it will be subject to a lower rate and deferring deductions like the charitable contribution to a year when they will do more good. 401(k) Plans. People who work for companies that match employee contributions should make the maximum contribution allowed to these tax-deferred retirement plans, Mr. Barbee said. ''Even if there is not a match, it should still be a high priority,'' he said. For 1990, the legal maximum will be just short of $8,000, he added, and many companies allow employees to make quarterly adjustments. Similarly, people with self-employment income should put money into tax-deferred Keogh retirement plans, he said.
Schedule C. This part of the tax form is for self-employment income - and related deductions. ''There are lots of family situations in which money is being expended because people want to get back into the work force or start their own business,'' Mr. Barbee said, ''but they think of it as an extension of the household expenses'' and fail to take advantage of Schedule C deductions.
A business has a couple of years to begin earning money, he said, ''so characterize it as a business as soon as possible,'' when money is spent to enroll in relevant courses, for example, or to buy a computer or to entertain potential business contacts. He cautioned that the home office was often a signal for auditors, and that business deductions would have to be well documented and legitimate.
Debt Management. Four types of interest are recognized by current tax law - mortgage interest, which is deductible for primary and secondary residences; business interest, deductible for those who materially participate in the business; investment interest, generally deductible to the extent it is offset by investment income, and consumer interest, which is only 20 percent deductible for 1989 and will be only 10 percent deductible for 1990.
As taxpayers assemble their 1989 interest expense records, they should try to eliminate consumer interest expenses in 1990, Mr. Barbee said. One way, if they have sufficient dividend and interest income, is to use a margin loan to pay off consumer loans or credit cards. Because interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000 is fully deductible, many people take out home equity loans to pay off credit card balances or auto loans.
''I'm cautionary about home equity loans,'' Mr. Barbee said. ''It's risky to put your home into play to pay for a fun trip or even a car.''

HEADLINE: Orders Rose At Factories In December

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Factory orders posted a second consecutive increase in December, rising 1.9 percent because of a surge in orders for civilian aircraft, the Commerce Department said today.
Orders had grown by 2.4 percent in November and were down one-tenth of a percent in October.
A key component, durable goods orders, gained 3.2 percent in December after an increase of 4.8 percent in November. Aircraft orders were sharply higher in both months, partly because a long strike at the Boeing Company ended in late November. 
 
Various Categories
 Excluding transportation, factory orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December after an increase of 1 percent in November.
For all of 1989, factory orders grew 6.4 percent, to $2.83 trillion, after a 9.7 percent 1988 rise, department officials said.
The 1.9 percent December rise was above the expectations of economists, who had generally foreseen a 1.1 percent increase from November levels.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, told Congress this week that a healthy backlog of orders for aircraft was one of the bright spots for the economy at a time when business activity was generally weaker.
Mr. Greenspan said the economy was experiencing a ''temporary hesitation'' before continuing to grow, but he conceded there was a risk that a recession could develop.
The department said orders in December for nonelectrical machinery fell 4.7 percent after rising 5.6 percent in November. Electrical machinery orders were up 5 percent after a 7.3 percent rise in November.
Transportation equipment orders rose by 11.2 percent in December and 10.8 percent in November. Within that category, orders for aircraft and parts soared 23.6 percent in December and 22.8 percent in November.
 
A Loss of Factory Jobs
 Earlier today, the Labor Department said in its January report on unemployment that there were 112,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in January than in December.
It was the 10th consecutive monthly drop in factory jobs and one more sign of waning vigor in the industrial sector.
Economists said they expected the Federal Reserve Board to monitor the employment report closely for signs of more economic weakening. The Fed can act to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates.
Excluding the volatile military category from both months, total factory orders rose 2.5 percent in December after a 1.8 percent gain in November.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Prices in Strong Rally As Gasoline Sets the Pace

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Expectations of strong gasoline demand early this summer fueled a strong rally in oil futures prices yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On other commodity markets, copper and precious metal futures rose; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
Gasoline futures posted the sharpest gains, settling 0.83 cent to 1.9 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 64.22 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 0.32 cent to 0.44 cent higher, with March at 23.02 cents gallon; heating oil was 0.77 cent to 1.52 cents higher, with March at 58.26 cents a gallon. 
Yesterday's strong rally after modest gains on Thursday suggests the petroleum markets are beginning a new upward push, analysts said. The strongest gains yesterday were in contracts for April and May delivery, indicating that petroleum dealers are locking in supplies for the late spring and early summer, when the vacation season begins and gasoline consumption swells.
Strong gasoline demand tends to spur United States crude futures prices because West Texas Intermediate crude, the type traded in New York, is more easily refined into high-quality gasoline than some other varieties, Randolph Donney, a research analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said.
Copper futures rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York amid signs of tightening supplies. The Comex reported a decline of 561 tons in its warehouse stocks of copper from Thursday to yesterday, bringing the level down to 6,621 tons, the lowest this year.
Warehouse stocks reported weekly by the London Metal Exchange have also been falling recently, and Monday's report is expected to show a further decline of 2,000 to 5,000 tons, analysts said.
Demand for copper is apparently picking up after slackening in December.
Some buying may also have stemmed from brighter economic perceptions because of the stock market's recent gains and yesterday's U.S. unemployment report, which showed no change in the jobless rate.
Copper is heavily used in the construction industry, making the market extremely sensitive to economic news.
Copper finished 1.9 cents to 2.35 cents higher, with February at $1.015 a pound.
Gold futures settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher on the Comex, with February at $418.20 a troy ounce; silver was a cent higher across the board, with March at $5.338 a troy ounce.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading While Gold Also Advances

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher yesterday in light, uneventful trading on world currency markets.
Gold prices rose, with most of the gains in overseas dealings. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold gained 20 cents to close at $418.20. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $418.50 a troy ounce, up 85 cents from late Thursday. 
The dollar rose after the release of a Labor Department report showing the nation's unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.2 percent in January. The Government said nonfarm payrolls increased by 275,000, but the manufacturing sector lost 112,000 jobs.
''It was a mixed bag,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at Chicago-based MMS International. ''People who remain bearish on the dollar cite the manufacturing number; people who are bullish look at the payroll gains.''
Traders reason that a steady unemployment rate will keep the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates. High interest rates make United States securities more attractive to foreigners, who need dollars to make such investments.
Most of the day's activity centered on the dollar and the West German mark, both of which moved in a wide range. When the dollar reached a high against the mark at around midday in New York, ''the market took profits in the dollar and immediately bought marks again,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
''Every time the dollar goes up'' against the mark, he said, ''people jump right in and buy marks.''
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.95 Japanese yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 145.35 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 145.50 yen, up from 144.89 yen Thursday.
In London, the British pound was unchanged at $1.6820. The pound was also unchanged in New York, where it finished at $1.6840.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6830 West German marks, up from 1.6765; 1.4920 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.7160 French francs, up from 5.6940; 1,251.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.75, and 1.1885 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1866.

HEADLINE: A Reward Fit for a King

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: INGLEWOOD, Calif., Feb. 2

 BODY:
Wayne Gretzky has paid off handsomely for Bruce McNall, and the Los Angeles Kings' owner is going to return the favor to the National Hockey League's career scoring leader.
McNall has extended Gretzky's contract by two years, at $4 million a year. The extension runs through the 1997-98 season. All told, Gretzky's 10-year deal will be worth $31.32 million.
McNall also increased Gretzky's salary in the final two years of his original eight-year pact by $500,000 a year and added $3 million in deferred salary.
''It's something we've been working on a long time,'' McNall said Thursday night. ''Last year was a spectacular year; this year's even better economically for us. We've done virtually twice as good as I had anticipated.''
McNall said the club lost $5 million in 1987-88, the season before acquiring Gretzky, and made $6 million in 1988-89. The Kings finished fourth in the Smythe Division the season before Gretzky was acquired from the Edmonton Oilers and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Last season, they finished second and advanced to the second round.
Besides trading two players and three No. 1 draft choices, McNall paid the Oilers $15 million for Gretzky.
''My job is to play hockey, not to worry about the contract,'' said Gretzky, who is 29 years old. ''All I had to do was sign it and I did.''
The new deal increases his base pay to $2.5 million in 1994-95 and 1995-96. He will receive $1 million in deferred salary for this season through 1995-96. McNall said Gretzky would receive a flat $4 million for the 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
New Politics of Social Security May Lead to Sharper Scrutiny

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut the Social Security tax and Richard G. Darman's counterproposal to shield the pensioners' nest egg from the hungry gaze of Congress have so far generated more shock than debate.
President Bush probably expressed the only deeply felt view in official Washington when he stated flatly, ''The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.''
But even analysts who see the controversy as political theater at its most cynical, as a game over who will take the blame for the size of the Federal deficit, believe that a re-examination of the economic underpinnings of Social Security is overdue. No budgetary sleight-of-hand, they agree, can assure a comfortable retirement for American workers now in their 30's and 40's. Unless Americans manage to build a more productive economy, the Government's promise to pay generous pensions to that generation will be difficult to keep. 
 
Greatest Strength and Weakness
The great political strength and economic weakness of Social Security, notes Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, is that ''people treat it as if it were a giant version of the Prudential Insurance Company.'' And nowhere is that misconception better illustrated than in the changes to the Social Security system in 1983.
Until the late 1970's, Social Security covered all its outlays from payroll taxes. Robert J. Myers, a former deputy Social Security commissioner, notes that the system instituted in the Depression and amended by Congress a half-dozen times since was never quite sound. The average single male retiring in 1975, for example, had paid in just a third of the taxes needed to finance his pension, even counting accumulated interest on his payroll taxes.
But to the casual observer, Social Security seemed self-financing because many workers were supporting few retirees. In 1950 there were 16 jobholders for each beneficiary, and as late as 1965 the ratio was as high as 4 to 1.
The demographic worm turned in the 1970's; for the first time, revenue fell behind outlays and the specter of insolvency loomed. Congress could have resolved the ensuing political crisis overnight by abandoning the pay-as-you-go principle and financing social insurance from general Government revenue the way most affluent nations do. But that would have violated the deeply felt belief that America's retirees had paid their own way in the past and should continue to pay in the future.
The bipartisan 1983 fix, largely engineered by Senator Moynihan, a New York Democrat, and the former Senate majority leader, Robert Dole of Kansas, accelerated scheduled payroll tax increases, delayed cost-of-living increases and raised the age at which today's young workers would be eligible for tomorrow's pensions. The package, it was believed, would make the system self-financing through the middle of the 21st century.
 
Little Thought About Surplus
But to cover future obligations, the Social Security Trust Fund would have to take in far more cash than it paid out for many decades. The Trust Fund balance, accumulated in Government bonds, would rise to six times the annual outlay by the year 2030 - an incredible $4 trillion in 1990 dollars. And at the time of the 1983 compromise, Senator Moynihan admits, little thought was given to the political or economic implications of the surplus.
Even before surplus payroll revenue started pouring in, Congress and Ronald Reagan's Administration had committed the Government to returning most of the money in the form of large income tax cuts enacted in 1981. Total Federal revenue as a percentage of national income remained virtually unchanged.
But the proportion of revenue coming from the regressive payroll tax rose from 23 percent in 1981 to 29 percent in 1989. Three out of four families with a taxpaying breadwinner now pay more in Social Security taxes than Federal income taxes, when employer Social Security contributions are counted along with the deduction that shows on the paycheck.
To Senator Moynihan, this increased tax burden on lower- and middle-income families is ''totally unacceptable.'' But it is another consequence of the Reagan tax shuffle - what Mr. Moynihan calls ''the dirty little secret'' - that most worries economists and perplexes the public.
The Social Security Trust Fund is a bookkeeping concept. Surplus revenue, $55 billion in 1989 and climbing, is indeed credited to the fund and used to buy Government bonds that pay interest. But the fund owns no tangible assets, no gold or factories or office buildings that could someday be traded for the goods and services pensioners need.
That fact in itself, Mr. Aaron of the Brookings Institution argues, should not be troubling. The most conservative private pension systems and insurance companies operate the same way, accumulating paper claims on future income. What troubles Mr. Aaron and others is that productive assets are not being set aside elsewhere in the economy to ease the burden of caring for people now in their 30's and 40's when they reach retirement age. ''What you should care about,'' Mr. Aaron says, ''is national savings. If you were getting it somewhere else, it would not matter.''
 
Deficits Are Masked
In fact, the annual Social Security surplus masks chronic deficits in the rest of the Government's budget. That has reduced the pressure to raise income taxes or cut Federal spending, which could make available the money to meet the needs of retirees who are now in their 30's and 40's.
It is hard to imagine that Washington would turn a cold shoulder to the righteous claims of 80 million retired voters. But it is also hard to imagine how the politics of paying out more a $700 billion annually in pension benefits would play out in a world of slow economic growth and tight government budgets.
Senator Moynihan's response to the low-savings predicament is to roll back the payroll tax to a level that would maintain about a balance of just one year's outlays. If future generations are rich enough to afford generous pensions for their parents, he reasons, they will finance them on a pay-as-you-go basis. Meanwhile, Washington will be stripped of the budgetary fig leaf provided by rapidly accumulating surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund.
Robert Ball, a former Social Security commissioner who helped devise the 1983 compromise, sees nothing wrong in principle with this approach. But he said he ''would like a reserve with a real cushion'' - perhaps one and a half year's projected outlays rather than just a year's worth.
But to Ralph Bryant, a specialist in economic stimulation at the Brookings Institution, the Moynihan approach is ''like being stuck in three feet of mud at the edge of a swamp, and driving in deeper to dramatize the seriousness of the problem.'' Any additional tax cuts, he argues, would further increase private consumption at the expense of savings and investment.
 
Darman Offers Alternative
Mr. Bryant estimates that the payroll tax rollback would raise long-term interest rates between one and a quarter and one and three quarter percentage points and increase the Federal deficit by $120 billion by 1994. If that reduced the growth rate of the economy by a modest one-quarter percent, annual national income would be about a trillion dollars smaller by the year 2030.
Mr. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, offers an alternative, the Social Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund, which would seemingly meet everyone's concerns. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law would be extended beyond 1993. But starting in 1993, Congress would also be required to make deposits into a separate fund. The annual deposit, equal to the Social Security surplus after a three-year phase-in, would be put toward reducing the Federal deficit.
In essence, the law would obligate Congress to run an overall budget surplus equal to the Social Security surplus. And that would free equivalent value of economic resources for private investment and growth.
But Senator Moynihan is not impressed. How convenient, he says, to ''start having integrity after the next Presidential election.'' Others wonder whether a Government that has wrestled in vain with a chronic budget deficit for years could be trusted to honor an agreement to run a $4 trillion dollar budget surplus over the next 40 years.
For the moment, however, the only proposal in the form of a bill is the Moynihan payroll tax cut. Mr. Aaron's ''nightmare'' is that Congress will pass it and make up the modest first year revenue loss of $6 billion by also cutting the capital gains tax, which is intended to promote business investment and economic growth .
Would Congress respond to fears that big budget deficits are imperiling Social Security by increasing the deficit still more? As Senator Moynihan says, ''People who pierce the veil of money rarely return with their senses intact.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Just Dribbles In to Nicaragua Opposition, but the Sandinistas Profit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
A $9 million program to assist the opposition in Nicaragua's presidential election has encountered so many delays and bureaucratic obstacles that a Nicaraguan Government agency has received more money than the coalition of opposition parties supported by the United States, American officials say.
The problems are attributable to obstacles put up by the Sandinista Government and to the caution of American officials in the aftermath of the Iran-contra scandal, the officials say.
Nicaragua, unlike the United States, permits foreign contributions to political parties in national elections. But under Nicaraguan law, foreign contributors must pay a 50 percent tax to the Nicaraguan election agency, the Supreme Electoral Council.
 
'Considerable Irony'
Roger F. Noriega, the official at the United States Agency for International Development who supervises the Nicaraguan election program, said the electoral council had access to $1,371,000 in American money. But he said the National Opposition Union, a coalition of 14 parties opposing the Sandinista Government, has received only $278,000. 
The opposition alliance, known as UNO, includes parties ranging from right-wing conservatives to socialists and Communists. Its presidential candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, is publisher of the chief opposition newspaper, La Prensa.
''There is considerable irony,'' Mr. Noriega said. ''The Sandinista authorities have blocked UNO's access to this money, but the Nicaraguan Government has access to its share. That was the worst nightmare of many people.''
After a visit to Managua this week, former President Jimmy Carter said the Nicaraguan authorities agreed to release American funds to the opposition coalition. But only three weeks remain before the Feb. 25 election, and American officials say the Sandinistas have reneged on similar promises in the past.
 
The Program's Objective
The purpose of the aid program, as described by Congress, is ''to provide assistance for free and fair elections in Nicaragua.'' In September, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said there was an urgent need for such assistance to help register voters. But none has been used for that purpose. By the time the President Bush signed the bill into law on Oct. 21, there was only a day remaining in the the registration period.
There are two basic reasons for delays since then. The Agency for International Development and various intermediaries, including the National Endowment for Democracy and foundations associated with the Democratic and Republican Parties in this country, have been extremely cautious.
Before disbursing money, they wanted to establish strict financial controls and procedures to verify and audit all payments. A dozen auditors from Price Waterhouse and three from the United States General Accounting Office are in Nicaragua.
That caution is a legacy of the Iran-contra scandal, in which Reagan Administration officials diverted money to opponents of the Nicaraguan Government in defiance of restrictions imposed by Congress.
In addition, people involved in the election aid program say the Sandinistas have deliberately tried to block or delay the delivery of American money to opposition groups.
J. Brian Atwood, president of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, which is affiliated with the Democratic Party, said that ''in view of bureaucratic hurdles in Managua and delaying tactics by Nicaraguan authorities, we can only conclude that political decisions have been made to slow down the program.''
 
'One Delay After Another'
Paul S. Reichler, a lawyer for the Nicaraguan Government, denied that. ''The Sandinistas have not blocked or delayed receipt of the funds, but on the contrary have created special exceptions to their own laws and procedures to facilitate the timely receipt of these funds by the intended Nicaraguan beneficiaries,'' he said.
But Ted D. Morse of the Agency for International Development said the response from Managua had been ''just one delay after another.''
American officials offered these examples of problems they have faced. Wire transfers of money from the United States did not get through to Nicaragua. Checks deposited in Nicaraguan banks take weeks to clear. The Central Bank of Nicaragua told opposition groups that they could not withdraw dollars needed to pay suppliers because the currency was in Panamanian bank accounts frozen as a result of the United States invasion of Panama on Dec. 20.
Opposition groups have used American aid to buy cars, Jeeps, pickup trucks and motorcyles, but the vehicles have been held up by the Nicaraguan Government for payment of customs duties. Government offices were closed in a crucial period, from Dec. 23 to Jan. 2.
 
A Circuitous Route
American officials say that 1.7 million people are eligible to vote in Nicaragua, so the $9 million represents more than $5 for every potential voter.
The American aid follows a circuitous route to Nicaragua, through a maze of intermediaries beginning with the National Endowment for Democracy, a private, nonprofit corporation created in 1983 to promote democracy around the world.
The Federal Government has given $7.7 million to the endowment, which in turn has given a total of $5 million to the National Democratic Institute and the National Republican Institute. Of that amount, $1.8 million is for Mrs. Chamorro's coalition and $1.5 million for the Institute for Electoral Promotion and Training, which is supposed to use it for nonpartisan ''civic education'' expounding the virtues of free elections.
Nicaraguan officials argue that the separation between the 14-party coalition and the electoral institute is a subterfuge to avoid payment of the 50 percent tax on money given to the institute. The tax applies to political parties and alliances with candidates in the election.
 
What the Charter Says
The statutory charter of the endowment says, ''Funds may not be expended, either by the endowment or by any of its grantees, to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office.''
George R. Vickers, an associate professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, who has studied the election aid program, said: ''This prohibition, while real, is more a legal distinction than a practical limitation. The distinction between nonpartisan civic and voter education programs and campaign activities is extremely difficult to discern in practice.''
The five directors of the electoral institute are all leaders of parties in Mrs. Chamorro's alliance, the National Opposition Union. Documents prepared as part of the Nicaraguan aid program say that the institute may ''employ individuals who are associated with or partisans of UNO,'' may use the coalition's equipment and may share its office space in nine regional offices outside Managua.
The American money can be used to buy typewriters, telecopiers and other office equipment; to conduct certain public opinion surveys; to hire poll-watchers; to transport voters to the polls on election day, and to encourage people to vote.
In addition to the $7.7 million given to the endowment, the Government has earmarked a total of $1.1 million for four organizations that will monitor the fairness of the campaign and the election. They are Freedom House, the Center for Democracy, the Center for Electoral Assistance and Promotion and an observer delegation led by former President Carter. The Government retains the remainder, about $200,000, to finance reviews by the inspector general of the Agency for International Development.
To date, Mr. Vickers said, the opposition has gained few tangible benefits from the American aid program. But, he said, the program has caused conflict among opposition parties vying for control of the money, has made it difficult for the opposition to raise money inside Nicaragua because of the perception that it well-financed, and has provided a campaign issue to the Sandinistas, who argue that Mrs. Chamorro would be a client of the United States.

HEADLINE: New Delhi Moves to Rein In Its Technology Chief

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The new Indian Government has moved to curb the influence of a former resident of Chicago who returned to India to give a push to the nation's modernization drive and who is now chief of India's telecommunications network.
The official, Satyen Gagaram Pitroda, has been removed from his post as Adviser on Technology Missions to the Prime Minister.
And an official investigation has begun into allegations that a technology center that he started five years ago to reduce India's reliance on foreign technology for telephone exchanges has failed.
Mr. Pitroda gave up his American citizenship to give his time and technological skills to the land of his birth. 
He is regarded as close to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who strongly supported his ideas and plans for modernizing telecommunications and other areas. At one point he conducted a computerized study of how Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party should be run.
''It has come as a shock to me because I see myself as a professional and not a politician,'' Mr. Pitroda said in an interview last month at his office, referring to the changes in his career.
He is still chairman of the Indian Government's Telecom Commission and Secretary of the Department of Telecommunications. His responsibilities include the development and operation of the country's telecommunications services, which have improved vastly in recent years with new technology but which still draw angry complaints of inefficiency and delays from users.
Other officials and critics said Mr. Pitroda had gone into areas with the technology missions where his work overlapped with other authorities, setting off interdepartmental tensions. The technology missions were asked by the previous Government to identify problems and advantages in its programs relating to drinking water, literacy, oil-seeds production and environment.
But it is not clear whether Mr. Pitroda, a high-profile technologist and businessman from Chicago who had prospered from developing telecommunications patents, will last a full three-year term in those posts. He is facing hostility from Cabinet Ministers who are suspicious of his assertions of success and his access to Rajiv Gandhi, whom they hold as primarily responsible the country's economic woes.
The new Government, which has held power for about a month, has not yet clearly spelled out its long-term views on high technology, although it has said it favors technology that is most appropriate for India's villages.
One of the projects that Mr. Pitroda first worked on was the development of indigenous rural telephone exchanges and city exchanges. His critics say that program has not gotten off the ground. But telecommunication officials say that more than 1,700 of those exchanges have already been installed and that 40 industrialists have been given licenses to produce them.
 
'Burned My Bridges'
''I have burned my bridges, this is my home, I have a job to do and I am not running away from my moral responsibilities,'' said Mr. Pitroda when a visitor asked him if he planned to resign his posts. He said one of the aims of his department was to increase the number of telephones in India, from the current level of 5 million to 10 million by 1995. India has a population of more than 800 million.
Under Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Pitroda said, he was sure of support. ''Now it is hard to say,'' he said. He said the option of returning to private life was always there but that he did not plan to return to the United States. Mr. Pitroda has renounced his American citizenship and resumed his Indian nationality.
Mr. Pitroda said the setbacks to his career could discourage professionals who wanted to play a specific role in the modernization of India.
''I am an outsider, I don't belong to any cadre, I am in no man's land,'' said Mr. Pitroda, who wears a grey, bushy mane of hair and a neatly trimmed beard. ''I never felt it before but now I feel it to some extent. I just want to continue doing my job until the Government decides otherwise.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: West Germany;
Bonn Balks at Soviet Plea For Vote on German Unity

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, today rejected a Soviet proposal for an international referendum on German unity and said his Government expected Moscow to help ease the process of German reunification.
''German unity is a German question,'' he said, adding that West Germany is ready to start talks ''on the specific steps leading to German unity'' immediately after free elections are held in East Germany on March 18.
Speaking to reporters after a 90-minute meeting with the East German Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, Mr. Kohl made it clear that the question of German unity had assumed greater urgency because of what he called the continuing ''mass exodus'' of East Germans to the West.
 
Effort to Slow Migration
Noting that his Government was willing to provide help ''on a new scale'' to stabilize the East German economy even before the elections, he said that ''East Germans must have the conviction that something will be resolved if the flow is to stop.'' 
In brief remarks to reporters, Mr. Modrow merely noted that the coalition government due to be formed in East Germany next week could be more broadly based than the one to emerge from the upcoming elections, but he did not address the reunification issue.
The two leaders held their third-ever meeting here today on the occasion of the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of political and business leaders. They have scheduled fresh talks for Feb. 13 in Bonn. They are expected to announce new economic aid for East Germany at that time. Among measures reportedly being considered is adoption by East Germany of the West German currency.
 
Neutrality Plea Rejected
Addressing the World Economic Forum today, Mr. Kohl reiterated his rejection of Mr. Modrow's call last week for the neutrality of a single German state, noting that ''a united Germany in the heart of Europe should not have any special status which would isolate it.''
''We are not an island; we're not in a corner of Europe,'' he said. ''We're in the heart of Europe and we can only solve this if we see our position as a bridge. But if we make it a bridge, it must be fully integrated with Europe and not isolated.''
Asked about a proposal made Friday by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, that a referendum on German reunification be held in Europe, the United States and Canada, Mr. Kohl said this was a matter for Germans to decide. ''Nonetheless, if all Europeans were to decide, the result would be the same,'' he said. Fear, or Economic Jealousy? But while noting in his address that West Germany expected Moscow to respect ''the right of the German people to free self-determination and to facilitate the process of unification,'' Mr. Kohl seemed to emphasize in his remarks today that the world had nothing to fear from a united Germany.
''There is a difference between understandable misgivings and fears and what is disguised as fear but is really economic jealousy,'' he said. ''Anyone who talks today of a Fourth Reich in Germany has either not learned the lessons of history or is deliberately slandering the Germans.''
Mr. Kohl said West Germany unswervingly supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ''To us and our friends, the security alliance between Europe and North America remains indispensable,'' he said. ''This is something clearly recognized in Moscow. This also applies to the continuing major role of the United States in enhancing security on this continent.''
But he added that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact would have to review their strategies as a result of developments in Europe, focusing more on political objectives. He said a proposed summit meeting of the 35 signatories of the Helsinki Accords would be an opportunity to move toward establishing pan-European security institutions.
 
A Commitment to France
Just as he emphasized the United States role in NATO, the Chancellor underlined West Germany's close ties to France within the European Community, to which, he added, Bonn ''is and will remain firmly anchored.''
Regarding Eastern Europe, Mr. Kohl dismissed those who equated the status quo with stability. ''Nothing is more destabilizing than denial of reform,'' he explained. ''In the Europe of today, stability can be achieved only by means of consistent, forward-looking reforms.''
He said the West should channel investments and credits to Eastern Europe and relax rules on the transfer of technology to Soviet-bloc countries. The European Community should also seek new forms of association with Eastern European countries, he said.
Asserting that ''like it or not'' the question of German unity is now on the agenda, Mr. Kohl said he had no doubt that East Germany would freely choose reunification. But he stressed: ''The road to German unity is not a mechanical process that can be arranged with the help of a timetable and a stopwatch. Least of all can the rate of progress be accelerated.''
 
A Warning to Unity Opponents
Echoing positions already adopted by NATO and the European Community, Mr. Kohl said reunification should take place within the context of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which negotiated the Helsinki Accords in 1975, and of continuing arms control talks.
But he also warned that East Germans were defending the right to reunification ''with growing impatience,'' adding that it would be ''just as unhistorical and irresponsible to try to oppose their interests and wishes.'' The alternative, he said, could be a major crisis and continuation of the exodus that is ''sapping the human and economic potential of East Germany.''
Noting that 55,000 East Germans have moved to the West in the last four weeks, he said, ''What we can do now -and this is easy to say and difficult to do - is to instill hope that there will be change soon and not just when their children have grown up.''
In his address, Mr. Kohl said West Germany would never forget the role played by Hungary and Czechoslovakia last fall in allowing East German refugees to pass through their territory. He pledged that, in moments of crisis, Budapest and Prague could count on West German help.
The dominant role of Bonn throughout Eastern Europe was underlined by the fact that Mr. Kohl also met privately here today with Prime Minister Marian Calfa of Czechoslovakia and Prime Minister Ante Markovic of Yugoslavia, who are among government leaders attending the economic forum.

HEADLINE: CAMBODIA FACTIONS SAID TO LINK ARMIES

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 3

 BODY:
A memorandum prepared by the Cambodian Defense Ministry says the two non-Communist factions opposing the Phnom Penh Government are increasingly cooperating on the battlefield with their dominant ally, the Communist Khmer Rouge.
The document, provided to The New York Times by an opponent of American policy toward Cambodia who recently visited the country, says the three opposition factions took part in attacks on Pailin, Varin and smaller towns in Banteay Meanchey Province.
The document offers details of how Phnom Penh says the three guerrilla groups are working together tactically on the battlefield and tends to support the assertions of Western diplomats who say cooperation between the non-Communist factions and the Khmer Rouge is increasing.
Spokesmen for one of the non-Communist factions, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, deny such cooperation. But Western diplomats say the front coordinates strategy with the Khmer Rouge on battlefield objectives and shares military intelligence. 
 
Sihanouk Explains Move
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who leads the other non-Communist faction, acknowledged coordination of military activity with the Khmer Rouge in an interview with The New York Times in Beijing in December. ''The world may condemn us,'' he said, adding that the military weakness of the non-Communists made cooperation with the Khmer Rouge necessary, however distasteful, because the world valued military strength more than moral purity.
The issue of non-Communist cooperation with the Khmer Rouge is important given a Congressional ban on the use of American funds for even indirect aid to the Khmer Rouge. American diplomats in Bangkok are sensitive to the problems raised by the cooperation and have objected to it, fearing that Congress may cut off funds for the non-Communists.
The United States, other Western nations and the non-Communist countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations support the three-party opposition coalition, but provide support only to the two non-Communist factions. The United States provides some $5 million in overt, non-arms aid to the non-Communists and $20 million to $24 million more in secret, non-arms aid, Western diplomats and American officials say. Weapons are formally paid for by Singapore.
The Cambodian memorandum was provided by Jeremy J. Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, who recently visited Vietnam and Cambodia. Mr. Stone, an outspoken opponent of American involvement in the Cambodian war and of any arms aid to the non-Communists, requested the memorandum from the Defense Minister, Gen. Tie Banh.
 
Recognition of Hun Sen Urged
Mr. Stone advocates American recognition of the Phnom Penh Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, as the only obstacle to a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule more than a million Cambodians died.
The American Government shuns Mr. Hun Sen's administration, which was installed by Vietnam 11 years ago after Hanoi drove out the Khmer Rouge. Washington supports Prince Sihanouk as head of state and wants a comprehensive settlement resulting in free elections supervised by the United Nations in which Mr. Hun Sen would not have an unfair advantage.
The Defense Ministry document asserts that Sihanouk forces have sometimes paid Khmer Rouge soldiers for help on the battlefield. In last month's battle for Varin, which both the Sihanouk forces and the Khmer Rouge claimed to have captured, Sihanouk forces paid $80 in Thai baht to each Khmer Rouge soldier, the document says. In a battle for the commune of Nimit, the memorandum says, Sihanouk forces paid $3,000 to Khmer Rouge division 450 for battlefield help.
A spokesman for the Sihanouk faction in Bangkok denied these assertions, calling them ''rubbish'' and ''defamation.''
''The Khmer Rouge don't need any money from us,'' he said. ''They're a lot richer than we are.''
 
More Cooperation Reported
Western diplomats said cooperation between the Sihanouk forces and the Khmer Rouge was increasing, especially because of ammunition shortages as supply lines lengthen. They said the Khmer Rouge, better organized and financed by China, has more ammunition porters and supplies. The two forces have been sharing ammunition, intelligence and artillery support, the diplomats said, and have sometimes fought alongside each other for the same objective.
All the factions are trying to control as much territory as possible before a new round of negotiations on a Cambodian settlement. Any settlement will probably call for a cease-fire in place, the diplomats said.
Mr. Hun Sen and Hanoi have moved closer to Washington's position by agreeing to a significant United Nations role in Cambodia, Mr. Stone said, ''while Sihanouk is drifting closer to the Khmer Rouge.''
''The contradictions in the U.S. position are surfacing so rapidly that it will be unpalatable for Congress to openly support the killing of more Cambodians by continuing to provide virtually all the funding to the non-Communists,'' Mr. Stone said. ''It's getting much harder to live with the contradiction that you could support the non-Communist factions without supporting the Khmer Rouge indirectly, which is against the law.''

HEADLINE: U.S. FIGHTS COLORADO FOR ROCKIES WATER

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREELEY, Colo., Feb. 2

 BODY:
In a trial that could help determine the pace of economic development across the West, the Federal Government is battling the Colorado authorities over control of the water from the Rocky Mountains.
For the first time, the United States Forest Service has filed a water claim in an attempt to set overall limits on water that others can draw from the creeks, streams and rivers that run through its vast properties.
Instead of relying on its water permit power to prevent abuses, the Government wants to assert a broad historical claim over water in mountain streams. It says that will insure long-term use of the water by safeguarding watersheds and stream channels. 
Led by the Colorado Attorney General, 48 local governments and water developers have objected, calling the Federal assertion unlawful and excessive.
 
Status of Water Rights at Issue
The case is being argued before a state water judge in this town 50 miles from Denver, and all sides say it will be carried to the United States Supreme Court. A final ruling will set a new legal status for the Federal Government's most important water rights.
''This may be the most significant water case ever tried in Colorado, and it has implications for all the Western states,'' said Deputy Attorney General Lois White of Colorado. ''It is an attempt by the Federal Government to set a new precedent which would allow it to make very substantial claims, and it would put serious limitations on the rights of other users.''
Andrew F. Walch, the Justice Department lawyer defending the Federal claim, said, ''At some point there will be a limit on how much use can be made of the water in national forests, and that limit comes when the destruction of the watershed and the channels infringes on the long-term public good.''
 
Flow in Stream-Bed Channels
The Federal claim would not take a drop of water out of the streams and rivers. Instead, the Government is trying to make sure that the flow of water follows natural rhythms sufficiently to keep stream-bed channels from clogging.
The Forest Service says maintaining the tributary system that has been etched into the mountains over untold years is the best way to make sure water is collected and sent down, and to limit erosion and flash floods.
Insistence on following natural rhythms, or mimicking nature, is a radical concept in a region where water has been so thoroughly manipulated that the levels in some rivers like the Cache la Poudre in northern Colorado actually fall in a heavy summer rain. When the farmers on the plains do not need water for irrigation, highland sluice gates are shut to build up reservoirs.
In Colorado the Forest Service owns 20 percent of all the land. Across the West more than half of all the available water either originates or flows through national forests.
 
'Social, Philosophical, Political'
''This is even more than a Forest Service water issue,'' said W. H. Miller, manager of the Denver Water Department, ''it is a social, philosophical, political question.''
The huge Federal land holdings in the West take the form of everything from wilderness areas to missile test ranges. They are already a source of resentment, and the new water claims would greatly increase Federal influence in an arena where it had been one player among many.
Water rights in most of the West are determined by the seniority principle - ''first in time, first in right'' - and those rights are bought, sold and bartered in an increasingly complex and sometimes vicious scramble.
Conflicting claims are resolved in state courts on the basis of case law rather than any overriding legislation or development plans. ''It is every man for himself out there,'' said Gary E. Cargill, chief of the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Region, ''and every claim has to be settled on a case by case basis.''
 
The Power of Seniority
This culture of individual rights so intrinsic to the West is now disturbed by what Mr. Cargill termed ''the first scientific and comprehensive effort to set requirements for minimum instream flows across an entire water system.''
The Forest Service not only wants to insert systematic limits into an open, unregulated market. It also wants to invoke the power of antiquity for those limits. The key legal issue involves the service's assertion that it has ''reserved rights'' dating to 1897 when the service was created by Congress. That would provide nearly a century's worth of seniority.
The Forest Service has tried but failed to assert this privilege before. In 1978, the Supreme Court denied the Forest Service the rights to control minimum flows for esthetic, recreational or wildlife purposes. The Justices said that Congress had not created the Forest Service to pursue those ends.
 
U.S. Emphasizing Maintenance
Instead, the ruling in United States v. New Mexico was that Forest Service's water rights deriving from the 1897 law were for the ''principal purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flow.''
The service now argues that securing those favorable conditions requires keeping the watershed and tributary system in good condition. With scientific data collected over a decade at a cost of nearly $1 million, the service is trying to show that it has worked out the most efficient system.
The plan would set a schedule for minimum water flows throughout the year. In the spring runoff, there would be a vigorous flow to flush the channels clean, enough to prevent silting and vegetation growth in the streambed for the rest of the year.
The Federal case argues that excessive diverting of water has caused some streambeds to clog and harm the water flow.
 
Ruling Expected in a Year
In a battle of experts that is expected to last through the summer, the State of Colorado and other critics of the Federal plan say they will show that the Forest Service is misconstruing Congressional intent, that natural flows are not necessary to preserve channels and that, in any case, the service is claiming much more water than it needs for that aim.
District Court Judge Robert A. Behrman is expected to rule about a year from now in the case, which concerns one of the seven Colorado water districts.
How much the Forest Service plan would infringe on future development is being hotly debated. The issue is so complex that officials on both sides of the case admit that specific restrictions resulting from the Federal claim can only be calculated one stream at a time.
Mr. Miller of the Denver Water Department said, ''This could really hurt us because in a dry year their minimum flows could amount to 100 percent of the water.''
Mr. Cargill acknowledged that there will be problems for some users, but he argued, ''It seems common sense that the best way to insure continued development is to make sure that the system that collects and conveys the water remains healthy.''

HEADLINE: Base Closings Seen as Opportunity Inside Problem

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Instead of just single-mindedly fighting the proposed closing of five Bay Area naval bases, local officials here are also considering how to acccomplish the historic task of converting to a peacetime economy with the least immediate pain and the most long-range promise.
Certainly, they are asking, ''What is the price of peace in my neighborhood?'' and worrying about unemployment and the failure of small businesses near the bases, if and when they close.
But they are also excited about redeveloping prime real estate and attracting new industry, and mindful of the many studies that show that employment increases after base closings. They sense they may be on the cutting edge of history, with their region likely to be the first to face the massive changes of a post-cold-war economy. 
No region would lose more bases than the Bay Area, according to the list released Monday of 35 domestic and 13 overseas installations the Department of Defense is considering closing. No county would be harder hit than Alameda, home of the Alameda Naval Air Station and Aviation Depot, the Oakland Naval Supply Center and the Oakland Naval Hospital, which together employ more than 8,000 civilians and pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economies. The Moffet Naval Base in Santa Clara County would also be closed.
 
Earlier Battle Recalled
The relative equanimity about the proposed base closings, which would not take place before 1992, stands in sharp contrast to the reaction last year, when the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco was on a list of 86 bases chosen for closure by a Congressional commission. Representatives Barbara Boxer and Nancy Pelosi, both California Democrats, fought feverishly to preserve the Presidio, a 1,400-acre wooded bluff overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and wound up with a compromise sparing the Army hospital and some reserve activities.
Representative Ron Dellums, a Democrat from Oakland who is a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, said he intends to press the Department of Defense for a detailed explanation of why so many Bay Area bases are on the list. But if sound military reasons can be given, Mr. Dellums said, he will then devote himself to fostering intelligent conversion of the installations for civilian use.
''I don't believe you can ask them to give consideration to the needs of a particular community,'' said Mr. Dellums, who advocates reduced military spending. ''We have a serious budget crisis. We have a changed world because of Eastern Europe. We know that expenditure of defense money is not a good expenditure for most people.''
Like Mr. Dellums, many local officials here and in neighboring counties seem more interested in planning for the closures than fighting them. ''We'll do what we can to forestall this,'' said Don Perata, president of the Board of Supervisors of Alameda County, where the Navy is the second-biggest employer, after the county itself. ''But the trend internationally is to de-militarize, so we have to wrap our minds around the problem and be creative about the solutions.''
 
Alameda Mayor Worries
Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco, faced with the loss of the naval base on Treasure Island, at the midspan of the Bay Bridge, said that considering shutting bases here ''makes sense in view of the changing conditions around the world.'' He said the land that may become available ''offers extraordinary opportunity for development.''
More predictably provincial in his outlook is Chuck Corica, the Mayor of Alameda, an island city across the estuary from Oakland. Alameda is a quintessential Navy town. The downtown shopping strip, with nine bars and a tattoo parlor, virtually shuts down when the sailors are at sea.
''It's a terrible blow,'' said Mayor Corica.
While the Navy is ''family'' in Alameda, the relationship elsewhere in the region is a matter of jobs, not love. Here in Oakland, the employment issue is especially important because of the steady erosion of industry that has cost Oakland 25,000 manufacturing jobs in the last decade.
 
Hopes for 'Humane' Process
Local leaders say they will look to the Federal Government for help in retraining displaced workers. ''They created the problem, and they can't walk away from us,'' said Representative Pete Stark, a Democrat from nearby Hayward. ''They must make this as humane a process as they can.''
Replacement industry must be labor intensive, planners say, and offer a similar ratio of skilled and unskilled jobs. Already there is debate here as to whether more jobs would be created by an industrial park or expansion of the Port of Oakland, by a high-technology manufacturing plant like those spreading from Silicon Valley or a pharmaceutical company.
But even under ideal circumstances, some of those laid off will be hard-pressed to find new jobs. ''You will not see people at the lower pay scales absorbed,'' said Mark Friedman, the director of the Plant Closures Project in Oakland, a local advocacy group.
The workers at the bases are alarmed. A receptionist at the Alameda Naval Air Station said this week that she was readying her resume to seek employment with the state. A mechanic at the Oakland Naval Supply Center anticipated that his next job would be ''dog work'' compared with the one he had repairing assembly lines.
 
Recovery After a Decade
Local officials are brushing up on studies regarding earlier base closings nationwide, which uniformly show a marked increase in employment 10 years after the military has pulled out. One such study, by the Pentagon's Office of Economic Readjustment, looked at 100 bases closed from 1961 to 1977. In place of the bases, there are now 75 industrial parks, 58 educational institutions and 42 airports, with 138,138 jobs where there had once been 93,424.
But Bruce Kern, the director of economic affairs for Alameda County, worries that the Bay Area presents special obstacles that discourage new industry, primarily housing costs -the most expensive in the nation - and stringent local environmental regulations. And Mr. Perata worries that new jobs will more likely be in the service sector than in manufacturing, the trend in recent decades. Such jobs, he said, often have lower salaries and inadequate benefits, thus shrinking the county tax roles and increasing its social service burden.
According to various experts, the key to successfully converting a military base is careful planning and enough time to get new job sources in place. Typically, cities and towns respond with panic, then try to block the closing, said Michael Closson, director of the Center for Economic Conversion in nearby Mountain View, which advises states and cities on this transition. ''They waste valuable time, sometimes years,'' he said.
This is why Mr. Perata and others have chosen to plan rather than fight. When the workers who lose jobs come banging on the county's door for help, Mr. Perata said, he wants to have more to tell them than ''I tried to prevent this from happening.''

HEADLINE: New Orleans Mayor Is Easy Victor in Bid for a Second Term

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy won a second term in a primary today, capturing well over the 50 percent of votes he needed to avoid a runoff against his challenger, Donald Mintz.
With 425 of 465 precincts reporting, Mr. Barthelemy had 71,716 votes, or 55 percent, to 57,066, or 44 percent, for Mr. Mintz. Two other candidates had 1 percent or less. 
Mr. Barthelemy, New Orleans's second black Mayor, smiled broadly as he began his victory statement, then called on the citizens to join together after a divisive campaign. ''We are in difficult times,'' he said. ''We have laid the foundations for the future. But we cannot build a great city divided. We all must work together.''
Earlier, Mr. Mintz conceded defeat, saying: ''Sidney, to you, congratulations and best wishes. If permitted, I look forward to working with you in the days ahead.''
The 47-year-old Mayor, who has spent 16 years in politics without losing an election, faced a strong challenge from Mr. Mintz, 46, who was making his first run for elective office.
The campaign included allegations of race-baiting on both sides. Mr. Barthelemy accused Mr. Mintz, who is white, of being behind fliers depicting him as an Uncle Tom. One shows him with a half-white face; the other shows him robbing the grave of the late Ernest (Dutch) Morial, New Orleans's first black Mayor.
Mr. Mintz, who wears a lapel pin showing black and white hands linked, vehemently denied the allegations and cited his own civil rights record, which includes an Urban League award to his law firm.
The challenger, who is Jewish, said some of Mr. Barthelemy's radio advertisements catered to anti-white racism, and he accused the Mayor of anti-Semitic campaigning because of a flier saying Mr. Mintz's civil rights credentials apparently did not apply to blacks.
Mr. Barthelemy called those allegation ridiculous, noting that he had appointed Jews and received a B'nai B'rith award.
Despite the sharp disagreements, the campaign drew relatively little attention in New Orleans and there was little interest in the issues: the city's high crime rate, unemployment and the candidates' experience and competence.
Until late December, most of the interest was focused on Mr. Morial, who served from 1978 to 1986 and was widely expected to run. But on Dec. 14, he announced that he would not. He died nine days later, never having endorsed either Mr. Mintz, a protege, or Mr. Barthelemy, who as a City Councilman often battled with the Mayor.

HEADLINE: Many Are Encouraged by Bush's Arts Budget

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The modest budget increases requested by President Bush for the arts and humanities in fiscal 1991 are regarded by top members of Congress as significant because while they do not keep pace with inflation they reverse a nine-year trend of declining or flat budgets in these areas.
The total request of $364 million for the three agencies that administer Federal grants to the arts, humanities and museums would be, if enacted by Congress later this year, an overall gain of $13.1 million from the fiscal 1990 budget.
Major beneficiaries in the President's proposals are the arts-in-education program of the National Endowment for the Arts (designed to advance the arts as part of basic secondary-school teaching) and the humanities education, research and preservation projects of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Representative Sidney R. Yates, the Chicago Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee that originates the budgets for the three agencies, said last week: ''It's wonderful! This is the first time either the Reagan Administration or the Bush Administration has given the recognition to the arts, humanities and museums that is properly theirs.'' 
 
'A Balancing Act to Do'
Asked if his subcommittee would follow the President's lead when it prepared an appropriations bill, Mr. Yates said: ''My wish is to support the Administration's proposals, but I have to be aware of the fact that our bill is one which is vitally concerned with environmental matters. If those programs have not been given what they deserve, I think we will have a balancing act to do.''
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat whose subcommittee on Education, Arts and Humanities will be holding hearings on reauthorization of the endowments later this year, said: ''I'm pleased with the increase because it indicates that the President and the Administration have positive thoughts about the endowments. It does not keep up with inflation, but at least it goes in the upward direction rather than the downward or flat direction as it has in the past.''
Senator Pell added that he thought the increase reflected ''great credit'' on John E. Frohnmayer, chairman of the arts endowment, ''because the areas targeted are arts education and administration and those are areas that interest him.''
''It's a vote of confidence for Mr. Frohnmayer and Lynne Cheney,'' he said, referring also to the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Of the total figure of $364 million, $175 million is to go to the National Endowment for the Arts, an increase over fiscal 1990 of $3.7 million, or 2.2 percent; $165 million is earmarked for the National Endowment for the Humanities, an increase of $8.1 million, or 5.2 percent; and $24 million is to go to the Institute of Museum Services, an increase of $1.3 million, or 5.7 percent.
Both endowment chairmen expressed pleasure with the proposed increases in their budgets.
Mr. Frohnmayer said the biggest gain among arts endowment programs was a $2 million increase for the arts-in-education project, which channels money through state arts councils to support art education in public schools from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
He also emphasized that one of his personal goals - that of serving multi-cultural and rural arts services - would receive increased support, although it was not reflected in the budget request.
Other increases, he said, would be used to broaden the membership of the grant-making panels, and to provide increased travel money so that panel members could be better informed about arts activities throughout the nation.
Ms. Cheney said that major increases would go to finance such projects as the Teacher Institute at New York University, which is designed to help teachers learn more about the subjects they are teaching; research to help scholars produce editions of the papers of important figures in American history, and preservation projects like the microfilming of deteriorating books and newspapers.

A Boom on Vienna's Bourse

 BODY:
While the Frankfurt Bund has been the focus of this year's excitement over investing in the future of Eastern Europe, the Vienna Bourse has quietly crept higher and higher, setting nine new record highs. And this after 1989, a year it outperformed every other major market.
Both markets are on the edge of an economic revolution and have been swept up in the whirlwind of change. While Austrian stocks have paid off as an entree to hoped-for profits from the Eastern bloc, the small Vienna market does pose some worries. 
Its size can make it volatile. It fell almost 7 percent from its mid-January high before rallying to four new highs last week, partly on the announcement of East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow's proposal for the reunification of the two Germanies.
In addition, analysts say, far less information is available on stocks in the Austrian market than in larger markets. This makes it harder for an individual, or even fund managers, to follow the market.
As in West Germany, the easiest access to the market is through a single-country fund traded in the United States. Like the two German funds, the Austria Fund, at about 77 percent, is trading at a high permium to the underlying value of the stocks it owns.
The run-up in Austria means that the market may be close to overpriced, if it is not already. That could set it up for a big drop.
Still, the Austrian gain is far ahead of West Germany's. The market is up 26.7 percent this year, according to the Financial Times World Indices, while West Germany has risen just 7.3 percent, even with large gains on Thursday and Friday that sent it to a record high. In the last 12 months, West Germany was up 51.5 percent, but the Austrian market rose 130.4 percent. Austrian stocks have benefited more than West Germany's from the moves toward economic reform in the Eastern bloc. That is because Austria has a long-time relationship with the East, and Austrians have had important roles in many joint ventures there.
Some analysts also argue that the longer-term commitments some large investors make in the Austrian market means the Vienna Bourse is less volatile than other markets of a similar size.
The market's boom has been built on its tiny size, - Vienna's market capitalization is 7 percent that of Frankfurt and 1 percent the size of the United States markets. Because the market is so small, purchases that would barely cause a ripple elsewhere, can send a stock soaring in Austria. Conversely, large sales can send prices falling, making investors reluctant to take their money out. This reduces some volatility.
''This is not a trading market,'' said Marko Musulin, the head of the securities and investment banking division of Creditanstalt in Vienna, the country's largest bank. ''It is not easy to exit this market in large volumes.''
When these factors were added to the rising demand for Austrian stocks, the trend had to be up. Part of the demand came from the fact that Austria was so underrepresented in many international equity funds before the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9. After that, Morgan Stanley & Company recommended that the weighting given to Austrian shares be increased to 6 percent from 1 percent. In addition, several new closed-end mutual funds, including the Austria Fund, have added to the demand for stocks.
David C. Roche, the international strategist for Morgan Stanley in London, said that in addition to the attraction of Eastern Europe, Austria is benefiting from the possibility that it now, finally, has a chance to join the European Economic Community.
He also said that because Austrian accounting requirements with regard to disclosures are not too demanding, many companies and banks are loaded with hidden assets of land and stock that are just now being seen by many foreign investors.
But the strong rise in the market has caused concerns. One analyst said shares in have become ''ridiculously overpriced.''
An Austrian analyst, who asked not to be named, said a good downward move right now would be nice. It would, he said, lower prices enough ''so we could make some more attractive sales to our customers.''

A New, More Subdued, Mood at Shearson Lehman
 
An era of daring and deal-making at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. undoubtedly ended Tuesday night with the resignation of Peter A. Cohen as chairman and chief executive. His replacement, Howard L. Clark Jr., has been chief financial officer at the American Express Company, Shearson's corporate parent. Though Mr. Clark was once an investment banker himself, he is likely to have Shearson adopt the conservative ways of American Express, where traveler's check receipts are invested in safe, short-term municipal securities. Riskier activies - merchant banking, real estate and bridge loans - might be trimmed. Analysts say Shearson will gradually devote more effort to retail brokerage. American Express, after all, is a consumer company.
 

The Exchange After Phelan
 
Now comes the New York Stock Exchange's chance to see how well it can get along without John J. Phelan Jr. He announced Friday that he would retire as exchange chairman by the end of the year. Mr. Phelan has won credit for turning an exchange that was becoming anachronistic and conflict-ridden in the 1970's into one capable of trading hundreds of millions of shares a day with no strain. Balancing the rival interests of floor traders and investment houses, he convinced the exchange to invest hundreds of millions on computer technlogy. And after the 1987 crash, he gave investors reassurance and calm. A former floor trader himself, he began at the exchange as a runner. 
 
 
Whipping Up the Product Mix
 
The Philip Morris Companies sold more food than tobacco for the first time in 1989. But even after buying Kraft and its food brands - Jell-O, Cheez Whiz - in December 1988, the company still finds that tobacco accounts for about 65 percent of annual earnings. Philip Morris reported last week that fourth-quarter profits more than doubled to $863 million.
 
*
 
Coca-Cola profited from leaving the movie business. A $509 million gain from selling its interest in Columbia Pictures more than tripled fourth-quarter earnings, to $757 million.
 
*
 
The nation's largest steel company had a fourth quarter that appeared to repay its diversification into oil. Higher energy prices helped USX increase earnings 54 percent to $244 million.
 
*
 
Caesars World, it seems, got slaughtered at the baccarat tables. The company predicted sharply lower earnings for the quarter ending Jan. 31, and blamed bad luck in the casinos. As Henry Gluck, the company's chief executive, said, ''The laws of probability work in strange ways.''
 
*
 
 At Boeing, a 48-day strike cut fourth-quarter earnings 56 percent to $77 million.
 

One of Europe's largest drug companies said Friday it plans to buy a majority stake in Genentech Inc., the pioneering American biotechnology company. Roche Holding Ltd. of Switzerland is to invest $2.1 million for a 60 percent share of the company, with an option to buy the rest. As part of the agreement, Robert A. Swanson, Genentech's chief executive, would become chairman and G. Kirk Raab, president, would replace him.
 

 An Optical Computer?
 
It looks like the runner-up in a high school science fair. But the first optical computer, displayed last week, already has the ability to perform some operations as quickly as huge supercomputers. Researchers at A.T.&T.'s Bell Labs who developed the device hope that in several years optical computers will far surpass conventional machines. Instead of electric currents and silicon chips, the new computer uses laser beams, mirrors and lenses. Some scientists scoff at its commercial potential, while others foresee an optical computer on the market in a decade.
 

Executives on the Move
 
A five-year, $10 million package convinced Allen I. Questrom to become chief executive of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores on Friday. Questrom had initially turned down the job in favor of remaining chief executive of Neiman Marcus.
 
*
 
The Campeau Corporation might not sell Bloomingdale's after all. Federated Stores Inc., the company's American subsidiary, plans to spend the next month or two deciding whether to accept one of several bids. Meanwhile, Robert Campeau himself might be joining his stores in insolvency. Available records indicate that his $500 million fortune has shrunk with the plunge in Campeau stock, and he is in default on two major bank loans.
 
*
 
Thomas S. Murphy, who built Capital Cities/ABC Inc. from a bankrupt UHF television station in Albany into a $5 billion media empire, said Thursday that he will step down as chief executive May 31. Daniel B. Burke, the company president, is to succeed him.
 

S.&L.'s - It's Not Over Yet
 
Savings and loan news: Federal regulators seized Centrust Bank, Florida's largest savings and loan, on Friday. They said that management had wasted assets on yachts, art and oriental rugs. The regulators also announced on Friday the sale of Bright Banc Savings Association, one of Texas's largest S.&L.'s, to the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio. On the brighter side, American Savings Bank, of California, sold to the Robert M. Bass Group more than a year ago, reported a $214.2 million profit for 1989.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 

Greenspan on Recession
 
Don't count on the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates soon. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress last Tuesday that, based on the Government's index of leading economic indicators, his staff sees only a 20 percent chance of a recession in the next six months. The economic index, released Wednesday, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in December, the largest gain since April, even after accounting for the end of the Boeing strike in late November. But another figure last week pointed to continuing weakness. New home sales fell 9.6 percent in December and 3.8 percent for all of 1989, making it the slowest year since 1984.
 

Job Data, the Good and the Bad
 
Unemployment edged down one-tenth of a point to 5.2 percent in January. But Friday's unemployment report may not be as healthy as it seems. Manufacturing jobs fell for the 10th straight month, with the auto industry hit hardest. And Richard B. Freeeman, for one, a Harvard economist, argued that stagnant real wages are a more accurate guide to the economy than low, stable unemployment. ''If we hold the same unemployment rate for the next 20 years and do not have any real wage growth, that would be a disaster,'' he said. Recent wage improvements have only matched inflation, he added.
 
 *
 
Renewed aircraft business after the Boeing strike contributed to a 1.9 percent rise in factory orders for December. But excluding transportation, orders rose just two-tenths of 1 percent.
 

The Bush Budget
 
President Bush gave Congress a budget last week that would restrain military spending, lower capital gains taxes, expand some domestic programs while cutting others and sharply reduce the budget deficit. Democrats dismissed it as an impossible, impractical relic of the Reagan years. They reacted more warmly Wednesday night when the President, in his first State of the Union message, proposed sharp new reductions in Soviet and United States troops in Europe. Behind the budget battles this year will lie a fight over economics. The Bush Administration assumes a healthy 2.6 percent economic growth rate; the Congressional Budget Office, 1.8 percent. If the President is right, the deficit will meet his target of $63 billion; if Congress is right, the deficit will be $100 billion. The consensus of private economists is on the side of Congress. But the Administration was more optimistic than Congress and the economists last year - and the Administration turned out to be right.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 

ast and East, Head to Head
 
The opening of Eastern Europe and the availability of its low-wage labor force could hobble some Asian economies. Asia may be able to produce textiles and shoes more cheaply, but Eastern Europe offers better-educated workers to handle technology and electronics. As Ed Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, put it, that Asia's ''four tigers'' - South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -have less to fear than their poorer neighbors around the Pacific. With Eastern European workers available for capitalism, he said, ''It's almost as if you suddenly created a Philippines in the middle of Europe.'' But Eastern Europe's situation is ''like the Philippines in other ways,'' Mr. Hewett cautioned. ''Troubled.''
 

McDonald's in Moscow
 
The workings of digestible materialism culminated Wednesday in the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's. The chain's largest restaurant, smack on Moscow's Pushkin Square, was mobbed with customers eager for ''Beeg Meks.'' For McDonald's, the toughest task was drilling Soviet farmers and counter help in the ways of standardized production and relentless good cheer.

Taking Mr. Greenspan in Stride

 BODY:
The yen lost its punch this week, falling back to its level of 145 against the dollar. As for the West German mark, it continued strong, but the dollar only moved down a little against it. Suggestions from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that there was less chance of a recession seemed to have little impact. A strengthening in the economy would mean that the Fed is unlikely to ease interest rates, which could push the dollar lower. But the market did not think Mr. Greenspan's remarks hinted at a new bias toward raising interest rates. Indeed, Manuel H. Johnson, the Fed's vice chairman, said late in the week that he does not rule out lower interest rates in the future.

HEADLINE: G.M. Europe: How to Get Something Right

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: ZURICH

 BODY:
Intense pride radiates from Robert J. Eaton, president of the General Motors Corporation's European car operations. Intense fear, too.
The pride is easy to understand. At a time when the problems plaguing the North American operations of G.M. are approaching crisis proportions, a dramatic revival of the European business - reflected in its hot product line and its strong profits - shows that G.M. can get something right.
The revival also shows that success does not necessarily require vast sums of money: G.M.'s European factories are not nearly as automated as those in America. 
Bob Eaton's fear is also understandable. Japanese car makers, among others, have set their sights on Europe. And there are widespread predictions that the bloodbath that occurred in America in the 1980's because of overcapacity and the arrival of the Japanese will be replayed in Europe in the 1990's.
The attractions of the European market are obvious. One is the prospect of the 12-nation European Community becoming a single, barrier-free market of 325 million consumers. Whether that happens by 1992, as planned, or somewhat later, as is probable, the assumption is it will come to pass, and that will make it easier to sell cars throughout Europe.
The Western European market for passenger cars is already the world's largest (35 percent bigger than the market in the United States), and it is also expected to grow faster in the 1990's - 2 percent or more a year on average, versus 1 percent or less in the United States.
In addition, there is the tantalizing prospect, assuming those countries continue down the road toward market-oriented economies, that demand for cars will soar in Eastern Europe.
''There isn't one large manufacturer in the world that can afford not to be here,'' Mr. Eaton, a 49-year-old American, said in an interview in G.M. Europe's headquarters in Zurich. ''We are going to be facing a tremendous amount of competition that does not exist today.''
Even more frightening to Mr. Eaton, an engineer who was a corporate vice president in charge of G.M.'s engineering, design and research staffs before taking over in Europe in June 1988, is the thought that G.M. Europe may not be ready for the new challengers. Although it has made great strides in the last five years in its cost-competitiveness, G.M. Europe's manufacturing costs are still only about average in the industry. Ford's and Fiat's are much lower, analysts say. And G.M. Europe's costs are nowhere near those of the highly efficient Japanese.
The pressure on Mr. Eaton to close the gap is tremendous because the European operations have never been more important to G.M. The fat profits from Europe are important to both Ford and G.M., which are virtually neck and neck in the market, ranking fourth and fifth, respectively, in share behind Volkswagen, Fiat and Peugeot and just ahead of Renault. But they are especially crucial to G.M.
 
A Growing Dependency?
 Though G.M. sold only 1.5 million cars in Europe last year (versus 3.44 million in the United States), the division earned an estimated $2 billion, or half of G.M.'s estimated total; most of the rest of the parent's profit came from nonautomotive operations. Unless G.M. can reverse its slide in the United States, where its market share has dropped 10 points since the early 1980's, to about 35 percent, the dependency on Europe is only likely to grow.
''I don't think one can overestimate the importance of G.M. Europe to the entire G.M. organization,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz Mager Deitz & Bernie Inc., a New York investment firm. ''This is where the cash is coming from for investment in G.M. North America.''
Indeed, one risk over the next few years is that so much cash will have to go to North America that G.M. Europe will lose its momentum.
''The temptation will be enormous to bleed Europe dry and postpone model programs,'' said Daniel T. Jones, a professor at the Cardiff Business School at the University of Wales. ''That's G.M. Europe's major worry.'' As G.M. executives acknowledge, Detroit starved the company's European operations in the 1970's. Even in the 1980's, there was a limit to Detroit's generosity.
Mr. Eaton says he would have liked to have had more production capacity last year, when his division could not satisfy the demand for its cars. A source close to G.M. said executives in Europe pleaded for more money to expand production, but were turned down by Detroit.
Even so, G.M. Europe managed to thrive: Its market share rose to 11.2 percent, from 10.5 percent in 1988, the largest increase in the industry. In Britain, G.M.'s Vauxhall brand overtook Rover for the No. 2 spot behind Ford. On the continent, where G.M. cars are sold as Opels, G.M. is No. 2 in five nations, including West Germany, and No. 1 in the Netherlands and Norway. And the company could not come close to meeting the demand for its newest midsized car - sold as the Opel Vectra and the Vauxhall Cavalier. Consumers in many countries still have to wait five to six months for delivery.
''They're the most profitable of the European car manufacturers,'' said John K. Lawson, an analyst at the Nomura Research Institute Europe, a unit of the Japanese investment firm. He estimates that G.M. Europe has a profit margin of 14 to 15 percent, or at least two points better than each of its five major competitors.
Not bad for a division that was in such poor shape in the mid-1980's that G.M. considered selling or drastically shrinking it. That was when it was generating huge losses and everything from weak consumer demand for cars to the declining value of the dollar was going against it.
 
'A Success Strategy'
 ''We took a survival strategy and turned it into a success strategy,'' said Louis R. Hughes, chairman of the West German-based Opel.
The strategy for reviving G.M. Europe differed greatly from the one that G.M. has pursued in North America. Unlike its big brother, G.M. Europe did not try simply to throw money at its problems when it decided to enter the growing European market for very small cars, revamp the rest of its product line and renovate its factories.
''It turned around because, without mammoth investments, it developed good products that are efficiently built,'' said Ms. Keller, the analyst, of G.M. Europe. ''It is an organization that came together with a purpose. There are enormous lessons for North America and it is really astounding they have not been taken to heart.''
As strong as G.M. Europe now is, major challenges lie ahead. Those with the broadest product lines and geographical reach are expected to have the best chance of achieving the economies of scale needed to survive in a more competitive Europe.
In the geographical distribution of their sales, G.M., Ford and Volkswagen (helped by its acquisition of SEAT, the Spanish car producer) are in the best shape. Italy's Fiat and France's Peugeot and Renault are still heavily dependent on their protected home markets. As for market reach, Fiat and VW, which also owns Audi, have had the advantage of sporting a variety of distinct brands.
Ford and G.M.'s biggest weakness is in the luxury car market. Despite some good cars, they have had limited success using their own brand names to compete against the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
This explains Ford's $2.38 billion acquisition of Britain's Jaguar last year and G.M.'s $600 million purchase of a half interest in Saab, the Swedish car maker. It was the snob appeal of the two nameplates that Ford and G.M. were after. They plan to expand Jaguar's and Saab's product lines and make the small companies much bigger producers.
But it remains to be seen whether G.M. and Ford - and the rest of the industry, for that matter - will be able to defend their market shares against the Japanese. By exporting to Western Europe, the Japanese have already grabbed about 11 percent of the market. Undoubtedly their share would be even higher were it not for the protectionism of countries like Italy, France, Britain and Spain. As part of the program to turn the European Community into a single market, individual national barriers to the Japanese are expected to be eliminated over the next 5 to 10 years.
 
Crowded Future
 A related threat is that while there is not a huge amount of excess capacity now in Western Europe, there soon could be. Most of the big manufacturers in Europe are expanding. Nissan, Honda and Toyota are expected to be producing as many as 750,000 cars in Europe within five years. And others are on the way.
By 1995, all these factories will be capable of producing at least two million more cars than anticipated demand, Mr. Eaton predicts. And that does not include those that American, Japanese and European companies plan to build in Eastern Europe.
G.M. has entered into one of the biggest deals in the East: on Jan. 14, it announced the formation of a venture with RABA, a state-owned Hungarian company, that will initially produce 15,000 small Kadett cars a year for Eastern Europe.
While there is widespread optimism about Eastern Europe becoming a booming car market, that may take time. For that reason, and because of the need to earn hard currency, there will be pressure on many of the new ventures to export some cars to Western Europe.
Mr. Eaton also worries that increasing overcapacity in the United States will mean factories there also will try to export more to Europe.
With so many concerns, it is little wonder Mr. Eaton feels that G.M. Europe cannot be content with its accomplishments and he makes it clear that his greatest priority is slashing costs. ''We know we're not there yet,'' he said.
In fact, some analysts believe Ford has made as much if not greater progress in reducing its components costs, and Ford has more of its production and sales in Britain, where car prices are high and labor costs relatively low. Industry experts also say Ford has been more successful in persuading unions to agree to reductions in job classifications, which gives Ford more flexibility in how it uses its people.
But in persuading unions to allow it to expand production schedules at some plants, ''G.M. is really the pioneer,'' said Karl E. Ludvigsen, a Ford alumnus who heads a London-based automotive consulting firm bearing his name.
 
24-Hour Shifts
 An assembly plant in Antwerp, Belgium, operates six days a week, with two 10-hour shifts a day. The company's factory in Zaragoza, Spain, was the first car assembly plant in the world to go to three shifts, enabling it to run around the clock.
G.M. Europe executives constantly question the need for expensive automation. Manufacturing complexes like those at Luton near London and at Russelsheim, West Germany, G.M.'s largest worldwide, boast state-of-the-art paint plants and their fair share of robots. But they are not nearly as high tech as many G.M. factories in the United States or as Fiat's in Cassino, Italy.
Paul J. Tosch, chairman of the British-based Vauxhall, talks of automation sometimes ''standing in the way of continuous improvement'' in productivity. Unlike G.M. domestically, Vauxhall uses people, not robots, to put in windshields and backlights.
In all, during the 1980's, G.M. Europe spent only about $7.4 billion on capital expenditures, a relatively small amount considering the dramatic changes that were being made.
One big reason G.M. executives in Europe embraced this spend-less gospel is they had no choice: Detroit's priority was North America, and it would not write the money-losing European operations a blank check. But that decision pushed the technical development center at Russelsheim to design ease of manufacturing and quality into new cars.
Still, plenty remains to be done. G.M. Europe is still too dependent on its plants in West Germany, where workers are pushing for a shorter work week - even though they already work 600 to 800 fewer hours a year than the Japanese. And it takes Japanese companies just three years to develop a new car from scratch, versus about four for G.M. Europe. Herbert Oberhaus, Opel's director of product engineering, worries that with the Japanese setting up development centers in Europe, G.M.'s advantage in design could be eroded.
Clearly the battle is far from over for G.M. Europe, notwithstanding its remarkable turnaround. And from the way things look right now in North America, it is a battle that General Motors just as clearly cannot afford to lose.
 
LEADERS OF THE TURNAROUND
In many ways, there were two main heroes of the General Motors turnaround in Europe.
 One was Ferdinand P. J. Beickler, who headed Opel, the company's profitable West German-based division, until 1986 and served as G.M. Europe's first president until he retired in March 1987. G.M. Europe was formally created four years ago, in the hope of finally uniting what had been two bickering divisions - Opel and the struggling British-based Vauxhall.
The other hero was John F. Smith Jr., who was executive vice president for European operations before succeeding Mr. Beickler in the top job. In mid-1988, he was named corporate executive vice president for international operations in Detroit. Mr. Smith is seen by many as a man who could one day head G.M.
Mr. Beickler, who is 67 years old, was one of the chief architects of G.M.'s product revival in Europe, which began with the introduction of the tiny Corsa Nova in 1982. Until then, G.M. had not done well in many countries because it did not sell very small cars. By building the Corsa Nova in a new plant in Zaragoza, Spain, G.M. also got a foothold in what has become one of Europe's fastest-growing car markets. And in 1984, G.M. came up with a radical redesign of the Kadett Astra, a model that is the next size up from the Corsa Nova and is now G.M. Europe's biggest-selling car.
Jack Smith, 51, gets much of the credit from analysts for turning what had been a divided enterprise into a truly pan-European operation - in terms of marketing and distribution, cost structure and a united management.
When Mr. Smith and Mr. Beickler created G.M. Europe, they purposely located it in Zurich, outside of the fiefs of Opel and Vauxhall. Only then was it possible to challenge Opel's dominance over G.M.'s European operations and the company's dependence on manufacturing in West Germany, where costs are high.
The leadership torch has now been passed to Robert J. Eaton. Before succeeding Mr. Smith, Mr. Eaton was involved in the development of the recently unveiled electric car as well as the new Saturn division, G.M.'s boldest attempt to rethink how it makes cars in the United States.
In Europe, Mr. Eaton has already impressed outsiders by his ability to move fast - something for which bureaucratic G.M. is not famous. Perhaps the most obvious example was the way he snatched Saab away from a surprised Fiat. He also gets high marks for hammering out the recent deal to build cars and engines in Hungary.
 
DESIGNING HIGH-TECH GOOD LOOKS
Largely through the work of its engineers at the company's huge technical development center at Russelsheim, West Germany, G.M. Europe has shown that it can produce competitively priced cars that are technologically advanced on the inside and appealing on the outside, with a modern, aerodynamic look.
The aim has been to create cars that are reliable and functional. All have back seats, for instance, that fold down so that items can be loaded through the trunk up to the front seat.
''Vauxhall/Opel has been very adventurous in its new model programs,'' said Bob Murray, editor of the London-based Autocar and Motor magazine. ''Even their bread-and-butter cars like the Vectra/Cavalier are a cut above other cars in their class. Ford is being very safe in Europe with styling and Vauxhall is taking risks that are paying off.''
Analysts and car enthusiasts also heap praise on G.M.'s engines, which they consider superior to Ford's and at least the equal of those made by all the other big-volume manufacturers in Europe.
The performance of G.M.'s new three-liter, 24-valve, six-cylinder engine is one reason Autocar and Motor thinks the sporty, midsized Vauxhall Carlton GSi3000 24v is a better buy than BMW's 535i.
''It's quicker, it's much roomier and it's also 7,000 cheaper,'' Mr. Murray said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH

BYLINE: By Sarah Bartlett;
The January Effect: Just a Few Good Days

 BODY:
Investors would have done well to have dabbled in the stock market the first and last trading days of January, but to have taken to the ski slopes in between. The gains of 56.95 and 47.30 points, respectively, on those two days formed handsome bookends around what was otherwise a discouraging trounce.
The decline in January of 5.9 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average marked the worst monthly performance since the post-crash doldrums of November 1987. Investors blamed the usual suspects: disappointing corporate profits, lack of takeover speculation and the prospect of stable or rising interest rates. 
Last week, investors seemed determined to cut through some of the gloom and retraced some of their steps, sending the Dow up 43.47 points, to close at 2,602.70.
That rebound occurred despite an array of discouraging economic news. The Chrysler Corporation kicked February off with a bang with its announcement that it intends to close one of its St. Louis plants, reducing its car-making capacity by 20 percent and laying off 3,700 workers. That may have raised hopes in Hollywood for a new movie called ''Lee and Me,'' but it only served to remind investors of the wobbly state of manufacturing, and the jobs and income that that important sector provides.
The Government's employment report, which was released on Friday, provided the first solid evidence that the economy in January remained weak. In manufacturing, 112,000 jobs were lost.
Strong job-growth in the retail and construction industries was largely due to statistical quirks and good weather. And construction is likely to succumb to rising mortgage rates. For the first time in months, homebuyers now face rates of over 10 percent on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, according to HSH Associates in Butler, N.J.
Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank USA, thinks higher mortgage rates bode ill for consumer spending generally, a key prop to the economy, and thus, to the prospects for a rising stock market.
Perhaps it is not altogether surprising, then, to find that the Conference Board's consumer confidence index for January also sank to its lowest level since November 1987. ''What people are saying is not so much that things are bad right now, but that they are noticeably less optimistic about the future,'' said Jason Bram, an associate economist at the board.
Of course, all that could change if interest rates were to decline. But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dampened hopes for that when he testified before Congress last week.
He and his secretive colleagues will have a chance to change their minds when the Federal Open Market Committee meets this week. But since that meeting coincides with an auction of $30 billion of Treasury securities - and many traders are worried about lukewarm Japanese interest and the possibility of a sharp jump on Friday of the producer-price index - few think that the Fed officials will be so daring. That is not, after all, their strong point.

HEADLINE: The Classic Conglomerate Wades Into the 90's

BYLINE: By FROMA HARROP; Froma Harrop covers the defense industry for The Providence Journal-Bulletin.

 BODY:
It has a reputation for business aplomb, but Textron Inc., the Providence, R.I., conglomerate, is also a company that's found itself on the crest of trends. Back in the early 1950's, when single-mindedness was American corporate gospel, Textron's founder, Royal Little, decided he needed a strategy to protect his cyclical textile business, so he invented the modern conglomerate. In the 1960's, a Textron subsidiary, Bell Helicopter, rode the Huey, the signature aircraft of the war in Vietnam, to record profitability.
Now, conglomerates no longer seem visionary and Textron, the nation's 17th-largest military contractor, is out on the edge of a trend - toward global peace - that's problematic for defense-sector companies. President Bush's new budget avoids the deep cuts feared by the military, but his determination to pare away defense money over the next several years bodes ill for contractors.
Many of Textron's military projects have survived the cuts so far, but two of its pet projects - the M-1 tank, for which a subsidiary is making gas turbine engines, and the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor helicopter-cum-plane - have dicey futures. Textron has for years been conservative about allowing any one of its business segments to dominate the others, but between 1984 and 1989, its military component grew to 28 percent, from 19 percent, of revenues. Now, Textron appears to be inching back from the military. 
''We're used to thinking about changing markets,'' said Beverly F. Dolan, Textron's chairman and chief executive officer, during an interview in Providence, his soft Georgia accent an incongruous contrast to the icy panorama of Colonial and industrial New England outside his window. ''That's certainly one of the strengths of a conglomerate.''
Textron's deliberate strategy of spreading its earnings and investments among aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services gives it more flexibility than some of its behemoth competitors in defense. The General Dynamics Corporation, for example, realizes 85 percent of it sales from Government contracts; at the Northrop Corporation, that figure is 91 percent.
But contracting problems at Bell and a slowdown in the auto industry helped send third-quarter earnings down 5 percent, to $59.5 million or 66 cents a share. Mr. Dolan does not argue with analysts' estimates that operating earnings for all of 1989 will be around $3 a share, down from $3.10 in 1988. Revenues may show only a slight increase.
Textron's style of diversification was virtually unknown in 1952 when Royal Little, of Massachussets, founded the company. Seeking a way to counter the periodic booms and busts that plagued his textile mills, Mr. Little bought a slew of companies in unrelated industries.
Under Mr. Little, who died a year ago at age 92, Textron was soon producing eyeglasses, bathroom fixtures, motor castings, machine tools, poultry and lingerie. His acquisition spree culminated in the 1962 purchase of the Bell Aircraft Corporation for $32 million. Today, the company's 33 divisions employ 57,000 people in five countries and every state except Alaska. Textron has 142 manufacturing plants in North America.
Recent changes in the executive suite suggest that Textron is, if not backpeddling from defense, at least trying to bring the company into harmony with its conglomerate philosophy. In December, Textron hired James F. Hardymon, 55, president and chief operating officer of the St. Louis-based Emerson Electric Company, to fill the same positions at Textron. Mr. Hardymon is regarded as the likely successor to Mr. Dolan, 62, who is expected to retire in three years. Mr. Hardymon's strength, according to Mr. Dolan, is his experience in operations at Emerson, where defense contracts account for 10 percent of revenues. ''He was the guy who ran the train,'' Mr. Dolan said. Mr. Dolan came up through the ranks at Textron after it took over a golf-cart company he and his brother had founded, E-Z-Go in Augusta, Ga., in 1960. His familiarity with the factory floor contrasts with the more austere financial orientation of some of his predecessors, including Rupert C. Thompson, a Providence banker, and G. William Miller, a lawyer who became Secretary of the Treasury under President Carter. (Mr. Miller was recently named head of Federated Stores Inc., to help guide Robert Campeau's bankrupt American department store chain.) Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, says Mr. Hardymon's appointment sends a strong signal to stockholders that Textron intends to arrest the slide in its return on investments. Return on equity has slid, from 13 percent in 1987 to an estimated 11 percent this year. The appointment may also counter a perception that the company is unfocused. ''Hardymon looks like a crackerjack manager,'' Mr. Rubel said. Textron's faith in conglomeration is not universally shared, of course. ''Conglomerates create confusion,'' said Lawrence Lytton, a multi-industry companies analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''Investors prefer to make their own portfolio, as opposed to hiring a C.E.O. and being one step removed from the process.''
To dispel any notion of wild diversification, Textron has typically sliced its pie charts into just three segments: aerospace-technology, which currently accounts for 44 percent of revenues; commercial products, 26 percent, and financial services, 30 percent.
The recent increase in the defense segment is largely the result of two acquisitions: the Avco Corporation, an aerospace and financial services giant bought in 1985 for $1.4 billion and the Ex-Cell-O Corporation, a maker of aerospace and automotive products, bought in 1986 for $1.05 billion.
To finance the deals, Textron sold more than two dozen nondefense operations, including Shaeffer Eaton, a maker of pens and paper products; Bridgeport Machines, a machine tool maker, and the Ex-Cell-O packaging systems division. These sales still left Textron with long-term debt of $2.23 billion, uncomfortably high, according to analysts.
The financial services' strong showing, starring Avco Financial, has offset some of the problems in aerospace-technology. The ratio of bad loans is now under 2 percent, putting the financial segment, Mr. Rubel said, ''near the top'' in the industry.
Some older members of the Textron commercial products clan, are also doing well. E-Z-Go, Mr. Dolan's home base, has benefitted from a surge in golf's popularity. Homelite, a Charlotte, N.C., maker of chain saws and generators, enjoyed a $3 million sales boom after Hurricane Hugo struck last fall.
Meanwhile, Bell is having ''a very good year'' overall, according to R. Jackson Blackstock, a conglomerates analyst at First Boston in New York, because of its robust foreign military sales and a strong commercial business. Over the first nine months of the year, operating earnings at Bell rose 24 percent over last year's levels. Textron reports an 18-month wait for deliveries on its light commercial helicopters, the 206B Jet Ranger and 206L Long Ranger. And because more than half the helicopters now in use in the non-Communist world were made by Bell, the company does an ''enormous'' parts business, according to Mr. Dolan.
Textron's biggest disappointment continues to be the Defense Department's refusal to fund production of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, on which it has spent 30 years of research and some $200 million. But cancelled weapons programs typically flutter rather than plummet to ground, and the Osprey may well be headed for a reincarnation, with help from allies either on Capitol Hill or foreign markets. Cancellation domestically would force the company ''to go offshore to look for money,'' said Jack Horner, Bell's president. ''With that goes rights to building airplanes overseas and selling them back to the United States.''
That threat aside, Textron is already looking to the economic unification of Western Europe in 1992 as an opportunity for commercial products. Last summer, Textron's Davidson Instrument Panel division formed a joint venture to supply auto parts to a Ford Motor Company plant in the Netherlands. Textron also plans the $250 million acquisition of Avdel, an English rivet maker, now stalled by the Federal Trade Commission.
Despite areas of unsteadiness, Mr. Dolan seems to view the future with equanimity: ''This is a damn good time to be a conglomerate.''
 
COMING IN ON A WING AND A PRAYER
Even before recent events in Europe and the Soviet Union prompted discussion of deep cuts in the military budget, the defense-sector dollar was growing more elusive.
Several of Textron's military products - for example, the re-entry system for the MX missile, from Textron Defense Systems in Wilmington, Mass., and air-cushioned landing crafts, made at Textron Marine Systems in New Orleans - seem to be flourishing or holding steady.
But the effects of slowing Government funding were clear last year, when Textron Aerostructures in Nashville, which had employed 7,300 people during its 1986-88 heyday, laid off more than 4,000 employees after completing contracts to build wings for the B-1 bomber and the center wing section for the C-5 transport. New contracts for parts of the Airbus A330 resurrected only a few hundred jobs.
Defense Secretary Richard M. Cheney has so far spared another Bell program, the LHX (Light Helicopter Experimental), a new Army attack helicopter still in the demonstration stage. Bell is developing the LHX jointly with McDonnell Douglas Helicopter in Mesa, Ariz., in competition with a team from two other contractors.

The Flight to Safety

 BODY:
The flight to safety is on. Investors, worried about skittish stock and ''junk bond'' markets and lured by high interest rates, are shifting their cash to money-market funds. And fund experts say that investor nervousness shows no sign of clearing.
''Interest rates are hard to resist, and people are afraid of the market,'' said Brian S. Mattes, a vice president of the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. More than $1 billion flowed into Vanguard's money funds in January, double the amounts from one year ago. Right now, Vanguard's money-market fund pays 8.16 percent. 
At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, money-market sales in December were stronger than they had been in any month in the last three years, said Michael J. Hines, vice president of marketing. January sales rose a hefty 42 percent, bringing money-market assets at the Boston-based fund group to an all-time high, he said.
January's activity was a big shift from December's investment behavior, which was detailed last week in a report by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
The report, which showed strong yearend inflows of cash into stock funds, solid gains in international funds and growing investor disenchantment with junk-bond funds - $664 million flowed out of junk-bond funds - was clear evidence of just how volatile the markets have been.
The difference between December and January investor behavior may be most pronounced in equity funds. While fund managers reported a strong outflow of money from stock funds in January, in December, according to the trade-group report, investors slapped down $9 billion for shares in stock funds, more than double November's total.
Over all, investors poured more than $15 billion into stock and bond mutual funds in December. That was a $3 billion jump over November sales and the largest monthly inflow since just before the October 1987 market crash.
There has been a clear move away from stocks in January, but fund experts say that many investors who want to stay in the market are looking abroad. International funds rang in almost $650 million in December sales, making it one of the hottest mutual-fund investment categories. And fund experts say the January numbers promise to be strong, too.
Last month, sales took off in T. Rowe Price's International Stock Fund, which invests in large companies in well-established international markets, according to Steven E. Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. The group's International Discovery Fund, which invests in small-capitalization stocks in established and emerging markets around the world, did almost as well, he said.
Recent events in Eastern Europe have sparked investor interest there, of course, and the consensus seems to be that the economic environment will be stronger abroad this year. And the foreign markets weathered a tough January much better than we did here.
Despite gains overseas, international turbulence has fueled new interest in gold in recent weeks. The price of gold has been strong, and more people are looking at gold funds now, portfolio managers say.
Edmund Serfaty, portfolio manager of the United Services' Gold Shares Fund in San Antonio, said interest in his fund has been rising. ''People are hedging their bets because of the uncertainty in the financial markets, and because performance has been so good,'' he said.
In December, there was some evidence of the conservatism that would grow deeper in January. At yearend, growth-and-income funds - considered a conservative play because they pay hefty dividends but let investors keep one toe in the market, just in case - captured the lead as the fund category that showed the biggest percentage gain, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks fund performance.
Over all, sales of bond and income funds totaled $6 billion in December, a small dip from the preceding month, according to the institute. Long-term municipal bond funds, including national and single-state funds, rang in December sales of $2.1 billion, cementing a minuscule rise for the entire year.
Part of investors' dissatisfaction with fixed-income funds is carrying over into corporate bonds.
''You're seeing a shift to safety,'' Mr. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price said. ''People are concerned about rising interest rates, so we're seeing definite shifts from long-term bond funds into money-market funds.''

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Mr. Bush, You Must Raise Taxes

BYLINE: by LEE H. HAMILTON; Representative Lee H. Hamilton is a Democrat from Indiana.

 BODY:
At the end of 1989, as chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, I issued a report that concluded our top economic policy priority in 1990 should be eliminating the Federal budget deficit. Unfortunately, the budget proposed by President Bush last week breaks no new ground in dealing with the deficit.
The Office of Management and Budget director Richard G. Darman makes a compelling case against the deficit and its attendant erosion of our economic future. But the Administration proposes only a tired list of tried-and-failed tax ''incentives'' that give away more than they get; tried-and-rejected spending cuts that have failed to garner a majority of votes from even the President's party in Congress; and $13.9 billion of ''revenue enhancements.'' 
The letters I received after the report was issued indicate that most Americans are seriously concerned about the deficit. They have an intuitive understanding of how the deficit has soaked up savings and eroded our economy over the long term by pre-empting domestically financed investment. However, the same Americans question the need for any kind of tax increase.
Why must a tax increase be part of a workable deficit reduction plan? In part, this conclusion is an economic judgment - we cannot grow our way out of the deficit. It is also a political judgment - other approaches to reducing the deficit, including relying on spending cuts alone, have not worked in the past and will not work in the future.
The deficit has been stuck at over $150 billion for the last three years, despite forecasts that were far lower. In fact, Congress and the Administration claimed to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets in each of those three years, but the actual deficits turned out to be far higher. The deficit has not faded away, contrary to the forecasts, because economic growth has been slower than predicted and interest rates have been higher, which reduces the Government's revenues and increases its interest costs. Future growth is unlikely to match the Administration's rosy forecast, in part because the Federal Reserve has clearly signaled its resolve to hold growth at about its current level to control inflation.
We have not reduced the deficit through spending cuts, despite the determination of the Reagan Administration. That is because there are not sufficient opportunities to cut spending without harming important national interests. Interest on the national debt - which is the fastest growing single item in the budget and cannot be cut - along with Social Security, Medicare for the elderly and defense spending, accounts for approximately 70 percent of total spending. This leaves little else to cut. And because these four programs are so large and have grown so fast over the last decade, the rest of the budget has been squeezed.
Many of the programs often thought of as targets to balance the budget are in fact quite small. Our deficit in 1989 was $152 billion. Against that figure, total American foreign aid was less than $7 billion, and much of that assistance comes back to the United States as expenditures for American farm products and manufactured goods. The total Congressional budget (which includes maintenance of the buildings and grounds, the Capitol Police, the Library of Congress and other activities that are often forgotten) was less than $2 billion. No cuts in these small programs, however desirable, could possibly eliminate the deficit.
The ''peace dividend'' that is expected to follow from reduced tensions in Eastern Europe is welcome, but it will be years in coming.
There were many good ideas about cutting the deficit in the 1984 Grace Commission report to the Reagan Administration, and most of them have been adopted. However, although the Commission claimed to have found enormous potential savings in the budget, a review revealed that the savings would be only one-third of what was originally claimed and that 16 percent of those savings would come as a result of higher taxes rather than spending cuts. In addition, much of the rest of the savings would come not from eliminating inefficiency or waste, but from cutting actual services delivered.
Likewise, procedural tools proposed to reduce the deficit - budget-process reforms and balanced budget amendments - would have limited effect. You cannot solve a substantive problem with a procedure; hard decisions must still be made, and in the absence of the will to make them, a way will be found to circumvent the procedure. Our experience with Gramm-Rudman proves this. A line-item veto would apply only to a small fraction of spending; it could not reduce Social Security benefits, Medicare payments, the interest on the debt, or defense or other costs involving long-term contractual obligations. Further, a President with a line-item veto would be likely to bargain for spending for a program he wants,like Star Wars, by offering not to veto a program that a member of Congress wants, like a new dam or Federal building in his or her state or district. The result would be more spending.
My best political judgment, on the basis of the experience of the last decade, is that we are unlikely to eliminate the deficit either through spending cuts or tax increases alone. Neither course is politically acceptable. Therefore, the only realistic solution is a package deal that includes both spending cuts and a moderate tax increase. There are many options for such a moderate tax increase that would not involve increases in income tax rates.
The deficit is so large that everyone will be unhappy with at least some elements of any program to eliminate it. We will never break the political gridlock unless we all agree to accept some changes that we do not like, in order to improve our economic future.

Rite Aid's Silver Lining

 BODY:
The cover of the 1988 annual report of the Rite Aid Corporation, the nation's largest drugstore chain, seems oddly prophetic today. It showed a workman in a hard hat buffing one of the company's giant red-white-and-blue signs. Last April, almost exactly a year after the report was issued, the company's president stood accused of attempting to bribe a member of Ohio's pharmacy board, a giant-sized smudge that is still clouding the market's view of the company.
But in the eyes of at least a few bargain-hunters, the bad news about Rite Aid is good news for investors interested in buying a quality stock at a bargain price. 
The last year's headlines have been lurid enough to scare away all but the fearless. After a flamboyant raid at a Cleveland airport hotel in April, local prosecutors arrested Martin L. Grass, the company's president and the son of Rite Aid's founder and chairman, Alex Grass, on charges of attempted bribery. In August, a judge unsealed the indictment that accused Mr. Grass and the company of offering a bribe to secure the resignation of the pharmacy board member, who was also a consultant to a chain of stores Rite Aid had purchased.
Lawyers for the defendants deny the bribery charge and characterize the payment as simply the company's buyout of the consultant's contract with the acquired company. The case is scheduled to come to trial in Ohio's Cuyahoga County on April 16.
Even the stalwarts who were unperturbed by the news out of Ohio apparently lost heart in December, when the company reported third-quarter results. Rite Aid earned only a dime a share from its continuing operations, down from 38 cents in the same period of 1988, but the 1989 figure reflects adjustments for the costs of closing the video rental departments in its stores.
The company's stock, which had slipped on news of the April arrest but recovered to nearly $41 a share in July, tumbled once again; its price has hovered around $31 in recent weeks.
To look at the stock's performance, one would think that nothing is going right at Rite Aid. But that view is simply wrong, said Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management Inc. of Boston and one of the pickiest value-hunters around.
Mr. Black manages $900 million in assets for a roster of clients that includes Yale, Stanford and several other major universities. He shuns any company that does not consistently earn at least 15 percent on shareholders' equity, or that cannot generate abundant amounts of cold cash from ongoing operations. And he absolutely refuses to buy a stock unless its price is less than 10 times the company's estimated per-share earnings for the coming year.
Mr. Black started buying Rite Aid stock a few weeks ago and is still at it. ''We really don't get many chances to buy a retail drug chain at this price,'' he explained. ''I mean, any idiot can buy Wal-Mart at 20 times earnings. I have to take good companies with good records when they've fallen on hard times.''
Rite Aid's record for the last decade certainly stacks up well, even when compared with the Walgreen's chain, the current favorite among most drugstore analysts. Figures compiled by Bart Schneider, an analyst for the Value Line Investment Survey, show that Rite Aid's cash flow per share has climbed steadily, from $1.13 in 1980 to an estimated $4.50 last year. Cash flow at Walgreen's, by contrast, was just 88 cents a share in 1980 and $3.59 a share last year.
Rite Aid's reliable river of cash has helped the company to grow considerably and to diversify a bit. In the last two decades, it has accumulated nearly 2,400 drugstores in 22 states - more than any other major chain - and added the Encore Books chain, a discount auto parts chain and a fleet of dry-cleaning outlets.
Helped by those acquisitions, its sales have grown an average of 15 percent a year since 1980; Walgreen's average sales growth for that period was 13 percent. And Rite Aid's profit margins have been equal to or stronger than Walgreen's during this time.
Mr. Black concedes that Rite Aid's margins were slimmer in 1989, when the company bought new computer equipment to speed shoppers through the checkout lines and improve record-keeping - steps that will ultimately benefit earnings. He said he expects margins to improve this year, pushing 1990 earnings up to $3.20 a share.
The share of Rite Aid's profits derived from drug sales and health and beauty items, as opposed to general merchandise, is high by industry standards. This profit mix, Mr. Black explained, is both a blessing and a safety net for the company. General merchandise sales generally suffer more in a recession than sales of drugs or other health-related products. And prescription drug sales are likely to get a substantial boost as the nation's population grows older.
As for the dramatic developments in Ohio? Both Mr. Schneider and Mr. Black are distinctly unconcerned. ''We think the bad news related to the trial may actually present investors with a buying opportunity from time to time,'' wrote Mr. Schneider in a recent review of the company's long-term prospects.
Mr. Black agrees. ''The business is going to do well, irrespective of this Mr. Grass,'' he explained. ''It's not like the company is falling apart. You can look at the numbers.''
In Mr. Black's view, this is a case where turmoil creates opportunity. ''By the time everything straightens out and the earnings come through and the stock is at a 15 P/E,'' he said, everybody on the Street will be recommending Rite Aid.

 
L.A. GEAR'S INVESTORS ARE FEELING THE BURN
It was just a typical week for investors in L.A. Gear, a high-flying California clothing manufacturer whose stock has taken more bounces than a Malibu aerobics class.
On Monday, after the stock opened at $27.125, the company announced profits of $3.01 a share for the fiscal year that ended Nov. 30. The market had been hoping for more. The stock fell $2.75, or more than 10 percent.
''Enough,'' said Jay J. Meltzer, a Goldman Sachs analyst. On Tuesday, he recommended L.A. Gear to his firm's traders. The stock steadied somewhat.
On Wednesday, the company named Kevin J. Ventrudo, a young investment banker, as its new chief financial officer - perhaps reminding the market that the post had been vacant for a year. By Thursday night, the shares had sunk to $23.375.
But Friday brought reports of stronger January orders, rumors that the company is adding a new celebrity to its endorsement roster, and a stock rebound to $25.25 a share. ''It's just very hard to call the moves on this stock,'' sighed Brenda Gall, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.

The President Looks On the Bright Side, And It's in Europe

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is hard for most of the world to focus these days on anything other than Europe, as events there tumble forward, pell-mell, and last week President Bush proved to be no exception. Not only did he propose, in his first State of the Union address, radical new cuts in Soviet and American combat forces, but he also gave Mikhail S. Gorbachev another salute, as he described it, for encouraging peaceful change in what used to be called the satellite states.
That's what was new, so that's what made the news, even if it tended to emphasize again that the main action is elsewhere, despite Mr. Bush's bold assertion that ''America stands at the center of the widening circle of freedom.'' Washington is more and more aware that the President and the United States are secondary players in this drama that is transforming a continent, day by day and week by week. 
But the speech and the new Federal budget, which preceded it by two days, had other, subtler messages, which were all but lost in the shouting. At the end of his first year in the White House, Mr. Bush marked out some trails that he intends to follow.
All in all, he showed a marked preference for foreign policy over domestic, to no one's surprise. This President, after all, held three major foreign-policy posts earlier in his career. What is more, the questions of foreign affairs are more tractable just now than the questions of domestic affairs, with the single, notable exception of China. Having barely escaped humiliation by Congress over his insistence on keeping close links to Beijing, Mr. Bush elected not to press the issue last week. He did not mention China once in reporting on the state of the union.
Foreign policy is also relatively cheap. The prospect of reducing American troop strength in Europe to 225,000 (and if the Democrats and the eastern Europeans have their way, well below that) will eventually mean money saved, even if some of it will be spent on economic aid to Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the rest. And saving money is in with politicians of both parties.
There were standing ovations Wednesday night when Mr. Bush called for an end to bigotry in the United States, and when he announced the troop cuts, and when he proclaimed his military triumph in Panama. But what really brought whoops of pleasure from the assembled Senators and Representatives, the Republicans and some Democrats, was the President's reiteration of his pledges not to raise taxes.
Yet hewing to that policy, and also striving to reduce the deficits that he inherited from Ronald Reagan, leaves Mr. Bush with little room to maneuver.
''The money is there,'' he said, in sharp contrast to his comment on taking office a year ago that ''we have more will than wallet.'' Clearly, he has been reading the poll-takers' findings as the nation enters an election year in which the Republicans hope to lay the groundwork for regaining control of Congress. The voters are worried about education and drugs and the environment, the polls say, so Mr. Bush offered increased funds for Head Start and more work on global warming and an intensified war on cocaine.
There was something, in other words, for almost everyone. But there was no suggestion that national calamities lurked or that national sacrifices were needed; indeed, Mr. Bush seemed consciously to have avoided picking any one or two or three problems - the homeless, say, or competitiveness - as cause for warning.
Most Presidents feel that they must act boldly, must innovate, in the first year or so of their terms, while they have a new mandate and their teams are full of the energy that Washington eventually saps from even the most vigorous.
Mr. Bush clearly does not intend to do that, at least in the domestic field. As in his invasion of Panama, and in his speech on Europe at NATO headquarters last summer, he showed in the troop-reduction plan the capacity to surprise those who have criticized him as too passive, but that capacity has been confined to foreign affairs.
He sees a modest role for himself and the Government at a time when difficult problems - AIDS, the homeless, medical costs, industrial decline, poverty, child care - seem to need fresh and, some would argue, huge attention. Instead of stirring calls to the nation to follow him in solving problems, Mr. Bush asked grandfathers and grandmothers, fathers and mothers, to talk to the younger generation. The thousand points of light were back: ''We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need.'' It was all very nebulous.
In a way, this budget and this State of the Union address represented a gamble. Clearly, Mr. Bush thinks the country is basically satisfied. Clearly, he believes that however many ills it sees, it believes that government is only a part, and probably only a very small part, of a solution. Clearly, he thinks that limited government action, combined with ample reassurances that he feels and cares, will prove politically adequate.
Hence the plethora of symbolic actions of which he spoke - planting a billion trees, transforming the Environmental Protection Agency into a full-fledged department with a seat at the Cabinet table, asking Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to ''review'' the already voluminous studies about how to get soaring medical-care costs under control.
Hence, also, the evocative, emotional talk at the end about holding his 12th grandchild - ''the little guy'' - in his arms, and of the centrality of faith and family. If there had been pictures and music with it, it would have made a great campaign commercial.
Which is, to be fair, what the State of the Union address has become in this age of television. Once, Congress was the principal audience, and the talk was technical, a presentation by a professional to professionals; that was what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they provided for periodic reports by Presidents. But now the ''target group,'' to use the language of marketing, is the whole country, and images and moods count, not numbers and analysis.
And in 1990, as in 1988, the mood that George Bush seeks to project is nostalgic, warm, safe, steady.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
For the Sudan, Famine Is Almost As Certain As Civil War

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan

 BODY:
POTENTIALLY one of the most prosperous agricultural spots in Africa, the Sudan is facing yet another famine, this time caused not by weather but by war.
Unlike in 1988, when Western relief officials insisted that they had been unaware of the hunger that caused 250,000 deaths in the country, international plans have been made to alleviate the suffering that is sure to come. But the junta in Khartoum and its southern rebel opponents are putting military and political tactics first as they push for battlefield victories before the annual rains that begin in May. Both sides are refusing to allow the humanitarian work that the southern Sudan depends on because fighting or fear of fighting prevent planting and harvesting. 
With travel so precarious in the southern region and the flight of so many displaced to the north and into Ethiopia, neither the United Nations nor the International Committee for the Red Cross has an accurate picture of the number of people left in the southern Sudan. Those likely to be affected by famine could range from one million to three million.
In neighboring Ethiopia, also locked in a civil war, an even larger famine is in the making with more than four million people needing food aid because of widespread drought. Both the Ethiopian Government and the rebels are bargaining with Western powers for donations of food, knowing that the side with the most relief can also be the most powerful.
Hopes are somewhat higher that starvation can be averted in Ethiopia. In the province of Eritrea, there has been a long lull in fighting and the relief effort appears well run.
The Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam, wanting to impress Western donors, has offered to allow Ethiopian church groups to take food to Tigre, a province entirely controlled by rebels, where at least one quarter of the four million Ethiopians who are at risk live. The Tigrean rebels have yet to agree. But even if they do not, peasants moving to the border between Tigre and parts of Eritrea controlled by the Government could pick up food now arriving in large quantities at Massawa, an Ethiopian port.
The difficulties in the Sudan seem more intractable. The leader of the military Government, Maj. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, has said that he favors continuing the United Nations relief operation that went into full swing last year. But the Government's actions suggest otherwise. Planes carrying food, medicine and relief workers to rebel-held territory were banned last November, two-way radios used by relief workers in isolated areas to keep in contact with their headquarters in Khartoum have been taken by the army, and aid officials are having difficulty getting travel permits. The snarling tone of a top Government official, Abu Geziza, who recently asserted that humanitarian aid helped the rebels, also cast severe doubts on the junta's sincerity.
 
A Trickle of Aid
Against this hostility, the United States, the chief financial backer of last year's United Nations relief effort, appears virtually impotent. Economic aid to the Sudan, once one of Washington's best-kept clients in Africa, will end this month under a Congressional law halting aid to a junta that toppled a democracy. A trickle of military assistance still flows, but not enough to hold any leverage over the Government.
Washington is increasingly frustrated as aircraft paid for with American funds to transport food, medicine and relief workers stand idle. A plane that had permission from Sudanese officials to fly after the ban took effect was shot down, killing three workers of Doctors Without Borders, an organization that specializes in medical aid. Aid workers believe that Government soldiers fired on the plane to deter other flights.
The rebels, whose group is known as the Sudan People's Liberation Army, have their own tactics for stalling relief work. Last month, the Khartoum Government said it might reconsider allowing supply planes into the southern Sudan if Sudanese officials could check all flights for weapons before they left for the rebel-held areas. The guerrillas said they wanted nothing to do with the plan. In the meantime, they have urged the residents of Juba, most of them displaced peasants, to move to the countryside, where there is no food, so the rebels can have a free hand to bomb the town.
The looming famine and the collapse of the relief operation are perhaps nowhere more evident than in the hamlet of Abyei, in the region that divides northern and southern Sudan. Last year shipments of food were plentiful and the village had a hospital with medicine and doctors. But a few weeks ago, the last foreign aid worker, stranded without radio communication, drove out of the town after shooting broke out. The hospital is without supplies, and what dwindling food is left in Abyei for its 40,000 people is under the control of the army commander from the north. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that up to 100,000 southern Sudanese will try to trek toward Abyei in coming weeks. Because there was relief food in Abyei last year, the southern Sudanese will expect it again and will be shocked to find there is not enough this time.
The refusal of both sides to take part in serious peace talks to end the seven-year war, the growth of the Government-backed militia and the successful push by the rebels across the southwestern swath of the country suggest that war will persist as famine relief fades away. And once again, residents of the southern Sudan - despised by the junta, neglected by the rebels who are supposedly fighting for them and seemingly beyond the reach of the international community - are likely to face starvation.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Farm Economy Is Fine, And Can Expect More Aid

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first farm subsidy law on May 12, 1933, he promised it was a temporary measure. At a time when people were hungry, he remarked, the Government had no business propping up prices by paying farmers to hold back their harvests. Now, nearly 60 years later, the payments are as much a part of American agriculture as the sun and rain, and tremendously expensive as well.
This year, Congress is again reviewing what has become as much an entitlement program as an industrial policy. Grain farmers have come to depend on the subsidies for a substantial portion of their incomes, and urban voters have not protested the high costs. 
Lawmakers also credit the programs for helping end the worst farm depression in half a century. As a result, few changes in the law are expected; the restiveness in rural America has been calmed by the new prosperity, and now more attention is being given to other issues in agriculture, particularly the use of pesticides.
In the 1980's, crop subsidies cost the Treasury $133.5 billion. Most of the money was spent after 1985, when Congress enacted amendments to the farm law that President Reagan said were gallant attempts to reduce the Government's role in agriculture.
 
The Controlling Hand
The farm subsidy program, which applies to 14 farm products, is a voluntary social contract between the Department of Agriculture and farmers. The Government pays cash to farmers for every bushel they produce - the payment for corn, for example, is about $1 a bushel - in exchange for a promise that they will leave a specified amount of their land fallow. The goal is to control production from year to year and to prevent huge surpluses. What the 1985 legislation did was lower the per-bushel price that the Government paid the farmers.
As if to mock the President, the farm economy worsened, and spending on subsidy programs reached a peak of $25.8 billion a year later. In 1986, the Government spent $11.9 billion - or the equivalent of the budgets of the Departments of State, Justice and Interior combined - just to reduce supplies of one crop, corn.
But in the last two years, farmers have earned record incomes. In large part because of the drought in 1988 and poor weather in other nations, surpluses have decreased, market prices have gone up, and demand around the world for American grain, soybeans, cotton and rice is increasing.
At the same time, the 1985 farm law lowered the Government-set prices of American commodities for overseas buyers and gave them generous subsidies. Farm exports reached $40 billion last year, the highest since 1981, and spending on the farm program is expected to fall to $8.1 billion this fiscal year, the lowest since 1984.
As a result, Congressional leaders now consider the 1985 farm law, which expires this year, a rousing success.
So pervasive is the subsidy program's presence in American agriculture, particularly in the grain belts of the Middle West and Great Plains, that small changes in policy can lead to huge consequences for hundreds of thousands of farmers. In no decade was this clearer than in the 1980's. In 1981, Congress acted to increase steadily the subsidies paid to farmers, encouraging more growers to join the programs. But the Government did not require farmers to take enough land out of production. Production soared. The corn harvest in 1985 was a record 8.9 billion bushels, 1.4 billion bushels more than it was last year.
At the same time, the high value of the dollar and a deepening world recession sharply reduced exports, filling storage bins with surpluses that caused prices to collapse and plunging agriculture into the worst depression since the 1930's.
The fundamental change that Congress made in the subsidies in 1985 was to lower the target prices set by the Government to guarantee farmers a certain income per bushel produced. In addition, the legislation took record amounts of land out of production.
Lower production helped to cut surpluses. Reduced target prices made American grain more competitive with foreign crops. Gradually American farm exports have climbed. Sales of corn overseas in the last two years have been higher than at any time since 1981.
Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter has made it clear that he is not looking for much change in the subsidy programs beyond an attempt to reduce their cost. Members of Congress from both parties say that a small drop in the target prices is possible and would help to cut the deficit, but that large price decreases would be unfair to farmers. Since 1986, the Government's target prices for grain have fallen 10 percent even as inflation increased by 20 percent.
A result of the strongest farm economy in a decade is that other agricultural issues have begun to command attention in Congress. The most important of these is a debate over the extent of pollution caused by modern cultivation practices and of the threat to food safety from pesticides and drugs used in agriculture.
For the first time, consumer organizations and environmental groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Audubon Society, are poised this year to join the debate on farm policy. Both groups are looking for new provisions in the law that would reduce the use of toxic chemicals and drugs in farming.
 
Friends on the Hill
How successful they are likely to be is difficult to predict. The big environmental groups command respect on Capitol Hill because of their scientific expertise and their wide public support. They also have an ally in Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, one of Congress's leading environmentalists.
The House Agriculture Committee and its chairman, Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, have not been nearly as friendly. Out of concern that farmers would lose too much, the House committee has consistently blocked legislation to restrict pesticides.
The ideological difference between the two chairmen, members of both committees say, will almost certainly result in separate farm proposals that will be similar in the economic provisions but differ substantially in programs that affect food safety and the environment. If the divisions are so deep that they could not be resolved, the 1985 law would simply be extended for a year.
The committees are beginning the debates this month. Mr. Leahy and Mr. de la Garza have assured farmers that they intend to produce new legislation this year, and both set ambitious schedules to conclude deliberations well before the elections in the fall.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Dinkins's First Budget Has Some Hard Edges

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
DAVID N. DINKINS, who once was dismissed by a critic as ''Mr. Smoothie with no position,'' proved last week what dividends such derision can bring. Presenting his first preliminary New York City budget as Mayor, he won praise partly for taking an unpopular stand.
''I will not allow tough times to become an excuse for foolish choices,'' Mr. Dinkins said as he proposed a $27.8 billion plan that would amount to the worst of both worlds: $550 million in new taxes and at least $226 million in cuts, from fewer police officers to shorter library hours. 
That phrase sounded so familiar that some people wondered if Mr. Dinkins's predecessor, Edward I. Koch, had used it. No proof was found, but the fact remained that Mr. Dinkins's cautious fiscal posture looked much like Mr. Koch's.
Still, the new Mayor's approach was his own. When a television commentator demanded tersely why it was not foolish to add to some programs but delay the hiring of some police officers, Mr. Dinkins replied, ''Perhaps if we educated our children better, if we provided opportunity and jobs, police might have less work to do.''
Now Mr. Dinkins faces the harder task of selling his plan to close a budget gap of more than $1 billion for the fiscal year that starts July 1. He wants to persuade the Legislature to pass a $200 million three-year tax surcharge on personal income that would cost the average city resident $70, and the City Council to raise property taxes by $180 million, or about $33 for a typical homeowner. But with state legislators staring at huge budget gaps of their own in an election year, and Council members reluctant to hurt their homeowning constituents, asking will not guarantee getting.
''We will leave no stone unturned,'' Mr. Dinkins pledged, adding that he believed he could be a cheerleader for New York, albeit in his own subdued way. ''We are going to travel the length and breadth of the city, to Albany,'' he said. ''I know how to say please and to plead our case, and I think that we will be successful.''
 
Many Uncertainties
Mr. Dinkins's plan depends on other uncertainties, including $300 million for the sale of the old Coliseum site at Columbus Circle, which is being held up by a lawsuit. And any plan for more taxes must avoid driving away businesses, which could further weaken the economy.
Because he is new, Mr. Dinkins will undoubtedly benefit from some good will that the combative Mr. Koch could not count on toward the end of his tenure. At the same time, Mr. Dinkins will also have to contend with the high expectations of a constituency eager for change.
But he said: ''I think that we have some credibility. I think that people generally believe that the economy is where we say it is, that the revenue picture is where we say it is.''
Asked if his warning of even deeper service cuts if taxes are not passed was intended as a bludgeon to get the Legislature and Council to act, Mr. Dinkins said he preferred to call it a ''mild entreaty.'' His challenge is to make his quiet approach work.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
The Soviet Oil Industry Has Two Decades' Worth Of Progress to Be Made

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
AS the Soviet Union strives to modernize its economy and match the performance of countries with free markets, it begins with an energy industry that missed the important events of the last 20 years. The Soviets are the world's largest producers of oil, but they were never driven to the productivity advances required in the West by years of competition and the price collapse of 1986. And on the demand side, both the industry and consumers missed the conservation lessons of the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979.
The challenge now is to produce enough oil to meet domestic needs - which presumably will rise with more consumer demands - and enough to sell abroad for vitally needed hard currency. Fuel exports account for about 40 percent of the country's foreign exchange. 
Instead, production has started to slip, experts say, probably to below 12 million barrels a day, about half a million barrels below the peak in 1987. The trouble in Baku, the center of the country's oil service industry, presages worse to come. These difficulties are watched closely by outsiders; this week the OPEC News Agency quoted an official of the cartel who suggested that Eastern Europe would be unable to rely on the Soviets for future energy needs.
A stumble in the Soviet Union's energy production would be felt worldwide, because it is currently the world's biggest energy producer and because it is likely to remain a huge source for decades to come. The Soviet Union has about 8 percent of crude oil reserves, more than double the United States level, and more than any other country except Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In natural gas, the Soviet Union is first in production and potential, with about 43 percent of the world's reserves.
United States Government and private experts describe a Soviet oil production picture similar to that in the United States: deposits that are easily reached have largely been found and exploited, leaving the smaller, deeper targets.
''The underlying problem is a shortage of really good prospects,'' said Thane Gustafson, a professor of government at Georgetown University and a consultant on Soviet energy for Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Massachusetts.
''The Soviets have been going at it with the technology of the 40's and 50's,'' he said. ''When Western oil companies come on the scene, they find the sweetest part of the cake nibbled out, but all around the edges are places the Soviets have passed by.''
Without the competitive urge, Soviet engineers have not developed advanced techniques, now common among Western multinationals, for finding and drilling in harsh environments, or recovering a larger portion of the oil in underground reservoirs. ''The opportunities over there are probably so significant that nobody would believe you if you described them,'' said Herbert M. Ryan, a spokesman for Dresser Industries, a Dallas-based oil field service company. ''They are mammoth.''
Dresser and other American companies would love to have access to the Soviet market. The oil companies have a well-developed way for dealing with countries with no capital: in exchange for permission to drill, they split the oil that is produced. Dresser now sells about $100 million a year worth of equipment and services to the Soviet Union but believes the potential is far larger. But the country may prove less eager than third world hosts; a rising tide of environmentalism and Russian nationalism could mean trouble for projects that would industrialize pristine areas for the benefit of foreigners. Labor shortages and worker disgruntlement may be other obstacles to drilling in the most remote areas.
In addition, some practices have reduced the possibilities of expanding production, even with advanced technology, experts say. An example of this is the large-scale pumping of water into the ground to make the oil flow toward the wells. Though this method increases the amount of oil recovered, companies say, it also reduces efficiency, because at some point the water starts coming back up with the oil.
In American fields, the practice is used mainly at sites where most oil has already been extracted. The Soviet producers, on the other hand, flood even new fields with water. This allows them to reach high production levels faster, experts say, but decreases the total amount that can be recovered over the life of the sites. Now many Soviet wells are recovering mostly water. ''There is no way of assessing efficiency, and no incentive for enterprise,'' said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst with Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London. ''All they can talk about is volume.''
Inefficiency also shows up on the the consumption side. ''Moscow is full of overheated buildings, with the windows wide open in the dead of winter,'' said Thomas McHale, an energy economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert and a frequent traveler to the city. ''It's the most inefficient economy you can imagine.''
Soviet energy use has roughly paralleled economic activity. In contrast, the American economy has grown one-third faster than energy use, because of rising efficiency, and even greater gains have been achieved in Western Europe and Japan.
In theory, a centrally planned economy should have some advantages in addressing this problem: it could simply order factories to make fuel-efficient cars and better-insulated refrigerators, rather than relying on consumer preference, which may be shortsighted.
But such a world has never materialized. The result is an industry in deep trouble, at the very time that its productivity is needed to fuel the stagnant economy into prosperity.
On the global scale, a Soviet oil shortage could temporarily disrupt the international market, by contributing to a shortage that could cause a major price swing. When the world is short of spare production capacity, the market is sensitive to even small changes in the supply-demand balance. And production capacity has disappeared in recent years in many non-OPEC countries, because producers, confronted with low prices since the mid-80's, have found little reason to invest heavily in drilling.
Tighter supplies, of course, mean higher prices, which will encourage more drilling, in the West and probably in the Soviet Union. The Central Intelligence Agency predicted, wrongly, in 1977 that production would peak in 1980, and many experts doubted that the Soviets would achieve the high level of natural gas production and exports that they managed in the 1980's.
As with other developments in Moscow in recent months, Western analysts may now find themselves rooting for Soviet success.

President Bush knows good politics and knows how to be a world leader. He showed that when he abandoned his reluctance to support Mikhail Gorbachev and reached out dramatically to end the cold war. He could now act with equal force at home if only he would seize the opportunity to transform the emerging peace with Moscow into a peace dividend for American society. 
While Mr. Bush still rejects the term peace dividend, it must surely be his aim. With one voice in his State of the Union address last week, he proposed big troop cuts in Europe. With another voice, he proclaimed his commitment to schools, cities, the environment, a war on drugs and a real decline in the Federal deficit.
But the two voices are disconnected. In his new budget, the President offers little money to meet his social goals. The dissonance will reverberate unless he recognizes that assembling and using a peace dividend is good politics and good policy.
No one expected Mr. Bush to propose new taxes. Yet there was some hope he would find savings in the Pentagon budget - well beyond his projected cut of 2 percent or $6 billion yearly in the next four years. His proposed reductions in Europe could, in time, save $10 billion yearly. But he could do better than a 2 percent cut next year. More important, he could lay the groundwork for phasing in far deeper cuts thereafter.
Where is the threat to justify a $300 billion defense budget? Mr. Gorbachev is dismantling Soviet military might. As that continues, Mr. Bush can prudently follow suit. This is true especially for strategic nuclear arms. Yet he and Defense Secretary Cheney resist cuts in this area above all. The Administration could save $20 billion a year or more if it gave up plans for missiles and bombers and pulled back on ''Star Wars.'' Even hard-liners concede that thousands of warheads and bombs are enough to deter nuclear war.
And what of the Navy? Mr. Cheney has barely touched its budget. He admits to ''difficulty explaining'' to the Navy that it might not need 14 aircraft carrier battle groups. There are billions more here to be saved.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are politicians and bargainers. They want to keep the defense faith with their conservative backers and put the onus for deeper cuts on the Democrats. Politics is politics -up to a point.
That point comes when the inevitable defense cuts are made helter-skelter by Congress. Then, rational reductions in defense will have been forfeited and domestic needs will go unattended, leaving the President to pay a political price.
Mr. Bush enjoys a remarkably high approval rating, 76 percent in the last New York Times/CBS News Poll. His handling of foreign affairs attracts about the same approval. But not other sectors. Only 49 percent approve of his economic performance, for instance. Is Mr. Bush, who styles himself the Education President, improving education? No; 68 percent of respondents say he's mainly talking. Is he helping the environment? No; 62 percent say he's mainly talking.
President Bush will be measured, ultimately, by how much he does, not how much he talks. By grasping the full possibilities of a peace he's helping to build abroad, he can rebuild a strong America. The connection is there, if only he would make it.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Martin Anderson's exultant celebration ''The Reagan Boom - Greatest Ever'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 17) cannot be left to stand without rebuttal.
True, the long recovery from the deep depression that brought President Reagan to power carried this country to the high point of the usual cyclical wave characterized by a low rate of unemployment and a high gross national product. It is most likely that wholesale tax cuts inaugurated by Mr. Reagan have made the level of the G.N.P., as measured by the Government statisticians, several billion dollars higher than it would otherwise have been. But at what a cost! 
Drastic cuts in public spending (except for military purposes) left the physical infrastructure of this country in ruin. City streets and transportation facilities, water supply and sewage systems, particularly in large metropolitan areas, are collapsing; the once glorious interstate highways are crumbling, and cramped airports are incapable of handling the rapidly increasing traffic. Despite the valiant effort of the underfinanced, underpowered Environmental Protection Agency, our lakes, rivers and forests are succumbing to deadly acid rain.
What is even worse, the intellectual, cultural and social infrastructure of the country has suffered even more during this greater-than-ever boom than its physical counterpart. Primary and secondary schooling have been so weakened that a whole generation of boys and girls can hardly read, write or count, while the soaring price of higher education (which, in contrast to the United States, is free in most other advanced countries) makes it impossible for many young people to take advantage of it.
No wonder the competitiveness of the United States is rapidly declining; many of our high technology industries are losing one battle after another in the struggle for their share of the foreign and even their own domestic market. At the same time, the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting homeless.
Let us hope that contrary to Mr. Anderson's expectations the ''Reagan boom'' will not continue in its present form for four or eight more years. If it does, the United States will find itself entering the 21st century as the richest country (in total value of stocks and bonds traded on the stock exchanges), but culturally and socially less advanced than other developed countries.

If Things Are So Good

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Reagan Boom - Greatest Ever'' by Martin Anderson (Op-Ed, Jan. 17) is the latest attempt by Reagan partisans to convince us how well off we are. If things are so good, how come I, and I suspect many others, feel so far behind? 
At my age, 35, my father owned a four-bedroom house and supported a wife and three children (with one more to come). In a few years, he will retire comfortably, having put all four of us through private colleges. Though my father and I have similar jobs, and I have no children to support, it will be a few more years before I have saved enough for a down payment on a small apartment. I made different choices from my father, but those alone cannot account for the vast differences in our economic positions. To me, owning no stocks or bonds, the 1980's has meant watching the prices of the big-ticket items - housing, education, health care - take a greater and greater percentage of my budget.
I don't spend a lot of time bemoaning these facts. In some ways I am grateful for the simpler, less materialistic life style it forces on me. But I don't appreciate being constantly told how much better off I am when the facts of my life tell me quite otherwise.

Unemployment Does It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
An Economic Scene column by Peter Passell (Business Day, Jan. 17) focuses on the ''devastating financial setbacks'' suffered by ''young, male, blue-collar workers'' - high school dropouts had a decline in earnings of 15 percent from 1979 to 1987, while those who managed to graduate absorbed cuts of 9 percent - on the very day that Martin Anderson's adulatory tribute to Reaganomics (''The Reagan Boom - Greatest Ever'') appears on the Op-Ed page.
Mr. Anderson, once a Reagan adviser and now a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution with a mind-set seemingly informed by the Guinness Book of Records, characterizes the creation of 18.7 million jobs since 1982 as a ''world record'' (avoiding both percentage growth figures that show lower rates of increase in the 1980's over the 70's and the losses of jobs in the devastating recession of 1981-82).
If we combine the two articles, and add the recession, we have a much different picture. Recession brought both interest rates and wage pressures down - unemployment does it every time! By breaking the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization strike, President Reagan helped accelerate the decline in unions, which Mr. Passell lists as a main cause of the decline in blue collar pay. Desperately attempting to maintain family living standards (a partial explanation for lower rates of personal savings), wives with children entered the labor force in ever greater numbers. 
Many found low-level part-time and full-time jobs, and thus are world records made. Mr. Anderson gloats that ''the stock market took off like a giant skyrocket.'' Perhaps in the rarefied atmosphere of the Hoover Institution it goes unnoticed that the same may be said of the number of homeless.
Why has the expansion Mr. Anderson is so proud of lasted so long? Partly, the Federal Reserve System has managed it better than is usually the case. Mainly, inflation has been kept in check by the high unemployment of the Reagan years, as well as by the negative effect on wages of increased international competition.
At the risk of Mr. Anderson's labeling, and thereby dismissing, me as a ''left-wing faculty member,'' I would suggest that whether our economy is better described as a ''guiding beacon'' for Eastern Europeans, as he suggests, rather than one, in the words of Mr. Passell, in which ''President Reagan's chickens may, at long last, be coming home to roost,'' may ultimately depend on whether one identifies with capitalists and the rich and powerful or with blue collar workers and others whose lives have been devastated by the ''Reagan boom.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Know What Human Rights Mean

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leo A. Orleans's criticism of the Chinese student leader Li Lu (letter, Jan. 24) suggests an almost heartbreaking insensitivity. One can only assume Mr. Orleans knows very little about this thoughtful and principled student and his perspective on the China spring of 1989. 
The assertion that ''unthinking and arrogant students'' are responsible for having caused an ''unnecessary setback'' to China's economic growth and political liberalization shows not merely blindness to the 1989 democracy movement, which unquestionably had broad popular support, but also a dangerously corrosive cynicism. Mr. Orleans would have liked the Chinese students to abandon ''unrealistic rhetoric about democracy and human rights.'' But they should have ''continued to combat corruption, inflation and the many other ills now plaguing China.'' How should they have gone about this? On what resources should they have drawn?
One of the inescapable lessons to emerge from the worldwide democracy movements of 1989-90, to which China's democracy movement contributed even in defeat, was that freedom of expression is essential to political and economic development alike and that press freedom, for which the students appealed, is a key to the exposure and reform of official corruption. The events of the last year have also made clear that human rights concepts, while deriving from Western sources, find clear resonances in other traditions and growing relevance in other societies. We are privileged to have Li Lu among us as a student at Columbia University.

Florida Imposes Fees for Fishing In Saltwater
Florida has begun, as of Jan. 1, requiring a saltwater fishing license for residents and visitors. Freshwater anglers in Florida have long needed a license. The cost of the saltwater license for visitors is $30 a year or $15 for a seven-day license. A stamp for the taking of crayfish (sometimes referred to as Florida lobster) is an additional $2 as is a stamp for catching snook. Children under 16 are exempt from the fees.
The licenses are available at all county tax collector's offices and at many bait and tackle shops. The counties tack on a 50-cent service charge and the tackle shops can add another $1.50. 
Most captains of the charter fishing fleet have licensed their vessels for saltwater fishing, and guests on those boats do not need a license. It is a good idea to check with the captain regarding licensing as infractions carry a $500 fine.
The new law applies to all fish brought into Florida by boat even if the fish were taken in international waters.
The law applies to all saltwater fishing, whether from the beach, a pier or a canoe. Money collected from the licenses will go for saltwater marine research and for marine law enforcement.
Freshwater fishing license for nonresidents is $30 a year or $15 for seven days.
 
Egyptology Plus Kenya
On one tour travelers can study Egyptian history with an Egyptologist by their side. On another they may not examine ancient sites in such depth but they will do some sightseeing and cruise along the Nile - and do some game viewing in Kenya as well.
The 15-day tour with the Egyptologist John Anthony West, the author of ''The Traveler's Key to Ancient Egypt'' (Knopf), is called ''Sacred Sites and Sacred Science in Ancient Egypt.'' Mr. West will speak at length on sites including Giza, Sakkara, Abydos, Dendera, Luxor, the Valley of the Kings (with Karnak, Edfu and Komombo), Aswan, Thilae Tempe and Abu Simbel.s A March 16 trip costs $2,695 a person, double occupancy, and is available through Sphinx Tours (721 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-832-3120). A trip leaving April 20 and costing $2,700 can be booked with Vicki Doyle Tours (1700 James Payne Circle, McLean, Va. 22101; 703-241-2241). Rates include round-trip air fare from New York and most meals.
Mr. West (518-678-9580) doesn't make the reservations but he's happy to talk to travelers about their trips. AFRICAN TRAVEL (1000 East Broadway, Glendale, Calif. 91205; 800-722-7755 or, in California, 800-252-0493) offers the tour combining Kenya with Egypt, a 17-day trip. After flying to Cairo and spending a day there, the party flies on to Nairobi for game-viewing excursions in the Abderdare Forest, the Masai Mara and other areas, and a stay at the Treetops resort. Then there's a flight to Luxor, Egypt, and a four-day cruise down the Nile aboard the Sonesta Nile to Cairo. The price is $2,995 a person, including air transportation from New York. The first of several departures is on April 27.
 
Faster Trains In Europe
The planned start of new high-speed rail service in West Germany and improvements to Britain's high-speed system will mean shorter rides and more conveniences for rail travelers on some European routes.
GermanRail will introduce its new InterCity Express trains along its Hamburg-Munich line on June 2, 1991. The trains, which can reach speeds of 165 miles an hour, will take about two hours off the eight-and-a-half-hour journey, according to a GermanRail spokeswoman. Service along the 512-mile route is expected to operate daily. One-way fares will be $149 for first class and $99 for second-class.
Passengers on most GermanRail long-distance routes can now enjoy uninterrupted telephone service, even inside tunnels. The improved phones can be found on all new InterRegio trains - they run every two hours and connect smaller cities - and most hourly InterCity trains. With the addition of on-board lockers, passengers may also store luggage and other valuables free of charge.
BritRail placed the first batch of its new high-speed trains, the InterCity 225, into service on the London-Leeds line in October. The trains, which currently average 98 miles an hour, can cover the 186-mile route in about 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is as much as 15 minutes less than regular trains. Rail officials expect that figure to improve once the completion of electrification along the line allows the trains to operate at their top speed of 140 miles an hour.
BritRail offers InterCity 225 service three times a day from London to Leeds with one return trip. One-way fares are $88 for first class and $60 for economy.
 
Yankee Weekend In Massachusetts
OLD STURBRIDGE VILLAGE, the living history museum in Massachusetts that reflects rural life in the early 1800's, and the Publick House historic inn are collaborating in a series of Yankee winter weekends through March. Guests at the inn are welcomed on Friday evenings by a host in frock coat and a hostess in long Colonial gown who usher them into the parlor for some syllabub - a traditional New England drink combining white wine, cream and a dash of apple brandy - by the hearth. Then the party moves to the taproom for roasted chestnuts and buffet and musical entertainment.
After what is described as farmhand's breakfast on Saturday morning, visitors can get some exercise by strolling through the village, a mile from the Publick House, stopping to chat with costumed interpreters who re-enact the daily activities of 19th-century homesteaders. The 200-acre village has some 40 buildings from all over New England, including a meeting house on the common, school house, general store and the Bullard Tavern.
Various activities are promised.The package ends after Sunday breakfast.
The packages cost $225 a person, in double occupancy, or $195 for those who stay in the Country Motor Lodge next to the inn or the Colonel Ebenezer Crafts Inn just over a mile away; children 5 and under are $50, 6 to 15, $100.
Prices include welcome party, meals, entertainment, taxes and tips and admission to Old Sturbridge Village. Reservations: Publick House on the Common, Sturbridge, Mass. 01566 (508-347-3313).
THE WAUWINET, a 40-room beachfront inn on Nantucket, Massachusetts, has designed a package for romantics that it says would make an ideal gift for Valentine's Day. The package is of three, four or five days and includes a dozen long-stemmed roses in guests' rooms, which look out on Nantucket Bay or the Atlantic, breakfast in bed (on one morning), breakfast on other days, and a dinner by candlelight in the inn's restaurant, Topper's. Champagne on arrival, use of tennis courts and tips are also covered by the price: from $990 a couple for two nights to $1,530 for four nights from April 4 through June 14 and Sept. 24 through Dec. 3.
 
French Vineyards On Tour Series
A series of Wine Discovery Tours is planned for wine lovers who wish to combine sightseeing with visits to many of France's small family-run vineyards. The Wine Society of America (800-367-2675), a 20,000 member organization devoted to wine appreciation, and the tour operator Abercrombie & Kent (800-323-7308) are sponsoring four tour packages in late summer and early fall. They include the Loire Valley (Aug. 20 to 30), the Bordeaux Region (Sept. 2 to 10), Champagne and Alsace (Sept. 30 to Oct. 7), and a barge tour through Burgundy (Oct. 8 to 16).
Tour groups will be limited to 17 to 20 people to allow participants to meet the winemakers and vineyard owners, according to David Banford, president of the Wine Society. These sessions will feature lunches at growers' estates, wine tastings and cellar tours. The tours will be led by Steven Spurrier, a wine merchant and the head of the Academie du Vin, a Paris institute that focuses on wine education.
All wines, including those served at lunches, dinners and tastings, are included in the packages, which cost from $3,130 to $3,320 a person in double occupancy and do not include air fare. The Wine Society requires that all participants purchase memberships, which are $19.95.
 
Philosophy In Ski Country
THE HAWK INN AND MOUNTAIN RESORT (800-451-4109 or 802-672-3811) in Plymouth, Vt., is offering a three-day winter package aimed primarily at the mind rather than the ski slopes. The Vermont Inquiry program is a series of seminars on topics, including ''Re-evaluating the Eisenhower Years'' (Feb. 9 to 11), ''Haydn's Sonatas'' (Feb. 16 to 18), ''The Real and Unreal in Everyday Life'' (Feb. 23 to 25) and ''Conceptions of Happiness'' (March 2 to 4).
The program, organized by faculty members at New England colleges, including Dartmouth and Williams, continues through early April; a summer program is scheduled to begin in June. Rates are $395 a person in double occupancy, which includes two dinners, two breakfasts, two nights' accommmodations, books (mailed in advance to participants) and use of the resort's recreational facilities.
THE CORTINA INN (800-451-6108 or 802-773-3331) at Killington, Vt., is offering a five-night package that allows skiers to ski a different Vermont mountain every day. Along with nearby Killington and Pico, Okemo is about 20 miles from the inn. For $579 a person, double occupancy, guests get five nights' lodging, five dinners and breakfasts, five days of lift tickets for any ski area in the state (except Mad River Glen), a sleigh ride and $25 credit on any piece in the Cortina Inn's art gallery.
Agents Predict Australia Boom
Australia is likely to be the favored overseas destination for the 1990's, at least among clients of American Express travel agents, according to a survey of 450 of the company's travel agents. The poll, conducted between Sept. 16 and Oct. 13, 1989, also found that Orlando is the most popular domestic vacation city among American Express customers and that cruises continue to rise in popularity as a favorite type of vacation. The findings are part of the company's 1989-90 Winter Travel Forecast, a survey based on the advance bookings of the company's agents across the country.
Florida was named as the most popular domestic destination, with Disney World-Epcot most often cited as a major objective.
After Florida, the top winter destinations at home were Hawaii, Colorado, California and Nevada. Britain is the most popular foreign destination this winter, according to the survey, which listed Mexico, the Caribbean, France and Austria, Spain and Switzerland - tied for fifth place - as runners-up.
In addition to Australia, the most popular overseas destinations for the next decade, the agents reported, are likely to be the Caribbean, Mexico, New Zealand and the Soviet Union.
 
Visa Help In London
For travelers to London who decide to visit another country on short notice, a business that expedites visas is a good place to know about. The Visa Shop supplies current information on visa requirments and turns around visa applications for any country in the fastest time possible. It can also supply new passports and extended visas. The charge for obtaining a visa is about $21 above the required application fees.
The Visa Shop also advises on work permits for businessmen, students and others. For a fee starting from about $259 it can obtain permits within two weeks, as long as it has the right documentation, as opposed to the 10 weeks that it usually takes. It also offers advice on setting up business in Britain.
The Visa Shop (Charing Cross Shopping Arcade, London WC2. telephone 379 0419 or 379 0376) is in the Charing Cross shopping arcade near the Charing Cross Underground and main-line stations.

HEADLINE: MARTIN AMIS: DOWN LONDON'S MEAN STREETS

BYLINE: By Mira Stout: Mira Stout is an American writer living in London. Her work has appeared in The Financial Times, The Spectator and The Paris Review.

 BODY:
MARTIN AMIS IS probably fiction's angriest writer. In Britain, with its long and decorous literary tradition, his voice stands out discordantly from the rest like a boom box at a harpsichord recital. His urban satires have provoked extreme reactions in Britain, none more so than his latest, most ambitious novel, ''London Fields.'' Although mysteriously absent from this year's nominations for the Booker Prize, England's most prestigious literary award, the book is in the midst of a long run near the top of the best-seller list and has triggered phenomenal media attention. In recent years, Amis has become an outright literary star - an anomaly in Britain. But then, his prose is probably more American than British in its energy and raucousness. For many critics, Amis's comic talent is unrivaled, but for others, mostly older and conservative readers, he is a malevolent harpie, with morbid, vaguely unpatriotic interests. Intriguingly, his father is Kingsley Amis, one of Britain's original Angry Young Men of the 1950's, now a Thatcherite Conservative. Martin sees a fouler England than his father does. 
''London is a pub,'' he declares, looking disgustedly out of his study window into the gray street below. ''Not the pub with the jolly butcher and the smiling grannies; it's the pub of eight or nine alcoholics, a handful of hustlers and nutcases and a few token regular people. It's a stew,'' he declares. ''The whole idea of the pub as a place for the working man has vanished. Who's working? Now the pub is where you go all day. We're in a gentle, deep decline,'' he says quietly. ''Not as frenzied as America's, but perhaps even more poignant, more tragic.''
Shoppers at London's chic Burlington Arcade or tourists queueing for tickets to the latest Andrew Lloyd-Webber extravaganza may disagree with him; the British look richer than they did a decade ago. BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes jam the bus lanes, the Royal Family soap opera is better than ever, and Thatcher's Government is enjoying its 10th consecutive year of Tory rule. On the surface, all looks well indeed, and for many it is. As in most things English, London's malaise is subtle, and class-inflected. ''London Fields'' - to be published in America next month - floodlights the sagging underbelly of Thatcherite consumerism.
Now 40 years old, Amis has written six novels, a collection of short stories and another of articles. Where his early, more self-gratifying novels were a pungent brew of sex, drugs and murder, his recent work (fiction and nonfiction) has ambitiously opened out into junk culture, nuclear weapons, America, and now the destruction of the environment. He traces his characters' destructive behavior to the overwhelming shadow of the bomb. Says a jaded character in ''London Fields'': ''If at any moment nothing might matter, then who says nothing didn't matter already?''
Talking politics with Amis, it's easy to forget that he is a satirical writer; his pitch-black humor springs from a bristling arsenal of outrage, despair and fear. ''If you laugh at it, it evens things out, makes it easier to live with,'' he says. Amis's laughter is vengeful; vigilante humor.
His last few novels have buried the myth of a decent, gentle, pastoral England, paving over the site with cement-hard observations of a seedy, queasy new Britain, part strip-joint, part Buckingham Palace. If 10 years of Thatcherism have materially bolstered Britain, there is a grudging national consensus that prosperity has hardened her spirit. Amis's mean London streets are litter-strewn, vandalized; morality is nudged toward bankruptcy by ''market forces.'' His characters are close to the edge, more like New Yorkers than traditionally stoic Londoners. Amis's sharp social ear prompts some comparison with Tom Wolfe, but he's more literary, idiosyncratic, closer to Nabokov in his primary, sensuous delight in language. ''London Fields'' is not a chronicle of London in the way that Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' is a tale of New York; Amis's is a more personal, oblique urban vision. Plot is always subordinate to language in his fiction, to the frustration of some readers. Even aficionados find his work nearly unreadable in places, and routinely painful. He demands absolute unsqueamishness as far as expletives, body secretions, psychological cruelty and even sadism are concerned. He has an extortionist's talent for knowing people's secret fears, creating a climate of danger and paranoia. ''London Fields'' is a meditation on the millennium - disguised as a murder mystery. Narrated by a young American writer living in the trendy West London neighborhood of Notting Hill Gate, most of Amis's tragicomedy of sleaze and death takes place in a sinister pub called the Black Cross, a locale that epitomizes the squalor hidden behind London's posh facade.
British novelists, from Iris Murdoch to David Lodge, have closed ranks against the new unpleasantness, ignored its consequences and settled in marginal enclaves of finer sensibility. With few exceptions, British fiction reflects the sovereignty of cozy, self-examining middle-class life: second-marriage angst, dinner-party betrayals, university-tenure feuds. Where his colleagues' writing is spare and cerebral, Amis is an unabashed maximalist: his work is refreshingly emotional, even carnal. He feels that ''good readers'' don't want to be shielded. ''My stuff is fairly sentimental; it's a lot worse out there,'' he says sadly.
I SPENT SOME TIME with Amis not long after he had finished his new novel. We met several times in his bachelorish writing flat in Westbourne Park, a bleak outpost of Notting Hill Gate. He explained apologetically that his wife did not allow interviewers in the house, a mile away.
Amis opened the front door of the forbidding Victorian rectory, greeting me with a sympathetic combination of professional wariness and animal curiosity. He has already been the subject of an extraordinary number of British interviews. Having read quite a few of them, I expected him to be small (around 5 feet 6) and clever, but what doesn't emerge from press clippings is his youthfulness, a quality of jaded teen-age swagger. The combination of his shortness and his bunchy, athletic build gives him the look of a boy-man. He wears nondescript clothes, except for a pair of raunchy black ankle boots with cowboy heels.
In the kitchen Amis clumsily made some tea, chatting companionably as he struggled with the kettle. His high, bulging forehead and single dark eyebrow give him a moody air even when he's laughing, and his deep-set eyes and pouting mouth are cold in repose. His treacle-brown hair, cut short, is thinning slightly. He has a powerful, attractive presence.
The first thing you notice in the flat is the pinball machine parked in the kitchen. Amis is a famous pinball nut. Perhaps he cultivates a bad-boy image to counter the seriousness and stridency of his writing. Altogether the flat resembles an all-male clubhouse, a sanctuary from grown-up pressure and parental taste. It's vaguely organized around typing and books, but the dart board, scruffy stereo, video and television set seem equally important. The odd children's book and woman's straw hat are the only jarring evidence of his family-man status.
In the newspaper-strewn study Amis spoke in a relaxed, candid way about his work. He was not the egomaniac that other journalists have described, but his self-assurance occasionally veered into profound self-satisfaction. He gives off complex signals; despite his worldly, wised-up manner Amis's natural curiosity makes him appear unexpectedly open and vulnerable, but also capable of sudden and vicious attack. His speech is enjoyably close to his narrative style - peppered with vivid adjectives and American slang, but the accent is standard Oxford issue. I ask him about his childhood. ''Childhood? What childhood?'' he exclaims. ''When Nabokov said a writer's childhood was his treasure chest, I thought, 'Christ, what do I do? I haven't got one.' '' He claims not to regret its absence.
Amis's paternal grandfather was a mustard clerk from Clapham, and his mother's father was a suburban shoe millionaire. Kingsley Amis is twice divorced, and Martin's mother is on her third marriage; in a fairly bizarre family arrangement, Kingsley, now divorced from the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, lives as a lodger with Martin's mother and her third husband.
Martin was the middle child of three, including an older brother, Philip, now a graphic designer, and a younger sister, Sally. ''I was the steady one.'' Amis attended approximately 14 different schools during the 1950's and 60's, due to the great success of his father's masterly picaresque novel ''Lucky Jim,'' which swept Kingsley broadly around the university circuit, including a year at Princeton, which introduced Martin to America.
The home atmosphere was permissive. ''Something out of early Updike, 'Couples' flirtations and a fair amount of drinking. They were all 'at it.' '' Amis speaks of his mother, Hilly, adoringly, stressing that her generous philosophy influenced him as strongly as his father's humor. He was devastated, at 12, by his parents' divorce.
''I had a passionate street life; going to pubs and betting shops, smoking dope a bit. My parents were lax about girls, too,'' he remembers happily. He mainly read comic books until his stepmother, the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, urged Jane Austen upon him. He was a mod, briefly (''too many scooter crashes''), and then a hippie (''flowered shirt, velvet suit, far more relaxing''). But it was all a pose, he admits. He reformed academically before too much damage had been done, and went off abruptly to Oxford, where he earned a first-class degree from Exeter College.
A seemingly effortless journalistic-literary career followed: entry-level job at The Times Literary Supplement; literary editor of The New Statesman at 27; feature writer for The Observer, author of sensationally reviewed novels at roughly two-year intervals. Writing seemed a natural path for Amis, growing up in a literary household. He was 20 when he began, but Kingsley famously displayed negligible interest in his son's work. Martin's reputation may now supersede his father's: an uncomfortable but not an acrimonious situation, both claim. Their ''rivalry'' is of such interest in Britain that when the National Portrait Gallery invited father and son to pose together for a double portrait, Kingsley's touchy refusal made the front page of The Sunday Telegraph. According to Martin, his father later regretted the fuss. Their relationship is unusually close - they even kiss cheeks un-Englishly, upon greeting - but they disagree about virtually everything: politics, people, literature. ''Several times he has even dumped on me in print,'' Martin laughs smartingly. His fondness for his father is such that he has never publicly retaliated, nor objected to Kingsley's opinions of his work. Martin takes it sadly, makes light of it. Apparently, Kingsley liked the beginning of his son's last novel, ''Money,'' a hectic tour of lowlife New York, London and Los Angeles, but didn't finish it. ''I can point out the exact place where he stopped and sent the book twirling through the air; that's where the character named Martin Amis comes in. 'Breaking the rules, buggering about with the reader, drawing attention to himself,' '' Martin says wearily, reciting his father's litany of complaints.
The novelist Julian Barnes explains: ''They do love one another. That established, Kingsley feels that he doesn't have to hold back in any other area, so he makes no pretense. Scandalously, I think, when it comes to the press. For Martin, it's a hurt that will never go away. The good side is, it's acted as a form of vaccination for Martin. If his father, whom he loves, dislikes his books, then it really doesn't matter what any critics say.''
I spoke to Kingsley Amis on the phone at home in North London. Reworking a new novel, he seemed glad to break and talk about Martin. He spoke gruffly, and with an enormous fondness that he occasionally sacrificed for a good cutting remark. He began cautiously: ''I think that if anyone's reading us both in fifty or a hundred years' time, we shall seem like very much the same kind of writer. We're more similar than we seem in some ways; we have a similar sense of verbal, spoken humor. We compete with each other on that, always have, in a family-joke way.''
One of Kingsley's main reservations is Martin's constant surveillance of his characters' bedrooms and bathrooms, which he feels is misguided and ''in poor taste.'' He modifies: ''Sex is a fascinating area, but it's harder than he thinks. Nobody says that fiction should be able to discuss everything; he thinks he can do it, but I wonder if he can.'' Kingsley Amis is upset when accused of being hard on his son. ''To be 'hard' on someone is to be unfair, inappropriate. What I would describe is a strong, even furious opposition of views.'' He pauses. ''I'd like to say this about him: I admire him very much as a man. He's responsible, and above all sane. I like sanity.'' And Martin's political views? ''They're a lot of dangerous, howling nonsense,'' he thunders, ''but apart from that I regard him as one of my best and closest friends.'' He's explosive on Martin's view of Thatcher: ''If London has gotten more dirty and squalid and violent in Thatcher's day, she hasn't done that - I think it would be much worse without her. Anyone with Martin's income has no right to complain. I say that very, very loudly, and rather crossly.''
Abruptly returning to writing, Amis says unexpectedly: ''But apart from Martin Amis, new British writers are disappointing. They should be doing what Martin's doing. When you get to be my age, a writer ought to be saying, 'Can't see what these young fellows are on about!' But with this lot, I can see only too well, and it's not very interesting. I'd rather read detective novels.''
Saul Bellow is another admirer from the older generation. He's a sort of hero to the younger Amis, who quotes him both in his novels and in conversation. I spoke to Bellow on the phone in Chicago. He and Amis had met when Martin interviewed him several years ago, and a master-apprentice friendship was struck. Bellow was amiable, and charming. I asked him what he thought of Martin's controversial prose style.
''There are two ways for fiction to go - one is to use an uncharged language which subordinates itself to the story and characters entirely, and the other is to use a charged language. Martin certainly uses a charged language. Anyone with that much of a feeling for words is bound to be accused of putting words first,'' he says equably. ''This was the case with Flaubert and Joyce, to begin with. Some critics felt that the poetry monopolized everything. I understand this intoxication with a new way of writing. The discovery is an overpowering one when it happens; you find you have a new way to write about modern life. And that's pretty heady.''
Does Bellow think that Martin Amis has the inventive genius of a Joyce or Flaubert? ''Yes, I do. I see signs of a very large outline.''
ONE DAY AMIS launches headlong into his pet topic, decline:
''The 19th-century British novel was, if you like, a superpower novel. It was 800 pages long, about the whole of society. With decline, the novel has shrunk in confidence, in scope. In its current form, the typical English novel is 225 sanitized pages about the middle classes,'' he says. ''You know, 'well-made' with the nice color scheme and decor, and matching imagery. I almost try and avoid form. What I'm interested in is trying to get more truthful about what it's like to be alive now.''
Amis bemoans the escapist, nostalgic leanings of the British toward their own country. He's bemused by foreigners' dated view of Britain as the land of tweedy aristocratic grandeur and dominance, the world of P. G. Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh. His own focus is the brash ascendancy of tabloid England, the downmarket world of Page Three pinups, Bingo greed and soap stars' abortions. He finds a rich source of comedy in contrasting the resentment-fueled economic rise of the working class against the slump of the largely ineffectual, burned-out upper class. ''Dead Babies,'' ''Success,'' ''Money'' and ''London Fields'' all feature bulldog-tenacious, kicked-around Cockneys barely triumphing over haughty, stunned aristocrats. Amis is sometimes criticized for caricaturing rather than characterizing his subjects, but he's quick to point out that he places no value judgments on his characters' actions (no matter how rotten); he's hardly a champion of the working classes, but he considers Thatcher's formula that money equals democracy ''facile.'' Unlike America, Britain has been a traditionally modest, even money-scorning culture, and its quick transition to a brass-knuckled state has been rather graceless, Amis feels, unaccompanied by inner generosity or fraternal spirit: ''I think Thatcher has done a lot of harm. The money age we're living through now is a short-term, futureless kind of prosperity that will last as long as there are public institutions to sell off, and as long as North Sea oil lasts. But it's really a 'live now, pay later' thing. Money is a more democratic medium than blood, but money as a cultural banner - you can feel the whole of society deteriorating around you because of that. Civility, civilization is falling apart.'' Keith Talent, the protagonist of ''London Fields,'' embodies the spirit of his age. A witless, wife-beating darts enthusiast, ''Keith cheated people with his limousine service at airports and train stations; he cheated people with his fake scents and colognes at the pavement stalls of Oxford Street and Bishopsgate . . . he cheated people with non-pornographic pornography in the back rooms of short-lease stores. . . . Keith earned three times as much as the Prime Minister and never had any money, losing heavily every day at the turf accountants on Portobello Road. . . . Sometimes he would ponder this on alternate Thursday lunchtimes, in his sheepskin overcoat, his head bent over the racing page, as he queued for his unemployment benefit. . . .''
Rolling himself a lumpy cigarette from a ratty-looking tobacco pouch, Amis readily talks about how the new book expresses his preoccupation with becoming middle-aged; it's a forced, angry farewell to selfish pleasures.
''It's a little death, middle age. Romantic possibility . . . changes,'' he strains, looking a bit dreamy. ''It's calmer waters now, windless seas - if not the doldrums,'' he says, unable to squash a note of petulance in his voice. ''You always thought it was a hilarious secret that while everyone else got old, you weren't. But children redefine everything for you. A lot of the self is lost, thank God; the internal gibber of wants and need dies down,'' he lectures, not very convincingly.
In 1984, Amis married Antonia Phillips, a widowed Bostonian philosophy teacher. Without prompting, he goes over to his desk and with classic pride shows me a snapshot of his sons, Louis and Jacob (5 and 3), a couple of towheaded boys plying a pair of giant milkshakes. The sight cheers him. ''That's beer,'' he jokes.
Despite being sidelined by married monogamy, Amis is still a keen observer of the sexual arena. His fascination with its dark side reaches a new low - or high, depending on one's taste - in ''London Fields.'' It's his blackest statement yet in a canon of black statements about sexual love. If his life has become G-rated, his work now earns an X. Amis insists that he uses sex as a vehicle for revealing characters ''when they're not just going through the motions.'' It's an area where need and greed converge, and where tenderness is accidental, a rare thrill.
Amis's early notoriety as a famous (Continued on Page 48) writer's son, and later as a successful author in his own right, provoked mixed but intense attention well before the publication of ''London Fields.'' He says journalists' often hostile jabs don't affect him, but his sensitivity is obvious in his sneering, humorless television appearances and in the crucifying glares he gives to publicity photographers.
His open contempt for the press has fed his spoiled reputation. His arrogance so disgusted Private Eye that the paper referred to him for many years as ''Smarty Anus.'' The press has also resented his literary connections. From his father's milieu to his Oxford friends and premarital girlfriends, Amis's close contacts number practically the whole of ''quality'' British publishing, and an upmarket chunk of New York's as well. (He's associated with The Observer, Tatler, Granta, The New Statesman, Viking Penguin, Jonathan Cape, The Nation, Esquire, Vanity Fair, to name a few.) ''His mixture of precocity, great intelligence, and wide sexual success is bound to provoke envy,'' says Julian Barnes. ''People try to write like Martin. There's something very infectious and competitive about it.''
Unlike many Englishmen, Amis doesn't apologize for his success. He now lives in a respectable family house in leafy Ladbroke Grove, but his work remains faithful to the esthetics of squalor. He's aware of leading something of a double life, and isn't completely comfortable with his new padding of wealth or the vantage de haut en bas. Never poor, Amis has become very well off. His advances have skyrocketed from a Dickensian $400 to a Hollywood-ish $150,000. According to friends, his wife, Antonia, is rich in her own right. Fame has not made him ''grand,'' as some claim, but ''busy,'' he corrects. His curtailed appearances on the London party circuit have given him a snobbish profile, but an old friend says: ''Martin's actually quite bad at parties, so he doesn't go to them anymore. He usually ends up talking to the waiter.''
In contrast to his allegedly wild younger days, Amis now leads a disciplined life. He breakfasts at 8:30 with the live-in nanny and children (his wife sleeps on), drives to the office via the boys' Montessori school, works until 2 or 3 (telephone off the hook). He is a serious tennis player; he drives to the Paddington Sports Club for his daily game. He is home by 6:15. When his wife attends the opera, Amis baby-sits, ''earning brownie points so I can play snooker later in the week. Marriage with children is all credit and debit, you know. My wife is a strong character, and I don't get away with much,'' he confesses. ''Some wives are rivals, muses, agents. My wife is just a wife. You don't get special treatment,'' he says in a rebuked tone. Amis is a hardened snooker addict. He joined a smart Pall Mall club not for prestige, he contends, but for its pool table. Sunday night is his regular snooker night.
FOR OUR FINAL RENDEZVOUS, I accompanied Amis to a book party for environmental causes. He picked me up in a taxi around 6 P.M., clutching a furled copy of Tennis magazine. His hair neatly combed, he was dressed almost smartly in a Prince of Wales plaid suit and dark coat - his white shirt bore a prominent stain. It was a rare, beautifully clear evening, and Amis was in a relaxed mood. South Kensington's facades flowed regally past the taxi window, transformed by sunlight. Kensington Gardens were overflowing with fresh summer foliage. London looked startlingly clean.
I asked Martin casually about his involvement with environmental issues. ''Paradise is a toilet!'' he exploded in a rehearsed way. ''It's as if the planet had aged four billion years in the last two centuries. If this had happened to a human being, you'd say, 'Jesus, what's he been up to? He looked like Apollo yesterday, now he looks like Methuselah!''
So is it all over? Is everything for sale? I asked at a traffic light.
''The theme that the good is gone is as old as literature. Everything has been cheapened; the accumulation of experience is causing decay,'' Amis replied gravely, sounding like a skeptical dentist. And man's capacity to love? ''Romantic love will always be there, but it's harder for it to flourish. As Bellow says, ours is a sclerotic Eros. I think there's a lot of romanticism in my work'' - my eyebrows shot up involuntarily - ''but it's thwarted by distortion and perversity, false commercial images in TV, literature, porn. The fact is, my satire wouldn't work if what I'm satirizing were not valued. Like Philip Larkin's poetry, love is conspicuous by it's absence.''
Martin Amis's instincts are chivalrous. By imagining the worst possible scenarios - addictiveness, child abuse, urban decay, nuclear holocaust - he seems to want to avert the impending disasters by giving us a test run, sending in his fictional characters to show the damage we'll run up. He knows he can't save anyone, but he wants us to see the danger and to experience fear squarely, not drunk on cheap deferral or delusion. But most of all he wants to deflate fear with laughter.
His prose style may shock, but the values behind it are surprisingly traditional: truth, love, compassion, integrity, family. ''But it's no fun to read about, and no fun to write.'' He grinned and climbed out of the taxi. Some photographers were waiting by the party entrance, and a television crew stood nervously by; Martin Amis stood tall and scowled for the cameras.

THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE
When America Goes to War:
The Presidents and the People.
By Richard J. Barnet.
476 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $24.95.
If anything has united American foreign policy makers and thinkers throughout our history, it's their contempt for the people. And the view that their countrymen are (depending on the accuser) too bellicose, xenophobic, selfish, naive or just plain stupid to know their true interests has driven American leaders to try to conduct foreign policy on the sly for more than 200 years. 
As Richard J. Barnet, a well-known leftist critic of contemporary American foreign policy and the author of ''Real Security'' and other books, argues in ''The Rockets' Red Glare,'' there are at least three things wrong with this approach: first, the United States is supposed to be a democracy; second, many of these secret policies have concerned paramount questions of war and peace; and third, the record compiled by our statesmen and experts is nothing to brag about.
His study of public opinion and American diplomacy contains ample evidence to document the gap between democratic rhetoric and the reality of foreign policy making since the Revolutionary era and the problems repeatedly created by it. What is largely missing, however, is the theoretical and philosophical discussion needed to figure out the proper role of public opinion in American foreign policy, let alone to support his grand conclusion that ''popular participation [in foreign policy making] is becoming more necessary but also more possible.''
Despite Mr. Barnet's plain sympathies and the string of official foul-ups and disasters stretching back to the War of 1812 that he colorfully recounts, few will finish ''The Rockets' Red Glare'' confident that the public's preferred foreign policies would have served American interests better - that is, when clear preferences could be discerned at all. The first four Presidents, for example, spent much of their terms desperately trying to restrain or defuse public demands to attack one or another European power for all manner of real and imagined insults, despite the young republic's military weakness. The elitists, in other words, tended to be peaceniks. And even in 1968, Mr. Barnet acknowledges, more Americans wanted to end the Vietnam War by escalation than by unilateral withdrawal.
Ironically, the author scores his most telling points in favor of more power to the people while examining the period in which public irresponsibility allegedly peaked: the 1920's and 30's. As Mr. Barnet astutely observes, the divine right still claimed today by foreign policy and public opinion elites even after Vietnam rests on the view that the public permanently disqualified itself from a lead foreign policy role by pigheadedly ignoring the fascist threat. But Mr. Barnet builds a credible case that ''the American people were ready to be educated by events and to follow the president whenever he chose to lead.'' Tragically, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sold his own powers of persuasion short.
Still, the debate over democratizing our foreign policy ultimately turns on questions that are not empirical. How, for example, can the public's desires be determined in the first place? Do we want government by Gallup poll? Even if some foolproof way of sampling public opinion were found, who would decide which alternatives should be presented? What if only small minorities register strong opinions? What if no clear winner emerges? How would the tie-breaker work? More broadly, must all decisions require explicit public approval? If not, when should official discretion be permitted? And should leaders ever rely on their consciences or their expertise? These issues, whose centrality Mr. Barnet recognizes, are hardly insuperable. But they are practically ignored. His overemphasis on the narrative flow of history makes for a book that is fun to read but also inconsequential for anyone interested in changing policy.
More troubling is the fact that part of his failure to address such questions clearly reflects a belief that the stunning international changes of the late 80's have rendered most of them moot. After all, the built-in conflict between foreign policy needs and democratic processes assumes a world of nations unavoidably locked in a struggle for security and advantage. Nations that cannot act secretly and speedily may have two strikes against them.
Mr. Barnet is obviously correct in suggesting that if traditional international power politics is rapidly fading in importance, and if true security now requires greatly expanded international cooperation, then speed and stealth count for much less. Indeed, in such a world, the openness, adaptability and unchallengeable legitimacy of genuine democracies could be foreign policy assets, not liabilities. But if, as is equally plausible, power politics is also simply taking new forms - for even global problems such as environmental destruction can affect different states in different ways, and the quick and the strong are still likeliest to see their preferred solutions chosen - the tension between democracy and foreign policy effectiveness will resurface.
The only way out of this bind may be to take a cue from the Founding Fathers. They confronted a choice between national security and the intrinsic inefficiencies of democracy. But rather than bow to national security (as the architects of our cold war strategy were to do a century and a half later) or pretend that the competition between the two concerns could be wished away (a la Mr. Barnet), they chose democracy - or, more precisely, republican government. They determinedly divided political power and produced a Constitution that, as Clement Attlee once ruefully observed, was designed for an ''isolationist state.'' Either the Framers were hopelessly naive or they knew something about America's latent strength, natural wealth and potential geopolitical security that indicated the new nation could afford a thoroughly democratic foreign policy much more than most other countries if it took advantage of its good fortune.
Two hundred years later, the possibilities for detachment from foreign conflicts are narrower, but they have by no means vanished completely. If Americans truly want to regain firm control over their foreign policy, they may well have to shift away from the broad internationalist approach followed since Pearl Harbor.
This change would rule out many policies that Mr. Barnet does not like, chiefly the focus on ''traditional war planning and war-prevention strategies,'' the maintenance of military alliances and reflexive opposition to third-world revolution. But it would also rule out many policies that he has long supported - e.g., massive aid for the third world and deep United States involvement in a new set of global economic planning agencies. In this post-cold war era, Mr. Barnet's call for democratizing American foreign policy is worth heeding and might be feasible. But he may well find himself just as unhappy with the resulting new priorities - chiefly, a vigorous search for opportunities to enhance our freedom of action and self-reliance - as he has been with the old ones.

 BODY:

CROOKED HEARTS, by Robert Boswell. (Laurel/Dell, $9.95.) For the members of the Warren family of Yuma, Ariz., disappointment is such an expected part of life that they throw parties to celebrate their latest failures. This novel is ''rich and vivid, an intriguingly busy view of the human adventure, the impossible family of man,'' Sharon Sheehe Stark said here in 1987. '' 'Crooked Hearts' is an insightful, nicely turned, amazingly agile piece of work.''
 
INNUMERACY: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences, by John Allen Paulos. (Vintage, $8.95.) One symptom of mathematical illiteracy is a tendency to believe in what Jung called synchronicity. But as John Allen Paulos demonstrates, even the eeriest coincidences are not as statistically unlikely as they seem. For example, the chance that two strangers have an acquaintance in common is about 1 percent; and 99 out of 100 times one of them will know someone who knows someone the other knows. ''What mathematics the book contains does not go beyond simple arithmetic and very basic probability theory,'' Morris Kline said here last year. ''The innumerate will surely profit from this entertaining book.'' 
 
WHEAT THAT SPRINGETH GREEN, by J. F. Powers. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $8.95.) A priest who has finally been assigned his own parish tries to maintain idealism and humor in an ever more secular world. ''No eye has been sharper, no ear finer than that of J. F. Powers at discerning the nuances of service to God and mammon,'' Amy Edith Johnson said here in 1988. '' 'Wheat That Springeth Green' is funny on every page.'' Washington Square has also reissued Mr. Powers's MORTE D'URBAN ($8.95), the story of a worldly priest sent to the Minnesota wilds for a spiritual overhaul. It won a National Book Award in 1963.
 
TRADING PLACES: How We Are Giving Our Future to Japan and How to Reclaim It, by Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. (Basic Books, $12.95.) A former United States trade negotiator tells how the country can learn to equate economic well-being with national security and match the Japanese at their own game. ''He writes about hand-to-hand combat between the United States and Japan with great clarity and spirit,'' Jeffrey E. Garten said here in 1988. ''And in the best tradition of insider reflections, the book combines some of the passion surrounding events as they happened with the balanced perspective of a thoughtful post-mortem.'' In a new postscript to YEN! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to America (Fawcett Columbine, $9.95), Daniel Burstein updates his argument that Reaganomics hurt the United States and helped Japan. In 1988 our reviewer, Edward Boyer, said, ''The most helpful prescription Mr. Burstein comes up with is his plea for a recognition that Americans, like the British before them, live in a world that is no longer entirely theirs.''
 
THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR, by Sharon Kay Penman. (Ballantine, $12.95.) In a 936-page historical novel set during the War of the Roses, Sharon Kay Penman upgrades Richard III's image from a villainous humpback to a sensitive, misunderstood ruler whose only handicap is an injured shoulder. '' 'The Sunne in Splendour' is very well researched and sticks closely to real historical details, where they exist,'' Mona Simpson said here in 1982. But she said she was unconvinced by the psychological interpretations of this new incarnation of the last of the Plantagenet kings.
 
LOYALTIES: A Son's Memoir, by Carl Bernstein. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) The former Washington Post reporter tells what it was like growing up with a family of Communists during the McCarthy era. Last year our reviewer, Elinor Langer, said these are ''honest memories, and they offer a useful corrective to the romantic image of 'red diaper babies' commonly held on the left.''
 
RITUAL, by William Heffernan. (Signet/New American Library, $4.95.) A series of copycat murders, inspired by an ancient Toltec sacrificial ceremony, casts suspicion on Kate Silverman, a young Metropolitan Museum curator. ''The suspense is excruciating,'' one reviewer said last year, ''and should keep readers in a state of frenzy to the last page.''
 
UNDERCOVER: The Secret Lives of a Federal Agent, by Donald Goddard. (Dell, $4.95.) A Federal agent with a theatrical bent goes undercover to trick narcotics dealers into betraying themselves. This is ''an exciting account of one agent's obsessive fight against drug traffickers,'' Charles Salzberg said here last year.
 
LOOK INTO THE SUN, by James Patrick Kelly. (Tor, $3.95.) An earthling architect hired by aliens to build a tomb for a dying goddess must overcome a difficult case of culture shock. ''His struggle to maintain his identity while shifting his point of view is treated with admirable seriousness,'' our reviewer, Gerald Jonas, said last year.
 
AT HOME: Essays 1982-1988, by Gore Vidal. (Vintage, $9.95.) Gore Vidal tells why he still thinks the American empire is homophobic, overarmed and ridden with other defects. ''As well as being virtuously subversive, Mr. Vidal is witty about everything from America's cultural forgetfulness to Nancy Reagan's attitude toward the proposed equal rights amendment,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times in 1988.
 
MURDER IN LITTLE EGYPT, by Darcy O'Brien. (Onyx/New American Library, $4.95.) John Dale Cavaness, an Illinois doctor, was convicted of killing one son and is suspected in the shooting death of another. Last year our reviewer, Wendy Kaminer, called this ''a meticulous account of Cavaness's life and crimes [and] an implicit indictment of a culture that condones and encourages violent behavior in men.''

A SHIELD IN SPACE?
Technology, Politics, and the Strategic Defense Initiative: How the Reagan Administration Set Out to Make Nuclear Weapons ''Impotent and Obsolete'' and Succumbed to the Fallacy of the Last Move.
By Sanford Lakoff and Herbert F. York.
409 pp. Berkeley:
University of California Press. $35. 
On March 24, 1983, Paul Thayer, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, convened a meeting of the top civilian and military leaders of the Defense Department. The purpose was to discuss a nationally televised speech President Ronald Reagan had given the night before, in which he had challenged American scientists to create ''the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.'' The Deputy Secretary opened the meeting with words that proved to be prophetic. He asked his colleagues, ''What are we going to do with this mess?''
In ''A Shield in Space?'' Sanford Lakoff, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and Herbert York, a physicist with long Government experience, outline how we got into ''this mess,'' and what the American and international political communities have done with it over the past six years. In a very readable, comprehensive and balanced book, the authors outline the history, the politics, the economics and the technology surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative (S.D.I.), or ''Star Wars.'' In addition, they discuss the impact of S.D.I. on strategic stability, arms control, the Western alliance and relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Their thesis is both simple and persuasive. Because S.D.I. is not just a man-against-nature problem (like going to the moon) but also a man-against-man contest, there will always be a countermeasure or another move. To suggest that effective strategic defenses can be developed and installed at a particular time is both dangerous and misleading.
This is the best book written about S.D.I. to date. Though it is clear from their subtitle that Mr. Lakoff and Mr. York are not sympathetic to the program, they do bend over backwards to present the strategic, technical, economic and military rationales used by supporters of S.D.I. ''A Shield in Space?'' makes it understandable why a renowned scientist like Edward Teller would propose a program like S.D.I., why a master politician like Ronald Reagan would embrace it and why James A. Abrahamson, the director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Office, and Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, would support it so zealously and at times excessively. (Indeed, Mr. Abrahamson, an Air Force lieutenant general and a respected career officer, was denied promotion to full general by the Congress in part because of his excessive zeal for the program.) From a scientific and technical point of view, the book is superb. The authors make comprehensible even to the nonspecialist such technical concepts as space-based defense, layered defenses, kinetic energy weapons and directed energy weapons. Moreover, they present excellent summaries of the reports of the scientific groups that have analyzed S.D.I.
From a political point of view, however, the book is not quite as good. On the one hand, Mr. Lakoff and Mr. York do a fine job of describing such things as why S.D.I. became a litmus test of support for Mr. Reagan and his legacy, and why Senator Sam Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reacted so strongly against the broad interpretation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty that the program required for deployment.
But the overall political analysis is weak, primarily because the authors did not supplement their research with interviews. In at least two places, Mr. Lakoff and Mr. York fail to see the essence of the politics of S.D.I. First, they ignore the corrupting impact of the program on some of those who become involved with it. For example, Paul Nitze, a great statesman, virtually had to repudiate his own work on the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to endorse the broad interpretation of that treaty supported by Mr. Reagan's followers.
Second, the authors have apparently missed the euthanasia of S.D.I. perpetrated in 1988 by Vice President George Bush and Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci. In an interview with The New York Times, conducted when he was running for the Presidency, Mr. Bush revealed that the emperor had no clothes when he said S.D.I. was very expensive and had technological problems. Later in the year, in a bloodless coup, Mr. Carlucci summarily replaced the flamboyant General Abrahamson as head of the program with the low-keyed George Monahan. Although the move was billed as a routine transfer, General Abrahamson was more than just another Pentagon program manager. The authors seem unaware that he was to S.D.I. what Victor Kiam is to Remington or Lee Iacocca to Chrysler. Finally, after taking office, Mr. Bush recommended cutting the S.D.I. budget he inherited from the Reagan Administration by $1 billion, knowing full well that Congress would make further reductions (which it did).
The mess has been cleaned up and S.D.I. has come back to where it belongs, and where it was before Mr. Reagan's speech - that is, to being a robust research program. Even though they do not recognize that outcome, Mr. Lakoff and Mr. York should be happy with it, and so should the American and international political communities.

Bo Jackson: He Knows Kids and Family and the Art of Hitting

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Bo Jackson is one player who could have benefited from the threatened lockout if only he had been able to plan for it. No, Bo doesn't need the extra rest between football and baseball seasons. Had he known he might have more time before spring training, he could have planned for more school work.
The remarkable Mr. Jackson is not simply a baseball star, a football star and a television commercial star. He is also a student. In the vernacular his Nike commercial has spawned, Bo knows family and child development.
Jackson is short 23 credits - slightly more than one-quarter's worth of work - of his degree in family and child development at Auburn University. In the third abbreviated off season of his jam-packed professional career, Jackson is taking a required five-credit internship in the school of human sciences. As one of his projects, he is making a videotape aimed at young students about the importance of education. 
The Kansas City Royals wish Jackson had understood the importance of instructional league education, but he opted to play football instead.
''My feeling is he'd be much further ahead as a baseball player, but that's not his agenda,'' John Schuerholz, the Royals' general manager, said.
Even without the extra course work in curveballs and sliders, Jackson has made intriguing progress for a fellow who played only 53 games in the minor leagues after an abbreviated college baseball career. All families and children should develop as well as Jackson has with the Royals.
In his three full seasons, Jackson has raised his average from .235 to .246 to .256, his home runs from 22 to 25 to 32, and his runs batted in from 53 to 68 to 105.
The improvement is also seen in his production per time at bat. He has gone from hitting one home run every 18 times at bat to 17.6 to 16.1 and from driving in one run every 7.5 times at bat to 6.5 to 4.9.
Jackson's 1989 performance becomes even more impressive when he is compared with other hitters. Among 183 players who had 400 or more plate appearances, Kevin Mitchell had the best run production average, .352 (runs scored plus runs batted in divided by plate appearances). Jackson was second at .340, 11 percentage points ahead of third-place Kent Hrbek, 17 ahead of Eric Davis and 21 ahead of Will Clark and Ruben Sierra.
Among American League hitters, Jackson was the most damaging on the road. He led the league in road runs batted in with 59 and slugging percentage with .554 and tied Mark McGwire for most road home runs with 21.
In spite of all of those achievements, Bo appears unimpressed.
''He doesn't make anything out of it,'' Richard Woods, Jackson's agent, said. ''He never talks to me about anything but maybe throwing a guy out. He likes that. It fires him up. That's better than a touchdown run. He knows he can do that, but he was criticized for his defense. Assists are something he's proud of.''
Jackson had 11 assists in each of the last two seasons, although his fielding average slipped slightly, from .973 to .967.
Proving that he can play baseball and football, Jackson intends to continue that routine.
''There are no plans to change,'' Woods said. ''He's got two years left on his football contract. Al Davis has never implied he would like him full-time. He's kept his word. He signed Bo as a part-time player.'' The Royals earlier this winter were said to be considering offering Jackson a lusty enough contract to induce him to retire from the National Football League.
''That wasn't exactly a rumor,'' Schuerholz said. ''We did consider that.'' The Royals, though, apparently didn't make a concrete offer.
That was all right with Bo. He knows what he wants to do, and he doesn't want to stop running just yet.
 
Debating the Size of Raises
 In debating his 1990 salary in arbitration with the Royals last Friday, Jackson sought a $1,290,001 raise. It sounds like a big raise, but Mark Davis, Will Clark and Dave Stewart could sneer at it. Based on the average annual value of his new multiyear contract, each has received a raise of more than $2.5 million from his previous contract. Davis's raise is the biggest, $2.65 million, followed by Clark, $2,625,000, and Stewart, $2,541,667. Until someone comes along next week or next month or next year, Davis's raise will stand as the biggest in baseball's economically dazzling history.
 
Bringing Up the Bottom
 If Mitchell and Jackson were at the top of the 183-player run production average list, who was at the bottom? Felix Fermin of Cleveland, whose league-leading number of sacrifices (32) exceeded his total of runs batted in (21), was 183d with a .126 r.p.a.
Infielders, in general, and shortstops, in particular, not surprisingly dominated the bottom. Jose Uribe of San Francisco (.129) was 182d, Alfredo Griffin of Los Angeles (.143) was 181st, Omar Vizquel of Seattle (.151) was 179th and Garry Templeton of San Diego (.155) was 176th: shortstops all.
The other three members of the bottom nine were Mike Pagliarulo (.148), Frank White (.153), Willie Randolph (.155) and Jose Lind (.157).
Jose Canseco of Oakland, the 1988 leader with a .346 r.p.a., did not qualify for the list last season because he had 258 plate appearances. Nevertheless, his r.p.a. was a whopping .376.
Dave Henderson of Oakland tumbled from second to 53d (.340 to .244), and Kirby Puckett of Minnesota plummeted from third to 70th (.333 to .234). Mitchell climbed to first from 56th (.247 to .352) while Jackson reached the second spot from 23d (.280 to .340).
Most consistent of the highest-ranked players was Eric Davis of Cincinnati, who in 1988 was sixth at .320 and last season was fourth at .323. Darryl Strawberry of the Mets skidded from seventh to 26th (.316 to .270), but Don Mattingly of the Yankees was consistent, moving from 24th to 22d, although his average slipped (.280 to .277).
 
Rosen Defends Clark Pact
 George Steinbrenner, of all people, recently criticized Al Rosen, the San Francisco Giants' general manager, for giving Will Clark a four-year, $15 million contract, even though Clark couldn't have been a free agent for two more years.
''I'd never take offense at anyone for criticizing me,'' Rosen said in his best diplomatic effort. ''But I'd never criticize anybody else for doing what they did. If we all had to go before a judge, all 26 clubs would be found guilty for excesses with player salaries. We all do it.
''But I'm more concerned about how my boss feels than how someone else feels. Clark is a proven winner. I'd hate to think Will Clark could become a free agent during my tenure as general manager.''
Rosen, who once served as Steinbrenner's general manager, added: ''If you knew there would be no further escalation, if you knew there would be a rollback, we wouldn't do these things. But in my experience, there's always been escalation.''
In other words, Rosen was saying, in two years, Clark's contract may be a good deal for the Giants. Steinbrenner, of course, was thinking of Don Mattingly, another fair first baseman, when he criticized Rosen. Mattingly has one year left on his contract, then can be a free agent.
 
Sides Appear Planets Apart
 What happens after the owners lock out the players? The players will no more accept the owners' revenue-sharing plan while spring training camps sit silently in the sun than they have until now.
Where does a compromise lie? If at all, probably somewhere out in a galaxy far, far away because the owners and the players have been negotiating from two different planets. The real problem, if the owners refuse to open camps, could be how do they then open them. Is there an agreement out there near Pluto or Uranus that can be achieved without revenue sharing or with revenue sharing made immensely more palatable to the players? Do the owners have a Plan B?
The owners, it seems, would abandon their pay-for-performance salary system for players between years one and six in the major leagues if the players could produce an alternative plan. Whatever plan is proposed, though, it would by necessity involve fixed salaries, just as the owners' proposal has to include some sort of limit on payrolls. Revenue sharing sets a fixed amount of money that would go for player salaries and benefits; therefore, the system must assure that salaries, in total, do not exceed the amount shared.
The players do not like fixed salaries. The contracts given players this winter could not exist in a fixed-salary system. Unless, of course, the owners were to offer the players a large enough share of their revenue that could accommodate the kind of salaries that exist now and are expected to continue rising.
Under the current proposal, the players would receive 48 percent of 82 percent of the owners' revenue. National Basketball Association players receive 53 percent of approximately 98 percent of the revenue. To match that 53 percent, the baseball owners would have to offer the players 63 percent -not the 48 percent currently proposed - of the segment of revenue they want to share: ticket sales and national and local radio and television.
Based on the owners' estimated $1.3 billion revenue for 1990, the difference between a 48 percent share and a 63 percent share would be $163 million. The owners would presumably raise the percentage, though not to 63 percent and certainly not until they have some indication that the players could, as they say, bite into revenue sharing.
The problem is whenever the players think of taking a bite, they remember what happened in another time when a fellow was induced to take a bite.
 
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
 
If the owners' pay-for-performance plan had been in effect in 1989 for players with more than one year but fewer than six years of major league service, these players would have been rated the top 10 in their respective position groupings based on 1987-88 statistics and would have receved the highest salaries. The rankings were determined and disclosed by the Player Relations Committee. The P.R.C. declined to say what the players' salaries would have been. These salaries were the actual salaries and show a different ranking economically.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Midtown Recycling;
From Dowdy to Sleekly Handsome on Park Avenue

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
WHY would the Reichmann family of Toronto, developers of such enormous projects as the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan and Canary Wharf in London, go to all the bother of rebuilding a mediocre, 29-year-old tower on Park Avenue, particularly when the cost may equal that of new construction?
Quite simply because the reconstructed 320 Park Avenue will be almost one-and-one-half times larger than current zoning rules allow - a financial boon achieved without special permits, variances, public hearings or votes by government bodies.
And that is because the extra space is already contained in the 660,000-square-foot building, known as ITT Corporation World Headquarters, which was begun before the 1961 Zoning Resolution took effect. Its floor-area ratio is 19.5, in contrast to current zoning for the site, between 50th and 51st Streets, which calls for 15 on the avenue and 12 on the side streets.
In a zone with a ratio of 15, a 30,000-square-foot lot is allowed to have a building with 450,000 square feet of space. 
Olympia & York Companies (U.S.A.), the Reichmanns' New York-based subsidiary, expects to begin reconstruction early next year and finish in 1994. The developers would not discuss the project cost, but it may turn out to be as expensive as new construction. John E. Zuccotti, president of the American subsidiary, said there were already ''some very aggressive tenant inquiries.'' Rents may exceed $60 a square foot.
Although the shape and style of the building will be transformed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill - from a fat, wedding-cake-style structure into a sleeker 34-story tower, flanked by 18-story pavilions - the steel framework will remain largely unchanged, the foundations will be undisturbed and the overall dimensions will not increase.
Therefore, in the view of municipal authorities, the project amounts to no more than an alteration, meaning that the floor space can stay the same and that the development need not be reviewed by the community board, City Planning Commission or Board of Estimate.
Much of 320 Park Avenue is occupied by ITT, which moved uptown from 67 Broad Street in 1961, when it was known as International Telephone & Telegraph. At its height as a corporate conglomerate, ITT occupied the entire building, with some 4,000 employees. Now, the company has about 400 employees at its headquarters, using 275,000 square feet. Among its best known divisions are the ITT Sheraton Corporation and the ITT Hartford Insurance Group.
This fall, ITT expects to create a dual headquarters with staff on both sides of the Hudson River. Some 250 employees will move to the former ABC Building - 1330 Avenue of the Americas, at 54th Street, owned by the Shuwa Corporation of Tokyo. It will be renamed the ITT Building. The other employees will move to 100 Plaza Drive, at the Harmon Meadow office park in Secaucus, N.J.
When it became clear that 320 Park Avenue was going to lose its principal tenant and that other leases in the building would expire at about the same time, Olympia & York executives knew an opportunity was at hand.
At first, they thought simply of renovating the lobby. But they figured that a new lobby would have no impact on anyone but those who actually used the building. They thought about recreating the lobby as a two- or three-story atrium. And then they decided to exploit fully their unusual situation.
''YOU don't frequently have a whole empty building on Park Avenue to deal with,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, the executive vice president for development at Olympia & York. ''It's like a new site.''
The project affords the chance to do several things at once, including removing asbestos, although Olympia & York executives said it does not pose an immediate health hazard. ''You could rent the space tomorrow as is,'' Mr. Zuccotti said, ''but it isn't good marketing to offer a building that has asbestos.''
Reconstruction also allows floor plans to be changed. The project manager for Olympia & York, J. Dean Chavooshian, said that seven different configurations would be reduced to three basic plans. Tower floors, which command a premium rent, would grow larger. Floors at the base would shrink. Although most floors have relatively low ceilings, some have enough height to accommodate the raised floors necessary for large computer installations, depending on the tenants' needs.
''What we don't want to do is start all over again,'' said David M. Childs, a partner in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ''There is a lot of value in what's there. What needs to be changed are the civic gestures that the building makes to the street. By reproportioning the masses, the building will take on - rather than a dowdy bustle - a sleeker, more pinstriped, handsome appearance.''
FOR now, the ITT headquarters is the middle one of three remarkably similar towers on the west side of Park Avenue, between 49th and 52d Streets. The others are the Colgate-Palmolive Building at No. 300 and the former Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building at No. 350. All three were developed by Percy and Harold D. Uris and designed by Emery Roth & Sons.
''It was very important to make this building different than the bookends that surround it,'' Mr. Chavooshian said.
In addition to new proportions, 320 Park Avenue will get a new facade. It is clad in ribbons of silvery reflective-glass windows and black panels. Mr. Childs envisions walls of stone and glass, but final plans have not been drawn.
''It would be nice to give some crown, some conclusion to the building,'' he said. ''Perhaps it would be a piece of sculpture. We don't want it to be arbitrarily clipped off where the floor area ran out.'' Renderings show a deep cornice at top, but Mr. Childs is not sure that is the answer.
Asked whether Olympia & York had considered giving the architects at Emery Roth a second chance at designing the structure, Mr. Frucher said only: ''We've done work with David Childs and felt that he'd be the ideal architect.''
Olympia & York's decision to spend the money on rebuilding 320 Park Avenue was considered important enough to warrant a news conference last month in City Hall, at which Mayor David N. Dinkins called it ''the first new building project on Park Avenue in more than a decade.''
''What everyone says today is that the real estate market is flat, if not very weak,'' Mr. Zuccotti said. ''We believe that there is a strong market for quality space in New York City and that is what fired our decision. It is a reasonable risk to go ahead, given the location and what we believe to be the demand.''
''As we said to Dinkins, 'Recycling is in,' '' Mr. Frucher recounted.
Some other reconstructions of recent years are the Bank of America Plaza on Madison Avenue, between 43d and 44th Streets, which was the Biltmore Hotel; the Chemical Bank building at Broadway and Exchange Place, which was the Exchange Court Building; Park Avenue Court on Lexington Avenue, between 86th and 87th Streets, which was the Gimbels East department store, and Park Avenue Atrium, between 45th and 46th Streets, which Olympia & York rebuilt from the 466 Lexington Avenue office building.
More is being recycled at the ITT site than the old headquarters. Like other Park Avenue buildings north of Grand Central Terminal, No. 320 sits on concrete foundations and steel columns through which the tracks of the subsurface rail yard are threaded.
The foundations first supported a 12-story apartment house known as 320-30 Park Avenue. Part of the original Terminal City complex that radiated from Grand Central, it was described in promotional literature as ''a distinguished residence, richly finished in fine taste.'' The foundations were used again for the ITT building. ''After we're through,'' Mr. Childs said, ''there will be another level of structure.''
And given the accretions represented by this and other reconstructions, he added, ''New York is looking more and more like Rome.''

BROWSERS' BOUTIQUES
While nothing is for sale at the new ''Born to Shop'' exhibition in New Canaan, browsers will have a field day. Conceived and arranged by Deborah Bede, conservationist at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the show consists of six boutiques dating from the mid-1800's to the 1930's, set up in vignettes throughout the New Canaan Historical Society Town House at 13 Oenoke Ridge. Many of the items were donated or lent by area residents.
An establishment called Annabelle's Accessories features items that include a red and blue silk shawl, circa 1850, and an ivory-framed mauve silk fan spangled in silver. At Madame Cherida's, the proprietor and mannequin in Victorian dress is realistically stationed at her desk near a dress form draped with maroon silk velvet, taffeta, fringe and beads, and a luxurious brown silk outfit made for a bride. Mannequins dressed as 1900's customers are poised on the stairs en route to the next shop. 
At Wee Blessings a collection of christening gowns and baby clothes is on display, and Eastern Outfiters, Rockwell Brothers, Proprietors, has a tailor on his knees measuring the hem of a green faille gown from 1913. Shoes are the only merchandise at J.& T.W. Benedict, dating from World War I and featuring bronze slippers with cut-steel trim, maroon and gold kid shoes and other elegant footwear. The Modern Shop offers a display of 1930's lingerie and gala evening gowns, including one from Fortuny, and a copy of Ginger Rogers' silk and feather gown from ''Top Hat.''
Hours are 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 2 to 4 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday until June 10, free of charge. Call 966-1776 for more information.
STRING QUARTET
Peter Schickele's ''American Dreams,'' and ''Quartet No. 6 the Audubon,'' composed by Ezra Laderman, dean of the Yale School of Music, for the Audubon Quartet, will be on the string ensemble's program at 7:30 P.M. Thursday in the Mattatuck Museum.
The group, formed in 1974 in Virginia, is made up of David Ehrlich and David Salness, violinists, Doris Lederer, violist, and Thomas Shaw, cellist. They have performed at the International String Competition in Evian, France, and at the Portsmouth International String Competition in England as well as throughout the United States.
Tickets are $10, and an additional $5 will admit the ticket holder to a champagne reception following the concert. The museum is at 144 West Main Street in Waterbury. Call 753-0381 for reservations.
 
MOVIE MUSIC
''A celebration of Afro-American originality on celluloid'' is the way Yale describes its film series called ''Black Music at the Movies,'' beginning at 9 P.M. Thursday in the Art Gallery Lecture Hall on Chapel Street with ''Cabin in the Sky.'' The 1943 film, starring Ethel Waters, Eddie Anderson and Lena Horne, with John Bubbles, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, concerns a musical battle between God and the Devil for the soul of Eddie Anderson as Little Joe.
It will be preceded at 7:30 P.M. by a slide lecture with Donald Bogle, a film historian and critic and the author of ''Blacks in American Films and Television: An Encyclopedia,'' published in 1988. The film will be shown again at 7:30 P.M. Friday, followed by ''Round Midnight,'' made in 1986, at 9:15 P.M.
Dexter Gordon, Herbie Hancock and Lonette McKee are featured in the fictionalized biography of two jazz musicians, Lester Young and Bud Powell, during their years as expatriates in Paris. ''Round Midnight'' will be repeated at 2:30 P.M. next Sunday. Admission is free. For more information call 432-0600.
 
CHINA TRADE
The Bruce Museum and the Greenwich Antiques Society have mounted an exhibition opening at the museum today called ''The China Trade: Decorative Art From the Connecticut Collections.'' The exhibition, which draws on the private collections of 28 Connecticut residents, consists of more than 70 Chinese export objects of various vintages, including porcelains, paintings, lacquerware, silver, paper fans, furniture, and several pieces of Armorial Ware from the Mottahedeh collection of made-to-order porcelain designed around a family crest, monogram or motto.
The show will run until March 25 and the museum, which is just off Exit 3 of Interstate 95, is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and from 2 to 5 P.M. Sunday. Admission is by donation.
Two lectures are scheduled in connection with the exhibition. At 10 A.M. Monday, David Howard will present a talk titled ''Chinese Export Porcelain for Merchants and Noblemen on Both Sides of the Atlantic'' in the Riverside Yacht Club.
On March 5, Peter Rosenberg, owner of the Vallin Galleries in Wilton, will discuss the origins of the China trade and its economic, political and cultural ramifications from ancient times through the 19th century. The program will be held at the Bruce Museum at 10 A.M. Admission to each talk will be $5, including a coffee hour at 9:30 A.M. Call 869-0376 for reservations or more information. $90ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT OPINION;
The Methodical Ways of a Collector

 BODY:
THE toothpaste tubes should have sent up a signal. When I began dating my husband, his friends chided him about being forthright and honest. I wondered what deep, dark secrets he was hiding. Did he have a criminal record? Was he suffering from some dreaded disease? As it turned out, his affliction was, and is, obsessive collecting.
When he finally realized our relationship was getting serious, he decided to come clean. In the upstairs bathroom of his house was an old-fashioned bathtub overflowing with empty toothpaste tubes. There must have been hundreds of them and not just any kind; they were all Crest toothpaste tubes.
When I asked the obvious question - why he had such a collection - he really didn't have much of an explanation, other than to say it seemed such a waste to throw away articles that so skillfully displayed the art of American advertising. 
Once he confessed, he found it easier to acknowledge some of his other unusual collections. In his early teens, transistor radios were the craze and he found it difficult to part with the dead batteries from them. Remnants of those were present in shoeboxes scattered about his bedroom. He was sure that if he waited long enough, someone would come up with a use for them. He's still waiting.
A bit later in our courtship, I was introduced to his then-current fanaticism, postmark collecting. His goal was to obtain the postmark of every city and town in the United States, which meant an inordinate amount of traveling whenever time and money permitted. Many of our dates were spent searching out well-hidden tiny buildings in small towns that doubled as general stores and post offices.
''It's a great way to see parts of the country we'd never see,'' he would say when I expresed a desire to see a mall I'd never otherwise see. He was also sure that such a collection would one day be extremely valuable.
In his inimitable, methodical way he catalogued the postmarks and placed them in those invaluable shoeboxes, being sure not to confuse them with those that were battery laden. His photographic memory came in handy when people asked him what marks he needed, and he could spout off quickly the gaps in his collection, which finally reached 8,000.
Anyone planning a trip across the country would be given instructions on how to secure a clear, hand-canceled postmark, and often my husband would receive a blank card bearing intriguing names like Bumble Bee, Ariz., or Santa, Idaho, with no sender identified.
I remember when, soon after we became engaged, we took a trip with my parents, and what should have taken two hours took four because of all the post office stops we made. I think my folks were beginning to have some doubts about my future happiness, but how could I not give my heart to a man who sought out postmarks from the towns of Ruth in Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada and Mississippi?
Once we were married and the children came along, that pastime dwindled because of other commitments. While his energies were mainly directed toward his family and career, with some time spent on amassing baseball cards and certain coins, I knew that ultimately something would come along that would pique his interest. Knowing his economical nature, I wasn't surprised when, with the advent of double coupons at the supermarket, his next obsession was born.
One or two nights a week he can be found sitting on the floor of his den, scissors in hand and surrounded by piles of newspaper inserts. I can tell by the expression on his face whether it's going to be a good or mediocre visit to the check-out counter.
Again his organizational skills come into play with this endeavor. All the coupons are categorically placed in envelopes that are alphabetically stacked in a large box. That container goes to the supermarket whenever he does. The first and only time I took the box to the store, I left it in the grocery cart as I went out of the store. Luckily a call to the manager revealed it had been turned in, so his collection and our marriage were saved.
My friends tell me how fortunate I am not to have to do the bulk of the grocery shopping, but there are drawbacks. We don't need, nor do we have space for, 20 jars of spaghetti sauce or 18 rolls of paper towels. But it's the cat food (we don't have any pets) and the diapers (our children are teen-agers) that really set me off. My assertions that ''we're not saving money if you buy items we don't need'' are met with assurances that he knows people who can use them and after all, the products are just about free.
While coupons bring savings, they also create embarrassment. When I accompany my spouse to the market, which is rare, he delights in surveying the contents of other shoppers' wagons to see if he has coupons for the products they are purchasing. I cringe as he accosts them to share his booty, but the hobby has increased his circle of friends. He's met many people in the aisles of the stores, and a talk before the local women's club resulted in a bevy of swapping activity. Women, stacks of coupons in hand, knock on our door, and I have explicit instructions on which ones they are to receive in the exchange.
Each outing to the market entails hours of standing before the items in question, debating which size would be best to buy. I have no patience for this time-consuming activity, but I must admit that his efforts pay off. On most trips he realizes savings of $30 to $40.
While coupons are a major source of enjoyment for my husband, bottles and cans have become his No. 1 recreational priority. In 1985, when the state enacted its bottle bill, our 10-year old son began collecting the containers and redeeming them for the nickel deposit. His goal was to buy a Mercedes-Benz when he reached 16.
Eric's enthusiams for the activity was short-lived, but his father was quick to fill the void. Now, whenever he has some free time and feels the need to get out and walk, he pursues what has come to be known around our house as canning.
First and foremost is the profit derived from the hobby, and while Eric may not be seen behind the wheel of a Mercedes when he's ready to drive, he will no doubt have some form of transportation to show off to his friends. Many people are quick to throw out empties, not willing to take the time and effort to clean, store and return them for a meager nickel, but my husband knows nickels quickly add up to dollars. His perseverance and foresight have paid off; Eric's car account now has a balance of $6,800.
In pursuing this quest, my husband claims to have received a great deal more than money. As a school principal, much of his time is spent under pressure. This diversion allows for exercise, relaxation and interaction with a variety of people he would never have a chance to meet. He has also done a great many undocumented studies on the drinking habits of the American people, which he is quick to share with anyone who will listen. And, of course, he is pleased to be doing his small part to help clean up the environment.
While he often just walks along the roads of our town, his largest hauls come from scouring state parks during summer weekends. Dressed in old clothes, he rummages through garbage pails, seeking his finds. While many onlookers shake their heads, no doubt as an expression of sympathy for this poor fellow who must be down and out on his luck, my husband inwardly chuckles. He loves to imagine their reaction if they were to recognize him when registering their children at his school.
Her dad's hobby has brought some mortification to our college-aged daughter, whose male friends have sometimes been recruited to help carry and hose down some of the bounty. I, of course, decline all invitations to accompany him on these excursions and direct my energies into making up believable excuses why we can't attend social functions on summer weekends.
I suppose I shouldn't complain. He could have worse habits, but I can't help bristle when there's no room in the cupboards because of dozens of jars of peanut butter or salad dressing, and the mounds of empty cans that line our backyard.
My main concern is, what will be next?

 BODY:
THE old adage ''can't see the forest for the trees'' might never have been more appropriate than on the day the Long Island Pine Barrens Society hurled a massive lawsuit at the people of Long Island.
The strategy of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society is to use the largest lawsuit of its kind in state history to force a halt to projects worth $11.2 billion. Not only is this lawsuit ill conceived, but it is also ill timed, with the potential effect of shifting millions of dollars of property taxes onto Suffolk homeowners when they are already suffering from the largest tax increases in county history.
No one disputes the need to preserve a portion of our pine barren areas if we are going to insure an adequate supply of drinking water for Long Island's future. In fact, the Association for a Better Long Island, whose members have more than $20 billion invested in Long Island, was one of the first organizations on Long Island to support the 1987 0.25 percent sales tax referendum, which is now being used by Suffolk County to fund pine barren purchases. 
That program has been working particularly well. During the 1980's, Suffolk County acquired more than 10,000 acres of open space, which does not include the properties taken by New York State under such programs as the environmental bond act. The beauty of this program is that it enabled the land to be preserved in its natural state without resorting to additional property taxes.
The lawsuit by the Long Island Pine Barrens Society is an entirely different matter. Everyone, even developers, agrees that we need to preserve a significant amount of open space, not only to protect our drinking water, but out of concern for the environment in general. The problem is that the Pine Barrens Society really seeks to prevent construction on nearly every piece of vacant land in Suffolk County.
The Pine Barrens Society is relying on its ability to manipulate the legal system to halt construction on more than 100,000 acres of property. Because this lawsuit uses the power of government to deny the permits and thus diminish the value of property, it amounts to a de-facto taking of the property by government.
So it is important to remember that under the same legal system, the owners of that property have the right to recover the lost value of their property from government. This could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, on top of the highest tax increases on record. In addition, there will be tens of millions more in lost property tax revenue, taxes that government will no longer be able to collect because it has become the owner of these properties.
As bad as the threat of another round of property taxes might seem, that isn't the only disaster that might result from the Pine Barrens lawsuit. There are several other economic dangers inherent in bringing to a screeching halt nearly all projects in Suffolk County. To begin with, the local economy, which appeared to be almost invulnerable during most of the 1980's, enters the 1990's perched on the brink of a potential downturn. The Grumman Corporation has been given only three more years to build its most famous airplane, the F-14; unemployment figures are up, and sales tax revenues have fallen considerably short of expected levels for the last two years.
Economic growth, which could help overcome those problems, will be strangled if no construction is allowed for any significant period of time, thereby compounding the difficulty of the situation. In addition, we will be unable to confront some of the other critical problems that endanger our economy. For instance, the lack of affordable housing is driving away the young families on whom we must depend for an educated, talented work force. Because housing is so expensive, many of the young workers on Long Island, needed to sustain our future, are moving away.
A lawsuit provides no special exemption for worthwhile purposes. If this lawsuit makes it illegal to build in vast areas of Suffolk, it will also be illegal to build the housing that these young families so desperately need.
There is a good side to the debate over preserving the pine barrens. This is not an either-or question. If we abandon extremist approaches to the problem, we will find reasonable solutions that can satisfy the goals of protecting our water supply and natural heritage, as well as allowing for reasonable economic growth.
The solution is not to go off blindly and halt all development, thus risking destruction of an economy already poised on the brink of an increasingly narrow precipice, but to use already proven methods of land use planning. The 32,000 acres of pine barrens to be acquired under the Suffolk County land preservation program are a good start. In addition, we can use innovative methods, such as clustered housing on plots with much open space, to preserve large natural areas at no cost to the public.
Only if we use common sense rather than incendiary tactics will we able to enjoy the forest as well as the trees.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Compromise Is Possible For Housing

BYLINE: By By Jeffrey Rubin and Joseph J. Seneca; Jeffrey Rubin is an associate professor and Joseph J. Seneca is a professor of economics at Rutgers University at New Brunswick.

 BODY:
THE two Mount Laurel decisions by the Supreme Court and the subsequent passage of the Fair Housing Act have brought nationwide attention to New Jersey. The state's housing policy has also fueled intense local debate and continued litigation.
One of the most controversial aspects of the Fair Housing Act allows municipalities to transfer up to 50 percent of their affordable-housing obligation to other communities. Recent disputes over attempts by Middletown and Parsippany-Troy Hills to negotiate regional contribution agreements with other communities exemplify these problems. 
The difficulties arise, in part, from an underlying conflict between the two primary goals of New Jersey housing policy: to increase the supply of affordable housing statewide and to achieve a more equitable distribution of this supply across communities.
The Fair Housing Act and other housing programs offer communities fiscal and legal incentives to expand the supply of affordable housing. In addition to regional contribution agreements, communities can construct affordable housing themselves and rehabilitate existing substandard units. They can also offer builders a density bonus. In return, the builder agrees to dedicate a portion of the new development to low-income and moderate-income households.
When choosing which methods to use, municipal officials are likely to be guided by community preferences. For example, some communities may be unwilling to accept the possible congestion and character change associated with inclusionary developments. They may also be concerned with the effects of such developments on housing values and property taxes.
A regional contribution agreement offers a community the opportunity to avoid or reduce these consequences. In a recent study, we examined how local economic conditions and other factors influenced decisions by municipalities to include such an agreement in their affordable-housing plans.
We reviewed 45 municipal plans certified by the Council on Affordable Housing. Our results indicate that the 11 towns using a regional contribution agreement had a higher average per capita income, higher average residential value and lower average equalized property tax rates than the 34 communities that did not.
In addition, a measure of the subsidy per housing unit that existing residents would provide to owners of affordable units was significantly higher in towns that used the regional agreement method compared with towns that did not. Such subsidies may arise because affordable units are taxed at their restricted price rather than at full market value. The communities receiving regional agreement funds have predominantly been older cities.
These findings and the use of these agreements have several implications. First, the agreements effectively shift some of the burden of financing affordable housing to communities that are willing and able to pay. Without the agreement option, the additional urban housing it finances either would not exist or, if it did, would require an alternative source of funds.
In the past, communities could use, without penalty, their zoning authority to exclude low-income and moderate-income housing. Now, they can limit the number of affordable units, but only at the price of paying for a regional agreement.
Second, in a weak housing market, municipalities are less likely to be challenged by developers seeking to build large numbers of market-rate units in inclusionary developments. If the threat of litigation diminishes, municipalities may have less incentive to expand the supply of affordable housing.
In such a housing market, the state must assure the availability of options that make it easier for a municipality to develop an affordable-housing plan. A regional agreement may prove essential to encourage some communities to participate in the affordable housing process.
Finally, these agreements affect the distribution of affordable housing in complicated ways. If the agreement option were eliminated, or the 50 percent constraint tightened, two possibilities exist.
One is that communities that would have relied on an agreement would, instead, meet all their affordable-housing obligation within their borders. If this occurred, the total supply of affordable units would be unaffected, but the distribution of this housing between city and suburb would be different.
A second and worrisome possibility, however, is that by eliminating the agreement option, some communities may react by delaying the implementation of any housing plan. This would reduce the supply of affordable housing and frustrate the basic goal of the Fair Housing Act.
Allowing communities to buy out of their affordable-housing obligation will remain a controversial policy. We believe that the need to increase the supply of affordable housing is compelling and deserves precedence over the distributional goal when these two conflict.
Constraining regional contribution agreements at 50 percent of a community's affordable-housing obligation represents a reasonable compromise. As long as receiving communities are free to accept or reject an offer, and absent a state commitment for broad-based financing of affordable housing, regional contribution agreements serve the basic intent of the Fair Housing Act.

HEADLINE: O'Rourke Sets New Goal on Housing the Homeless

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
INITIATING what he clearly intended to be a major assualt on Westchester's homeless problem, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said last week that he was moving from ''the think-tank stage to the let's-do-something stage.''
Mr. O'Rourke established a 15-member Housing Implementation Commission consisting of private builders, developers, union officers and elected officials and assigned it the task of ''developing 1,000 units of family shelter'' by the end of the year.
He said that some of the 1,000 units might include ''upgraded apartments and conversions, rather than new construction.''
The commission, which he acknowledged would have a difficult time dealing with communities opposed to housing for the homeless, was also told to develop plans for 5,000 units of permanent housing for the homeless. ''We won't produce them by the end of 1990, but I'd like the plans to exist,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. 
 
Cost to County Has Risen Steadily
The County Executive has watched the cost to the county rise steadily as the homeless population increased to 4,455 last year from 1,173 in 1985. He said last week that he had given up on any present or future financial assistance from Federal or state agencies.
''I no longer trust the state or Federal Government to produce anything of substance in coming years,'' he said. ''If anything, I see them hardening, instead of making it easier for us to do our job.''
If the county is to solve its homeless problem, he said, ''we're going to do it, in the main, by ourselves, and through the creative use of existing state and Federal regulations.''
Mr. O'Rourke, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, suggested that the situation might get worse even as solutions were sought. He said the county could lose more than 13,000 low- to moderate-income housing units by 2005 if action is not taken to avert the impact of certain Federal and state regulations.
The current law, he said, permits private lenders and owners who built subsidized rental housing in the 1970's to prepay their mortgages and then terminate the below-market rent guidelines that apply to those buildings. Mr. O'Rourke did not offer any specific plan to counter this change but said: ''It has come to our attention that there has been no concerted approach to solving this problem. So we'd like people to know that something has to be done.''
The low-interest loans and guaranteed subsidies were offered in the 1970's to encourage private developers to build and operate moderate-income housing units. The loans can be prepaid on their 20th anniversary, and apartments originally covered by rent subsidies can then be rented at market value. Mr. O'Rourke conceded that so far there had been few such ''buyouts.''
 
20 Communities Affected
Perhaps, he said, ''prepayments will be disallowed, giving us more time'' to find solutions. ''Maybe there are state and Federal programs that would enable the people in those apartments to buy out the mortgages, and own their own apartments.''
More than 20 Westchester communities could be affected, with four cities being especially vulnerable. There are more than 6,700 such units in Yonkers, 1,721 in White Plains and 1,800 each in Mount Vernon and New Rochelle. Mr. O'Rourke said he was sponsoring a conference in April to study ways of addressing the situation.
The new push being made by Mr. O'Rourke to build 1,000 transitional and 5,000 permanent units for the homeless was also addressed only broadly, although Mr. O'Rourke acknowledged that the major impediment would be what it has always been, the resistance of local officials to accept such housing.
''We're talking about some heavy-duty movement, and some political strife,'' the County Executive said, adding with a smile that he hoped his audience ''realized why I need 15 people to hide behind when those things happen.''
The Housing Implementation Commission was one of two such agencies that replaced the four-year-old Commission on the Homeless. The new agencies were intended to implement housing goals but with memberships better able to accomplish those objectives, according to two members of the outgoing unit, Dr. Anthony A. Cupaiuolo, the chairman, and Ann Tourk, the vice chairwoman.
 
'More Political Involvement'
Dr. Cupaiuolo, who is a professor of public administration and director of the Michaelian Institute at Pace University, said the reconstituted commission needed to have ''some more corporate involvement and more political involvement.''
Political leaders, he explained, ''could be helpful in trying to persuade some of their former colleagues to be more responsive to the needs of homeless people.''
Ms. Tourk agreed, saying that the composition of the old commission ''did not have enough broad-based representation or enough clout.''
''We're all cut from the same cloth - advocates for the homeless,'' said Ms. Tourk, who is the area director of the American Jewish Committee. ''We needed people from the business community, people with greater visibility in leadership positions, a more diversified group.''
 
A Division of Responsibilities
Mr. O'Rourke replaced the old commission with two advisory boards: the Housing Implementation Commission to implement the housing goals, and also a Commissioners' Interagency Advisory Group on Homelessness, which will deal primarily with the day-to-day issues of service.
Mr. O'Rourke said that the chairman of the Housing Implementation Commission would be ''a senior officer of a major Westchester corporation'' and other members would come from the ranks of builders, developers, elected officials and union officers. The establishment of the commission is subject to approval by the Board of Legislators.
He is expected to name the members shortly and said the commission would probably conduct its first meeting before the end of February, or before the Board of Legislators is likely to act.
Mr. O'Rourke was asked if he would identify possible sites for the 1,000 units of housing. ''I don't know how else to do it,'' he said, indicating that he would do so.
 
Board Updates Its Housing Policy
The Board of Legislators, meanwhile, has commissioned experts on suburban housing at Rutgers University to study Westchester's needs, said Legislator Timothy S. Carey, chairman of the Community Affairs and Housing Committee, who said it was part of an updating of the board's housing policy for the next decade.
Instead of ''just saying we need 50,000 units, which is what the 1980 study said, we are looking to be able to define it down to a regional or perhaps town or city levels,'' Mr. Carey said. The study should be completed before the end of this year, he said.
The 50,000-unit estimate for the 1980's, he said, ''had no delineation by socio-economic need or by income.'' Now, he said, ''We are looking at needs, so we will be able to say how many low-income, moderate-income, middle-income houses will be needed.''
The results would go beyond the needs of the homeless, but would have an effect on that segment of the population. ''In the last 10 years we have turned 30,000 units of rental housing into co-ops and condominiums,'' Mr. Carey said. In the same period, he added, ''We've built only 250 units of fair-market rental housing, which is why we come up with housing gridlock.''
 
A Final Report Is Delivered
The Commission on the Homeless, in its final report, called for a number of improvements on the state and Federal level, such as increasing housing subsidies, and endorsed an effort on the county's part to have the state amend its constitution to enable counties to create permanent housing.
It also faulted all levels of government within the county for not confronting the issue of housing for the homeless. ''We certainly have a long way to go,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''Unfortunately many of our best and brightest ideas are hampered by the lack of initiative and cooperation on the part of other levels of government.
''Perhaps the strongest conclusion that was drawn by this report,'' he said, ''is that the powers who are able to solve the problem are not willing to deal with the problem.''
Dr. Cupaiuolo pointed to some specific accomplishments by the outgoing commission. One was the creation of the Eviction Prevention Program, in which mediators working with the courts and the Department of Social Services intervene in efforts to prevent eviction. Eviction is the cause of 36 percent of the incidents of homelessness, he said.

HEADLINE: Divergent Goals at River Site Owned by State

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: OSSINING

 BODY:
FOR nearly a quarter of a century, a 17.8-acre slice of wilderness land rising steeply above the Hudson River has remained wild and undeveloped, ignored by the State Department of Transportation, which owns it, and coveted by the village of Ossining, which wants the property on its tax rolls.
Now the Department of Transportation, under pressure from the Governor's office to dispose of surplus land to help meet a growing budget deficit, has turned its attention to its Ossining property. But its plans for the land have become the focus of dissension as groups with different objectives try to balance the sometimes competing needs for affordable housing, environmental protection and fiscal prudence.
 
Decision a Relief to Many
The land was originally purchased for a Hudson River Expressway, which was never built. To the relief of those who feared that the state would sell the property to the highest bidder, the State Department of Transportation decided to transfer title to another state agency to permit construction of affordable housing on a part of the site. 
That decision was confirmed by state officials last week and came in response to a request from the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which will oversee the housing construction, as well as to a proposal outlined by a village coalition of clergy and housing advocates.
But environmentalists have expressed concern because the State Division of Housing is considering subsidizing the cost of the affordable housing on the eastern end of the parcel by also building market-rate units. These would be placed on the 10 to 12 acres that are near the river, an environmentally sensitive area of coastal highland with sweeping views of the Hudson River, the Palisades and Croton Point Park.
While supporting the affordable housing on the eastern section, the environmental groups - Scenic Hudson, the Heritage Task Force and others - tried to persuade the Department of Transportation to transfer the land with restrictions that would preventing development on the 12 western-most acres. But a spokesman for the department said the state agency receiving the land was ''the more appropriate group to decide on the use of the property.''
''We do want to continue to have part of the land on the Hudson remain as open space,'' said Judith A. Engel, director of development and planning for the State Division of Housing. ''But you do need to sell some units on the river at market rates to finance the affordable units.''
Trying to balance the needs of the environment with the need for affordable housing and the demands of the budget is important and difficult, Ms. Engel said. ''The sale of market-rate housing is particularly important when there are very few dollars to go around,'' she added.
 
A Plus for Village Tax Rolls
The state plan would fill what many agree is a critical need for affordable housing in Ossining and would also bolster the village tax rolls. But housing advocates say that if there is no cost associated with obtaining the land, as now seems to be the case, market-rate housing should not be needed to subsidize the affordable units.
The Ossining Ministerial Association, a 30-member group leading the effort to build affordable housing in the community, opposes selling part of the land for market-rate housing. ''If the land is given to a nonprofit housing corporation, we believe that decent, affordable housing could be built, and financing obtained without the need to sell off a beautiful, priceless plateau,'' said Dr. Robert J. Berson, a leader of the association.
Dr. Berson said a nonprofit consortium of trade unions and builders that recently offered $250 million from its pension funds to finance affordable housing in Westchester was one of the sources the Ossining group would turn to.
The 12 acres in question are landlocked and nearly inaccessible by foot; it is generally agreed that construction would be difficult and therefore expensive. David Bogdanoff, a Westchester developer, has studied the affordable housing potential of the site for the village and believes that between 80 and 160 co-operative units could be built for residents with incomes of up to $30,000, ''using available financing.''
The village should not try to build market-rate homes along the river, said Mr. Bogdanoff, the managing partner of Montrose Construction Corporation in Yorktown, explaining that the project would require an expensive extension of Beach Road.
Environmentalists and neighbors are opposed to the development of the 12-acre portion of the land at any cost. The Beach Road-Brayton Park Homeowners Association, representing a neighborhood just northeast of the parcel; a coalition of regional environmental groups, and some state legislators argue that construction of expensive housing on the riverfront runs counter to the objectives of the Hudson River Greenway Council and to state policies that advocate the acquisition of open space.
The Greenway Council is a state-appointed group studying how to establish a linked system of trails, recreation areas and open spaces along the Hudson. It recently heard a presentation by the Brayton Park Homeowners Association that asked for help in preserving the land.
 
'This Magnificent Property'
''As construction removes, once and for all, more and more of our wilderness landscape,'' the association said, ''communities like ours have come to recognize acutely the precious value of the few remaining pockets of undeveloped land.''
Louis B. McCagg, president of the Westchester Land Trust, expressed his objections in a letter to the Transportation Commissioner, Franklin E. White. ''This magnificent property is one which, if it were in private ownership, the state would seek to acquire for open-space preservation along the Hudson,'' he wrote. ''Since it is already in state ownership, it would be a false economy, indeed, to sell it now for a use that would destroy its open-space value.''
His comments have been echoed by leaders of Scenic Hudson, the Heritage Task Force for the Hudson River Valley and Clearwater, among other environmental groups.
 
Pataki Objects to Sale
''Whether this is a sale or a transfer of state land to an agency that is going to turn around and sell it to a developer, makes no difference,'' Assemblyman George E. Pataki of Peekskill said last week. ''It's ridiculous to sell land that could be a critical part of the Greenway just before the Governor is sending a $1 billion bond issue to voters in November to ask for money to buy more land.'' Mr. Pataki is a member of the Greenway Council.
''No one objects to splitting off five or six acres for affordable housing,'' Mr. Pataki said. But the remainder of the Ossining property, which is adjacent to the Croton Aquaduct and to the village-owned Crawbuckie Nature Preserve, constitutes a ''tremendous asset'' to the Greenway, he added.
''For us to make a profit by selling it to a developer is idiotic,'' Mr. Pataki said. He said he planned to introduce legislation calling for a one-year moratorium on the sale of state land in the 13 ''Greenway counties'' of the Hudson Valley. It is unclear whether such a moratorium would stop a transfer to another state agency or prevent housing from being built.
 
Governor's Help Is Asked
There has been no official announcement about the future of the property. But Ms. Engel said last week that the Transportation Department ''has committed itself to transfer their land for the purpose of building affordable housing.'' The transaction was confirmed, she said, in a letter on Jan. 5 from Commissioner White to the Housing Commissioner, Richard Higgins.
After learning of the land transfer last week, members of the Brayton Park Association wrote Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asking for help, said Christine H. Miller, a lawyer who lives in Brayton Park with her husband, Mitchell. The letter asks for the Governor's support to divide the use of the site between affordable housing and green space.
Thomas Cambariere is a Village Trustee who has been a strong advocate of affordable housing. ''It's all coming to a happy ending, unless you live on Beach Road,'' he said after he learned of the state's decision last week. ''The affordability of the houses we build is affected by what we do with the land on the bluff. Now, it's up to the money. If we can get enough money to build affordable housing without the use of this parcel, there will be a park there, absolutely.''
As for what influence the village has in the matter, Mr. Cambariere said that state housing officials had assured him they would cooperate with the desires of the village.
 
Many Questions Remain
Later this month, top officials from the Department of Housing are to meet here with village officials and iron out the details of the plan, Ms. Engel said. State officials hope to issue a request, in conjunction with village officials, for proposals from potential developers of the site The Ossining Village Manager, Gennaro J. Faiella, said last week that he was pleased the state had finally decided to allow the property to be used, but he added, ''We have a whole series of questions.''
A survey is planned to determine the extent of the need for affordable housing in Ossining, he said, and officials also need to decide whether parkland should be set aside and how that might affect the tax ratables generated by the project.

HEADLINE: Both Germanys - Almost Unified

BYLINE: By Graham Allison; Graham Allison was dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government from 1977 to 1989.

 BODY:
No country, especially the U.S., can any longer avoid addressing the issue of German reunification.
While politicians continue to scramble, they are being outrun by the galloping political and economic forces in both Germanys. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, who fears reunification most, this week acknowledged its inevitably. But he warns sharply against the ''chaos of nihilism, the diktat of the crowd.'' 
Has reunification already occurred? Yes, almost. Historians will identify 1989's closing months as decisive. Both Germanys reawakened to being a single nation in the currency that matters most: hearts and minds. Formalities and legalities remained. But de facto, Deutschland again became one nation that increasingly acted as one state.
The terms are evident, though dip lomatic rhetoric will seek to obfuscate them. In business language, this is no merger; it is an acquisition. The Federal Republic is acquiring the German Democratic Republic on the basis of West German values, economics and deutschmarks.
What impels these developments? The proximate cause was Mr. Gorbachev's decision not to use troops to maintain Soviet-imposed governments in Eastern Europe. What kept these governments in power was Eastern Europeans' belief that the troops served as prison guards.
Once that dam was removed, natural forces rushed to predictable results. First, nationalism was no less authentic in Germany than in any other Eastern European state celebrating independence. Second, East Germany collapsed. Its original claim ''to build socialism on German soil'' had a certain credibility. In practice, the experiment failed. The peaceful revolution exposed German Communism as worse than a failure: It was a fraud.Third, the scars of 40 years left East Germans with deep convictions that shaped politics. Enabled freely to express their own views, solid majorities will be anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, pro-Western values and pro-German.
Could these forces produce formal anschluss sooner rather than later? Two German elections loom this year: March, in the East; December, in the West. Nearly 3,000 East Germans vote with their feet daily; annualized, this amounts to 7 percent of the remaining population.
The East German Government's desperate search for ways to persuade the populace that their prospects are as promising in the East as in the West is under way. Large-scale West German subsidies and investments will hinge upon guarantees for property and investment. But this will in effect mean rapid acquisition of the East.
Under such conditions, what are the prospects for preserving separate political authorities? If a plebiscite is held, most East Germans are likely to vote for immediate unification. If they do, no West German government could refuse the offer.
Only Mr. Gorbachev can arrest this march of history. His words, however, suggest that early anschluss lies beyond even his bottom line. While he might find ways to accommodate to an evolution over time, he reportedly told President Francois Mitterrand that ''the same day the reunification of Germany is announced, a general will be sitting in my armchair.'' With 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, he can prevent unification if he so desires.
Although it seems hard to believe, he could threaten to use the troops. Or he could attempt to replay Stalin's 1952 card: the price for unification would be a neutral state (as proposed by Prime Minister Hans Modrow) empty of all foreign troops.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preferring to remain in the NATO fold, has rejected neutralization. If Mr. Gorbachev stands fast and can make it stick, Mr. Kohl may be forced to rethink his options. For the U.S., neither the use of Soviet troops nor neutralization would be acceptable.
Failing to appreciate the forces in the saddle, Western goverments could wring their hands and simply allow the inevitable to take final shape. But this could have very damaging effects on relations with Moscow. Thus, Washington and the West would do far better to make unambiguous their support for unification, endorse Mr. Kohl's concept of the process and explore with Moscow the terms for accepting a united Germany inside NATO.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: THE STRATFORD HEADQUARTERS OF TEXTRON LYCOMING;
At a Defense Plant, No Peace if Jobs Are Lost

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
LAST year, Textron Lycoming in Stratford was predicting a secure future: It had orders to produce 1,000 Army tank engines a year through 1996.
But last week workers at the sprawling plant near the mouth of the Housatonic River were told that 1,350 employees - nearly a third of its work force of 4,000 - could be laid off in the next couple of years if President Bush's deficit-reducing proposal to eliminate the M-1 tank program is carried out. Textron Lycoming makes the 1,500-horsepower gas turbine engine that powers the M-1.
The proposed cutback, one of several announced Monday, is regarded as a response to the easing of East-West relations and to a perceived decline in threats to world peace, but many of the workers at Textron Lycoming said the President is moving too fast.
''Just because the Berlin Wall went down doesn't mean there's no threat,'' said Robert A. Meier, who makes parts for the tank engine. ''There are still other countries.'' Robert Koetsch, a plant security guard, said: ''This could be part of a plan, a plan to get our defenses down, get our guard down. If they shut this place down, and something happens in two or three years, it's going to take a while to start up again.'' 
Theresa R. Bruno, a 30-year veteran of the inspections department, said plant workers take pride in their work and find the prospect of losing the M-1 tank frustrating. ''We work and strive to give them a good product,'' she said, ''and I don't see why they have to eliminate it.'' Not just workers are worried. Neil F. Sherman, vice president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, said he was concerned about how the loss of the M-1 project would affect the rest of the local economy; Textron Lycoming is one of the two largest employers in Stratford, along with the Sikorsky Aircraft helicopter plant farther up the Housatonic in the north end of town.
''In Stratford, we like to say when Sikorsky and Textron catch a cold, the town comes down with pneumonia,'' Mr. Sherman said.
The same might be said of much of the state and its ties to its defense industries. With $4.9 billion in military contracts, Connecticut - though it is 28th in population among the 50 states - ranks eighth in dependency on military money. Connecticut's $1,531 per capita in military spending is second only to Virginia's. Under Mr. Bush's budget, contracts at Pratt & Whitney, the jet-engine builder and a subsidiary of the giant United Technologies Corporation in Hartford, would also be cut back.
In Stratford, this dependency can be felt down the road from the Textron Lycoming plant, at the Windsock Restaurant inside the terminal at the local airport. There, many Textron Lycoming workers go for lunch or after work for a beer, and the owner, James E. Boone, said he worries about losing customers if plant workers are laid off.
After Textron's last layoffs, in 1988, business at the Windsock dropped 30 percent and never recovered, Mr. Boone said. Now, he said, if the company cuts a third of its work force, his business will go under. ''If they go, I go,'' he said.
Mr. Boone and some Textron Lycoming retirees spent a recent afternoon in the lounge area of the Windsock guessing which of the people signed up for a shuffleboard tournament in February would have to withdraw because they would be too busy looking for jobs.
''That place goes up and down, up and down; nothing surprises me anymore,'' said John Morrison, who retired last June after 27 years as a gear inspector at the plant. ''I guess the generals have enough tanks to play with for a while.''
William B. McDaniel, a spokesman for Textron Lycoming, a unit of Textron Inc., an aerospace company in Providence, R.I., said the M-1 program represents 60 percent of the unit's business; the rest consisting of government and commercial contracts for jet engines.
The M-1's elimination, he said, would mean the layoff of 1,350 workers at Textron's Stratford plant and 150 more at its Greer, S.C. plant, where some of the parts are made.
Mr. McDaniel also said that Textron Lycoming buys parts, material and equipment from more than 900 vendors in 32 states, so the effect would quickly spread.
The President's budget proposal calls for about a 3 percent increase in defense spending but actually cuts the defense budget 2.6 percent after inflation is factored in. The expected saving from an elimination of the M-1 tank is $1.1 billion.
Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat of Bozrah, has called for a diversification of the Connecticut economy for most of his 10 years in office. The military money spent here has been declining, from $5.54 billion in 1985 to $5.44 billion in 1986 and $5.03 billion in 1987, the last year for which figures are available.
''For years you couldn't get anyone to pay attention to our calls for diversification,'' Mr. Gejdenson said. ''All of a sudden, we're getting so much attention it's frightening.''
There have been exceptions, however. Some companies, like Pratt & Whitney, the jet-engine maker, long ago diversified into nonmilitary products.
Mr. Gejdenson said he will lobby heavily for legislation that would require retraining of workers and retooling of plants when defense cutbacks are announced, rather than when the effects start to be felt.
''If you go to Stratford today, you'll find very low unemployment'' -roughly between 3 and 4 percent, Mr. Gejdenson said. ''It's stupid to wait until it climbs up to 10 or 12 percent before the Government steps in.''
As Connecticut starts to face a loss of military contracts, defense-industry workers are beginning to recognize some unlikely allies - groups that for years have pushed for more spending on domestic programs and less on the military.
Patricia Wass, executive director of one such group, Connecticut Sane Freeze, said her organization has been talking with several labor organizations about converting defense plants to non-military uses.
''Conversion planning should have begun 10 years ago, so it's a little late to start, but better late than never,'' she said. ''Our concern is that the workers not be left out in the cold. We want to make sure the money goes back into programs like housing.''
Ms. Wass said that Sane Freeze, the United Auto Workers and the Machinists Union are organizing a workshop in March that will examine conversion efforts at the local, state and Federal level and that she is seeking as examples businesses that made the switch from a dependency on Pentagon money to the making of peacetime products.
''We haven't come up with a scheme for Electric Boat to make subway cars instead of submarines, but that's not our role,'' Ms. Wass said. ''Our job is to just make sure the planning happens.'' Mr. McDaniel, the Textron Lycoming spokesman, said: ''We recognized three to five years ago that there would be a decrease in military spending, and we began an active program to change our business mix to predominantly commercial. We are talking right now to aircraft manufacturers all over the world about the new generations of regional jets and business aircraft.''
But it will be 1994 or later before the company can reach full-scale production on some of those projects, he said.
''Certainly, we did not forsee even three years ago that they would cease M-1 production,'' Mr. McDaniel said. ''We thought it was going to be scaled back, over a much longer period of time.''
But the cutbacks at the plant could also be an opportunity, Mr. Gejdenson said. He noted that during the last economic upheaval in Connecticut - the withdrawal of the woolen mills - what was left behind were plants so aged as to be useless, equipment that was designed in the 19th century and people whose skills were not adaptable to any modern industries.
''The good news today is that while there's going to be some dislocation, the skills, the facilities and the equipment we will be left with are among the most sophisticated in the world,'' he said.
Mr. Gejdenson said the focus of domestic industry on military goods has contributed to the trade imbalance in this country. While Textron Lycoming built tank engines, he said, engines for trucks and buses were imported from overseas.
''Instead of buying rail cars from a company in Japan,'' he said, ''let's buy them from a Connecticut company.''

HEADLINE: Health Insurers, to Reduce Losses, Blacklist Dozens of Occupations

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In an effort to avoid losses, many insurance carriers have quietly blacklisted dozens of types of small businesses and professions. A wide variety of occupations, from bartender and gas-station attendant to oil driller and dentist, have been declared ineligible for health insurance.
The exclusions are adding heat to the growing debate over how to protect the 31 million uninsured Americans, more than half of whom are working people and their families. At least three Congressional committees and several state commissions are drafting laws that could help make health insurance accessible to those without it. And the insurance industry, hoping to ward off new Government programs and regulations, is scrambling to come up with its own proposals.
 
Situation Is 'Just Awful'
In his State of the Union address last week, President Bush said his White House domestic policy advisers would review ''recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost'' of health care being developed by Government study groups. A number of Democrats in Congress are working on bills that would require all employers to offer health coverage. Some critics of the insurance industry are also calling for national standards of conduct for insurers. 
The situation is ''just awful'' for small businesses that need health insurance, said James Bissonett, an insurance broker in Eden Prairie, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis.
The exclusions can have serious consequences for workers in the affected industries. In a number of states, including New York, they may turn to a Blue Cross or Blue Shield plan for coverage, often at a high monthly cost, but in many states such people go without insurance. And many hospitals, doctors and medical clinics will not treat uninsured patients.
While some health insurers have been accused of denying coverage to people in cities and occupations where the insurers contend the AIDS virus is most prevalent, the exclusions extend well beyond these groups. More than 40 industries are listed as ''ineligible'' in correspondence to insurance brokers from several large insurers. The lists were provided by a New York insurance broker, who asked not to be identified, as examples of the exclusions imposed by many insurance companies.
For instance, a list under the letterhead of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company, based in Hartford, includes service businesses like laundries, service stations, hotels, motels and restaurants; hazardous or seasonal industries like oil drilling and ski resorts, and health-care providers.
At the Hartford Group, a subsidiary of the ITT Corporation, types of businesses listed as ineligible for medical, disability and life insurance included barber shops, bars, beauty salons, car washes, entertainment groups, fishing enterprises, logging or mining operations, Government-financed nonprofit organizations, drilling and exploration operations for oil and natural gas, scrap dealers, taxi drivers and used-car dealers.
For dental coverage, the same company said chiropractors, dentists, education groups and municipal employees were also ineligible.
 
Insurers Cite Reasons
Insurance executives cite a number of reasons for the exclusions, which they say are based on their profit-and-loss experiences with such groups. Insurers say that employees of some businesses that sell alcohol, like restaurants and bars, have higher rates of alcoholism, resulting in expensive health problems. They say businesses like lumberyards, munitions plants and sanitation companies can be unprofitable for insurers because of frequent accidents or illnesses.
Other businesses with high turnover and many part-time employees, like motels, convenience stores and hair salons, are excluded because transient employees may be in poor health to start with and insurers find it difficult to verify their health histories, said Henry Raymond, a director of insurance, managed care and provider relations with the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurer trade group in Washington.
''Some industries that have high turnover and low pay may be perceived as occupations that attract an employee whose truthfulness and veracity may be difficult to verify,'' Mr. Raymond added. He said that in analyzing the health of applicants to decide whether their group should be accepted for insurance and what rates to charge, ''it is very difficult to verify what hospital a transient individual went to, or to get a documented health history.''
Yet another reason for exclusion, insurance executives say, is a high incidence of claims by people in the health-care professions, like doctors, dentists, nurses, chiropractors and other medical workers. ''Because they are highly aware of health-care needs, health providers tend to have a high rate of utilization,'' said Joan Herman, a senior vice president at Phoenix Mutual.
 
Administrative Costs
Finally, some groups are excluded because insurers say they require high administrative expenses. Insurers say they usually take several years to earn back the start-up costs of enrolling new members, so they shun clients like local governments that require annual open bidding and may frequently switch insurers. Similarly, they contend that some small nonprofit organizations may lose their financing and drop their coverage before the insurer can recoup its costs.
But many groups say the exclusions are arbitrary and unfair. ''I would like to see statistical data to show why the arts community is treated like the ammunition industry,'' said Ted Berger, executive director of the New York Foundation for the Arts.
Arts and dance groups and people like florists and interior designers say their groups are often unfairly excluded on the mistaken assumption that their employees are likely to contract the AIDS virus, even though many states prohibit discrimination against people thought to be at increased risk of AIDS.
Mark Scherzer, a Manhattan insurance lawyer, said small businesses with employees who have consulted mental health therapists were also often refused health insurance.
 
Individuals Also Denied Coverage
The exclusions extend beyond certain groups to individuals in small businesses that have not been blacklisted. Many individuals who are ill or have a sick dependent go without health insurance after being rejected - while their fellow workers are accepted - or after being charged steep rate increases. About 2.5 million Americans are considered medically uninsurable, according to Federal estimates.
''Middle-class folks often don't realize how shallow their coverage is and how vulnerable they are,'' said Maryann O'Sullivan, executive director of Health Access, a California consumer coalition based in Los Angeles. The most impoverished Americans are insured by the Medicaid program run by states and the Federal Government.
The exclusion problem ''has gotten worse over the last few years,'' said Lisa M. Carroll, health services director of the Small Business Service Bureau, an association based in Worcester, Mass., that arranges group insurance for 35,000 businesses.
Insurers say the exclusions have resulted from rapidly rising medical costs that increase their risks. ''We're being told the problems are becoming more acute,'' said Mr. Raymond of the Health Insurance Association. ''We hear it from the state insurance commissioners, customers having trouble getting coverage and on Capitol Hill.''
 
Small Groups Suffer Most
Critics of exclusions, including some insurance executives, say blanket denials of coverage are adding heat to a growing debate over improving access to health care for uninsured Americans. The insurance exclusions are felt most by groups of fewer than 50 employees, whose combined premiums frequently do not meet the costs of a single expensive illness. While insurance brokers say they can sometimes negotiate exceptions to the exclusions, small groups often find the price beyond their reach.
The critics say many insurance carriers now concentrate on the customers considered least likely to have high medical costs, avoiding people who would once have been insured as part of a communitywide group.
''The insurance industry is killing itself softly,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health-care expert and professor of political economy at Princeton University. ''I understand their business needs, but I would like them to get out of the game of picking the favorable risks and excluding the rest. They are getting a terrible reputation.''
Ms. Carroll of the Small Business Service Bureau said the restrictions were often unfair. ''Even though they may hire part-timers, the owners and operators and permanent office staff are also being excluded,'' she said. ''And most diseases are not industry-specific.''
 
Some Insurers Are Alarmed
Some insurance executives have also expressed alarm. ''We are clearly concerned about accessibility, both as a company and as an industry,'' said John P. Cole, executive vice president of the Lincoln National Corporation, an insurer based in Fort Wayne, Ind. ''What we have to do as an industry is get back in the insurance business, to look at small businesses and take on more risk than we have in the past.''
Some insurance carriers have tried to avoid exclusions. Indeed, Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations in some states still accept all applicants, although their rates have also risen steeply and often include added charges for people in cities where health care is expensive, as well as for elderly people, who are more likely to submit medical claims.
The Small Business Service Bureau arranges coverage for pooled groups of its members with nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and health maintenance organizations that have fewer barriers to membership.
Insurance groups are also discussing special pools financed by the insurance industry that would accept high-risk people, spreading the costs of their care among all insurers. Small employers would still pay a premium, but would receive tax credits or government assistance.
At least 18 states have pools that receive little or no government help. Bob Griss, a policy analyst in Washington with the World Institute on Disability, an advocacy group for disabled people, said groups using the pools must still pay high premiums.
 
Higher Rates for Everyone
Under the current system, unpaid health costs not covered by insurance are transferred through higher rates to everyone who does have coverage. ''We all end up paying more,'' said Dr. Stephen Crane, a health policy analyst at the Boston University School of Public Health.
Insurers voice frustration about efforts to insure small groups. Joseph Fazzino, a spokesman for the Hartford Group, said the company stopped selling group health insurance last year to most businesses with fewer than 50 employees. He said the exclusion list ''may still apply to groups of 50 to 100 employees.''
''We've found it is very difficult to adequately price small groups,'' he added. As for government-financed nonprofit agencies or municipalities, ''those might be cases where the clients go out for bids on a yearly basis,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Incumbent Easily Wins Second Term as the Mayor of New Orleans

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy won re-election to a second four-year term here on Saturday, making a comeback after polls last fall showed that he had lost the confidence of the voters.
Mr. Barthelemy, 47 years old, beat his main challenger, Donald Mintz, by a comfortable margin. Mr. Mintz, who is white, is a successful lawyer who had never before run for political office.
In the final but unofficial count Mr. Barthelemy received 79,995 votes, 55 percent of the total votes cast in the open primary, and Mr. Mintz, 65,047, or 44 percent. In Louisiana's nonpartisan election system, a candidate who receives more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary wins outright. Both candidates are Democrats. 
Mr. Barthelemy, who is this city's second black Mayor, won re-election with a coalition that included black ministers, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and conservative and moderate whites, giving him 86 percent of the black vote and 25 percent of the white vote. The electorate here is 54 percent black.
 
'A Complete Flip-Flop'
''This was a complete flip-flop'' of the support Mr. Barthelemy received four years ago, said Edward F. Renwick, director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics and Mr. Mintz's pollster. In 1986, when his challenger was a black State Senator, Mr. Barthelemy won 85 percent of the white vote and 30 percent of the black vote.
Among Mr. Barthelemy's supporters was former Mayor Moon Landrieu, who was Housing Secretary for President Jimmy Carter and is now a real estate developer. Some of the city's more conservative white elite also supported Mr. Barthelemy.
''What you have in this election,'' said Arnold Hirsch, a professor of history and urban studies at the University of New Orleans, ''are some of the city's most conservative whites combined with blacks, which means that someone is going to be disappointed in the next four years.''
 
Fears About Crime and Economy
Polls showed Mr. Barthelemy's popularity declined precipitously last fall as voters expressed fears about crime, drugs and the economy. But in January, his popularity rose after the death of this city's first black Mayor, Ernest N. Dutch Morial, a civil rights leader and political enemy of Mr. Barthelemy.
Mr. Morial's friends had been urging him to enter the race but the former Mayor announced he would not be a candidate and died a short time later.
Mr. Morial and Mr. Mintz had been old friends. Though a newcomer to politics, Mr. Mintz has long been prominent in New Orleans business and civic circles.
Both Mr. Mintz and Mr. Barthelemy were perceived by voters as liberal, said Silas Lee, one of the incumbent's pollsters. In virtually a single-issue message, Mr. Mintz tried to convince voters he alone had the drive and competence to revive the battered New Orleans economy, which declined with the collapse of oil prices.
Mr. Barthelemy responded by saying he was ''quietly getting the job done.''

HEADLINE: Costly Pitfalls in Worker Retraining

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT SMITH, Ark.

 BODY:
The best way to deal with workers who lose their jobs when industry shrinks, Washington has thought for years, is to teach them to do something else. But retraining is more talked about than done, and in this blue-collar city on the Arkansas-Oklahoma border, it is off to an uncommonly rocky start.
A critical problem with retraining in Fort Smith, one that is almost uniquely American, is the way employers juggle their labor forces, laying people off when business dips and calling them back when it brightens.
While the juggling has reached an extreme here, it has been going on for decades in some industries, especially in automobile manufacturing and defense contracting. And industrial experts say it could worsen in today's slow economy. 
 
Cutting Costs to Bone
The need for retraining arose because Fort Smith's biggest and highest-paying employer, the Whirlpool Corporation, is cutting costs to the bone. A generation ago, Whirlpool, like other industrial companies from the North, flocked to communities like Fort Smith in pursuit of lower wages and compliant workers.
The company, which makes refrigerators here, is replacing hundreds of its workers with machines, and next month it will move some of its production to Mexico. In September it will also cut wages for the first time.
The highly competitive appliance business is littered with the corpses of other brands, said Lee R. Ross, the division vice president who runs the Whirlpool plant here. Because large numbers of people in their 30's and 40's have already bought and furnished their homes, he said, growth in the industry has stopped, and ''we're slugging it out with the guys who are going to remain.''
There have been some successes in retraining laid-off workers, especially young people who are able to handle major changes in their lives. But for most former workers, retraining is difficult because wages for new jobs can be half and even a third those of the old factory jobs, leaving them little incentive to seek retraining.
Even as it is reducing its work force here over the longer term, Whirlpool is recalling workers.
 
From 5,400 Workers to 1,900
Less than two years ago, the company employed 5,400 people here. But with a series of big cuts, mostly in the last year, it chopped the payroll to 1,900. Management says it does not expect to need 5,400 workers again, but it is calling back 500 on Monday and perhaps 1,500 more through April. It says many of the people will be let go again in September, but it says it cannot be specific.
The juggling is unavoidable, Mr. Ross said. ''Our season is historically very seasonal or cyclical,'' he said. ''In past years we were able to work around it, '' but in a more intensely cost-competitive market that is harder to do.
Whirlpool's struggle for survival is playing havoc with a comprehensive community retraining program set to begin this month for 670 workers from the company and its suppliers.
Martha Anne Pearcy, head of the Western Arkansas Employment Development Agency, which is coordinating the retraining program largely financed by the Federal Government, said she was wary of rankling a company that can dictate Fort Smith's fortunes. But she said, ''It almost seems you're playing with workers' lives.''
As long as workers think there is hope for a recall and a Whirlpool wage, the retraining experts here say, they are unlikely to join the program. Many who might have enrolled will choose to take a Whirlpool paycheck instead, even though they are likely to lose it again.
While retraining, the workers would collect only unemployment benefits and, if they qualify, an extra $50 a week.
 
Other Problems With Recall
The workers' willingness to wait for a recall causes other problems. More than 100 jobs - some in electronics and nursing that pay as much as Whirlpool, most paying less - have already been lined up for trained people from Whirlpool, and these could dry up.
Worse, delay in getting all 670 workers into the program could jeopardize its financing. In December, before Whirlpool disclosed how many people it would call back, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole announced she would provide $2 million for the workers under the Job Training Partnership Act, the six-year-old program that Congress devised to help communities assist dislocated workers.
Fort Smith has 18 months to use the money, and if fewer than 670 people sign up, it would have to return some of the money. The city could ask for an extension so it could pick up workers who will be laid off in the fall, but with scores of other communities competing for the money, the Government could send the funds elsewhere.
One person who could be recalled is 25-year-old Kathy Fox, who started at Whirlpool in October 1986. ''I was laid off in May last year,'' she said. ''Three weeks later I was called back. Then I was laid off in July, and I haven't been called back since.''
Work force juggling like Whirlpool's occurs most often in communities where a single employer dominates the economy and pays the highest wages. A prominent case is Framingham, Mass., a city of 65,000 where a 50-year old General Motors Corporation factory was the biggest employer. Seven years ago the company shut the local plant, then expanded it and recalled the workers the next year, disrupting the retraining programs.
In late 1987, General Motors closed the factory again, idling 3,700 workers; it reopened the plant a second time in early 1988, recalling 2,000 workers. Last summer the plant was closed a third time, because of lackluster sales of the cars made there, the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera.
''You'll get a lot of autoworkers who go on layoff and live in the hope they'll be recalled,'' said Jerome M. Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute in Scarsdale, N.Y., a not-for-profit research organization. ''They'll scrimp and wait two years or more.''
Last year, Whirlpool proposed that workers here take a 58-cent cut in their hourly wage, dropping it for most to $10.19. Over a year, the cut represents a reduction of about $1,000 from wages that typically are $22,000, excluding overtime. The union leadership, which negotiated the contract, urged the members to accept the wage cut.
Workers are also irked by the company's move to Mexico and its latest form of automation. The move involves the company's cheapest and smallest refrigerators, those that are 24- and 28-inches wide. Whirlpool says it simply cannot make them in the United States and meet the competition's price.
Mr. Ross appears to have the upper hand. The union is reluctant to strike because it lacks the money to provide benefits. And because of Arkansas's right-to-work laws, Whirlpool has a nucleus of nonunion workers to keep the factory running in the event of a strike. With a rise in Fort Smith's unemployment rate, to about 8 percent last November from about 5 percent a couple of years ago, Mr. Ross also has a growing pool of people outside the company to draw on.
He said Whirlpool intends to remain in Fort Smith but on terms dictated by the appliance market.
''What we're trying to do is work with the people to get them to understand we have to do things differently so we can be here another 25 years,'' he said. ''We think we can be successful in Fort Smith, Arkansas - at the wage rates we're currently paying. Fifty-eight cents, is that take it or leave it? No. But net, net, bottom line, that's where we've got to be.''

HEADLINE: The Year, Perhaps Hour, of the Child

 BODY:
This year, the President and Congress have an extraordinary opportunity to speak for the poorest and most helpless of all Americans. Those Americans don't have the vote or any economic clout; they don't know how to read and write; and while they may fight among themselves, they can't possibly fight for themselves. They are, of course, children - ''all special'' as President Bush put it in his State of the Union speech, ''because they are the very future of freedom.'' 
Some are what the Governor of Oregon, Neil Goldschmidt, recently described as ''the children in the shadows - the ones ill provided and ill equipped to learn and prosper.'' These kids have had so bad a beginning in life that even by first grade it's clear they're never going to catch up. Unless, that is, they're lucky enough to be enrolled in a Federal program called Head Start.
Head Start's graduates are more likely to be employed, have a high school diploma and go to college than comparable children. They're less likely to be arrested or live on welfare, too.
President Bush knows that: it's why he's seeking a $500 million increase to bring Head Start spending to nearly $2 billion. Such an increase would allow 180,000 more poor children to be added to the 450,000 already served, thus enabling the program to reach about 75 percent of the nation's eligible 4-year-olds.
But why stop at 4-year-olds? The Bush proposal represents the largest single-year increase in Head Start's 25-year history. But it doesn't allow for better salaries for instructors or broader programs; most important, it doesn't allow for Head Start to enter a poor child's life as soon and as often as possible. Ideally, Head Start would be all day, all year and so generously funded it could include all the children eligible.
Mr. Bush also knows that ''a better America'' is one ''where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child care alternatives for parents.'' Congress has a chance to insure that confidence right now, by passing a good child care bill.
Last fall, the Senate approved a $3.5 billion package that would boost the working poor and increase their access to safe, decent child care. The bill would provide expanded tax credits and grants directly to low-income families, and it would help states increase the supply of day care providers and establish standards for them.
The House has a similar though somewhat costlier bill that's been held up by members' stubborn inability to agree on whether funds should go to the states through direct appropriations or through block grants. The battle looks more like turf warfare than honest disagreement. In the meantime, it has, sadly, delayed help for low-income families.
''When it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of dreams, ready to take on the world.'' George Bush said that last week. If the President means what he says, he and the Congressional leadership are going to have to knock some heads together - so that all kids get the same fair chance to take on the world.

Staying a Superpower

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Take a long look ahead. Assume the Soviet military threat continues to recede, as grim necessity imposes a policy of contractionism.
Assume, too, that U.S. military strength can subsequently be reduced to the ability to take on one and a half downsized aggressors, and to defend our skies against incoming terrorist missiles.
Finally, make the equally hopeful assumption that the U.S. wants to continue to advance the cause of human rights and free markets in the world, as well as to defend its interests and nationals abroad. 
How do we square that last hope with the first two assumptions? How do we remain a superpower in a world in which military strength does not define supremacy?
The answer is self-evident: we have to maintain and enhance our national economic power. Although multinational corporations will abound and stock exchanges will interlock, for the next generation, at least, a few political entities called nations will lay the power lines for the world economy.
Some nation is going to be No. 1; better it should be us, with our tradition of raising standards of living and of not starting wars. And since enlightened capitalists do not treat business as a zero-sum game, our ambition for preeminence poses no danger to any other nation; if we win, nobody loses.
Our superpower competition will be reunified Germany (perhaps together with its European satellites) and expanding Japan (perhaps allied with China, if they can bring that off). Their successful systems are based on central-bank-disciplined, government-supported private enterprise.
Grant me, arguendo, that sort of scenario, with the Soviet federation rebuilding and small wars raging here and there, as the world of the millennium.
In that world, the U.S. will from time to time feel duty-bound to use its muscle. I'm not talking about industrial policy or subsidized consortiums or government research to help U.S. business and labor compete with other superpowers' companies on their terms - that's another subject. Today's tract is about being able to apply the power of the U.S. economy to change the policy of other countries.
Suppose our citizens are molested, or our property is illegally expropriated, or a despot sets up a depot for poison-gas sales or a haven for drug criminals; suppose a new Khomeini or Qaddafi or Idi Amin emerges to assault a neighbor or wipe out a minority. ''Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead'' is less of an option, especially when Raisuli has an off-the-shelf missile with a nuclear warhead.
We need a way to turn up the economic heat, when appeals to conscience or international organizations fail, to foment internal discontent - thereby to put a real cost on tyrannical or corrupt behavior.
Sometimes sanctions are effective and sometimes not; this and a little hypocrisy produce great inconsistencies in policy.
To South Africa, when world economic sanctions combine with an ebbing Communist threat and a gutsy leader to produce progress toward ending apartheid, liberals say we should keep the sanctions on, and add fresh sanctions against China to protest their massacres; but to the Soviet Union, where technology-transfer restrictions have added to the pain that has yet to bring fundamental reform, the same voices cry ''take them off.''
This proves that economic sanctions - pressures, harassments, denials of opportunity - are presumed to have an effect, if only psychological. In the future, foreign aid (the carrot) and limited economic war (the stick) will be the primary ways we exercise our power, and will be most effective when other economic superpowers act in concert.
Here we are, then, on the brink of a new era calling for a new way to use American power - and nobody in the White House to my knowledge is coming to grips with it.
We are still organized according to old functions rather than new missions. Shall we apply coordinated economic pressure to achieve a policy aim? The men from Commerce and Agriculture shake their heads no, the man from Defense nods yes, the Trade Negotiator other-hands maybe, and on the State Department's seventh floor, eyes roll heavenward. Congress then mixes in.
Needed is a sub-Cabinet council of economic intervention, at first within the National Security Council, to see what muscle we can marshal and what connective tissue will add to its puissance.
New world a-comin', maybe, but not without crises in need of U.S. action. To meet them, a few sophisticated business minds should be put to work to get us ahead of the power curve.

Albany Deadlock Blocking U.S. Aid To Poor Families

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The Federal Family Support Act, approved by Congress 16 months ago, has yet to support a single member of the family of New York.
Delays in complying with complex and politically sensitive Federal laws are not uncommon. In this case, though, 27 other states - including New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Florida - have enacted legislation that entitles them to additional Federal funds to help wean people from welfare.
California received $50 million in the six months ending Jan. 1. New York could have collected at least $4.5 million so far and, theoretically, as much as 10 times that. 
Albany's languor is particularly galling to Senator Daniel P. Moynihan because he fathered the Family Support Act and New York is his home state.
''We've wasted 16 months,'' Mr. Moynihan complains. ''All the major welfare states have commenced serious programs of welfare reform in the 1980's except New York.''
New York's welfare officials insist that the state's modest demonstration projects were models for the nation. But they concede that New York failed last year to capitalize on the Federal program. The state's failure to comply by this fall could subject the state to Federal sanctions.
The Family Support Act requires single parents on welfare whose children are over age 3 to get regular jobs or, if they are unable to do so, to enroll in Government-financed educational and job-training courses to prepare them for work. As an incentive, welfare recipients who find jobs are eligible for a year of child care and medical benefits.
But how to comply with Federal guidelines for the work program has stymied the Legislature. These questions dominate the debate:
* Should the program pay welfare recipients to attend college? Federal guidelines provide for post-secondary education, but it is arguable whether that should include college or be limited to vocational training. Under one compromise, the program would cover two years of community college and the last two years of a four-year college.
* Should the program be mandatory for all parents with children between 3 and 5 years old? Or should job or training slots be filled first with volunteers? Does it make sense to force some people into the program to the exclusion of others who are more highly motivated? Or, should the goal be to recruit malingerers and others who are reluctant to participate? One compromise would require participation and accept volunteers; slots would be filled first come first served.
* If, in the absence of alternatives, welfare recipients are assigned government jobs, would they displace regular unionized public employees? One compromise would limit such jobs to six months at most.
''There are two diametrically opposed philosphical views'' between the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-dominated Assembly, says Cesar A. Perales, the State Social Services Commissioner. ''We're struggling to find a consensus.''
The state estimates that 84,000 welfare recipients with children age 6 and older are employable. About 30,000 of those, according to the estimates, have enrolled in some employment or training program. The Federal law, by including single parents of younger children, would expand the pool by about 60,000, about 45,000 of whom are deemed employable.
Tomorrow, Mr. Perales will ask the Legislature's fiscal committees to raise the state's share of the employment and training budget to $54 million, a $23 million increase, to provide for 20,000 additional training slots. (Under the Family Support Act, the Federal Government would pay 60 percent; the state and localities would split the rest evenly). Mr. Perales acknowledges, though, that waiting lists for child care mean fewer single parents will be able to graduate from welfare to work.
Too often in the welfare bureaucracy, results seem as illusory as goals seem elusive.
The number of welfare cases in New York State has declined slightly, from 361,000 in 1979 to 337,000 last year, in part because families are smaller. But since 1969, inflation has eroded benefits to children by one-third. Fewer children previously known to New York City's child welfare system apparently died of abuse or neglect last year than in 1988. But those 45 children still accounted for 4 in 10 of all suspected deaths from abuse or neglect.
The Family Support Act, Mr. Perales says, may not revolutionize welfare, but it may eventually re-define the system from one that seems to perpetuate dependency. Unless the Governor and Legislature do their jobs over the next few months, though, fewer welfare recipients may get to work.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Children Doing Adults' Work

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FREITAG

 BODY:
With its harsh fluorescent lights and faint odor of caustic chemicals, the cramped belt factory on West 38th Street is an unlikely place to find an 11-year-old girl on a Friday morning. But there among the rows of industrial sewing machines and heaps of remnants, Maria Mendez is hard at work.
Wielding a large pair of scissors, Maria trims excess threads from finished belts. She concentrates so intently that neither she nor her mother sees the investigators from the New York State Department of Labor enter the factory. 
Her mother, who is also named Maria Mendez, tells an investigator that her daughter's teacher was out sick and classes were canceled. Rather than leave her child at home alone, Mrs. Mendez says, she brought her to work.
The factory owner, Gabriel Basques, says the girl is not working but is there visiting her mother.
Nonetheless, the investigator, Angelo Valdevitt, cites Mr. Basques for violating child labor laws. If he is found guilty, he can be fined up to $500.
 
A Too-Familiar Scene
''She said she was just playing with the scissors, but obviously she was cutting threads,'' Mr. Valdevitt said.
The scene is all too familiar to Joseph Halik, a supervising investigator with the Apparel Industry Task Force, which inspects garment factories for violations of wage and hour and child labor laws. Almost every day, he said, investigators find children who claim their classes were canceled operating sewing machines or putting finished garments into bags.
''I can't tell you how many times we've heard that story,'' Mr. Halik said. ''There must be a lot of sick teachers in this city.'' He said he has never heard of a school canceling a class instead of calling in a subsitute teacher.
More than 50 years after the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act banned children younger than 16 from working in factories, child labor is widespread in New York City. From the bustling lofts of the garment district and Chinatown to the basement sweatshops outside Manhattan and in the suburbs, at least 7,500 children work illegally in the garment industry every day, state officials say.
These children are missing school and are subjected to health hazards including exposure to toxic substances and injuries from machines they are too young to operate safely.
The extent of the problem is unknown, but studies by Federal and state agencies indicate that child labor violations are rising in many industries, both in New York City and in other parts of the country.
Experts attribute the increase in child labor violations to a shrinking labor pool caused by low unemployment and the end of the baby boom, as well as to intensified competition from foreign companies.
 
Seeking Tougher Penalties
Federal labor laws prohibit most paid work for children younger than 14 and set strict limits on how much children younger than 16 can work after school and on weekends. But Federal and state officials say a growing number of employers are flouting the laws.
In response, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last year introduced legislation that would tighten the state's child labor laws by, among other things, making the penalties against employers more severe.
In support of that legislation, the State Labor Commissioner, Thomas F. Hartnett, testified in Albany last week that the number of children found illegally employed in New York more than doubled from 1984 to 1989. But that may merely reflect stepped-up enforcement.
As in other states, violators included supermarket chains and fast-food restaurants that ignored regulations regarding what times of day and the maximum number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds are permitted to work. But many of the most flagrant violations in New York were by some of the 7,000 garment factories in the metropolitan area.
 
Hampered by Low Fines
Since it was formed in October 1987, the state's 34-member Apparel Industry Task Force has found 370 children working illegally in about 250 sweatshops.
''The violation rate was so terrific when we started out that we had to make child labor a programmatic priority,'' said Hugh McDaid, the director of the task force. About 15 percent of the group's inspections yield at least one violation of child labor laws, Mr. McDaid said.
The task force is empowered to make random inspections like the one last week at Gabriel Belts on West 38th Street. But the group is hampered by the amount of fines it is allowed to levy and by the vastness of the problem, Mr. McDaid said.
''This agency cannot stamp out child labor,'' he said. ''The only thing we can do is educate them about why this is a bad thing.''
 
'This Is a Trap for Them'
In some family-oriented communities, particularly Chinatown, children work only after school or during school vacations to supplement the family income, Mr. McDaid said. ''Their problem is that they're falling asleep in class,'' he said.
But in many other places, particularly neighborhoods of recent immigrants from Latin America, children do not attend school at all, he said. Instead, they work long hours for wages that rarely reach the legal minimum.
''This is a trap for them,'' Mr. McDaid said. ''They sacrifice their education and literally commit themselves to a life of working in a sweatshop. They have no future.''
For more than a year, Dr. Susan H. Pollack and Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan have been studying the medical impact of child labor. Although they expect to spend at least another year on the study, their preliminary findings indicate that hundreds - possibly thousands - of working children in the city are injured each year.
''We know that in New York State there are over 1,000 kids getting workers' compensation for injuries each year, and that's just the tip of the iceberg,'' Dr. Pollack said. ''My guess is that many more children are getting hurt and no one is reporting it.''
Dr. Pollack, who has accompanied members of the Apparel Industry Task Force on several inspections, said she noticed many potential hazards, including machinery like hydraulic hole punches and steam presses. But the greatest hazard, she said, is that the children simply lack the experience to avoid dangerous situations.
''What really struck me,'' Dr. Pollack said, ''was how many 14-year-olds were out there and how little they knew about their rights as workers.''

HEADLINE: Tourist Love For New York Grows Chilly

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
The number of people visiting New York City for business or pleasure declined slightly last year, but what really worries many in the local tourism industry is the prospect that the 1989 statistics may be the first sign of a long slide.
Travel experts see a number of negative patterns at work. One is that tourists from the United States and abroad, having already visited New York, are increasingly choosing to sample less familiar parts of the country. Second, in a sluggish economy, companies are turning away from the exorbitant hotel prices of New York for business meetings.
At the same time, the budget of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau has been cut by nearly one-third because the city, struggling to balance its budget, stopped appropriating money to it. The bureau, which promotes the city, books conventions and assists visitors, says that other cities are aggressively competing for the travel dollar. 
 
'The Sky Is Not Falling'
Not all observers agree that the downturn will be steep.
''There are signs that suggest an erosion of a pattern of growth,'' said Bern Rotman, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Economic Development, ''but the sky is not falling down.''
At the 770-room Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza at 49th Street and Broadway, which opened in December, the managing director, Michael Silberstein, said: ''I believe there's no reason to panic or to start slashing rates. It'll take about a year to get out of this sluggish economy, at which point we'll all go back to the happy old days.''
But many experts are not as optimistic. ''I think it's going to be slow coming back,'' said Stephen W. Brener, a New York City consultant to the hotel industry.
For the first 11 months of 1989, the latest figures available, the number of people flying into the three major airports that serve New York City was about 35 million, a figure 5.2 percent below the comparable period in 1988, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
International arrivals rose 1.6 percent, but domestic arrivals at La Guardia Airport, Kennedy International Airport and Newark International Airport dropped 7.9 percent, Port Authority figures showed.
 
Hotel Occupancy Is Down
The hotel occupancy rate fell, too, to 75.62 percent, from 79.21 percent in the first 11 months of 1988, according to Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting and consulting firm that specializes in the hotel and restaurant industry. And the average number of hotel room nights sold through November fell slightly in New York City while rising in cities like Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla., according to a survey by Smith Travel Research, a lodging industry research organization in Hendersonville, Tenn.
While more tourists from overseas did come to New York last year, the city's share of all foreign travelers who arrive in the United States is shrinking, partly because airlines in recent years have begun to schedule international flights in many more American cities.
''Ten years ago an international visitor had few options for arriving in the United States,'' said Marshall E. Murdaugh, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''Today you have major gateways in Miami, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Denver and Dallas.''
And foreign visitors are not just arriving in other cities, but are also staying there to explore them or are venturing into the countryside.
''Foreign travelers are looking to see all of America,'' said Ron Erdman, a market research analyst with the Travel and Tourism Administration, an arm of the United States Department of Commerce. ''They have been to New York. In New York, you have to give them another reason to come back.''
 
Shorter, Family-Oriented Trips
Domestic travel patterns are changing, too, said Linda Scott, director of retail travel for American Express Travel Services. Americans, in many cases working couples looking for relief from job-related stress or wanting to spend more time with their children, are looking for ''weekend getaways'' or shorter, family-oriented vacations. Often they prefer packages that offer the most value for their money and new destinations.
''There's a 'discover U.S.' trend,'' she said.
Higher airline fares and hotel rates last year discouraged corporate trips to New York, tourism experts said. Air fares in general increased as much as 15 percent during 1989, according to the Air Transport Association. New York City hotel rates, the highest in the country, rose 9.2 percent during the first half of 1989, compared with a national average increase of 3.2 percent, according to a survey by Pannell Kerr Forster.
The average daily hotel rate in New York in the first six months of 1989 was $127.83, compared with $52.10 in Houston, $74.40 in Los Angeles and $88.99 in Chicago, the survey found.
 
Choosing Houston Instead
Audrey Lord-Hausman, of Meeting Planners International in the West Coast, an association of corporate travel managers and tourist industry representatives, said travel costs have risen too high for some companies.
''I think we're going to see in the 90's smaller meetings that are closer to home,'' she said.
There was a time, for example, when managers of Fireman's Fund in Novato, Calif., came to New York City for business meetings and a whirl of sightseeing. Now they are more likely to pack for a company trip to Houston or St. Louis.
''You could easily argue that New York is a better destination because there's a lot to do,'' said David Kliman, Fireman's Fund director of travel and corporate events. ''It's the center of the world and all that. But what companies are looking at is, 'What does it cost?'
''We have paid up to $285 per room and that's just very difficult for my company to justify.''
 
From Tourism, 143,600 Jobs
With the outlook for tourism so unclear, the Convention and Visitors Bureau argues, now is not the time to cut back on promoting New York City by reducing the bureau's financing.
''This business has become extremely competitive,'' Mr. Murdaugh, the bureau president, said. ''Two-thirds of the people don't have to come to New York. They have to be motivated to come to New York.''
Bureau officials are trying to convince the new city administration that the cutbacks would have costly long-term effects. Tourism accounted for 143,600 jobs, $9.7 billion in revenue and $542 million in local taxes in 1988, when the city was visited by 19.8 million people, bureau figures show.
Bureau officials said they are looking into possible new sources of public financing, like a hotel room surcharge.
City financing of the bureau dropped from $1.5 million in 1988 to $1.25 million in 1989. There was no 1990 allocation. The bureau's current budget of $3.6 million comes from contributions from its 1,400 members, including hotels and restaurants.
 
Information Center Closed
Visitors' bureau officials say that budget cuts have forced them to stop worldwide advertising of the city. They said that with fewer staff members, fewer conventions will be booked, jeopardizing the visits of hundreds of thousands of delegates this year.
The bureau has also been forced to shut down its information center in Times Square and to close the one at Columbus Circle on weekends, the officials said. An estimated 149,000 visitors who would have received assistance through the centers now cannot, they said.
In addition, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget calls for a $2 million cut in the state's ''I Love New York'' tourist promotion program.
Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, deputy mayor for finance and economic development, said any loss of tourism revenue is a concern but fiscal constraints will determine whether the city can reinstate money for the visitors bureau.
''They're very high on our list of priorities,'' she said.

HEADLINE: With Kemp at Helm, H.U.D. Gains New Spirit, but Some Doubts Linger

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Jack Kemp was impatient. It was 6 P.M. one day last spring, and he wanted to mail a letter directing 3,300 public housing authorities to evict drug dealers. Unfortunately, the agency lawyer who was drafting the document had left for the day.
Mr. Kemp, unfazed, found the letter on the lawyer's computer disk, polished it and had it mailed. The next morning, the lawyer discovered his disk missing and the letter sent.
With Mr. Kemp at the helm, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has awakened. Unlike his remote predecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., Mr. Kemp has wandered the halls, popped into offices, solicited ideas from staff members. 
Housing and urban experts agree that an infusion of spirit and purpose into the troubled agency has been the greatest achievement of Mr. Kemp's first year as Secretary. But a year after the former Congressman from Buffalo was sworn in, some are still uncertain about his success in putting housing back on the national agenda or in returning himself, as some suspect he hopes, to the political arena. Rhetoric Into Action? ''The question is whether he can translate rhetoric into action,'' said Ira Gribbin, a former president of the National Association of Realtors. ''That will be the test in 1990.''
Mr. Kemp admits that his enthusiasm sometimes exceeds his knowledge of the agency's programs. When he announced last month that he was ending a mortgage insurance program that had cost the Government $1 billion, he admitted he was not conversant with all the details. ''Did they want a mortgage banker or a quarterback?'' asked the former Buffalo Bill.
On the plus side, Mr. Kemp used his Congressional experience to help win enactment last November of a modest legislative package to correct the ravages of the Pierce era. The measure is intended to help avert the pattern of political influence that often determined grant decisions in Ronald Reagan's Administration and enriched developers and consultants with high-level Republican connections.
The new law limits the agency's discretion by creating firm criteria for housing grants, threatens violators with civil penalties of up to $1 million a year.
In addition to Mr. Kemp's efforts, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced last week that he was seeking the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate Mr. Pierce and other former senior H.U.D. officials for conspiracy to defraid the Government in awarding grants to prominent Republicans and close friends, regardless of merit.
Housing experts credit Mr. Kemp for persuading President Bush to support legislation to create a three-year, $5.5 billion program intended to help low-income families become homeowners. The agency is now drafting the legislation.
At Mr. Kemp's behest, the budget for the fiscal year 1991 that President Bush delivered to Congress last week calls for a $1.4 billion increase in housing assistance, to $15 billion. The President's budget also calls for a $300 million increase in money for the homeless.
 
Some Housing Cuts Are Sought
But critics note that the budget seeks a reduction in money for modernization of public housing and low-income home energy assistance. Money for community services block grants would be cut to $42 million from $389 million under the Bush proposal. The President also wants to repeal Urban Development Action Grants, which helped build up the downtown areas in Baltimore, Buffalo and other cities. Mr. Kemp agreed to these reductions to obtain money for Project Hope, the plan for low-income homeowners.
''For every good initiative, they've taken money away from equally good programs,'' said Mark L. Wolfe, director of Federal Funds Information for States, a joint project of the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Legislatures. ''Mr. Kemp has no money. It's a matter of simply pushing things around.''
Although he is no longer a quarterback, Mr. Kemp is still scrambling as he seeks ways to operate the department more efficiently. ''My biggest surprise was the depth of the problem,'' Mr. Kemp said in an interview in his office, beneath portraits of Churchill, Lincoln, Jefferson and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ''I don't mean the depth of the scandal, but the depth of mismanagement. There were systemic problems.''
He added, ''The agency had been drifting for decades.''
Mr. Kemp has taken a few steps to end that drift. Last month he announced his intention to appoint financial officers to oversee major departments. ''At F.H.A., with a $300 to $400 billion portfolio and inventory, there is only one actuary,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''People don't know where the money is going.''
 
He Remains an Anomaly
To some degree, Mr. Kemp remains an anomaly, a conservative Republican who talks urgently about housing for the homeless and empowering the poor. Calling himself ''a bleeding-heart conservative,'' Mr. Kemp has insisted that at least 75 percent of the agency's money be spent on the poor.
''I'm dealing with the issues that are the least obvious to most in my own party, yet are the most intractable problems facing our country as it tries to tell the rest of the world that democracy will work for them,'' he said.
Although Mr. Kemp gets high grades for working Capitol Hill, he is faulted for dealing directly with tenant groups rather than local elected officials. This tendency has caused concern among mayors and even some Congressmen fearful of being bypassed in the allocation of money to their constituents.
''They want to shift to less government control over the programs, when those programs haven't had enough control,'' Mayor Greg B. Sparrow of DeKalb, Ill., a Democrat, said of Mr. Kemp's desire to end run city officials. ''Besides, who's going to provide all the support services, if not the cities?''
On balance, it seems Mr. Kemp spent much of his first year with his finger in the dike, trying to stem the fallout from the disclosures of fraud, waste and influence peddling in the Pierce years that rocked the agency. The budget process that just started in Congress will provide a test of his resolve and effectiveness.
 
What He Wants Financed
After persuading President Bush to endorse the Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere program, Project Hope, Mr. Kemp needs to make sure that Congress finances the package, which would cost $1.2 billion in fiscal 1991. It includes $250 million in grants to help low-income families and tenants become homeowners, and would require the states to put up an additional $1 for every $2 in Federal money. The program also calls for $251 million for housing vouchers; $412 million to help resident groups become home buyers, and a $246 million program to help the homeless by providing medical care, education and job training as well as beds.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kemp enjoys some credit for good intentions. ''One encouraging sign,'' said Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, who headed a study on hunger and homelessness for the United States Conference of Mayors, ''is that Kemp wants to put the Federal Government and the Federal tax code back into the business of producing affordable housing.''
The Secretary's good reviews are attributable in part to advisers who fall into three competing groups: conservatives, managers and Kemp political protegees.
The conservatives are led by Alfred A. DelliBovi, Mr. Kemp's Under Secretary, who strongly suggests dealing directly with antipoverty groups rather than with mayors and what he calls ''poverticians'' who make money and careers out of poverty issues.
C. Austin Fitts, the head of the Federal Housing Administration, leads the managers who coach Mr. Kemp on what procedures need to be changed to improve efficiency.
 
Eye on Political Horizon
The Kemp political faction remains concerned about his image and his future. They are led by Mary Brunette, Assistant to the Secretary for Policy and Communication who served in Mr. Kemp's Congressional office.
Many credit the department's legal counsel, Francis A. Keating, a career prosecutor who first detected the brewing scandals, with protecting Mr. Kemp by making sure he was perceived by the public as a vigorous reformer.
At times, the Kemp team is strained by conflicts between what is good for H.U.D. and what is good for Jack F. Kemp. ''Jack believes that if he does a good job in this situation, the future will take care of itself,'' said Mr. DelliBovi. ''But some are concerned about his image. There are things they don't like the policy implications of, and they say that on top of that, it would hurt his image.''
Although Mr. Kemp dismisses any discussion of future campaigns, some of his remarks have fueled speculation that he plans to return to the political arena. Last month he criticized President Bush for sending his Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, to China after the uprising at Tienanmen Square.
But, as Mr. DelliBovi suggests, the final political reckoning may depend on Mr. Kemp's ability to breath life into the Administration's housing policy.
Critics note, for example, that despite the loss of an estimated one and a half million low-income housing units, Mr. Kemp has not proposed building any new housing.
 
Out of Construction Business
''We're not going to go back into the construction business,'' Mr. Kemp responded. ''The stock of housing in America is vast. I'm not saying it's good. A lot of it is in disrepair.''
Therefore, Mr. Kemp said, he is gambling that he can make his mark by concentrating on the renovation of existing housing stock. He also want to provide vouchers that pay the rent of those who cannot otherwise afford decent housing. The voucher program is already in existence, but Mr. Kemp is seeking additional funds. Mr. Kemp acknowledges that critics will charge that these approaches curtail construction of new federally funded housing, an economic boon to many cities. The big complaints, he said, come from developers who profited from H.U.D. programs started in Democratic administrations.
''It's really ironic,'' he said, ''that Jack Kemp, who was criticized as a trickle-down economist, is now in the position of fighting the trickle down theory of the left: subsidize the big, wealthy developers and hope that the benefits accrue to the poor.''
Mr. Kemp's remarks underscore the hard politics of H.U.D. financing: housing contractors are among the major contributors to mayoral campaigns. Democrats who control many city halls have long looked to the housing department to keep those contractors happy. In circumventing city hall by providing Federal funds directly to local groups, critics charge, Mr. Kemp's strategy is an attempt to bolster the status of Republicans in Democratic-controlled cities.
It is a reasonable suspicion to have about a man who, as a Congressman, talked about creating ''blue-collar Republicans.'' Even when Mr. Kemp insists his interest these days is housing policy, it is still possible to imagine he has an eye on the political bottom line.
''If we're going to subsidize anybody, we should subsidize the poor, the family, the renter, the person in public housing,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''Our money should get people into housing, and not go to a developer who gets a multimillion-dollar profit.''

HEADLINE: After the Boom, Tough Times for Dance

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Dance Theater of Harlem arrived in San Diego in mid-January to find itself suddenly without work because the local sponsors had run out of money. Last week, the company announced that a five-month layoff would follow its March engagement at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. ''I don't feel in my heart it's the end of D.T.H.,'' said Arthur Mitchell, the company's artistic director. ''There must be someone out there who will help us.''
Times have been hard lately for American dance. The Dallas Ballet folded last year. The companies of Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis merged, in part to save money. In December, the financially pressed Martha Graham troupe laid off its dancers for January and February. That same month, Karole Armitage said she was disbanding the Armitage Ballet. In 1988 Twyla Tharp, citing the burden of financial concerns, gave up her company to work with American Ballet Theater.
Other cutbacks have been made; the reasons have been complex and specific to each organization. What is certain is that dance, traditionally a struggling art form in the United States, underwent significant changes in the last decade and is now facing new kinds of problems. 
 
Growth, Then Competition
Dance in America experienced a period of explosive growth from the mid-1960's through the 1970's. Federal and private financing agencies increasingly began to recognize and support this youngest of American art forms, and the arrival of international stars like Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov brought new visibility and glamour to the dance scene. By the end of the 70's, there were new companies and new audiences throughout the country for ballet and modern dance.
But dance lost some of its major figures in the 1980's, among them George Balanchine, Antony Tudor, Robert Joffrey and Alvin Ailey. Government support waned as the number of companies continued to grow, intensifying competition for financing from the private sector. And while company directors today talk of the greater sophistication of dancegoers, audiences have not grown as much or remained as loyal as expected, although the youthfulness of much of the dance audience is seen as a positive sign.
''The years of extremely rapid growth for those professional companies that are more than 15 years old are over,'' said Stephen Richard, managing director of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater and one of 25 dance administrators, presenters and artists interviewed recently on the economic state of American dance today. ''But growth is not over. Artistic maturation is not slowing down. You simply don't have the exponential growth that you did in the start-up years.''
 
Tour Dates at a Premium
The concern most frequently cited by dance professionals was the shrinking of touring opportunities. Engagements produced by local or regional presenters have traditionally helped dance companies, particularly modern-dance companies, to finance home rehearsal periods and seasons. But such opportunities began to dwindle with the demise in 1983 of the Dance Touring Program of the National Endowment for the Arts, a program that provided a subsidy structure that helped reduce the risk of presenting often little-known dance companies.
''The system is so big that Government has to be the largest investor,'' said Donald A. Moore, executive director of Dance U.S.A., a national service organization for professional dance. Not many corporations and foundations want to subsidize touring, Mr. Moore said. Support for touring, as for operating budgets, seems far less glamorous than the commissioning of new work. ''And you can't create audiences if you can't get the company there,'' he added.
In the 1980's, many more companies were vying for the available touring dates. There were 37 ballet, modern and ethnic dance companies in the United States in 1965, write William Baumol and William Bowen in their book ''Performing Arts - The Economic Dilemma.'' Twenty years later, 250 were listed in Dance Magazine's Performing Arts Directory. ''Ten years ago, we had presenters call us,'' said Darlene Neel, general manager of the Lewitzky Dance Company of Los Angeles. ''Now you have to make 10 calls to get the work. We used to come home with a little money for rehearsal. Now we break even, if we've done our homework.''
 
Budgets Up, Income Down
With costs rising, outstripping income, sheer economic survival was another concern expressed almost universally. Company budgets have at least doubled or tripled over the last 10 years, with the ratio of earned to contributed income tending to decline by small percentages. At the same time, arts endowment funds to dance have remained flat - dwindling, in terms of real or inflation-adjusted dollars - as have other Government and private aid in general.
Rising costs have resulted in rising ticket prices. In a 1985 survey by the arts endowment, almost one in three adults cited cost as a barrier to ballet attendance. The hiring of administrators who can woo that selective audience is now an increasingly popular strategy in a domain once ruled exclusively by artistic directors and choreographers.
There are new areas of concern, too, for administrators. ''Most dance companies used to be interested only in selling tickets, not institutions,'' said David Resnicow, president of the Arts and Communication Counselors, a division of the public relations concern Ruder Finn & Rotman that arranges sponsorships for corporations and cultural institutions. As institutions, Mr. Resnicow added, dance companies must band together to lobby the Federal Government and the public effectively.
 
Tax Breaks Gone
''What little stability there was, was governmental, because it was fairly dependable,'' Ms. Lewitzky said. ''The states vary. But the Government not only said it would cut everything across the board; they then took away the tax break that was an incentive for foundations and corporations to donate.'' Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, tax deductions for charitable contributions were eliminated for taxpayers taking standard deductions, and tax rates were reduced, making charitable deductions less attractive, particularly to wealthy donors. In addition, the law greatly reduced tax benefits for gifts of appreciated stock, real estate and artworks.
Many of those interviewed expressed dismay at having to compete with social programs for money. ''It's hard to give money for a production of 'The Sleeping Beauty' when you go down the sidewalks to the Opera House and see all these homeless people,'' said W. McNeil Lowry, chairman of the board of the San Francisco Ballet.
Audiences were also a subject of concern. Patterns of dancegoing have changed. In the 1960's, there existed a small, dedicated core of dancegoers interested - as Sali Ann Kriegsman, director of the dance program of the National Endowment for the Arts, put it - in ''observing the arc of development, going back to 'Swan Lake' a hundred times.'' Now the audience has more choices and is more selective about dance, she said.
 
An Era of Marketing
In an effort to reach that new audience, dance companies in the 1980's experimented with sophisticated marketing techniques and discovered what the London Arts Council has called the ''snacking effect'': audiences' sampling dance attractions without developing any longer-term loyalty.
''I feel the new techniques had a short-term gain but a long-term loss,'' said Marda Kirn, director and producer of the Colorado Dance Festival in Boulder. ''They used Madison Avenue killer hype, but how many times can you use an exclamation to describe a dance company? I think we're seeing audiences disenchanted because there wasn't any substance to that marketing.
''Dance is going out of the chute with a big disadvantage,'' Ms. Kirn continued. ''Music has radio, audio, CD's, recordings. The visual arts have design and graphics and photographs of work so you can see it all the time. Plays are in books or on film. Those art forms are much more present. You can't turn on dance on your car radio. You've always had to make some effort to go to a dance performance. I think education is really important.''
 
Dance Goes Nationwide
On the positive side, dance has become increasingly decentralized, in part because of the innovative National Performance Network. Devised in 1983 by David White, director of the Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan, the program works with promoters to produce and commission dance attractions, half of them from New York and half from other areas, at alternative theaters in 21 cities outside New York.
Big American cities have experienced real-estate booms that make it harder to find space - so necessary for dance - in which companies can work. But there is also increased local support for home companies and it is now possible to have a successful dance career outside New York City.
Dancers have been the poorest paid performers in the arts, a fact borne out by the 1980 census, which found dancers' salaries to be 45 percent below the average for all artists. But the standard of living has risen somewhat for dancers performing in major modern-dance and ballet companies, which are increasingly unionized, around the nation.
Dancers also are at a higher level of technical virtuosity than ever before. ''We have the largest, best trained core of young people trained in dance that any country has ever had,'' said Mr. Lowry, who developed the Ford Foundation's groundbreaking 1963 grants program for dance schools and companies.
 
New Means of Support
There are new advocacy and support systems as well. A coalition of dance companies, presenters, state and regional arts agencies and national service organizations helped the arts endowment put together its promising new Dance on Tour program, to take effect in the 1991-92 season. Grants from the program's $1.1 million budget, which must be matched by recipients, will be awarded to regional arts agencies and state arts organizations. The agencies will convene panels to review applications for money from presenters, whose newly important curatorial role may be one of the major developments of dance in the 1990's. The state organizations will apply directly to the National Endowment for the Arts for projects that support the presentation of dance.
And the 1990's? Mr. Lowry worries about finding jobs for the newest generation of dancers, and about a general loss or leveling of standards that has resulted, he said, in the belief that ''everything is as good as everything else.'' Ms. Kirn urges that dance ''look video straight in the eye'' and learn to use it to educate, document and compete as entertainment in the increasingly important electronic media.
''I guess the issues for dance companies are not so different than they used to be: time, money and place,'' Mrs. Kriegsman said. ''I think the transmission of dance - the question of continuity and succession - by the masters, the teachers, is going to be a key one.''
Mark Russell, director of Performance Space 122 in Manhattan, said he thinks dance is stronger now than it was during the boom years. ''We've gone from birthing to a sort of adolescence,'' he said. ''I think we're trying to clean up our acne now.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Higher Rates Are Expected At Bond Auction This Week

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Even with the sharp increase in interest rates since late December, some credit market analysts say bond yields may need to move higher still in order to attract buyers at the quarterly Treasury auctions that will be held this week.
The sales begin tomorrow, when the Treasury will auction $10 billion of three-year notes. The following day, $10 billion of 10-year notes will be sold. The auctions conclude on Thursday with the sale of $10 billion of 30-year bonds. 
Given the recent rise in yields, analysts said they were not particularly concerned about the first two legs of the auction, but the 30-year bond could be another matter.
 
Higher Yields Seen
''With a yield of around 8.40 percent, there will be strong demand for the three-year notes,'' said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''That should set the table for some pretty decent results for the 10-year. But yields on the 10-year and the 30-year may have to widen some to get the bonds sold.''
Late Friday, the 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.45 percent, while the 30-year bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.46 percent.
Gauging foreign demand is difficult. At the last refunding auctions in November, the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes had a 2.50 percentage point advantage over the comparable Japanese bond. As of late last week, that spread, or differential, stood at about 2 percentage points. And the recent rise in West German interest rates has virtually erased what has historically been a sizable differential between American and West German yields.
''Will the Japanese invest at a lesser rate than they did in 1989?'' asked Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. ''I think the answer is 'probably,' but on the margin. Where, in the past, they might have purchased on average 30 percent to 40 percent at the refunding, now they may do 25 percent to 30 percent. Even though rates are high enough to attract domestic investors to substitute, I would expect further modest increases in yields as we move through the auction period.''
 
No Signs From the Fed
The prospect that the Federal Reserve Board will not soon provide any assistance in the form of an easier monetary policy may provide additional incentive to push yields higher.
''In his Congressional testimony last week, Alan Greenspan effectively told the market not to bid at the refunding with the expectation that the Fed is about to ease policy,'' said Mr. Santow, of Griggs & Santow.
Analysts said any chance that the Fed might have been pursuaded to allow interest rates to ease a bit further at some point later this month was virtually eliminated with the release of January's employment report, which indicated that the economy is still firm.
But while the reported 275,000 increase in workers on nonfarm payrolls was unexpectedly large, many analysts said that because of seasonal factors, the rise was overstated and they saw underlying signs of weakness.
''The gains we saw in retail trade and construction employment happen every January and always get revised downward,'' said Joseph Carson, a senior economist at Chemical Bank. ''I think these numbers were very soft.''
David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm, said: ''We do expect these numbers to be revised down, but there is not much sign of recession in these employment numbers. If I were at the Fed, I would be sitting on my hands.''
 
Open Market Panel to Meet
Members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee will gather in Washington tomorrow to consider their options. Market participants will await the signals from this meeting as well as the release on Friday of producer price figures for January.
Much of the suspense surrounding these figures has already been removed: Because of sharp increases in food and energy prices, virtually all economists expect the overall figure to show a steep increase.
Led by the weather-induced run-up in food and energy prices, the increase in producer prices is likely to be the biggest monthly gain in nine years, said Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.
Salomon expects the overall index to show an increase of 1.2 percent; other economists are forecasting an even bigger rise.
The report is likely to contain some good news, however. The so-called core inflation rate - the rate that excludes the volatile food and energy sectors - will show only a modest rise for January, analysts said.
In contast to the huge increase in the overall index, the core rate probably rose only two-tenths to three-tenths of 1 percent last month, analysts expect. That would be about half the gain recorded in December.

HEADLINE: Old Problems Seen Giving Banks Difficulty

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Although bank profits are expected to improve in 1990 from the depressed level of last year, bankers and analysts see little chance that they will rebound to the record level of 1988.
The banking industry began the year with familiar concerns: that problems with bad real estate loans will continue and that a weak economy will cause more loans to go sour while limiting new lending to businesses and to consumers.
Because losses on large banks' loans to developing countries will be far less than in 1987 and 1989, the industry as a whole is expected to earn more this year than last. But even among the regional banks, whose consumer banking businesses continue to generate steady profits, analysts wonder whether earnings will rebound to equal the $25.1 billion in profits in 1988.
Investors are discouraged enough about the industry's prospects that prices of most banks' shares have fallen by 30 percent or more since October. 
''There is a long worry list, and without a doubt the pressure is on banks in 1990,'' said James J. McDermott, an executive vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm that specializes in banks.
Thomas Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., said this year would be difficult ''because growth in loan volume is definitely going to slow, and further deterioration in the quality of bank loans is likely to require increases in loan-loss provisions.'' Provisions, money set aside to cover losses on loans, are subtracted from bank profits, and the reserves are expenses that can change rapidly, with little warning to investors.
Large and small banks are seeking ways to improve earnings without benefiting from high-profit loans to real estate developers. Because of losses on existing loans and of a glut of new buildings in many parts of the country, particularly in New England, New Jersey and Arizona, banks are wary about financing new projects.
''Some of banks' greatest profits in the 1980's came from lending for construction and real estate development,'' said William L. Bitner 3d, the president of Evergreen Bancorp of Glens Falls, N.Y. ''If that business is not there, it will have a dramatic impact on bank profits.''
 
Big Banks and Takeover Fees
Large banks face the additional challenge of replacing the fees earned from financing corporate takeovers and companies with heavy debt, when the number of such takeovers is dwindling. Ronald Mandle, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, has estimated that the slowdown could reduce bankers' fees by 10 percent to 15 percent. Warnings by regulators about takeover financing and about the increased risk of loss as the economy slows has made bankers more cautious about issuing new loans for such endeavors.
Losses on loans to highly indebted companies would be greatest in a recession. But the bankruptcy filing last month by two units of the Campeau Corporation, the Allied Stores Corporation and Federated Department Stores Inc., whose bank loans totaled more than $2 billion, was a reminder that the lucrative interest rates and fees paid on loans for takeovers are also very risky.
While the volume of bank financing for corporate takeovers is expected to fall, it is not going to disappear entirely. Some bankers see growth opportunites in refinancing older loans, even those that are in trouble. Chemical Bank, for example, is earning fees and interest by arranging for a group of banks to lend $300 million to the nine retail chains of Federated Stores Inc., the recently renamed holding company for Federated and Allied, so they can continue to buy merchandise from suppliers.
 
Expanding Consumer Business
On the positive side, many bankers expect consumer lending to remain a good business, although they are troubled by a rise in defaults on consumer loans in recent quarters.
Rather than rely on new opportunities for high-profit, high-risk loans in real estate or corporate takeovers, many bankers are looking for profits through reducing costs and expanding their consumer business.
Mr. Bitner of Evergreen Bancorp, who is also the president of the New York State Bankers Association, said he expected many banks to acquire ''weaker but unfailed thrifts that have proven themselves to be great deposit gatherers, but just don't have the capital to continue.''
In 1989, banks acquired more than 50 savings institutions with more than $20 billion in deposits, and attracted billions more in deposits from savings and loan customers who were alarmed at the financial condition of the industry. With more than 200 savings institutions being controlled by Federal regulators before they were sold, and with hundreds more expecting to be sold in the next few years, analysts expect bank acquisitions of savings institutions to be crucial to the expansion of banks' consumer business.
''The savings and loan industry has traditionally grown more rapidly than banking,'' said Paul Ross, a banking analyst at Data Resources Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
But just collecting deposits is no longer enough to guarantee profits. Since the early 1980's, when banks were allowed to pay interest on checking deposits and ceilings were removed on savings accounts, bank profit margins have been under pressure.
As the cost of deposits has risen, banks have found it harder to earn acceptable profits by investing in low-risk Treasury bills. Instead, they have developed what Marc Perkins, a banking analyst at Perkins, Smith Inc., a securities firm in Tampa, Fla., calls ''the compulsion to lend.''
''The real estate collapse was caused by banks who threw too much money at the developers,'' he said.
 
'Reaching too Far'
Alex Sheshunoff, a banking consultant in Austin, Tex., contends that ''some of the best-managed banks are the ones that will accept occasional years of down earnings, if that saves them from reaching too far and making bad loans.''
As the experience of 1989 shows, problems from bad loans made in a quest for increasing growth and profits can linger for years. In the third quarter, the industry's loss was concentrated among New York banks that needed to set aside reserves to cover losses on loans to third world countries, many of them made more than 10 years ago.
The nation's 15 largest banks were hardest hit by loans to developing nations, which caused large losses for those institutions in 1987 and 1989. They are, based on assets, Citibank, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, Bankers Trust Company, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Security Pacific National Bank, Chemical Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, First National Bank of Chicago, Continental Bank, NCNB Texas, First National Bank of Boston, Bank of New York and Mellon Bank.
Large banks that lent money to Brazil expect to be hurt in 1990 if the country refuses to make interest payments on the $20 billion it owes to American banks.
 
Regional Influences
According to some bankers, the severe losses from loans for commercial real estate projects last year were caused by more than poor judgment about borrowers' ability to repay. Banks in regions with many new buildings and high default rates by developers had few lending opportunities in other parts of the country, where conditions were more favorable.
The New England Banking Corporation, once the second-largest banking company in a region that had been thriving, was among the hardest hit, as its concentration in Massachusetts and Connecticut led to a $1.2 billion loss in the fourth quarter and $1.05 billion loss for the year.
The company, which was highly recommended by analysts in late 1988, is now fighting for its survival. It is seeking to sell $6 billion in assets and perhaps some of its banks.
Victor J. Riley, the chief executive of Keycorp, an Albany banking company, said the problems in New England were a reminder that ''bankers need to diversify geographically so that they are not too vulnerable to an economic downturn in a single region.''
An emphasis on consumer banking and lending to small and medium-sized businesses has been a successful formula for several years at regional banking companies. Now, and in the years ahead, analysts expect to see more banks following the lead of Keycorp and other highly regarded companies, including the Banc One Corporation, based in Columbus, Ohio, and the Security Pacific Corporation, based in Los Angeles.
Mr. Riley, who pushed Keycorp into expanding westward into Oregon, Washington and Wyoming in the 1980's, recalled that the New England states had not allowed acquisitions by New York banks, but did allow mergers among banks within the region.
''The New England banks promoted the idea of super-regional banks, they judiciously protected it, and in the long run, it has been their downfall,'' Mr. Riley said.

HEADLINE: Companies Hold Firm On Pretoria

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Business executives and the anti-apartheid protestors who are pushing them to sever economic ties with Pretoria do not expect the changes announced by President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa to stimulate new foreign investments.
''We have said it would take a complete elimination of the laws supporting apartheid, and the establishment of political freedom and equal opportunity for all, for us to renew the licenses on our industrial controls and distributorship agreements in 1996,'' said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for Honeywell Inc.
Notwithstanding South African hopes for a quick economic stimulus from the changes announced Friday, which included plans to legalize the African National Congress and to free Nelson Mandela, bankers in the United States said they doubted South Africa would find it any easier to get new loans from international banks.
 
Protests Against Extending Loans
Most banks are more eager to receive full payments for existing loans - South Africa had $12.2 billion in debts at the end of 1989, $2.4 billion of it owed to American banks. The bankers also face continuing protests about agreements they have reached to extend those loans. 
''There's an enormous amount that has to unfold before we have a new South Africa, and I don't see many new options for the business community at this point,'' said an American banker who asked that his bank not be identified.
''It may be that companies that have not pulled out now feel they can hold on because there is light at the end of the tunnel,'' the banker said, ''but it's hard to see an immediate reversal for those that have pulled out.''
Andrew MacThomas, a spokesman for Barclays Bank, the London-based bank that was once a dominant force in South African banking, commented: ''Our position hasn't changed from when we divested in 1986. We won't consider going back unless the existing apartheid laws were rescinded and world opinion has changed to the point that pressure groups and opinion formers feel it is acceptable to trade there again.''
The anti-apartheid groups stressed that many of the laws and policies supporting apartheid remain in place in South Africa. They said they intend to press for tougher sanctions.
''Our basic theme is the continuing need for sanctions until there is majority rule,'' said Timothy Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility, which coordinates shareholder lobbying by church groups on a variety of issues. ''The people we have talked to in South Africa - religious leaders, political leaders, labor leaders - say that pressure should continue. We will be pursuing banks not to roll over loans, companies to cut ties, and the U.S. Government to impose new sanctions.''
More than 120 American companies still have subsidiaries or investments in operations in South Africa, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington group that tracks corporate involvement in South Africa. The exodus grew from 7 companies in 1984 to a peak of 56 in 1987. The number of companies leaving fell to 27 in 1988, and to 18 last year.
The center said 176 companies - about half the total that have departed - have retained ties, which do not include ownership stakes of operations in South Africa. These ties include licensing agreements or arrangements to export products. The companies include such heavyweights as the International Business Machines Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company and the General Electric Company.
Anti-apartheid advocates say they intend to continue to use shareholder resolutions at annual meetings, boycotts, demonstrations and other forms of protest to encourage an end to such links, unless South Africa eliminates all laws requiring racial segregation and adopts a form of government that gives equal weight to each vote.
''The South African Government wants to find an excuse for the international community to lift sanctions, but de Klerk is still looking for a way to maintain white privilege,'' said Richard Knight, research director of the American Committee on Africa, a New York-based organization that promotes democratic change in South Africa. ''Now is not the time to let up the pressure.''
Companies that have announced plans not to renew current licenses or other relationships say that much more striking changes would be needed for them to reconsider their policies.
Nor are companies that went through the pain and cost of divesting likely to reverse that course quickly. Although a large market by African standards, South Africa is of marginal importance to most multinational companies.
The Raychem Corporation, a supplier of electronic wire and cable products based in Menlo Park, Calif., said it had no intention of backing out of a deal to sell operations in that country to local investors.
''We expect final approval from the central bank this month,'' said Christopher Margolin, Raychem's assistant secretary. ''Today's announcement is encouraging, but we are listening to our shareholders. We're out.''
In London, RTZ Ltd. and the British Petroleum Company hailed the development but said it would not induce them to change their investment policies. B.P. is one of the largest oil companies operating in South Africa, but the business is still a relatively small part of the company, accounting for only 1 to 3 percent of revenues.
Patrick H. Grattan, the company's regional coordinator for South Africa, said B.P. was not going to increase investment in South Africa. He suggested that the company was waiting for negotiations between the Government and black leaders.
A spokesman for RTZ, John G. Hughes, said of the developments, ''We see it as a positive step, but it doesn't mean we will turn around and dramatically increase investment.''

A Paper Spill Due In the Valdez Case

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus

 BODY:
THE Exxon Valdez case is coming - ''one or two million pieces of paper,'' by one lawyer's estimate - and it is already testing the courts' ability to adjudicate for thousands of people at a time.
Fishers, seafood processors, environmental groups, coastal villages and many others who filed suit after the oil spill in Prince William Sound in March are now represented by a small bureaucracy. The ''case management team'' of 17 lawyers was appointed six weeks ago by a joint ruling of the state and Federal courts in Anchorage, which consolidated about 150 lawsuits against the Exxon Corporation, its subsidiaries and its partners in the Alaska pipeline.
In a case of this magnitude, lawyers note, that is how it has to work. ''Otherwise the court system would be absolutely paralyzed, with 79 law firms and potentially 7,000 or 8,000 plaintiffs,'' said David W. Oesting of Davis Wright Tremaine in Anchorage, one of two lawyers appointed as lead counsel. 
Committee management of disaster litigation and product-liability cases has plenty of precedent, including the injury claims from the Bhopal, India, chemical leak; the Vietnam veterans' suits against the makers of Agent Orange, and the cases brought by Dalkon Shield users.
But that does not mean the courts are well suited to the task. ''I don't think the Founding Fathers in their wildest dreams imagined litigation involving thousands of claims, thousands of plaintiffs and multiple defendants,'' said Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Washington lawyer appointed by the court to fashion an accord in the Agent Orange case. ''These cases are not well processed.'' The Exxon Valdez case presents another twist: while liability is not expected to be an especially difficult issue, the plaintiffs have potentially divergent interests in whatever damages the group may collect. Fishing and tourist businesses, for example, must calculate individual losses, while municipalities and the state represent more diffuse public interests. Environmental groups want funds for research and protection of other resources. But all the plaintiffs, except the State of Alaska, are lashed together until judgment or settlement, which is not going to be soon.
Even for individual plaintiffs, damages might be gauged in many ways. ''There's some non-economic loss in intrinsic value of the resources lost,'' said Macon Cowles, a committee member from Boulder, Colo., who originally filed suit on behalf of several environmental groups. ''One of the policy questions raised by the contending claims is whether we're any better off if each fisherman gets $100 or $1,000 for this non-economic loss or if it's better directed to a fund used to enrich the environment for everyone.''
While members of the case management team insist that their main job is putting together a lawsuit, not mediating among plaintiffs, Mr. Feinberg said the most pressing issue would be ''who's going to pay, how soon they're going to pay and who's going to get the money.'' The committee members note that first they must hack their way through pleadings, depositions and exchanges of documents, pretrial motions at every turn and probable appeals of rulings on the motions. Jerry S. Cohen, the co-lead counsel and a partner in the Washington firm of Cohen Milstein Hausfeld & Toll, said that in the two main issues at a trial - establishing negligence and arguing for punitive damages - the plaintiffs would have common goals.
Still, even at this stage there must be provision for those dissatisfied with the committee's representation. Already a small group has tested this rule, complaining that the committee leadership would not be responsive to individual plaintiffs' interests because both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Oesting are class action lawyers. The court rejected that argument last week.
Perhaps the nearest precedent to the Exxon litigation is the tangle of suits growing out of the Amoco Cadiz oil spill off Brittany, in western France, in 1978. These suits were consolidated in the Federal District Court in Chicago, which established liability in 1984 and assessed damages four years later. Three months ago, after many challenges, a court-appointed special master submitted another recommendation.
How the Alaska courts could work more efficiently is not clear. If a trial resulted in a damage award, a jury or the court might simply ''fill in the blanks'' for contending plaintiffs, one lawyer said. In the more likely event of a pretrial settlement, the court could apply its own criteria or appoint a special master, like Mr. Feinberg, to oversee the plaintiffs' efforts to allocate the money.
Mr. Feinberg credited the judge in the Agent Orange case, Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, with finding ways to handle remedies that the judicial system was not intended to handle. ''We created our own administrative system,'' he said.
Does the Exxon case present more potential for conflict? ''Absolutely,'' Mr. Oesting said. Like the other lawyers in the case, he said he was waiting for the courts in Anchorage to be inventive.

Comfed Savings Bank Names New President

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Jack C. Zoeller has moved smartly through many careers, first in the Army, then on Wall Street and now in the banking industry. Mr. Zoeller, 40 years old, has been named president and chief operating officer of the Comfed Savings Bank, based in Lowell, Mass.
Mr. Zoeller, who joined the bank two years ago, takes the post from Jefferson F. Allen, who is chairman, president and chief executive of the bank's parent, Comfed Bancorp. Mr. Zoeller is executive vice president of the holding company.
Mr. Zoeller joined the company in 1987 as a vice president in the Comfed Mortgage Company, ''managing the Wall Street side,'' he said, referring to such tasks as hedging and transforming mortgage packages into securities. 
''Jack Zoeller is a recognized expert in Wall Street financings,'' Mr. Allen said. ''and is considered a pioneer in the securitization of loans and the hedging of interest rate risk.''
The Lowell area is suffering an economic downturn and banks in general in New England are being hurt by bad real estate loans. Comfed is no exception, having posted several recent quarterly losses. The Lowell economy is dominated by sagging high-technology businesses and in particular by Wang Laboratories Inc., which has reduced its work force by about 9,000 employees in the last year.
But Mr. Zoeller is optimistic. ''On new business, things are going surprisingly well,'' he said. ''Despite a slowdown in the real estate market, we've hired a number of mortgage sales people. On the deposit side, we have 30 branches in two states and we've been able to hold and increase deposits without getting involved in rate wars. Unfortunately, we still have a legacy of loans done in the previous climate.''
Mr. Zoeller is waiting for the sunny weekends of spring to bring the home buyers out. ''The market will tell this spring'' how the bank will fare this year, he said.
In 1970, Mr. Zoeller graduated first in his class from the United States Military Academy and went on to receive a master's degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Next stop was Oxford, where as a Rhodes Scholar he received a master's degree in politics.
In 1978, as an officer with the 82d Airborne, he wrote the operational plan for a parachute jump into Zaire to evacuate Americans caught in fighting. ''For a couple of nights we sat on the runway,'' Mr. Zoeller recalls. Finally, French and Belgian troops were sent instead.
When the 82d Airborne jumped into Panama in December, Mr. Zoeller ''got a vicarious pleasure'' out of the operation, he said. By that time, he was far from the Army, having spent his final two years of service wrestling with Army budgets in the Pentagon.
Leaving the Army, he wrote letters to Wall Street firms and was hired by E. F. Hutton & Company, where he stayed five years before forming his own firm specializing in savings and loan problems.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Headaches in China for Investors

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
When officials of the Shanghai Center told the Chinese customs bureau that the complex planned to import 50 to 60 cars, they received a strange notice: for each model of a Japanese car it imported, it would have to bring in two extra samples. These would be turned over to authorities for ''test driving.''
''It doesn't matter that the model you bring in is already on the streets of Shanghai,'' said Patsy Whitcomb, an American executive who is helping to prepare for the opening of the $195.5 million Shanghai Center, which is being financed by American and Japanese investors.
The request for extra cars is just the latest snag in what has been a long, twisted process of constructing Shanghai Center, which will be the city's largest hotel, office and residential complex when it opens in March.
 
Little Flexibility
The center's owner, Seacliff Ltd., hopes that the new rule, which comes on top of a 280 percent duty on the imported cars, will be negotiable, although customs officials have shown little flexibility so far. They have already prohibited the company from importing a Mercedes-Benz, a car that they say would not suit China's new style of ''plain living.'' 
The experience of Shanghai Center suggests that China remains as much of a headache as ever to many foreign investors, despite the eagerness of the Government to attract investment since its bloody crackdown last June.
Yet for the Shanghai Center, there is profound injury as well as insult: it is opening just as foreign business clients are staying away from China in droves. And for all its commitment to China, the center finds itself running up against the same problems that keep its clients away.
With its retail shops and 1,000-seat theater, the center is a showcase project intended to add a cosmopolitan air to China's biggest city. Thus, it would have seemed a likely candidate to get help from the Chinese Government as Shanghai tries desperately to regain its role as a financial and commercial center for Asia.
 
No Change Since Crackdown
So far, however, the Shanghai Center has not found business any easier since the crackdown, according to Seacliff, a partnership among the Portman Companies and the American International Group, both of the United States, and a Japanese concern, the Kajima Corporation. The Shanghai Center was designed by John Portman & Associates, the American architectural firm.
Investors had hoped the Chinese would offer better terms, both to overcome international outrage after the bloodshed in June and to dispel the gradual disillusionment of many Western investors in recent years, particularly after an economic austerity drive that began in late 1988 reduced prospects for economic growth.
Many business analysts in Shanghai say that the center would have been highly successful before the austerity drive began, but that the business climate is now much more sluggish. Uncertainty has also scared away many new investors and potential clients, although some who have been negotiating plans for years still plan to come.
''The real challenge is that there are no new people coming in,'' said Michael C. Kalyk, the general manager of the center. ''New business has to start up again before there's real business for us.''
 
Foreign Investment Dwindles
Like the rest of China, Shanghai has seen foreign investment dwindle since the crackdown. From January to June last year, there were 133 new projects worth $260 million by American investors, a Western diplomat estimated. The diplomat said that from July to December, only 66 projects worth $150 million were started, and most of these were begun before the crackdown.
The first half of this year will be more telling, since those who have invested less time in start-up negotiations may not feel burdened to continue their projects. Some companies who tried to pull out of their contracts apparently were not allowed to do so by the Chinese, diplomats say.
After the crackdown, many foreign companies facing dimmer commercial prospects hoped that Chinese bureaucrats would be more conciliatory at the negotiating table to restore the confidence of overseas investors. Some were offered interviews with senior officials, ministry-level bureaucrats, and at times, an audience with the Communist Party General Secretary himself, Jiang Zemin.
Foreign companies that demonstrated their commitment to China were thanked effusively and given encouragement. Some hope still lies in the prospect this spring that China will change the joint-venture law, extending the allowable term of a venture and authorizing the appointment of foreigners as a venture's chairman.
 
No Widespread Concession
Yet so far the high visibility has not led to widespread concessions, diplomats and business executives say. Only a small number of companies have obtained better terms, notably a foreign real estate developer in Tianjin. In fact, executives say some authorities, in an attempt to prove they are not to be cowed by foreigners, have actually become less cooperative with foreign companies.
''Despite the public relations, the environment for getting concessions is not easier, but harder,'' a Western diplomat here said. ''There are regulations that may have been in place already, but now there is a trend to enforcing the regulations that people overlooked before.''
Seacliff is negotiating with Shanghai's local government for greater concessions, primarily on property taxes and an extension on its current 18-year land lease. But the Shanghai government, which has auctioned off expensive land-use rights for 50 years to a foreign company, might not want to offer a 50-year or even 40-year lease to the Shanghai Center at a bargain price for fear of offending its other client.
A Chinese business official familiar with the negotiations indicated that Seacliff would probably get an extension, although it was not clear for how long.
 
Commercial Reputation
Shanghai has enjoyed a reputation as one of China's most attractive commercial centers for foreign investment and business representation. When the Portman Companies first conceived of building a mixed-use complex in 1979 and then when construction began in 1986, there was a severe shortage of first-rate commercial complexes in Shanghai.
The company had estimated that in 1986 there were about 4,000 hotel rooms for foreigners. But since then, officials all over Shanghai, and throughout China, moved as quickly as possible to sponsor hotel projects.
There apparently was no central plan governing construction projects in Shanghai, and for competitive reasons owners and builders tried to keep their development plans secret. As a result, the Portman Shanghai hotel will add 700 rooms, in March or soon thereafter, to a city that will have a total of 18,000 hotel rooms, Seacliff estimates. When the hotel opens, Seacliff expects occupancy to be around 40 percent.
So far, the company has pre-leased about 25 percent of its apartments, 20 percent of its shopping complex and 30 percent of its office space. The complex will not be fully open until July, when the theater is finished.
 
Complex Behind Schedule
In mid-1985, executives of the Portman Companies indicated that the project would be finished in the spring of 1988. Revised plans set the opening date for December 1989, which then was delayed three months when work halted for 30 days after the June crackdown. Crews were sent to their homes overseas or to other provinces in China, and it took about two months to be ready again.
In late summer, Seacliff injected an additional $20.5 million in capital to cover cost overruns and help start the construction process again, bringing the total project cost to $195.5 million. On Jan. 24, the company and its bankers, including the First National Bank of Chicago, signed an agreement, apparently initiated before the crackdown, to restructure the project's $145 million in loans.
Mr. Kalyk of Seacliff said the Shanghai Center would be able to cover operating expenses as soon as it opened, and he said he was confident the center would be able to meet its loan repayments. About a fourth of all operating expenses, he said, go to pay salaries for expatriate employees. This sum should drop once the center is running smoothly.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: TELEVISION;
New Friend For CBS: Ted Turner

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

 BODY:
A VERY intriguing meeting took place in Atlanta last week, when two top officers of CBS quietly visited a man whose previous role in the CBS drama was playing the bogyman: Ted Turner.
In the television industry, circumstances change quickly and so do alliances. CBS is now very interested in doing business with the man whose maneuvering to take over the network in 1985 led to a management upheaval, the effects of which are still being felt.
Now one top CBS executive says of Mr. Turner and his cable empire, ''We like these people.'' 
CBS had already established a link to Mr. Turner under a deal for cable rights to the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS won all the television rights to those games but sold a portion of the events to Turner Broadcasting System Inc. for $50 million.
An unusual part of the arrangement calls for CBS to sell all the commercial time in the two events, even for the hours that will be carried on Mr. Turner's TNT cable channel. CBS and TNT will also share the cost of the productions.
As a CBS executive put it: ''We are going to be doing some complicated things with them. Might something else grow out of that? That could be part of the process.''
The possibilities for a CBS-Turner alliance are as fascinating as they are surprising. The main item discussed by the two companies last week was the possibility of future relationships in sports, executives from both companies said. The discussions were held by Mr. Turner; Terry McGuirk, the president of the Turner sports division; Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, and Jay Kriegel, a senior vice president of CBS.
The most obvious possibility opened by a Turner-CBS sports alliance is to provide a counterbalance to the cable alliances already in place at other networks. ABC owns 80 percent of the all-sports cable channel ESPN and NBC manages and owns half of Sports Channel America.
One cable industry executive said he expected to see ''more and more joint bidding in the future by a broadcast and cable entity.''
Both ABC and NBC say no joint bidding has taken place so far. But, one cable industry executive said, ''ABC was involved in helping ESPN win the right to the N.F.L. three years ago.''
The main reason joint bidding makes sense, of course, is cost. Sports television rights have risen sharply in the last year, with professional baseball and basketball and college football and basketball all getting record television contracts. CBS grabbed two of those franchises - Major League Baseball and N.C.A.A. basketball. The baseball deal exceeded $1 billion.
''The word billion used to only be associated with the population of China, the gross national product and a children's book about cats,'' said Seth Abraham, the senior vice president of programming for the Home Box Office cable channel. ''Now it's turning up in deals for sports rights.''
And the most important and valuable television deal of all, the rights to the National Football League games, is currently being negotiated.
Almost no one believes that CBS and Mr. Turner will form an alliance to secure N.F.L. rights because the broadcast and cable packages will almost surely be negotiated separately. But at least one executive who will take part in the N.F.L. talks does not entirely rule it out. ''The N.F.L. is so wide open at this point I wouldn't say anything is impossible,'' he said.
The executive said he was aware of talks between CBS and Mr. Turner about the baseball deal before negotiations began.
But far more likely are deals for other sports that will be coming up in the next year or two, including such events as the world figure skating championships, the world gymnastics championships and tennis and golf tournaments. All have natural cable-broadcast divisions - early events on cable, finals on network.
The problem of escalating prices for sports rights really cuts both ways, a cable executive said. More and more cable operators are protesting the high rates that cable channels have been paying for sports because those dollars have to come from cable subscribers. The cable operators are worried about anything that may force their rates up because they are struggling in Washington to hold off re-regulation of the cable industry.
But, as Mr. Abraham sees it, the networks are facing a far more ominous situation. ''The networks are a little like Custer at Little Big Horn,'' he said. ''They are surrounded by Indians. Cable is there. The pay channels are there. Pay per view for sports is coming. Sooner or later they are going to be outnumbered. It makes a lot of sense to form an alliance with one of the tribes.''
Even something as simple as sharing the costs of sports announcers and commentators may make sense, Mr. Abraham said, because salaries for the top sports talent in television are now well past $1 million a year.
But sports may not be the only area where CBS and Mr. Turner can find common interest. Another possibility: news. CBS is the only network without an interest in an independent international news-gathering service. NBC owns part of Visnews and ABC is part owner of Worldwide Television News. The independent companies provide news coverage to clients, and ABC and NBC are now able to get coverage from places where they have no correspondents.
With CNN, Ted Turner has his own international news-gathering operation, one that is increasing in reach and impact every month. A link between CBS News and CNN would create an enormously powerful news operation - and something of a shocking one given the past history between the two companies.
But CBS is not ruling it out. ''There are a lot of ironies,'' a top CBS executive said last week. ''But we'd have no hesitation doing business with them. We want to explore every option.''

HEADLINE: Bush Asks Cautious Response To Threat of Global Warming

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
President Bush called today for a cautious response to the threat of global warming, pleasing those in his Administration who want a deliberate policy but disappointing many environmentalists.
In a speech to an international environmental group, the President called for global action but warned against policies that would interfere with economic growth and the free market.
Administration officials said the speech struck a middle ground between conflicting positions among Mr. Bush's aides.
His chief of staff, John H. Sununu, wanted to emphasize scientific uncertainties about global warming and to warn of economic dangers in rushing to act. Several agency heads, including William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, pressed for a stronger message of America's commitment to action. 
 
No New Recommendations
The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the speech did not represent a victory for the chief of staff. But it is clear that Mr. Sununu, who has a degree in nuclear engineering and has taken a strong interest in environmental issues, is having substantial influence on one of the most important environmental issues before the President.
''The United States remains committed to aggressive and very thoughtful action on environmental issues,'' Mr. Bush said in his speech. But he offered no new recommendations for specific action to slow or reduce global warming. He did not even use the words ''global warming,'' speaking only of ''climate change.''
Although there is considerable disagreement over the extent of the problem, many scientists expect temperatures across the world to increase as carbon dioxide and other industrial and vehicular gases accumulate in the atmosphere and trap radiation from the sun.
Mr. Bush called for an ''international bargain, a convergence between global environmental policy and global economic policy, where both perspectives benefit and neither is compromised.'' He asserted that strong economies around the world would provide the resources for better protection of the environment.
''Wherever possible,'' he said, ''we believe that market mechanism should be applied and that our policies must be consistent with economic growth and free-market principles in all countries.''
Mr. Bush spoke at a meeting here of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body formed under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Association. The panel's mission is to assess the changes in the world's climate that many scientists expect will occur in the next century, and the political and scientific implications of those changes.
The President's remarks disappointed environmentalists and some European government officials and scientists at the meeting. They had hoped Mr. Bush would outline specific suggestions for concerted action to lower the gas emissions.
 
Contrast With Europeans
''A year ago this speech would have been exciting,'' said Christopher Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute, a research group based in Washington, adding that in the past year there has been a growing international consensus about the threat of global warming. ''Now it's a disappointment.'' The combustion of fossil fuels like oil and coal is the chief source of carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Flavin noted that some European governments had committed themselves to controlling emissions, often through taxes on industries and products that emit carbon dioxide.
He added that members of the Bush Administration were seeking to kill a provision in the clean air bill before the Senate that would require improved fuel efficiency in automobiles as a way to curb emissions.
James T. B. Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, said of the speech, ''The tone is fine but there are no specific commitments.'' He added, ''What is needed now to deal with global warming is a massive energy Marshall Plan that stresses energy conservation and efficiency, renewable sources of energy and a reversal of trends toward increasing oil imports and traffic congestion.''
 
Praise From Industry
Industry representatives praised the President's insistence that any policies to deal with the environmental threat must be consistent with economic growth.
Thomas G. Lambrix, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group, called the President's speech ''very strong'' and said it struck a good balance between the global warming problem and the need to achieve a better understanding of the scientific issues and to develop strategies that are premised on economic development.
Jana R. Oakley, assistant vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said, ''The President has outlined strong environmental initiatives,'' and added, ''I don't see how anyone in this room can say he is not an environmental President.''
Administration officials said the muted tone of the President's speech reflected concerns by the White House staff that more scientific data about global warming and more study of the potential costs of meeting the threat are needed before formal international action is taken.
But the officials said that despite Mr. Sununu's influence, most of the changes he sought were not included in the speech as delivered. Those changes would have had the President dwell chiefly on the scientific uncertainties and economic dangers and play down the environmental threat.
Mr. Reilly, who pressed for a strong commitment on global warming, praised the President's speech.

HEADLINE: Panama Is Resisting U.S. Pressure To Alter 'Inadequate' Bank Laws

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Officials of the new Panamanian Government are resisting United States pressure to change the banking laws that historically made the country a haven for enormous illicit drug profits before Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was removed from power.
The Panamanians say the current laws and the new Government are more than adequate to prevent such abuses. American law-enforcement officials and legislators are concerned that the new Government and the country's appetite for foreign investment will actually lead to even greater use of Panamanian financial institutions to conceal illicit drug profits.
Edgardo Lasso Valdes, the president of the Panamanian banking association and one of the country's seven banking commissioners, said in an interview: ''The only problem of money laundering in Panama is the newspapers that mention that Panama is a big money-laundering center. , To be honest, we don't feel there is any problem.''
But a senior State Department official here, who asked not to be identified, said the existing laws ''are grossly inadequate'' to prevent money laundering, a process in which illegally earned profits are deposited in bank accounts or legitimate businesses, then withdrawn as ''clean money.'' He said the United States was strongly urging Panama to revise them. 
 
A Growing Tension
In interviews in recent days, local banking regulators, senior Panamanian officials and United States officials demonstrated through their comments a growing tension between the two nations over the money-laundering issue. A fight appears likely in Congress over a proposed $1 billion aid package for Panama.
An extensive review of Panamanian banking records and court documents shows that many senior leaders in the Government, while never accused of money laundering, have had strong ties to corrupt banks. Several of the banks have been indicted for money laundering or been shut because of pressure from the United States.
The nation's new President, Guillermo Endara, has for years been a director of a Panamanian bank used extensively by Colombia's Medellin drug traffickers.
Guillermo (Billy) Ford, the Second Vice President and chairman of the banking commission, is a part owner of the Dadeland Bank of Florida, which was named in a court case two years ago as a central financial institution for one of the biggest Medellin launderers, Gonzalo Mora.
Rogello Cruz, the new Attorney General, has been a director of the First Interamericas Bank, owned by Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, one of the bosses of the Cali drug gang in Colombia.
There is no evidence that President Endara, Vice President Ford, Mr. Cruz or other current leaders were aware of or involved with the illegal operations carried out at the banks to which they have ties. But officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department say the business connections and friendships make it difficult to believe that any real crackdown against money laundering is likely.
American law-enforcement officials said they had evidence that Panamanian banks were used to launder money through the waning hours of the administration of General Noriega, who is awaiting trial in Miami on drug and money-laundering charges. And though most of General Noriega's senior aides remain either fugitives or in jail, all the bankers with whom they are said to have dealt remain in key positions.
''I'm very concerned about it,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has held extensive hearings on money laundering and the use of Panamanian banks. ''This is the moment to do something - but it now appears that not enough is being done.'' Long History of Aiding Money Launderers Panama's secrecy laws and tax breaks for foreign depositors, coupled with the country's proximity to cocaine production and trafficking in the Andes, have long made banks here a kind of hidden tub for cleaning dirty money.
In a recent interview, President Endara acknowledged that the success of Panama's financial center in the 1970's and 1980's was a result of the Latin American drug cartels.
Increased pressure is now on the nation's banks, whose foreign deposits have fired rapid economic growth for two decades, to lure back more foreign investors, many of whom had left during the turmoil of recent months. Illegalities Aid G.N.P. The financial community represents as much as 15 percent of the Panamanian economy, according to Government figures. Last year, the gross national product was estimated at $1.76 billion, and virtually all economists agree that laundered drug money, arms sales and other illicit income have played a large role in the accumulation of that wealth.
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama in 1988 in an attempt to halt money laundering. As a result some banks were forced to freeze some deposits, and some banks failed. Until the sanctions, Panamanian authorities would occasionally seize assets of suspected accounts but would generally not provide information to law-enforcement authorities.
Merchants from Colon, on the Atlantic coast about 50 miles north of Panama City, said one common way of laundering money was the purchase of large amounts of clothes with millions of dollars in drug profits. The clothes are then shipped to Colombia and sold for Colombian pesos, which are deposited in local banks. Hidden Bank Accounts And Secrecy Laws But the strongest attraction for money launderers appears to be Panama's hidden bank accounts.
The bank secrecy laws permit a depositor to sue a bank if confidential information is disclosed, and prosecutors can also bring criminal charges against the banker who, without authorization, provides information about an account. Panama also has corporate secrecy protection that enables the founder or founders of a business to keep their identity secret.
 
Talks on Cooperation
Negotiations have been under way to forge an agreement of cooperation between Panamanian and American law-enforcement authorities, following a preliminary agreement signed last month by the Panamanian Government and the State Department.
Nonetheless, the widely held view among drug officials is that as banking restrictions imposed during the period of United States sanctions are lifted over the next four months, illegal profits will again pour into many of the country's 110 banks.
''Given the chaos and general turmoil of the country following the invasion, there is now an excellent opportunity for organized crime and the cocaine cartels to step back in,'' said James E. Preston, an Arizona prosecutor who has spent recent months on a Federal grant studying international money laundering.
President Endara has said he sees no need for any significant banking-law changes and so does not expect any. The National Banking Commission, which regulates banks, is dominated by local and international bankers, many of whom agree with the President and Mr. Lasso that the magnitude of the drug problem has been exaggerated. Feelings of Resentment Over U.S. Pressure Disputing reports by the Drug Enforcement Administration and other people at the Justice Department, the new Finance Minister, Mario Galindo, said in an interview that there was no money-laundering problem in Panama. Many bankers and some officials expressed resentment over pressure by the United States to alter the banking system.
Mr. Lasso, who is also general manager of the Panamanian branch of the International Bank of Costa Rica, said it was hypocritical of United States officials to be citing Panamanian banks. He said the punishment meted out recently in the two largest drug money-laundering cases in the United States shows that American officials themselves are not particularly tough on money laundering.
The settlements were of $5 million over four years in the case of Banco de Occidente and $14 million for Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Both banks admitted in courts that their Panamanian branches were used extensively to launder drug money.
''How can you ask us to break a bank in Panama when all they do in the U.S. is pay a fine?'' Mr. Lasso asked. ''We don't understand it. It gives us some doubts.''
 
Reputable Banks Driven Out
The economic sanctions have driven out some of the more reputable international banks, and many of those left continue to be found to have drug ties, knowingly or not. Testimony in one recent case tied a third of the banks to laundering operations for drug money. Most of those banks were used not as points at which customers would deposit cash but rather as places to which launderers in the United States would electronically transfer funds for deposit.
Virtually all those banks remain in operation today, and none were prosecuted for laundering.
''There are already laws here on the books that make money laundering illegal,'' said a senior banker who has been in Panama for more than 20 years and now works at a large Asian bank in Panama City. ''But the laws have only been as good as the people who enforce them.'' Important Banking Ties Of Top Panama Officials It is difficult to find any senior officials here who do not have important ties to banks.
President Endara has for years been a director of Banco Interoceanico de Panama, one of the two dozen Panamanian banks named in a case based on a Federal Bureau of Investigation case code-named Cashweb/Expressway. F.B.I. agents posing as money launderers were given large amounts of cash in that case by Colombians in the United States who instructed them to transfer the funds to these 24 banks.
Mr. Endara, a corporate lawyer before becoming President, is a close friend of Carlos Eleta, a Panamanian businessman who was arrested in Atlanta in April on charges of conspiring to set up a major cocaine smuggling ring. Released on bail, he is now awaiting trial.
The families of First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon and the Finance Minister, Mr. Galindo, are also heavily involved in banking. Mr. Galindo's cousin, Samuel Lewis Galindo, is chairman of Banco del Istmo.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 6 about Panamanian banks and money laundering referred incorrectly to the relationship of the Dadeland Bank of Florida to a senior Panamanian offical and accusations of money laundering. Guillermo (Billy) Ford, Second Vice President of Panama, is not an owner of Dadeland. No Federal or state authorities have accused Dadeland of improper ties to the Medellin drug cartel.

HEADLINE: Peace Plan Critic Is Elected President in Costa Rica

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Rafael Calderon Jr., a critic of the Central American peace efforts of President Oscar Arias Sanchez, was elected Sunday to succeed Mr. Arias, according to nearly complete returns.
Mr. Calderon, the son of a former President who was driven into exile in 1948 after bringing on a civil war by trying to win a second term, defeated Carlos Manuel Castillo, the candidate of Mr. Arias's National Liberation Party. With about 90 percent of the returns counted, Mr. Calderon had 51 percent of the vote and Mr. Castillo 47 percent. 
Mr. Calderon, the candidate of the Social Christian Unity Party, is to take office May 8. Mr. Arias was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second term.
Mr. Castillo bitterly conceded defeat late Sunday night.
''It's a referendum on 40 years of history,'' a senior adviser to Mr. Castillo said.
Exit polls showed that Costa Rican voters feared an excessive concentration of power. Traditionally, the country has alternated governing parties. But the National Liberation Party, taking advantage of opposition disorganization, had won five of the last six elections and seemed on the verge of becoming the dominant party.
 
Born in Nicaragua
Mr. Calderon's victory also underscored the growing appeal of free-market principles in the region and the rejection of state intervention in the economy. While both major parties promised amibitious social programs, analysts said the National Liberation Party was more strongly identified with a state-managed economy.
Mr. Calderon was born March 14, 1949, in Nicaragua, where his family was living in exile after his father was defeated and driven from the country. His godfather was the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Garcia, who was assassinated in 1956.
The family soon moved to Mexico, where Mr. Calderon went to primary and secondary school. He returned here and graduated from the University of Costa Rica. He is married to Gloria Bejarano Almada and has four children.
He was elected to the National Assembly in 1974 and ran unsuccessfully for President in 1982. He then formed his Social Christian Unity Party from four small parties and ran again. The results were closer, but he was once again defeated, this time by Mr. Arias.
After his defeat, he became the executive director of the Costa Rican Association for the Defense of Democracy and Liberty, a right-wing group. Under Mr. Calderon, the association was among the strongest critics of Mr. Arias's peace plan for Central America. Government officials charged that the group's activities were part of the Reagan Administration's efforts to thwart the Arias peace plan, which called for the demobilization of the United States-financed Nicaraguan rebels.
 
Dispute Over Financing
The association had close relations with senior Republicans in the United States and according to Congressional documents was largely financed by the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, one of four branches of the National Endowment for Democracy. Although technically a private organization, its budget comes from public funds through the United States Information Agency.
Congressional Democrats charged that this financing violated the endowment's charter prohibiting it from supporting political candidates.
Mr. Calderon, who resigned from the association before launching his current campaign, said the United States money was used for ''political development'' and that none of it went to his presidential effort.

HEADLINE: A Grieving Israel Pushes Politics Aside

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Stunned Israelis postponed politics, canceled trips to Egypt and lamented what seemed to be a further blow to regional peace today as the nation recovered its dead and wounded from the terrorist attack on a tour bus near Cairo on Sunday night.
This evening, a transport plane pulled into a secluded corner of Ben-Gurion International Airport, at Lod. With somber ceremony, officers in colored berets carried eight flag-covered coffins out the cargo door and laid them in the beds of eight military trucks. After the trucks were lined up in a neat, careful row, dazed-looking family members, hugging themselves in the chill air, listened from a few yards away as rabbis read the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead. 
''Today the people of Israel are draped in heavy sorrow,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in Jerusalem this afternoon. After consultations among normally bitter Likud party rivals, led by Ariel Sharon, Likud agreed to postpone what had promised to be a bruising party meeting, a contest for power scheduled for Wednesday night. No new date has been set.
 
No 'Petty Arguments'
''This isn't an appropriate time for petty arguments between Likud members,'' Mr. Shamir said.
Nine or 10 Israelis were killed and 17 were wounded, some of them seriously, in the attack. The death toll is uncertain because of conflicting reports about whether a victim died in transit today. Eight victims died in the attack, and a ninth died in an Egyptian hospital overnight. One more person reportedly died this morning while being flown to Tel Aviv.
An Islamic fundamentalist group in Lebanon took responsibility today for the assault. Egyptians and Israelis said they hoped that the attack would not block movement toward peace talks.
The Foreign Ministers of Israel, Egypt and the United States are trying to arrange a meeting soon between Israelis and Palestinians.
But politics took second stage to grief. As the dead and wounded were removed from the transport plane, the daughter of one victim grew hysterical and smashed through a thick terminal window, screaming ''Mother! Mother!'' as she tried to run to the middle of the field where the victims were being loaded into ambulances. The police and soldiers restrained her.
Grief and regret was not confined to Jews. As a sign of sympathy, the heads of Israeli-Arab local town councils postponed a one-day strike over economic problems. In Egypt, the Palestine Liberation Organization denounced the attack, as did several prominent West Bank Palestinians.
Faisal al-Husseini, the leading nationalist figure in the West Bank, said, ''We condemn this act, no matter who committed it.'' But he and other West Bank leaders came back with a prepared statement a few hours later, reminding Israel, ''We can't mention the attack on the Israelis without mentioning the Palestinians killed every day in the occupied territories.''
At Haddasah Ein Karem Hospital in Jerusalem, Nickolas Aronowitsch, a kibbutz worker from Sweden who was on the bus, lay in the emergency room being treated for shrapnel wounds to his leg and foot. His clothing was wrapped up in a plastic bag under his bed. After the bus stopped, he said, the attackers ''told a couple of Arab passengers to get off.''
The shooting started moments later, Mr. Aronowitsch said. He fell to the floor, then ''jumped out the left side,'' through a shattered window. ''I threw myself into some sort of ditch and saw a man standing there with an assault rifle. He was screaming. I don't think he saw me, thank God.''
''I was told that four hand grenades were thrown,'' he added, ''but I heard only three.'' After several minutes of firing, he said, the assailants fled.
''It was a big highway, and a lot of cars passed us, but very few stopped,'' he said. ''It was 25 minutes before the ambulances came.''
 
Account of the Attack
Noam Lahav, a college professor from Mevaseret Zion, outside Jerusalem, was being treated nearby, and the police were interviewing him. ''There were two terrorists,'' he said, ''and I think one of them was kind of fat. The one holding a gun had a headdress wrapped halfway around his face.
''I got off the bus, and one of them on the ground continued to shoot. I carry an Italian leather bag with me, and I ran toward him. I didn't think first.''
When he was a foot away, he said, ''I hit the one in the face'' with the bag.
Professor Lahav was being treated for a gunshot wound to the arm. He told the police that he was 61 years old.
Interviewed on Israeli radio, Dr. Shimon Shamir, the Israeli Ambassador to Egypt, said Egypt did ''more than could be expected'' in response to the bus attack.
In a speech to the Parliament this evening, Prime Minister Shamir said he held Egypt accountable for the safety of Israeli tourists, adding, ''Our first demand at this time to the Egyptian authorities is to find those who carried out this crime and to bring them to trial quickly and to punish them as much as the law allows.''
But both Mr. Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said they saw no reason that the three-way foreign ministers' meeting could not proceed.
At the same time, Israeli tourists are no longer proceeding as planned on trips to Egypt. More than 100,000 Israeli tourists visited Egypt last year, but travel agents across the country were reporting cancellations by the dozens. Aryeh Waknin, manager of a tour agency in Haifa, said, ''In general, people are canceling out.''

HEADLINE: Bentsen Leery on Social Security Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, whose support is crucial to adoption of a plan to cut the Social Security tax, declined today to take a stand on the proposal.
At the opening Congressional hearing on the proposal before the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is chairman, Mr. Bentsen said the growing use of Social Security revenues to cover the deficit in the rest of the Government's budget was ''an issue that can no longer be ignored.''
But Mr. Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, added, ''My concern is what replaces the revenue loss to the budget, and I haven't seen anything on that one.''
The sponsor of the proposal, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, was praised by Mr. Bentsen and other senators for having focused attention on the way the Social Security surplus is being used to pay for the general operating expenses of the Government rather than to guarantee retirement benefits in the next century. 
 
Quandary for Democrats
But Senator Moynihan's specific proposal to cut the tax by more than $60 billion over the next two years won no solid political support. And without the unconditional support of Senator Bentsen, whose committee has jurisdiction over the issue, its prospects for enactment are dim.
The proposal has presented Democratic leaders like Senator Bentsen with a quandary.
On the one hand, they agree with Senator Moynihan that cuts in income taxes and increases in the Social Security tax over the last decade have unfairly shifted the tax burden from the well-to-do toward the poor and middle class. Even more important, the Democrats enjoy watching the discomfort of President Bush and his Republican allies as they oppose a tax cut for workers and support a reduction in the capital gains tax, which would largely benefit the wealthy.
On the other hand, the Democrats believe a tax reduction of the magnitude Mr. Moynihan is suggesting would be disastrous for the economy, and they are reluctant to push for a different kind of tax to make up for what would be lost in Social Security revenue.
 
Political Danger Seen
Senator Moynihan argues that it would be politically foolhardy to advocate another kind of tax as long as Mr. Bush remains so adamantly opposed.
The only other Democrat who attended the hearing, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, said he too was ambivalent and needed more time to study the measure.
The Moynihan proposal was criticized as irresponsible by several Republican lawmakers and by the Social Security commissioner, Gwendolyn S. King.
Restating the Bush Administration's position, Mrs. King maintained that a reduction in the tax now could jeopardize retirement benefits in the future.
 
Denies Future Peril
Senator Moynihan, who is chairman of the finance panel's Social Security subcommittee, denied that future benefits would be endangered. So long as the payroll taxes are not invested for the future and are used instead to pay current government operating expenses as well as retirement benefits, he said, the next generation of workers will in any event be burdened with much higher taxes to pay for their parents' retirement.
Charles A. Bowsher, the comptroller general, agreed with Mr. Moynihan's analysis, but he said that if alternative tax revenues were not found to replace those lost under the Moynihan plan it would ''add to the financial risk.''
Mr. Bowsher, who heads the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, took issue with the Bush Administration's plan, which involves continuing to use Social Security funds to pay for general government expenses through 1995. That, he said, would lead to another $1 trillion in government debt by the middle of this decade.

HEADLINE: Helping Eastern Europe Helps the West

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the efforts of Eastern Europe to change from state-controlled to market economies (editorial, Jan. 21), serious questions arise about the transformation and the new organization these economies will take. Are small and large enterprises to be transferred from the public to the private sector, and in what form? How would the transfer of ownership be achieved? Through state sales to individuals and foreign investors, or by making workers and employees total or partial owners of the companies in which they work?
Although we do not have much experience in applying such economic reforms, some form of workers' capitalism or employee stock ownership plans could be used in the process of privatization. This economic system avoids extreme wealth accumulation and monopolization by individuals or the state, and combines advantages from both the capitalist and the socialist systems. It is in accordance with Joseph Schumpeter's theory of ''people's capitalism.'' 
Under this system, which has been implemented to some extent by the United States, Japan and the European Community, work incentives and labor productivity improve, strikes and other disputes are less likely because employee-owners share in decision making, and income distribution is more equitable. Thus, the saying that ''in capitalism man exploits man, in communism it is the other way around'' may not be relevant to workers' capitalism.
Along with democratization of the Eastern bloc countries, proper institutions for property titles and mortgages for credit should be established, as well as patent and copyright laws to insure orderly transfer of ownership. Such efforts can be financed and supported by Western countries and world institutions, while international mutual funds can capitalize on Eastern Europe's dramatic changes and invest in productive ventures.
As government subsidies are reduced and prices and unemployment rise, Eastern Europeans will need Western support because it is difficult to make such drastic changes alone. In the long run, such a policy is expected to be beneficial to Western economies as well.

Grasping Reality

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The news from South Africa is as breathtaking, in its context, as from Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union. The leader of the party that institutionalized white supremacy, that imprisoned the black majority's spokesmen and outlawed its political movements, has started down the political path toward a new South Africa.
What led President F. W. de Klerk to such dramatic steps? Why would a man brought up in the National Party and Afrikaner tradition decide to legalize anti-apartheid politics after 30 years of repression? And decide to free Nelson Mandela?
I put those questions to an important figure in the internal opposition, Patrick Lekota, who is visiting here. He is publicity secretary of the United Democratic Front, the largest anti-apartheid group inside the country. The record of his life indicates the price of opposition politics in South Africa. 
In 1976, after a two-year trial, Mr. Lekota was convicted on two counts of ''terrorism.'' He had organized a rally to celebrate Mozambique's newly won independence, and the court said that might encourage South Africans to similar rebellion. The other count was participation in the black consciousness movement of the time, which might incline blacks to be hostile to whites: ''a terrorism of the spirit,'' the judge said.
The sentence was six years. He served most of that in the notorious prison on Robben Island.
In 1988, after a three-year trial, he was convicted of high treason. The charge was that he had helped to found the United Democratic Front in 1983, with the aim of instigating anti-apartheid protests that would make the country ungovernable. Again, there was no evidence of violence.
This time the sentence was 12 years. Mr. Lekota went back to Robben Island. But last December the conviction was thrown out on appeal.
Altogether, including detentions and imprisonment during trials, he has been in prison 13 of the last 16 years - for what would not be offenses under American or European law. At the age of 41, he has been able to get a passport for the first time. But his political comments, on the reasons for the de Klerk moves, were without bitterness.
''Most important there was the sheer tenacity of us inside the country,'' he said, ''the way we responded to the worst excesses they could bring on us. The resilience we had when they cut off our leaders, our creativity in always finding a new way, showed that we were simply irrepressible. ''Second, this is a new generation of Afrikaners, educated in different conditions - some of them in part abroad, including F. W. de Klerk. They have seen that other liberation struggles were not defeated. They have looked at Algeria, for example, and know the viciousness at the end of that struggle.
''Another important element is the interconnectedness of South Africa and the rest of the world. They're not like P. W. Botha [the last President], who said 'The hell with the world.' The reality is we have to be part of the world.
''Then there was the thawing of relations between East and West. What has happened in Eastern Europe has had a big impact. Things are opening up elsewhere, people are saying they have to have political solu-tions, and they don't want to lag behind the world.''
What it added up to, I thought, was that Mr. de Klerk had begun to face reality: the determination of the 75 percent black population to have rights, the economic cost of the world's disapproval and so on. But for a National Party leader to face reality is remarkable. The party has been in power since 1948, and for most of that time its leaders have tried to shut out reality.
Mr. de Klerk showed in a striking way that he was determined. He moved to prevent obstruction of the new policy by the state security forces.
A week before his speech he called the 500 top police commanders to Cape Town and appealed to them not to undermine his plans. Failure to reach a political settlement now, he said, would lead to ''an Armageddon.'' Then, when a young man died in police custody, Mr. de Klerk immediately ordered a judicial inquiry: the first in 71 such deaths since 1963.
It is a long way still to resolution of what are very different views of the political future. But President de Klerk has set out on the path. He knows that the first steps are not enough: that people's expectations have not been met, that foreign banks and investors are waiting. It will be hard to turn back.

Pay or Shiver: Sticker Shock Of Heating Oil

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: WOODBURY, N.J.

 BODY:
rrWinter has not yet run its capricious course, but the near-balmy days of January and early February make the pulse-chilling cold of December seem a bitter memory.
For many New Jersey residents, that is just the word for it - bitter.
''I really, sincerely, absolutely felt I was being held up,'' said Mrs. Ralph Paulillo, 63 years old, who lives in Jersey City with her husband and a sister, all retired.
''The Jan. 10 fuel-oil delivery was $1.39 and nine-tenths a gallon,'' she said, separating every word of the amount as if holding them up to baleful scrutiny like dirty socks. ''And that was for 400 gallons. I made up my mind right then I was going to do something.'' 
What Mrs. Paulillo did was call a cooperative, the New Jersey Citizen Oil Group. Their price a week or so ago was $1.09 a gallon. She signed up immediately for a total fee of $24, which included membership in the parent group of the co-op, New Jersey Citizen Action.
She was not the only new member. In the wake of the December oil shock, driven by bitter cold that seemed to go on forever, the group signed up 650 new members.
''At the end of October we had 957 members,'' said Kendall Miller, the cheery 24-year-old who runs the cooperative. ''I was answering the phone 16 hours a day.''
The cooperative has been in operation for six years, and the 650 new members make up a sizable part of its membership.
Economics is a factor. ''I think anybody in their right mind would change dealers if they could get these prices,'' said Mrs. Paulillo. But there is another factor, and that is anger. ''There is really a sense of betrayal,'' Ms. Miller said. ''A lot of these people had been with their fuel-oil company for 10 or 15 or 20 years. Prices went up and down, but they trusted their oil company. It was like a relative, like their mother. It kept them warm. Then they got these exorbitant bills.'' ''I am not enamored of the oil companies anyway,'' said Martha Viel of Vineland, who signed up after her oil price went from 93 cents a gallon when she filled her 500-gallon tank on Dec. 11 to $1.27 last Tuesday. ''I thought my dealer was probably just passing it on, the extra cost, but who knows? I don't like the abuses of it.''
There is also the feeling of powerlessness, that like death and taxes oil prices are inexorable. Pay or freeze.
''We already pay such exorbitant property taxes,'' said Mrs. Paulillo, whose income is largely fixed. ''Then fuel prices go up. I had never complained about prices before. But he delivered 400 gallons when I wasn't home, and when I saw the price I really flew off the handle.'' For some, anger is not possible. ''One woman, she was 73, called, and she was in tears,'' Ms. Miller recalled. ''She got her oil bill, and it was for $500, and she just couldn't pay it. She didn't know what to do.''
Ms. Miller called the woman's supplier and arranged for monthly payments. And she signed up the woman for deliveries from the co-op.
For most oil buyers, there is little alternative. Converting to natural gas can cost $2,000 to $3,000. Even for the committed, that is not always possible.
''I thought about converting when I moved here in October,'' said Edward J. Sauka of Bloomfield, who bought his house with an oil furnace and who signed up with the oil co-op a week ago after seeing his first bill. ''But it wasn't economically feasible right now.''
Mr. Sauka is a marketing specialist for a big utility, Public Service Electric and Gas.
''Who made the profits?'' he asked, a question that Congress and regulators across the country are posing. For the moment, no one is quite sure. Meanwhile, the oil co-op provides one of the few alternatives to paying whatever the traffic will bear or shivering through the cold.
The New Jersey Citizen Oil Group is able to offer oil well below market prices because it has contracts with five dealers across the state who agree to provide oil at cut-rate prices, partly for public relations and partly to spread deliveries across predictable markets. All five keep their identities secret because they also have regular customers who pay market prices.
There is another consideration, Ms. Miller said, and that is that fuel-oil consumers, angry and frustrated at unpredictable prices, will shift to alternative fuels.
''We're the last stop before conversion to gas,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Maps Policy of Delay For Raises

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Facing both a $1 billion budget gap and negotiations with New York City unions that are among Mayor David N. Dinkins's biggest supporters, city officials say they are considering offering contracts with minimal raises this year but the promise of larger payments in the future.
The practice, known as backloading because part of the raise is deferred until the end of the contract, might enable the city to hold to something like the modest 1.5 percent annual increase that it now claims is all it can afford for municipal workers in settlements that come due beginning on June 30.
But the tactic could conceivably commit the city to an increase it could not otherwise afford in anticipation of future revenues it cannot guarantee. Municipal contracts settled with delayed increases in pension benefits in the 1960's are generally considered to have contributed to the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's. 
City officials refused to discuss the likely size of wage proposals or possible contract strategies in any detail, and said no plan had been formed. They also noted that in the fiscal crisis, municipal unions agreed to defer wage increases outright for several years until the city could afford to pay them, an idea that is also being floated.
 
Risky Inducements
Fiscal and labor relations experts say the wisdom of backloaded agreements depends mostly on the size of the deferred increases and the cumulative increase by the end of the contract.
For example, the total compensation over the life of a contract might be no greater than it would have been through a series of limited raises, but would simply be distributed differently, with progressively larger payments in later years. More typically, a premium is offered as an inducement for signing such contracts, and the experts say that is riskier.
''It's very hard to speculate on something like that,'' said Charles Brecher, director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private monitoring group. ''If all you did is spread the same money out in an uneven way, then that could be good for the city. But presumably you're going to have to pay a premium for that.''
Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and a member of Mr. Dinkins's council of economic advisers, has urged deferring any wage increases until the city can pay for them outright, or negotiating very modest increases to be offset entirely by attrition in the work force.
 
'Shouldn't Try to Kid People'
''Whatever increase is negotiated should be modest and up front and distributed evenly across the contract,'' he said in a telephone interview from Paris yesterday. ''You shouldn't try to kid people.''
Mr. Rohatyn said backloading a contract, at worst, ''is borrowing, and it's just paying at a different time.
''But as for the overall economics,'' he added, ''unless you think that you're in a really temporary economic downturn and you're very sure of it, it doesn't really solve anything. It just enables you to pretend in the early stages that you have less of a problem.''
Mr. Dinkins's four-year financial plan and preliminary budget issued last week shows a projected budget surplus of $314 million in fiscal year 1993, which ends on June 30, 1990. That amount appears under the heading ''reserve for service enhancements, tax reductions and other contingencies,'' and officials said it could also be used for labor settlements.
 
Counting on the Economy
But they cautioned that the number is merely a prediction, dependent on many variables and the future course of the economy. Even if all that money were available, each percentage-point increase in wages and benefits for city workers is now estimated to cost $130 million a year, so $340 million would allow for an increase of fewer than 3 percentage points, well below the unions' current demands.
''It's obviously a fairly speculative number, because a lot of water has to go under the bridge before then,'' said the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael. He added that the surplus was a consequence of economic projections, not an expectation of future needs, and that ''it wasn't put there as a source of a backloaded labor settlement.''
But he said the city's forecasts anticipate that the economy will improve in the future, while there is not much room for flexibility in labor settlements this year. Officials said that the four-year plan, a legacy of the fiscal crisis, would make it unlikely that the city could hide delayed contract plums as in the 60's, since balance sheets for the future must be included in each year's budget.
While the city says it has included only enough money in the budget for a 1.5 percent wage increase this year, Barry Feinstein, a major Dinkins supporter and the head of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents many city workers, said a 5 percent increase is the floor at which his union intends to start formal bargaining on Feb. 13 for a two-year contract. #1.5 Percent 'Untenable'
Mr. Feinstein said yesterday that no one in the administration had mentioned the possibility of a backloaded contract to him, but he said he would discuss any reasonable proposal. ''What's untenable is saying 1.5 percent and that's all that's there,'' he said.
The teamsters' current contract expires on June 30, along with those of unions representing police officers, firefighters and correction and sanitation officers. Contracts for teachers and most other municipal workers expire on Sept. 30.
The administration has yet to name a labor relations director to negotiate for the city. But a senior aide to the Mayor said yesterday that an appointment would be made soon.
Mr. Dinkins's $27.8 billion preliminary budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1 calls for $550 million in new taxes, plus hundreds of millions in service cuts and productivity measures to close a budget gap of more than $1 billion caused by unexpectedly large shortfalls in tax revenues.

HEADLINE: Taxes May Increase, Trenton Warns

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Florio administration said today that the state faces a $550 million deficit this fiscal year and that the Governor is contemplating tax increases despite his pledge as a candidate last year that none were needed.
The State Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, said that the administration was reviewing not only tax increases to balance the budget but also cuts in programs and layoffs.
Mr. Berman attributed the shortfall to a weakening economy and to overly optimistic and misleading budget projections by Gov. Jim Florio's Republican predecessor, Thomas H. Kean. Mr. Florio is a Democrat. 
But during the campaign a number of budget experts said Mr. Florio and his Republican opponent, Representative Jim Courter, were ignoring evidence that indicated the state did not have enough money to reach June 30, the end of the fiscal year.
 
'This Was Not Unexpected'
''This was not unexpected,'' said Senator Laurence S. Weiss, a Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee. ''I sounded warning signals more than a year ago when the Kean spending plan was presented to the Legislature.''
New Jersey's Constitution requires that the budget, which totals more than $12 billion, be balanced by the end of the fiscal year.
Mr. Berman said that all three major taxes in the state had fallen far short of the expectations in Mr. Kean's last budget. He said the sales tax had fallen $256 million short, the income tax $276 million and the corporation tax $172 million. Other taxes, he said, were $26 million short of expectations.
The state is also facing about $120 million in expenses not accounted for in the state budget, including additional funds for welfare, Medicaid and correction programs as well as a new union contract with state workers.
Those calculations leave the state $850 million worse off than the Kean budget had predicted.
The Kean budget had planned a $300 million surplus at the end of the fiscal year. To have a balanced budget, Mr. Berman said, the administration must find $550 million in cuts or additional revenue by June 30.
''Additional spending cuts are contemplated, but I am not sure that would be sufficient on its own,'' Mr. Berman said. ''Almost any tax option you can think of is under discussion.''
As a partial explanation for revenue problems, Mr. Berman referred to statistics indicating that unemployment may be rising in New Jersey while it has declined nationally.
 
Democrats Fault Kean's Budget
Mr. Berman, who served as Mr. Florio's campaign manager last year, said the Democratic candididate depended on Mr. Kean's budget figures when he repeatedly told voters that he saw no need for tax increases.
Some leading Republicans charged that the Florio administration was trying to make the budget look far worse than it is, to enact tax increases.
The Republicans said that Mr. Florio's projections failed to include $62 million in savings from a hiring freeze that Governor Kean imposed last year and that the administration had suddenly reduced projections for the growth of income-tax revenues.
'The administration wants to give us the very worst budget scenario it can,'' said Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a Republican Assemblyman, ''in order to give Governor Florio the wiggle room he needs to get out of this campaign promise of no new taxes.''

HEADLINE: New Cruiser to Replace The Iowa at Base on S.I.

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
The nation's newest fighting ship, the guided-missile cruiser Normandy, will replace the Iowa as the flagship of the Navy group to be based at its new base in Stapleton, S.I., the Navy announced yesterday.
The Iowa, commissioned in 1944, will be mothballed in an economy drive by the Defense Department. The Normandy was launched in 1988 and commissioned two months ago. 
The change will drastically reduce the number of crew members on the base's main ship. The 887-foot Iowa has a crew of 1,500, and the 567-foot Normandy has 367.
The Staten Island Borough President, former Representative Guy V. Molinari, a Republican, said the economic impact of the reduction would be eased by an eventual increase in other jobs at the base. He said at least five support vessels would be stationed at Stapleton - three destroyers and two frigates.
 
Controversy Since 1983
The base and the deployment of the battleship Iowa were announced in 1983. Supporters cited the economic advantages of having six or more major Navy vessels in the city, with their crews, families and hundreds of supporting civilian workers.
Opponents cited the nuclear threat posed by accidents aboard the ships, all of which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, or by an enemy attack on the vessels in the port. A spokesman for the Coalition for a Nuclear Free Harbor, Michael Immerso, said the Normandy and at least one support ship would ''carry the same Tomahawk cruise missiles as the Iowa.'' The Navy has not confirmed or denied that the ships would be armed with nuclear weapons.
Although former Mayor Edward I. Koch strongly supported the base, Mayor David N. Dinkins has opposed it from the start on the ground of safety.
''The Mayor's opposition is longstanding and continues,'' a spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, Clifford Chanin, said yesterday. ''He has certain concerns that need to be resolved, and the presence of this ship is not one way or the other going to resolve them.''
 
Number of Jobs in Question
Mr. Molinari said the Federal Government would spend an estimated $387 million a year to operate the port. He predicted that it would use 4,500 Navy workers and 900 civilian employees. Theirs incomes would in turn generate thousands of civilian jobs, Mr. Molinari said.
Mr. Immerso said that the number of jobs at the base was inflated and that many of them would be taken by the spouses of Navy workers, and not by local workers. Navy dependents would have at least 300 of the 900 civilian jobs, he predicted.
The Normandy, cruising the Caribbean, is to arrive in New York in August. The other ships are to arrive over the next year, Mr. Molinari said.
Built at the Bath (Me.) Iron Works, the Normandy is a Ticonderoga class cruiser armed with hundreds of missiles. She also has the Aegis electronic weapons-control system.

HEADLINE: Poll Detects Erosion of Positive Attitudes Toward Japan Among Americans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The percentage of Americans expressing negative views of Japan has increased significantly in recent months, according to the latest Times/CBS News Poll as well as additional interviews with ordinary Americans and leading Japan watchers.
It is not the widespread presence of Japanese consumer goods that is the problem. Even many Americans who concede that they also drive a Honda or listen to a Sony Walkman. The rise in unfriendly feelings appears to be fueled by two other factors: the purchase of American institutions like Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures by Japanese investors and the end of the cold war with the Soviet Union as a focus of attention.
It is the trend, more than the raw numbers, that has alarmed some politicians and political analysts. Sixty-seven percent of those polled still say they have generally friendly feelings toward Japan, according to a Times/ CBS News Poll of 1,557 Americans taken by telephone Jan. 13-15. That is down from 74 percent in a CBS News Poll last June and 87 percent in a Times/CBS News Poll in 1985. 
 
Rise in Unfriendliness
A quarter of Americans now say their feelings about Japan are ''generally unfriendly,'' up from 19 percent last June and 8 percent in 1985, the latest Times/CBS News Poll found. The newest increase comes after several years in which unfriendly opinion was essentially stable. To be statistically significant, a shift in poll findings must be at least three percentage points.
''There is a real erosion in the popular mood about Japan,'' said Prof. Gerald Curtis, an East Asia expert at Columbia University.
In follow-up interviews after the poll, Americans made it clear that highly visible Japanese investments here are feeding an anxiety that Americans are losing control of their own country and culture. Furthermore, the collapse of the Soviet bloc has freed them from their fears of Communism and allowed them to turn their anxieties toward what they see as their own nation's slipping economic strength.
Experts on Japan like Richard C. Holbrooke, who was President Jimmy Carter's Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, said the results of the latest polls were ominous and could seriously complicate an already difficult relationship between Washington and Tokyo.
Even around Portland, Ore., an area that has prospered on trade with the Pacific rim, Representative Les AuCoin says he is hearing protectionist sentiment from corporate executives and other people who a few years ago sang the praises of free trade.
 
Pressure on Politicians
The rising anxieties are already increasing the pressure for stronger rhetoric on trade issues, politicians reported. That could well fuel the growing resentments in Japan toward Americans while raising expectations here for economic improvements, a cycle that, as Representative AuCoin pointed out, could make it that much harder for political leaders in both countries to agree on the economic actions needed to solve the very problems that have provoked the anxieties in the first place.
''You have a dynamic in both countries that brings out the worst in both,'' said Mr. AuCoin, a Democrat. ''There can only be catastrophe at the end of that unless something comes out and turns it around.''
At the Republican White House and in the Democratic Congress there is considerable awareness of these trends. President Bush, in his State of the Union Message on Wednesday, and Speaker Thomas S. Foley, in the Democratic response, used strikingly similar language to proclaim their commitment to free but fair trade. The Democrats have made a strategic decision to stress ''economic competitiveness'' as one of their major political themes this year, and Mr. Bush stressed the theme in appearances on Friday and Saturday.
Older Americans, those with more direct memories of World War II, are more likely than younger ones to express negative views toward Japan. But nearly one in five younger Americans now say they have an unfavorable view.
 
Fears Voiced in Colorado
When Jennifer Albright of Denver buys a ticket on the ski lift, she frets that the money is leaving Colorado and going to the resort's new owners, in Japan, she said.
''I think they're buying up a lot of the United States,'' said Ms. Albright, a 25-year-old accountant for a printing company in Denver. Ms. Albright made her comments in an interview in the poll and expanded on her answer a few days later. ''I know they are here in Colorado. We've lost several ski resorts and real estate properties. It seems like they're investing a lot of money in our country and not letting us do that in theirs. It seems the United States isn't reinvesting in our own country and we're letting other countries buy us up. Bush needs to do something to stop it.''
Such sentiments were a major topic at a recent series of strategy sessions among leading Democrats, who spoke about the talks but asked not to be identified. One leading party strategist said the nation's attitudes were at an important crossroads. The question is whether politicians can channel economic anxieties into productive policy without fueling dangerous protectionist or nationalistic sentiments.
 
Warning by Democratic Strategist
''It's such a strong chord in the thinking of Americans that if it's not channeled positively it could become a very negative view quickly,'' said the Democratic strategist. ''Get a couple more instances of Japanese buying Rockefeller Center and there's an opportunity for someone who's dangerous to manipulate that anxiety and fear.''
The latest rise in antagonism toward Japan coincides neatly with the decline in fear of the Russians and the soaring popularity of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in this country. But the response is more complicated than a simple replacement of one foreign enemy with another; what Americans themselves make clear is that the end of the cold war has freed them to worry about other problems.
''The Russians aren't the threat they used to be,'' said Anthony Peone, 39, of Brockport, N.Y. ''We ought to quit subsidizing Japan. We have troops there. We have bases there. I don't have any kind of racial hangup. I think they just ought to pay their own way. There really isn't much of an excuse to keep up all of these military bases.''
Mr. Peone was an electronics technician at General Electric, but agreed to leave and take a severance settlement when the company cut back operations, a cutback for which he partly blames competition from Japan. He is now training to be a computer programmer, a job he believes is better insulated from Japanese competition. ''I don't think they're going to send their programmers over,'' he said.
Interestingly, there was very little regional variation in attitudes toward Japan. More affluent or better educated people were somewhat more likely to express friendly attitudes.
''I have to give them credit for being astute and recovering from defeat and building themselves an empire - a financial empire,'' said Homer Plimpton, a stockbroker from western Pennsylvania. He said that his feelings toward Japan were generally friendly but that he had heard others express fears that Japan was buying out America. ''They've got a long way to go to do that,'' he said.
 
Ambivalence in Assessment
Professor Curtis and others note that the feelings of Americans toward Japan are ambiguous and ambivalent. Many Americans concede that much of the blame for the nation's economic troubles can be found here at home. ''I think a lot of it is unfair competition,'' said Talmadge Fort, 39, a New Jersey auto worker. ''But I also think a lot of it is bad management.''
Mr. Fort said a heated argument had broken out at a recent union meeting in Linden ''about not buying Japanese cars.'' He recalled the debate: ''O.K., you might not buy the cars. But what about the stereos, the radios, the sneakers?''
He said the union local's president had argued for a boycott on all Japanese products. But, Mr. Fort said, ''When they started coming up with lists, there is no way of getting around buying.''
Ms. Albright drives to the ski slopes in a Japanese car, and Mr. Peone said he bought what he thought was an American-made refrigerator only to discover that all its internal works were made by Mitsubishi.
Some Japanese politicians and writers, noting that the British, not the Japanese, are the largest overseas investors in the United States, have perceived racial causes in the far stronger reaction toward Japan. In follow-up interviews after the Times-CBS poll, several respondents volunteered that they were motivated by economics not prejudice.
 
Resentment at Town Meetings
Mr. AuCoin says he sees prejudice at town hall meetings in his district ''in which somebody will stick their hand up and express some form of resentment about valedictorians in graduating class being those non-Americans, by which they mean Asians.''
''There is obviously a racism intertwined in this, and it's very troubling,'' he said.
Mr. AuCoin said increasing antagonism toward Japan has become apparent in his northeast Oregon Congressional district. Oregon, he notes, actually has a trade surplus with Japan, thanks to agricultural exports. And Japanese high-tech companies have actually brought jobs to, not taken them from, his district.
Yet when Mr. AuCoin, who has opposed restrictive trade bills, polled his constituents last year to ask how they would feel about a candidate who supported fees and limits on imports from countries with unfair trade practices, 73 percent said they would look favorably on such a candidate. Fourteen percent said unfavorably.
''That is absolutely astounding for this Congressional district,'' he said in his Washington office. ''If it's happening there, imagine what they're saying in Detroit.''

Splish-Splash
To be perfectly discreet, you wouldn't wear a bathing suit to work, unless you're Greg Louganis. Or would you? Liza Bruce, the London-based designer who is introducing a line of swimwear-inspired sportswear for spring, thinks nothing of it.
''Swimwear is no longer swimwear,'' Ms. Bruce said shortly before showing her new collection at Barneys New York last week. She wore a low-cut, glove-tight black jumpsuit, with chiffon blouse, both from her line. Not the kind of thing to wear to work, but definitely O.K. for lunch at Le Madri. 
''It's based on the idea of the swimsuit removed from the beach,'' she said. Ms. Bruce is well-known for sexy, skimpy bathing suits, many of them with a trademark crinkly Lycra fabric, for that wet Fortuny look. But for a designer interested in fashion, the swimsuit business has its limits.
''The swimwear market is controlled by the major department stores,'' she said. ''Everything is on wheels,'' which is industry slang for the practice of returning merchandise to a manufacturer if it doesn't sell quickly.
Swimsuits use barely a half-yard of fabric and are often made with straight seams, so the cost is low and the profit potential is high. But since they take up the same amount of space on sales racks as street clothing, and prices are typically no higher than $100, they have to sell fast for retailers to realize the same profits per square foot.
There is also a limited number of units that can be sold at the designer end, which, as you may have noticed, makes swimsuits for female figures that exist primarily in dreams.
With the multitude of cover-ups and wraps that accompany swimwear these days, it is only a small step for a designer to move into sportswear. The catsuit, or stretch jumpsuit, has become a staple of a number of designer collections, including those by Donna Karan, Norma Kamali and Vivienne Westwood.
Ms. Bruce's set of Lycra coordinates, in the Co-Op store of Barneys New York, includes stretch leggings, high-waisted skirts, bandeaus, bicycle pants and Rudi Gernreich-inspired 60's jackets.
''We are finally acknowledging that the 60's look was the closest we have yet come to expressing female emancipation in terms of fashion,'' Ms. Bruce said. Shamask's Back in Style ''My name is my name,'' said Ronaldus Shamask, sounding vaguely like Popeye while looking out over the poop deck of the Morgans Hotel in Manhattan. Mr. Shamask, who is back in the design business after several months of legal wrangling over the rights to his name, showed his fall men's wear collection in a penthouse suite at the Morgans last week.
The big plaid Clint Eastwood ponchos and unconstructed three-button jackets were a hit with store buyers. After a one-season absence, he will show a women's collection on the runway in New York in April.
 
Celebrating Barcelona
The Barcelona style in art, design and fashion will be showcased when a group from the Catalan region of Spain take over the State Armory at 26th Street and Lexington Avenue for a three-week cultural exhibition.
The exhibit, which includes architecture, painting, sculpture, photography and textiles, begins with a fashion show Thursday evening at 8, with clothes by six designers: Armand Basi, Estrella G., Roser Marce, Antonio Miro, Margarita Nuez, and Lemur. (Sybilla, perhaps the best known of the Barcelona fashion designers, will not be represented. She now manufactures and shows her collections in Italy.) The exhibition is sponsored by the government of Catalan, in northeast Spain. Since joining the European Economic Community in 1986, the Spanish Government has been aggressively supporting businesses that enter international markets, said Sheelagh D'Arcy Hinds, whose marketing company, SD'H International, organized the New York event.
''This is why we're seeing so much going on in Spain the last couple of years,'' she said. ''Just as we looked to Milan 10 years ago, now we're looking to Barcelona.''
 
Leave of Absence
Who says fashion people are totally driven? Emily Cinader, the designing mind behind the J. Crew catalog, is taking a six-month sabbatical from the company, she said yesterday. Ms. Cinader is looking for a house in Los Angeles, to be with her fiance, Cary Woods, who was recently named the executive vice president of Columbia Entertainment, the movie company.
''I'll still be giving plenty of input into the company,'' said Ms. Cinader, the president of J. Crew Inc. and its chief designer. ''It's not a permanent change.''
 
Planning an AIDS Benefit
The Council of Fashion Designers of America, which holds its annual awards gala tonight at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has been working quietly on plans for a major AIDS benefit, some members said last week.
Instead of another glittery charity ball, the council is considering a huge auction or sale of designer clothing at the armory on Lexington Avenue.
''We're studying the feasibility of that and a thousand other ideas,'' said Carolyne Roehm, the president of the C.F.D.A. ''Right now I'm just trying to get through tonight. I'm thinking of doing a straitjacket in diamonds for myself.''
The guest list for the awards dinner has gotten so crowded, Ms. Roehm said, she has had to eliminate the dance floor to accommodate more tables.

Saving the Landfills

 BODY:
Crab scraps are being converted into high-quality compost in an effort to solve an expensive waste disposal problem. The pilot project in Perry, Fla., uses cypress sawdust, yard waste and bark to convert the smelly crab scraps into marketable compost.
The annual crab harvest on Florida's Gulf Coast yields 16 million pounds of blue crabs, 3,000 tons of which become waste. Crab scraps, made up of exoskeletons and viscera, account for 30 percent of landfill material in the Florida panhandle region, and consume up to a quarter of the money set aside for solid waste management. 
''Composting is a way to alleviate the economic burden of landfills,'' said William Brinton Jr., an agricultural chemist and president of the Woods End Research Laboratory of Mount Vernon, Me., which is directing the project. ''The counties run the landfills and are liable for the waste. They want to develop this as an option to keep their crab processors happy.''
The project, begun on Nov. 9, has already converted 500 tons of crab scraps into 1,000 tons of nutrient-rich compost. Cypress sawdust is blended with the scraps in a precise ratio and then turned each day by a special composting machine. Bacteria in the mixture grow at a rate capable of heating the pile up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. After 40 days the resulting soil is clean and odor-free.
''Each week about 65 tons of crab scraps are blended at the site with 125 tons of forest product residue,'' Mr. Brinton said. ''The piles placed end to end would be 1 mile long, 6 feet high, and 12 feet deep.''
The county will sell the compost for $30 to $40 a ton. Current compost prices in New England range from $50 to $300 per ton.
Results of the project have persuaded other Gulf Coast counties to request similar pilot projects. The project is being financed by a grant from the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation.

HEADLINE: Ex-Im Bank Resumes Aid to China

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Export-Import Bank, an agency of the Federal Government that provides credit to the customers of American exporters, has made its first loan to China since the military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in June, bank officials said today.
The loan is believed to be the first to China by any Western lending agency since June.
The $9.75 million loan to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was signed in Washington on Friday. Wary of criticism by those who believe its China policies have been too lenient, the Administration did not announce the action. 
Last month, Beijing lifted martial law, and the Bush Administration responded by easing some sanctions against China, including ending its blanket opposition to World Bank loans to China.
Bank officials said the loan, which is for 10 years at an annual interest rate of 8.3 percent, had been approved after a determination by the bank's board that the American company would lose the contract without the Government financing. Administration proposals to reduce the operations of the bank have drawn criticism from business leaders who are concerned about the loss of such export sales. [Page D8.] The new loan will enable the Chinese oil company to finance engineering services for a gas processing plant that the Chinese state enterprise is buying from McDermott International Inc. The plant is near the Bohai Gulf.
McDermott, based in New Orleans, has annual revenues of $2.4 billion and employs 2,800 workers, selling, among other things, oil and gas equipment and services. Much of its business is overseas.
World Bank officials said their board will take up two China loans on Thursday, one for $60 million for agricultural projects in Jiangxi province in eastern China, and one for $30 million for earthquake reconstruction in Shanxi and Hubei provinces in north China.
The actions of both the Export-Import Bank and the World Bank come against a backdrop of sharp Congressional criticism of the Administration's policies on China. Congressional critics argue that the Administration has been too willing to ease sanctions in the absence of significant improvement of human rights policies by Beijing.
Some officials said today that the United States might approve only the earthquake reconstruction loan because this would have the least political repercussions.
The Export-Import Bank makes loans at subsidized interest rates to foreign customers of American companies. It also guarantees export loans that commercial banks may make. For most of its loans, the bank looks for a guarantor, in case the money is not repaid. The guarantor usually is the national bank of the country receiving the goods.
In this case, the guarantor is Mitsui & Company, a giant Japanese trading concern that has close commercial relations with the Chinese oil enterprise and with McDermott.
Bank officials said a guarantee by a commercial enterprise in a third country was unusual but not unprecedented. ''Mitsui offered the guarantee, and it certainly has the money,'' one bank official said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Productivity Rises By Only 0.2% in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
American workers' productivity rose a barely perceptible two-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter, while hourly labor costs rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent, the Government said today.
For the year, nonfarm productivity, defined as the output per hour of work, was up only slightly more, by nine-tenths of a percent; it was the worst showing since the 1981-82 recession. Hourly labor costs for 1989 jumped 5.5 percent, the Government said. 
The annual increase in nonfarm productivity was less than half of the 2 percent gain recorded in 1988.
 
'A Recipe for Trouble'
While attributing part of last year's poor performance to an overall slowdown in economic growth, analysts worried that the combination of weak growth in productivity and higher labor costs would further weaken America's ability to compete internationally.
''That's a recipe for trouble,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company. It is symptomatic, he added, ''of an economy that is near the end of expansion.''
The Labor Department report showed that while productivity was slumping, hourly labor costs - an important measure of inflation for businesses - increased significantly. The 5.5 percent increase was up from 4.7 percent in 1988 and was the biggest increase since 1982.
''Labor cost increases are probably the scariest part of the report,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm.
 
White House View
At the White House, the Administration spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, pinned the slight productivity increase in the quarter on the overall slowdown of the economy. The pace of economic expansion, as measured by the gross national product, grew by a rate of five-tenths of a percent in the last three months of 1989, the slowest growth for any quarter since 1986.
''The small productivity gains last year probably reflect the transition to a more moderate pace of economic growth rather than a general weakening in productivity,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''Productivity gains often fall off sharply when output growth slows.''
Output in the nonfarm sector was up 3.3 percent in 1989, while the number of hours worked rose by 2.4 percent, accounting for the nine-tenths of a percent increase in productivity.
 
Debate Over Productivity
The report seemed certain to revive the debate over America's lagging productivity.
Since the end of the 1981-82 recession, growth in productivity has averaged 1.8 percent a year. While a slight improvement over the 1.2 percent average growth rate of the 1970's, that was still far below the 3.3 percent annual rates of the two decades after World War II, when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a rising standard of living.
Improved productivity is considered esssential to improving living standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their output rises, without the risk of higher inflation.
In addition to the large rise in hourly compensation, the report indicated that unit labor costs, another important factor in determining future price inflation, shot up 4.6 percent for the year, compared with a 2.7 increase in 1988. Unit labor costs reflect changes in compensation as well as changes in productivity.

HEADLINE: Honda Asked To Sell Jeeps To Japanese

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company said today that the Chrysler Corporation had asked it to sell Jeep recreational vehicles in Japan, and some Honda officials hinted that they were likely to strike an agreement soon.
Japan's leading economic daily, Nihon Keizei Shimbun, reported today that Honda expected Jeep sales to reach 5,000 to 6,000 vehicles a year. A Honda spokesman said no figures had been calculated because no agreement had been reached. 
Chrysler's talks with Honda are another sign that its long relationship with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation may be coming apart.
 
Poor Sales in Japan
Chrysler's performance in Japan has been dismal. The company owns four exclusive dealerships; two are in Tokyo, where Chrysler Japan Sales has built large showrooms in expensive areas of the city. In addition, there are 43 independent dealerships around Japan that carry Chrysler cars in addition to other models.
For all that, Chrysler sold 970 cars in Japan last year, according to industry statistics, and 260 Jeep Wranglers, which are classified in Japan as trucks.
Chrysler's future in Japan has taken on particular interest here, because Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman and chief executive of the company, has been the most outspoken American auto executive about barriers in the Japanese market. Last year, he suggested in a television interview that was widely rebroadcast here that he would ''knock heads'' if allowed to compete directly in Japan with Japanese auto makers.
 
Reduced Stake in Mitsubishi
So far, Chrysler's main affiliation in Japan has been with Mitsubishi, a second-tier auto maker in which Chrysler once held a 25 percent stake. In September, apparently to raise cash, Chrysler reduced its stake to 12 percent and took a $310 million profit.
At the time, Mr. Iacocca said the company's ties with Mitsubishi would remain ''as strong as ever.'' The two companies have a joint venture in Diamond-Star Motors, whose plant in Normal, Ill., builds the Plymouth Laser, Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon specialty sports coupes. Mitsubishi also builds more than a half-million V-6 engines for Chrysler each year, and Chrysler dealers sell several Mitsubishi car and truck models.
Still, there have been frequent reports that the relationship between the companies has become strained. Mitsubishi is said to have recently turned down Chrysler's request to sell its cars through Mitsubishi dealerships.
 
Frequent Complaints
At the same time, Chrysler has repeatedly complained that Japanese car dealerships are closed to it, largely because most Japanese companies - Toyota and Nissan in particular - compete with Chrysler's Jeeps for the booming market here in off-road vehicles. Honda, in contrast, offers no off-road models and thus has nothing to lose.
Mitsubishi Motors executives make no secret of their distaste for Mr. Iacocca's remarks about how the United States should take a hard line against Japan on trade issues. And there has been widespread speculation about whether Chrysler would turn to Mitsubishi or other Japanese car makers for help - or to buy part of its operations - should Chrysler's American sales outlook worsen.
Chrysler has laid off thousands of workers and closed several plants in recent months, and it announced last week that in the fall it would reduce its car-making capacity by 20 percent and lay off 3,700 more workers.

HEADLINE: Plan to Cut Ex-Im Bank Draws Business Protest

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Budget decisions by the Bush Administration to reduce the operations of the Export-Import Bank have drawn loud protests from business supporters of the Administration, as well as from some lawmakers.
Indeed, Congress may well increase the bank's lending authority beyond the level of the budget request.
The 57-year-old Export-Import Bank provides direct credit, insurance, loan guarantees, working capital guarantees and other programs for hundreds of exporters, big and little. The help represents a subsidy for business, since the credit made available to the buyer of the goods abroad is at below-market levels for interest rates. 
In defending the proposed reductions, Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, says the Export-Import Bank was an example of what he called ''hidden Pac-Men.'' He used the phrase to describe situtations in which a mechanism was in place to spring forward and consume future resources.
The proposed cutbacks would reduce the bank's most heavily used program, which makes direct loans to customers overseas who buy American exports. Critics of President Bush's budget say the proposals underscore a gap between policy rhetoric and substance.
These people say that while the Administration acknowledges the trade deficit as a major problem, its actions weaken Government financial support for exports at a time when similar programs are being strengthened by most other industrial countries.
 
N.A.M. Official Critical
''When our competitors are going opposite ways, you have to wonder how seriously we are taking exporting,'' said Howard Lewis, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
Bruce B. Talley, executive director of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, which represents exporting corporations, trade unions and state governors, commented, ''The cutbacks are an invitation to American companies to go offshore.''
C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury official who is now director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy organization, said, ''We're losing billions of dollars a year in exports because of the inadequacy of Government finance.''
The budget proposals called for cutting the Export-Import Bank's direct-loan program by 18 percent.
 
Reserve Set Up
Sometimes the bank's loans go sour. Earlier this month the bank established a $4.8 billion reserve to cover possible losses on loans and loan guarantees made in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
The reserve is equivalent to 40 percent of both the bank's outstanding loans and its outstanding guarantee and insurance claims. Bank officials say the action does not mean the loans have been written off. They say they continue to expect all loans and guarantees to be paid in full.
 
High-Tech Involved
Many of the bank's transactions involve high technology and speciality goods and services from smaller companies. The products include CAT scanners, telecommunications ground stations, air navigation equipment, computer software, wood products and even iced soft-shell crabs, now being shipped daily by plane to Tokyo from Chesapeake Bay.
Nearly 30 percent of Export-Import Bank transactions help small and medium-sized businesses, like Sattel of Van Nuys, Calif., which designs satellite communications systems and has just sold one to Indonesia. Ten years ago, bank figures show, the comparable number was 5 to 6 percent.
Increasing use of the bank's resources by small business has heightened political sensitivity over the cutbacks in the direct lending program.
 
Senate Panel's Warning
In a legislative report in September, the Senate Appropriations Committee told Mr. Darman ''not to repeat the mistake of asking for inadequate funding of this program, thereby forcing the Congress to cut programs which the Administration supports in order to fund this vital activity in support of U.S. exports.''
The new budget calls for $500 million of direct loans, down from $612 million authorized in the current fiscal year. In the last year of the Carter Administration direct loans totaled $5.5 billion. In the late Carter years the United States was actually running a trade surplus. More recently the annual trade deficit has been exceeding $100 billion.
John D. Macomber, six months on the job as Export-Import Bank chairman and a friend of Mr. Bush, denies that the institution has been weakened.
In an interview, he noted that comparisons should be made not with the $612 million that Congress authorized for the current fiscal year but with zero in direct lending proposed in the last Reagan budget.
The Reagan budget directors, David A. Stockman and later James C. Miller 3d, exhibited little sympathy for the bank, arguing that it provided a large subsidy for a tiny fraction of exports.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs I.M.F. Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The United States is willing to accept an increase of up to 50 percent in assessments for the International Monetary Fund, the Treasury Department said today.
Negotiations over raising the quotas paid to the I.M.F. by its 152 member countries have been going on for several months. The United States had previously said it would accept a quota increase of 45 percent.
Negotiators are still divided on a proposal by the United States for the I.M.F. to sell some of its gold reserves to help make up nearly $4 billion in late payments owed to the fund by 11 countries.
The I.M.F., set up after World War II, uses its cash to make loans to countries with balance-of-payments problems, usually in conjunction with economic restructuring plans.
A Treasury spokesman today confirmed a report in The Financial Times of London that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had formally shifted the American position to accept an increase of up to 50 percent in the quotas.

HEADLINE: Visitors to U.S. Expected To Increase 75% in Decade

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The number of visitors to the United States will increase more than 75 percent by the end of the decade from last year's 38 million visitors, the Commerce Department said today.
Travel by Americans has remained fairly constant for the last two years, so the nation's $350 billion-a-year travel industry is counting on international traffic for growth. The Commerce Department's projection, announced at a tourism and travel conference in Washington this week, said that by the year 2000 the United States is expected to play host to 67 million visitors a year. 
Last year, for the first time, tourists spent more in the United States, $43 billion, than American travelers spent abroad, $42.6 billion, giving the United States a slight travel surplus in the balance of trade calculations. That surplus, the Commerce Department said, is expected to triple this year, to $1.48 billion.
 
Weak Dollar Expected
The projections, released by Rockwell A. Schnabel, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism, are based on computer models of the strength of foreign economies and estimates that the value of the dollar will continue to be fairly weak.
The weakness of the dollar accounts for much of the increase of foreign visitors, Mr. Schnabel said, but he cited other factors, particularly the intensive promotions by hotels, airlines and city, state and Federal governments.
Another factor in the growth is the change in Eastern Europe. ''There is a tremendous pent-up demand in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to travel here,'' he said.
''They are interested in our philosophy: look at what happened with McDonald's,'' he added, referring to the throngs of people jamming Moscow's first McDonald's restaurant, which opened last week.
On the other side of the equation, the number of Americans traveling abroad continued to taper off last year, growing only 1 percent from 1988, to 41.3 million. And domestic travel by Americans was relatively flat. Trips of more than 100 miles from home increased by only 3 percent, to 1.3 million.
Although international visitors provide only about 10 percent of travel revenue today, they are expected to provide much of the growth in the 1990's, said Don Wynegar, director of the Office of Research at the Travel and Tourism Administration, part of the Commerce Department.
And while most of the international visitors to the United States come from Canada and Mexico, the number of Japanese and British visitors has grown significantly in the last five years, Mr. Wynegar said. During the next decade, he said, there will be large increases in the number of visitors from South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and Australia.

Moscow and Pretoria News Lifts Precious Metals Prices

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Precious metals prices continued to rise yesterday in reaction to developments in South Africa and the Soviet Union. Dealers said a further decline in the dollar against the yen and the West German mark also bolstered the gold market.
At the close of the Commodity Market in New York, the spot February gold delivery settled at $422.40 an ounce, up $4.20 on the day, while the same silver contract gained 2.2 cents an ounce, at $5.329. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, spot February platinum rose $3.20 an ounce, to $512. 
''Gold always thrives on uncertainty as well as when the value of paper money declines,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''And Soviet President Gorbachev's proposals to end the Communist Party's monopoly on political power has raised the possibility of turmoil there.''
 
Exchanging Paper Money
As it is, deteriorating economic and political conditions in the Soviet Union, a major producer of gold and platinum, have led many people there to exchange paper money for precious metals and stones.
Ms. Raptopoulos said the gold market views the recent announcements of reforms in South Africa as positive over the long term. Should the reforms help improve South Africa's worsening economy, it could reduce that country's need to sell or use its precious metals as collateral for loans.
After President F. W. de Klerk announced last week that the African National Congress would be legalized, the prices of Krugerrand gold coins rose, Ms. Raptopoulos noted.
 
Krugerrands at a Discount
The coins used to be the most popular form of investing in gold. But South Africa's racial policies led many countries, including the United States, to ban the import of Krugerrands several years ago. With the subsequent proliferation of other popular gold coins, like Canada's Maple Leafs, American Eagles, Mexican pesos and China's Pandas, Krugerrands began to sell at a discount of up to $5 an ounce from the spot price.
Since the reforms were proposed by President de Klerk, the price of Krugerrands has moved to parity with most other bullion coins. The Pandas command a premium because many investors consider them the most esthetically attractive of the popular gold coins. They are also produced in smaller quantities each year than other bullion coins of comparable value.

Job Outlook For Middle Managers

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WHEN middle managers lose their jobs, do they have reason to be optimistic or pessimistic about their chances of finding new positions these days? Even experts on the job market cannot agree.
''It has never looked better for middle management and business,'' Nancy Kovalcheck, a spokeswoman for Management Recruiters International, a large nationwide contingency search firm, said last week. ''More jobs are being created than can be filled.''
But Lynda C. McDermott, who heads a small consulting firm, Equipro International Inc., in New York, has a different view. ''We have a glut of middle managers, especially in the Northeast, believe me,'' she said. ''A surplus of middle-level employees for too few jobs is leading to slower career growth and slower upward mobility for those who remain in middle-management slots after downsizings.'' 
Ms. Kovalcheck supports her brighter view with the results of a survey by the firm as well as figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating an unemployment rate for middle managers of only 1.9 percent, compared with 5.3 percent for the population as a whole.
The survey showed that of 2,700 company responses, only 11.8 percent planned cutbacks in the first half, while 51 percent said they would maintain current middle-management work forces and 36 percent planned to add middle managers.
''If anything, there's going to be a crisis in the 1990's about finding people to fill middle-management positions,'' she said. She defines middle managers as those earning $30,000 to $75,000.
Nearly every day, newspapers carry announcements about corporate revampings that end up eliminating middle-manager positions. Affected companies have included Eastman-Kodak, I.B.M., McGraw-Hill, Gillette, A.T.&T., Merrill Lynch and Pitney-Bowes.
Dan Lacey of Lacey & Company in Lakewood, Ohio, a consultant who follows employment prospects, agrees with Ms. McDermott. ''Unlike the blue-collar employment bloodbath that hit old-line industries at the beginning of the 1980's,'' he said, ''this one is striking hardest at middle managers in advanced-technology companies. Long-term corporate job security is now coming to an end.''
Mr. Lacey added that he foresees years of ''diminishing job opportunities for middle managers'' in terms of salaries and promotions, as well as job openings.
Between the optimistic and pessimistic, the truth will probably be found. It may involve demographics: job losses on Wall Street, and fewer jobs in the computer industry in California and Massachusetts counterbalanced by the need for more managers in some Western and Midwestern states, where business prospects have improved somewhat. Because of these shifts in job opportunities, middle managers should be prepared to relocate.
''Middle managers have to let go of the myth that any job is permanent,'' Ms. McDermott said. ''I advise a middle manager to think of himself or herself as 'Me Inc.,' a business like any other that must consider how best to package the product, which is that person.''
Paul R. Ray Jr., president and chief executive of Paul R. Ray & Company, a global management recruiting company with headquarters in Fort Worth, said, ''The talent pool is greater because of downsizing.''
Recruiting firms that once ignored unemployed managers now will consider them because their clients are more willing to hire displaced managers, he said. ''There is recognition that talented persons have value to add,'' Mr. Ray said.
He predicts a shift toward ''companies reaching lower into middle management'' to award profit sharing incentives because of what he calls ''a corporate fixation on productivity.''
''It has been shown that profit sharing can help boost productivity,'' he said, adding that it can also help assure loyalty among middle managers. As a characteristic, loyalty to one's company has been badly battered by indiscriminate dismissals.
But profit sharing tends to replace salary increases for middle managers while helping to hold down fixed costs. ''We foresee much more pay-for-performance and much more discrimination as far as who gets the extra compensation'' is concerned, he said.

HEADLINE: A $15 Million Penalty for Laundering

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
In the first case involving laundering drug money brought by the United States against a large bank, a Federal judge in Tampa today ordered two subsidiaries of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International to forfeit $15 million, the largest penalty ever assessed against a bank.
Last month, on the eve of the trial, the two principal units of the $20 billion bank, which is based in Luxembourg, agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges of conspiracy and money laundering. Specifically, they admitted that bank officials had engaged in disguising transactions involving funds they knew were the proceeds of cocaine sales in the United States.
The two subsidiaries are the Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A., in Luxembourg, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd., in Grand Cayman. The bank has offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami. 
The plea agreement with the Justice Department called for the bank to be placed on five years' probation and to forfeit more than $14 million it had placed in an escrow account, an amount that with interest has since grown to just over $15 million. The case involves transactions from 1983 to 1988.
 
'Only Sanction Available'
Judge William T. Hodges accepted the plea agreement, which prosecutors said was three times as much as any penalty assessed against a bank in the history of the United States. Judge Hodges said, ''The only sanction available to the court in sentencing corporate defendants is the imposition of a fine or a monetary penalty, as in a forfeiture.''
Some in Congress have criticized the plea agreement as too lenient. Last week four Representatives and two Senators, all Democrats, wrote Judge Hodges suggesting that a larger monetary penalty be considered.
The bank has served as a depository for tens of millions of dollars controlled by the deposed Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Though Mr. Noriega was not mentioned in the indictment, prosecutors said they might introduce evidence about his dealings with the bank in the case. 11 Officials Named Eleven bank officials were named in the indictment. They included a number of regional and country managers, but none were at the highest management levels of the bank. Five officials are now on trial before Judge Hodges on money-laundering charges in a case that is expected to last several months.
The five are: Amjad Awan, head of the Latin American division and a former banker for General Noriega; Syed Aftab Hussain, an officer of the bank in Panama; Akbar A. Bilgrami, an official in the Miami office; Sibte Hassan, an officer of the Paris branch, and Ian Howard, manager of the Paris office.
The bank was founded in 1972 by Middle Eastern and Pakistani investors, and was headed by Agha Hasan Abedi from 1972 to 1988.
 
Review of Licenses
The bank, which operates in 73 countries, faces further scrutiny and publicity after today's sentencing. Foreign and state regulators said they would review the bank's operating licenses in the wake of the plea agreement.
The bank's offices in the United States are licensed by state regulators. In Florida, the guilty plea gives the Comptroller, Gerald Lewis, the authority to revoke the license of the Miami office. Mr. Lewis has already called the plea agreement too lenient, said a spokesman, Terence P. McElroy.
The Luxembourg Monetary Institute will also review the bank's license, which could affect their operations worldwide, but its examination is complicated by legal and jurisdictional factors.
London serves as the bank's biggest base of operations and its de facto headquarters. However, the Bank of England, Britain's central bank, plays a secondary supervisory role because the legal headquarters of the main subsidiaries are in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and the United Arab Emirates, countries that have fewer supervisory resources.
 
Unusual Structure
This unusual structure has caused difficulties for supervisors. The Luxembourg Monetary Institute has primary jurisdiction over the bank, even though it operates ''marginally'' in Luxembourg, said Pierre Jaans, the head of the institute.
In an interview last month, Mr. Jaans said he had been trying for two years to get the bank to ''come to a legal structure that would better fit the economic reality of the bank,'' but he added, ''I can't throw somebody out.''
Mr. Jaans said the institute, consistent with Luxembourg law, would review the bank's license in light of the plea agreement. Professional or ethical fitness figures in such a review, but the issue is complicated because Luxembourg's criminal justice system does not encompass plea bargains. Nor does Luxembourg have the American concept of penal corporate liability, in which a corporation can be held responsible for the actions of its employees.
Luxembourg's review of the bank's license, Mr. Jaans said, will look at these questions: How high up in the organization were the bank officials involved in the wrongdoing? How many officials were involved in the money laundering?
 
'Specific Knowledge'
A transcript shows that Michael Rubinstein, an assistant United States attorney, told Judge Hodges last month that the evidence in the case showed a ''conscious intentional pattern by which the defendants -defendant corporations, their high-level officers, of which had specific knowledge that the funds were the proceeds of cocaine distributions in the United States, proceeded specifically with an eye toward concealing and disguising the nature of the transactions.''
As part of the plea agreement, the bank entered into a consent order with the Federal Reserve, which also has jurisdiction over foreign banks operating in the United States, requiring the bank to improve its record-keeping and screening of customers.
The plea agreement, which requires the bank to cooperate with prosecutors, could lead to more information on General Noriega's financial dealings. A man the Government says was a partner in drug trafficking with General Noriega, Steven M. Kalish, deposited $2 million in drug proceeds into accounts at the bank's office in Panama City in 1983, the indictment said.

HEADLINE: Drug Study Faults Role Of State Dept.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
An internal State Department review has concluded that the agency has not taken its role in the drug war seriously because it is hampered by the complexity of its mission, limited resources and a lack of interest among senior agency officials.
The audit of the department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters confirmed what critics in Congress and other agencies have long said about State Department narcotics policy: that it has taken a back seat to other diplomatic efforts and has been left to the initiative of junior Foreign Service officers.
The findings could prove embarrassing to the Administration as State Department officials prepare for a drug summit meeting on Feb. 15 in Cartagena, Colombia; President Bush and the leaders of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru are to attend.
The national drug strategy announced by President Bush last month states that the bureau is the lead Government agency in coordinating American narcotics policy overseas and the nation's drug assistance programs in other countries. Although the bureau does not take an operational role in those areas, it is charged with coordinating such activities as drug interdiction and crop control in Latin America and other regions. More than half of the bureau's budget is for economic support and other efforts to help the coca-producing countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. 
 
Policies Corrected, Official Says
The audit, which circulated on Capitol Hill last week, also contradicted comments to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday by William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director, that ''the scourge is beginning to pass'' and that ''we are beginning to win'' the war on drugs.
''The war on drugs is by now well known, well documented and disheartening,'' said the audit by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. ''Disheartening because it is being lost and is taking a huge toll in human suffering and exacting a high price in political instability in several source countries.''
Melvyn Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary for International Narcotics Matters, did not dispute key findings in the audit but he said it reflected policies put in place under the Reagan Administration, many of which he had already corrected.
''I'm a little frosted by the inspectors putting out a report,'' Mr. Levitsky said in an interview. He said many of the inspectors' recommendations were his own ideas ''for turning the bureau into something which is decent.''
 
'Poor Job of Managing'
Mr. Levitsky, who became head of the bureau last June, noted that while the report was completed in January, it was based largely on inspections here and in field offices from last July until the fall, before he had time to make changes.
''The department before this Administration had not given drugs its proper priority,'' he said. ''Although there was a lot of rhetoric and a lot of focus on it, they had not gotten the resources together.''
But the audit suggested that many of the problems were entrenched in State Department procedures and could not be quickly reversed.
It found that ''the most consistent theme'' reported by department officials and other Administration and Congressional officials was that ''the Department of State did not assign a high priority to narcotics matters.'' This, the audit said, ''set in motion a cycle of below-average Foreign Service personnel doing a poor job of managing an expensive program with little to show for it, with other foreign policy concerns systematically overriding the narcotics aspect.''
Several times, the audit reported, inspectors witnessed other Administration officials bypassing the narcotics bureau on critical drug-related matters. In one recent case, it said, the head of the bureau was not invited to a meeting between a Deputy Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of Colombia, ''ostensibly because the agenda did not include narcotics.'' The bureau head later had that reversed.
 
Bureau Not Consulted
In another example, the audit said that ''following the assassination of a Colombian presidential candidate, the State Department's press office made several announcements without even consulting'' the narcotics bureau. These slights, the audit asserted, ''are additional items in a long list that reflects low priority for the bureau that is supposed to have the lead on narcotics and, by extension, low priority to narcotics matters in general.''
The audit said that senior agency officials needed to make clear to the American public and foreign leaders that ''they indeed see narcotics trafficking as a threat to national security.'' Another problem cited was the use of bureau planes, which ''are idle unnecessarily for extended periods of time or deployed in reaction to impromptu ambassadorial requests for aviation support.''
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and a member of the Senate Budget Committee, said the audit raises questions about President Bush's proposal to increase the narcotics bureau's budget next year. In a letter last week to James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State, Senator Grassley wrote that ''if this report is true, we are potentially earmarking hundreds of millions of tax dollars for waste and inefficiency in the battle against drugs.''
Mr. Bush has recommended a budget of $150 million for the narcotics bureau in fiscal 1991; the current budget is $113 million.
 
Confusion Over Roles
The audit said that while the bureau's budget had nearly tripled since it was established in 1978, the level of staffing ''has not kept pace with the increasing importance and complexity of its responsibilities.'' The document also found ''confusion over function responsibilities'' in the bureau and a lack of coordination between bureau officials and the embassies.
Moreover, the audit said, the bureau needed to become more active in coordinating intelligence gathering and law enforcement activities. It said the bureau ''should be participating more directly'' in deliberations of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
The report offered 27 recommendations for improving the bureau, from developing a new policy statement to filling new positions to revising many of its operations. Mr. Levitsky said several recommmendations were his own or were already being put into effect.

HEADLINE: For Moscow, Another Winter Of Revolution?

BYLINE: By Leon Aron; Leon Aron is a Soviet specialist at the Heritage Foundation, a research organization.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev's speech to the Central Committee calling for the surrender of the party's monopoly on power signals the onset of a two-month period that promises to be the most significant in Soviet political history since Stalin completed his seizure of power in 1929.
By the end of March, the country, which faces national catastrophe, may well be radically transformed.
Forces beyond anyone's control have been propelling the Soviet Union toward a fork in the road. There are only two turns. First, a true multiparty democracy, with unconditional return of land to the peasants and privatization of the economy. Second, abandonment of glasnost and a return to rigid economic centralization. 
The middle course, perestroika -gradual democratization, gradual and contradictory decentralization of the economy, preservation of a benign one-party dictatorship - no longer satisfies the left or right.
Mr. Gorbachev has long been accused by his radical supporters of being both the Pope and Luther. Now, apparently, he has finally chosen to imitate Luther by urging the party to reject any legal or political advantages and to struggle for power ''strictly in the framework of the democratic process.''
Severely factionalized and thoroughly discredited, the Communist Party has become an albatross around Mr Gorbachev's neck. The pattern of Soviet public opinion in the last two years makes this unmistakably clear. Whenever he has been perceived as under attack by hard-liners, his popularity has soared. Whenever he has been seen as defender of the party, his popular support has plummeted.
Under the circumstances, distancing himself from the party as much as he can is not merely the best way for Mr. Gorbachev to survive politically, it is perhaps the only way.
The potential catastrophe that the country and the leadership faces is cosmic: a near-total breakdown of the economy; a collapse of local party and state authority in the republics and the emergence of a Solidarity-like, rapidly politicizing workers' movement in the major mining regions; food shortages, which in some areas have caused the rationing of even potatoes; inflation, which by unofficial estimates just passed 20 percent and continues climbing; economic and political hostilities between Moscow and national republics, as well as warfare in Azerbaijan, and a rapidly worsening energy crisis.
While radicals push for dramatic reform, hard-liners are bound to seek ways to prolong the one-party dictatorship. They cannot wait any longer. By May, it might be too late to halt, much less reverse, the collapse of the political system, the demise of the Soviet domestic empire and the further evaporation of its former Eastern European holdings.
Four developments may compel the hard-liners to try to strike soon -or vanish from the political scene.
First, the Supreme Soviet (Parliament), which reconvenes this month, is likely to complete, victoriously, the assault Mr. Gorbachev carried forward yesterday on Article 6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the party's ''leading role.''
Second, elections are due in city, district and republic legislatures this month and next. No one doubts that apparat candidates will be swept from power.
Third, by the end of April, newly institutionalized political structures will be in place in key independence-minded ethnic republics following popular elections: in Lithuania on Feb. 24; Moldavia, Feb. 25; the Ukraine, March 4; Latvia and Estonia, March 18, and Georgia, March 25. Declarations of secession from the U.S.S.R. assuredly will follow soon thereafter. By that time, the only means of preserving Moscow's domestic empire would be massive military intervention.
Even the hardest of the hard-liners would think twice about such action. The hostilities in Azerbaijan have brought home to Muscovites the price, in blood and treasure, of preserving the domestic empire. Moreover, the willingness of ethnic Russians to fight to the last soldier to preserve the empire is now seriously in doubt - and certainly the Estonians would not consent to send their young men to keep Uzbekistan in the U.S.S.R.
Finally, by the end of May, multiparty democracies will be institutionalized by popular elections in Hungary, Romania, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. However inconceivable, if Moscow decided to intervene to restore its Eastern European empire, the political and military mechanics of such a reversal would be greatly complicated by the fact that the Soviet armed forces would be overturning the new status quo. Besides, the Kremlin can no longer count on Warsaw Pact forces to cooperate.
If the more than 100,000 demonstrators who marched through Moscow demanding democratic changes on the eve of the crucial Central Committee meeting symbolize the nation's mood, the hard-liners have no future. The awesome aerial photographs of the marchers jammed into Marx Prospekt demonstrated potently how the hopeful populace relishes its opportunity to exploit glasnost to the hilt.
If these marchers and their sympathizers across the nation's 11 time zones do not get their way, Mr. Gorbachev, or his successor, can count on increasingly violent political turmoil and ethnic strife.
The marchers bore their placards aloft through the Russian winter, which traditionally, has been an important ingredient of political upheavals. The Russians tend to rebel in winter - from the Decembrists in 1825, to the Revolution of 1905, to the overthrow of the Czar in 1917. Now, 1989-'90 seems likely to be added to the history books.

HEADLINE: ISRAELIS WIDENING ROLE IN ETHIOPIA

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, Jan. 31

 BODY:
In an effort to support the last non-Arab presence on the Red Sea, Israel has increased its diplomatic and military links with the embattled Marxist-Leninist Government here, diplomats say.
The Government of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam needs to be supported against secessionist rebels in coastal region of Eritrea who would turn the ''Red Sea into the Arab Sea,'' the new Israeli Ambassador here said.
The Eritreans are not Arabs, but Ethiopian and Israeli officials contend that they are supported militarily by Arab governments. The leadership of the rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front is predominantly Christian, but about half the region's population is Muslim, a fact that the Addis Ababa Government has always emphasized. 
Western diplomats say Arab countries sympathetic to the Eritreans have responded to a recent appeal from the rebels, saying that with Israel on the side of Ethiopia, the rebels need help more than ever.
Washington has taken a dim view of Israel's assistance. Some officials say the Israeli help will serve only to prolong the Ethiopian civil war, now nearly three decades old.
 
U.S. View Differs from Israel's
The Ethiopian Government is pressed by rebellions based in Eritrea and Tigre province, divided within itself and practically bankrupt. From Washington's point of view, it appears to be in a terminal stage of collapse and not worth propping up. One American official called the Government a ''dead duck'' and described the strategic value of Ethiopia to the United States as vastly diminished as the Cold War winds down.
Israeli officials, including the new Ambassador here, paint a different picture.
Ambassador Meir Joffe, newly arrived here after a 16-year break in relations, He said it was strategically vital for Israel that the rebels not turn the ''Red Sea into the Arab Sea.''
''You just have to look at a map to see the importance to Israel,'' he said in an interview. If the Eritrean rebels were able to win independence, the Red Sea would be under Arab influence, Mr. Joffe asserted.
He claimed that the rebels get most of their supplies from radical Arab countries, including Libya and Syria. But many Western diplomats agree that the vast majority of the Eritreans' supplies are captured from the Addis Ababa Government.
The Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army, Gen. Dan Shomron, visited Ethiopia last month with an Israeli military delegation to assess Ethiopian needs, Western and East Bloc diplomats based here said.
 
Helping Christians Kill Christians
Already, these diplomats say, Israel is believed to have supplied President Mengistu with cluster bombs for use against the Tigre People's Liberation Front, which is not a separatist movement but rather seeks the overthrow of the Addis Ababa Government.
The State Department has said it has no proof that Israel delivered the bombs, and Israel and Ethiopia have denied the reports. But Western officials here say that descriptions of bombed areas in Wollo province conform with the kind of damage done by cluster bombs.
Military attaches in foreign embassies in Addis Ababa report that several hundred Israeli military trainers have arrived to boost the struggling Ethiopian Army.
An Eastern European diplomat said he had seen an Ethiopian Army brigade in training with Uzis, the Israeli-made assault rifles. Western diplomats say they have had credible reports that the Tigre rebels have captured Uzis from Government soldiers in recent battles. But Israel has denied giving automatic rifles to the Ethiopians.
Israeli officials have acknowledged supplying small arms to the Ethiopian Army. In one account, an Israeli official said that 150,000 bolt-action rifles had been given for militiamen fighting the Tigre insurgency.
The Tigre rebels are Christian Ethiopians, and do not present the Arab threat perceived by the Israelis. But the Tigreans have cooperated with the Eritrean rebels, and it appears that the Israeli Government has decided that its best course is to support the Addis Ababa Government against all challengers.
 
A History of Cooperation
Israeli assistance to Ethiopia is not new. Seeing Ethiopia as a bulwark against a Muslim tide, Israel aided the Government of Emperor Haile Selassie until his ouster in 1973, when relations between the two countries were broken.
Even after the break in relations, informal connections continued between the two countries. When Somalia invaded Ethiopia in 1977, Israel secretly supplied Ethiopia with military assistance, deliveries that were cut when they became public.
From the Ethiopian point of view, the Israeli relationship is helpful not only militarily but also diplomatically. It is through Israel that Ethiopia hopes to persuade Congress to lift the ban on American economic and development aid to Ethiopia.
Representative Mickey Leland, the Texas congressman killed in a plane crash while visiting Ethiopia last year, was hoping to set up an Israeli agricultural project that would be funded in part by American philanthropic interests. These plans are now being pursued by Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat.

HEADLINE: As Shipments of Soviet Grain Lag, Cuba Reduces Daily Bread Ration

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Soviet Union has fallen seriously behind with its promised grain shipments to Cuba, forcing the Government of President Fidel Castro to cut the bread ration and increase some food prices, Western diplomats and other experts say.
At the same time, Cuba has admitted failing to send as much citrus fruit as it promised to the Soviet Union, adding to the widespread food shortages there. Both countries mainly blame a lack of shipping for the slowdown in trade between them.
But experts on Cuba, which by some estimates receives $5 billion a year in Soviet aid, are divided over whether this is the real reason. Some say they suspect that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is trying to force President Castro to soften criticism of his domestic policies by witholding supplies, while others say the trade disruption reflects shortages and strains within the Soviet bloc brought about by these changes. 
 
Opposes Gorbachev's Policies
On Jan. 23 the Cuban Government, which has made no secret of its hostility to President Gorbachev's policies, announced that the daily bread ration for Cubans living outside Havana would be cut starting Feb. 1 from 100 grams to 80 grams, or less than 3 ounces. In Havana, where bread is not rationed, the price was raised by about 30 percent. The price of eggs was also raised, reflecting a shortage of grain-based poultry feed.
The Government said promised supplies of Soviet grain and flour had failed to arrive at the start of the year, although it did not give any figures for the shortage. It admitted dipping into its reserve of scarce dollars to ease buy some grain on the world market, but again gave no details.
Reporting the rationing decision on Jan. 24, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda attributed the slowdown in Soviet grain supplies to administrative errors and a lack of ships.
The Cuban Government blamed a shortage of ships from Poland, East Germany and the Soviet Union for its failure to send as much citrus fruit to the Soviet Union as promised in recent months. It said only 72,159 tons were shipped in December instead of 113,505 tons, while in the first half of January it sent 28,350 tons out of a promised consignment of 45,300 tons.
Those who suspect the Soviet Union is pressing Cuba to soften its Stalinist line argue that Moscow did just this during the late 1960's when Mr. Castro criticized the Brezhnev Government for being too liberal. Moscow cut oil deliveries then, forcing Cuba to impose draconian rationing.
 
'It May Be Happening Again'
Only after Mr. Castro endorsed the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 did the Soviet Union normalize relations and resume full economic aid to Cuba. ''It happened then and it may be happening again now,'' said Frank Calzon, a Cuban expert with the Washington office of Freedom House, a New York-based human rights and public policy organization.
Last June, the Central Bank of Cuba published figures suggesting that Moscow had cut about $200 million from the cheap oil it sends Cuba. Traditionally, the Cuban Government derives much of its foreign currency income from reselling Soviet oil on the world market.
Other Cuba experts argue that the trade slowdown is mainly of economic significance, reflecting the growing shortage of food inside the Soviet Union and the disruption of its barter trading arrangements with Cuba and Eastern Europe caused by the recent changes.
Diplomats say the explanation for the lack of shipping to carry Soviet grain to Cuba and Cuban fruit to Moscow may lie in recent rumors that some Eastern European countries now want the Soviet Union to pay in hard currency for the use of their vessels.
''The trade breakdowns are caused by the accumulating economic incapacities of the Soviet Union,'' said George Dominguez, an expert on Cuban affairs at Harvard University. ''There is no proof of intent to pressure Cuba politically.''

A 'WAR' IS FOUGHT AS BUSH LOOKS ON

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT IRWIN, Calif., Feb. 6

 BODY:
On a day when he hailed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for proposing an end to the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power in the Soviet Union, President Bush stood on a bleak Mojave Desert ridge today to watch American soldiers fight ''Soviet'' tanks in a mock World War III battle.
Despite the political upheaval in Eastern Europe, Mr. Bush said this was not a time to ''let down our guard against a worldwide threat.''
''I can speak for all Americans when I say we are pleased to see Chairman Gorbachev's proposal to expand steps toward pluralism in the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Bush said over a radio link to the 2,689 soldiers, who stopped their ''war'' for five minutes to listen to the Commander in Chief.
''It's especially encouraging to see anything which might bring the day of true democracy a bit closer for the Soviet people,'' Mr. Bush said. But he cautioned, ''It is important not to let these encouraging changes, political or military, lull us into a sense of complacency.'' 
 
'And Now, Back to War'
''God bless our country,'' Mr. Bush said to conclude his remarks. ''Thank you colonel, and now, back to war.''
Mr. Bush, who is devoting this week to an effort to prove why the United States needs to maintain its nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union, arrived at the command post on Hill 781 just in time to see Soviet tanks of the fictitious 197th Krasnovian Motorized Rifle Regiment smash through the defensive lines of the real-life Third Brigade of the Ninth Infantry Division from Fort Lewis.
Mr. Bush went down the hill, part of the sprawling Fort Irwin Army base midway between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, to talk to some of the American ''dead.'' He wore a camouflage jacket above his blue pinstripe trousers, binoculars around his neck and wing tips on his feet. But perhaps mindful of the pitfalls awaiting politicians in photo sessions at military bases, Mr. Bush did not try out any of the weaponry or ride in one of the M-1 tanks, like the one in which his Presidential opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, took a politically damaging spin in 1988.
It was a day packed with the heavy ironies and political paradoxes that have become commonplace as the Bush Administration, Congress and the United States military struggle to come to grips with a rapidly changing world in which the old strategic principles that were being played out today in the exercise on the Mojave Desert floor are called into question almost daily.
 
A Speech on Military Policy
Mr. Bush flew 2,340 miles from Washington to Fort Irwin for this first stop on a trip that will also include a visit to the Strategic Air Command, a major speech on military policy and a tour of a laboratory working on the ''Star Wars'' anti-missile shield. The purpose is to head off lawmakers who argue that the receding Soviet military threat justifies more than the 2 percent cut, after accounting for inflation, that Mr. Bush is offering in military spending.
The Third Brigade training today at Fort Irwin is a light, motorized infantry brigade, just the kind of highly mobile unit on which Mr. Bush and the Pentagon want to concentrate as they begin the reshaping of the United States military.
But Fort Irwin, site of the Army's National Training Center, concentrates primarily on the sort of operation that the military leadership concedes is increasingly unlikely, a land war against the Soviet Union.
The 197th Krasnovian, which almost always wins its war games since it is based at Fort Irwin and highly trained in its desert terrain, charged from the Whale and the Furlong, two low ridges in the Mojave Desert, behind a barrage of simulated artillery fire and chemical warheads and made quick work of the less-experienced light brigade.
 
Tactics Used by 30 Nations
On a hill above, Lieut. Col. Michael Ryan, who designed the day's war games, dealt good-naturedly with the same questions of strategy that are perplexing his commanders in Washington. Although the training at Fort Irwin is clearly intended to simulate a war against Soviet troops, Colonel Ryan took care to point out that Soviet equipment and tactics ''is used 30 nations around the world.''
When a reporter asked if he would have offered that caveat six months ago, Colonel Ryan grinned and said, ''You all are asking a lot of questions you wouldn't have asked six months ago.''
Colonel Ryan said the base had not ''loaded'' the battle to give the Americans a victory. ''We've been nervous about what the fallout was going to be, but the battle was designed before we knew the President was coming,'' he said.
As he gazed out on the hillside, where the Third Brigade had dug itself in, Colonel Ryan said this choice was likely to lead to a defeat.
''If they stay where they are with no armored protection, they're subject to getting killed pretty fast,'' he said in the dry, matter-of-fact speech of a warrior talking to untested civilians.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: U.S. Policy;
U.S. Backing West German's Unity Idea

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The United States is backing a proposal by the West German Foreign Minister that a reunified Germany be part of NATO but that no NATO troops be based on the territory of East Germany, a senior Administration official said today.
The official, speaking to reporters after a meeting at Shannon Airport in Ireland between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, said a majority of NATO members appeared to favor such a unification formula.
The official said Mr. Baker would raise the issue with President Mikail S. Gorbachev when he goes to Moscow on Wednesday. After his brief layover in Ireland, but before his trip to Moscow, Mr. Baker stopped in Prague for talks with President Vaclav Havel.
 
The Genscher Proposal
The remarks by the Administration official, who is in a position to speak authoritatively on behalf of the State Department, amounted to the first indication that the Bush Administration was ready to back the unification proposal, which was presented to Mr. Baker last Friday by the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
Mr. Genscher, who is the chief of the Free Democratic Party in West Germany and who often floats ideas on foreign policy, has been discussing his unification idea with European officials.
The plan has not been endorsed by East Germany, which officially seeks a neutral and unified Germany sometime in the future. It has not been endorsed by the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who heads the Christian Democratic Union in the coalition government, or by the Government itself. But it has gained widespread support in Bonn, and Government officials there say it is likely to become policy.
American officials added that they were not wedded to the proposal, meaning that if it proves impossible to put into effect, or if a better idea comes along, they will also consider those.
 
'A Pretty Good One'
''Genscher has come up with one proposal, and we think that proposal, in terms of not having NATO forces move further east, is a pretty good one,'' the senior official said. ''It maintains a NATO structure that will try to achieve not only the new missions we've talked about but the political purposes of the alliance. So we think that is a very positive contribution. This is the sort of thing that will have to be discussed among the various parties: NATO, the Germanys, the Soviets.''
Asked what kind of support the proposal had in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the official said, ''I think many of the other countries in NATO think that this serves the elements that we set and will help maintain stability.'' Up to last week, Bush Administration officials studiously avoided lending support to a detailed or concrete plan for German unity.
 
Four Conditions
Instead, whenever the President or the Secretary of State were asked for their preference on the unification question, they answered that they supported the basic principle, provided that it took place with four conditions. Those conditions were these:
* Unification must come about through the free voting and self-determination of East and West Germans. As Mr. Baker said in his speech in Berlin on Dec. 12, ''We should not at this time endorse or exclude any particular vision of unity.''
* Unification should occur in the context of Germany's continued commitment to NATO.
* For the sake of European stability, unification must happen step by step.
* There should be no enlargement of Germany's postwar borders, except through peaceful negotiations.
Administration officials said they were forced to move from those general principles to a more detailed blueprint two weeks ago, when the troubled East German Government announced that it was moving up elections from May to March 18.
 
'Takeover' or 'Merger'
Given the fact that the vast majority of East German parties running in the campaign urge unification, the voting is expected to be followed by the establishment of a new East German Government that will immediately take steps toward merging the countries.
As the Administration official put it, Washington recognizes that after the elections, ''you can expect a very quick process dealing with the economic, political and legal aspects of unification between the two German states.''
The question for the Administration became more immediate: on whose terms would unification take place? In Wall Street terms, would it be a ''takeover'' of East Germany by West Germany, or a ''merger'' between relative equals? The East German Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, weighed in last week with his own proposal, in which a ''united fatherland'' would cease to be a member of NATO or the Warsaw Pact and would set up its government in Berlin.
 
Brakes on Modrow Plan
It was in an effort stop the Modrow proposal in its tracks, before it gained any momentum with the German public, that Mr. Genscher, encouraged by the Administration, came up with his own concrete proposal in a speech on Jan. 31. The hope in Bonn and in Washington is that by the time the vote takes place in East Germany, the West will have a formula for keeping a unified Germany in NATO and resisting calls for its neutrality.
The Genscher formula postulates that a united Germany remain in NATO but that NATO promise that its troops in West Germany would not be extended into East German territory once the nations were merged.
The hope is that such an arrangement would make German unification less threatening to the Kremlin. Mr. Genscher has also proposed that the Soviets be allowed to continue maintaining some troops in East Germany, ideally in much reduced numbers, and that those troops could even engate in joint exercises, exchanges and other confidence-building measures with NATO troops so that Germany would be, as he puts it, a venue for East-West reconciliation, not confrontation.
 
Avoiding a Public Stand
To date the Bush Administration, unlike Mr. Genscher, has declined to take a position on Soviet troops. Officials traveling with Mr. Baker said, ''We don't want to rule them in or out.''
They do not want to rule them in so as not to appear to be sanctioning the presence of the Soviet Army in East Germany, the officials explained, and they do not want to declare that they must leave by a certain date because to do so would probably undermine hope of Soviet cooperation. The Soviets have about 390,000 troops in East Germany.
The Soviet position on the German question appears to be in flux. As to a meeting last week in Moscow between Mr. Modrow and Mr. Gorbachev, the Soviet President for the first time gave a cautious endorsement for a discussion of reunification.
But a day later, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze seemed to back away from that idea, saying that given Germany's Nazi past, unification was a concept that might be best put before an international referendum. ---- Thousands Rally in Prague PRAGUE, Feb. 6 (AP) - Thousands of people filled Prague's Old Town Square today and demanded that 75,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia withdraw unconditionally by May 31.
The crowd, estimated at 8,000 by a Western reporter and at 30,000 by the official press agency, applauded a speaker who demanded that Vasil Bilak and other former leading Communists be put on trial. Mr. Bilak and the others are deemed responsible for inviting troops into Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the liberalization movement known as the Prague Spring.
The new coalition Government, headed by President Havel, has demanded the withdrawal of the Soviet forces by the end of 1990.

Baker Offers Prague Economic Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today offered Czechoslovakia a package of economic assistance similar to that provided by Washington to Poland and Hungary to help the new leaders in Prague consolidate their revolution and establish a free-market democracy.
The Czechoslovak assistance program was part of a broader set of proposals included in a speech Mr. Baker is to deliver in Prague on Wednesday that outlines the Bush Administration's thinking on how ''Czechoslovakia and its neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe can move from revolutions to lasting democracies.''
In the address, copies of which were distributed to news organizations this evening, Mr. Baker tried to provide some suggestions to help the Eastern European revolutionaries of 1989 become the efficient democrats of 1990.
He said: ''If 1989 was the year of sweeping away, 1990 must become the year of building anew. The spirit of revolution needs to move from the streets into the Government.'' 
 
Baker's Assistance Package
To help Prague make that transition, Mr. Baker, the first Secretary of State to visit Czechoslovakia since William T. Rogers came in 1973, held a round of talks with the new Czechoslovak President, Vaclav Havel.
During the Secretary's discussions with the dissident playwright who has become the President, he presented the following assistance package:
* An immediate waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which had prohibited preferential trade benefits for Prague because its previous Communist leadership did not allow free emigration. That presidential waiver will permit export of Czechoslovak products to the United States with lower tariff rates as soon as the trade agreement can be signed.
* A presidential request to Congress to let the Overseas Private Investment Corporation operate in Czechoslovakia. OPIC provides insurance for American businessmen who want to invest abroad.
* Support for Czechoslovakia's request to join the International Monetary Fund and a move to make Prague eligible for export-import bank lending programs.
* A reopening of the American Consulate in Bratislava, which has been closed since 1948.
* American support for the location in Prague of the European Development Bank now being set up to aid Eastern European countries in reconstruction.
Mr. Baker also proposed the opening of American cultural centers in Bratislava and Prague, an increase in cultural and educational exchanges, the start of a Peace Corps program for English-language instruction in Czechoslovakia, and a joint American-Czechoslovak study on the Czechoslovak air-pollution problem, the worst in Europe.
 
Initiatives and Technical Aid
The Czechoslovak Government is not expected to respond to the package formally until it is officially presented by Mr. Baker, who is to speak at Charles University. But there is little doubt that officials here will be pleased that most of the details were worked out in quiet discussions through diplomatic channels during the previous weeks.
Unlike Poland and Hungary, Czechoslovakia does not have much foreign debt, so it does not seek from Washington outright cash grants but rather initiatives and technical assistance that would enable it to compete better in the world marketplace.
Besides meeting with Mr. Havel in the gilded music room of the Presidential Palace, the Secretary also met with other leading members of Civic Forum. A loose coalition of Czechoslovak dissidents and intellectuals, Civic Forum was responsible for organizing the street demonstrations and on Nov. 28 forced the Czechoslovak Communist Party to relinquish its 41-year monopoly on political power.
Administration officials said they were struck in their conversations with the new Czechoslovak leaders by how candid they were about the difficulties they were encountering in governing the country - not only because they had been dissidents and outsiders for so many years but because they were discovering that die-hard Communists were still in many ministerial posts and were doing their best to obstruct change.
 
Establishing Free Elections
In many ways, Mr. Baker's speech was aimed at addressing precisely such problems - not only in Czechoslovakia, where Administration officials are fairly confident that the leadership is on the right course, but also in Romania, Bulgaria and East Germany, which have started down the path of change but not gone nearly as far as Washington feels is necessary.
Mr. Baker outlined four basic areas in which, he said, the United States would try to work together with those countries to help them achieve the full promise of their revolution.
The first area is how to bring about free and fair elections to establish legitimate governments. In that regard, Mr. Baker proposed that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation umbrella organization tying together Eastern and Western Europe with Canada and America, ''join with the United States in sending observer delegations to insure that people power elections'' in Eastern Europe during 1990 are conducted properly.
He also added an American warning that ''the peaceful transition to democracy now underway in Eastern Europe will not tolerate rear-guard maneuvers from any quarter.''
 
Threat of Ancient Feuds
''We will proceed on the basis of a new democratic differentiation: any backsliding in the movement to creating legitimate governments will isolate a nation from the support we can provide,'' the speech said.
The second area involved arms control, where Mr. Baker underscored the urgency of achieving a conventional-arms reduction treaty in Europe, but then added a proposal that was clearly aimed at diffusing the pent-up ethnic and nationalist tension brewing in Eastern Europe. East-West conflicts, he said, are no longer the greatest threat, but rather old feuds between ancient peoples of Europe.
''We need to develop measures that would impede an assertion of military might by any European nation against any other,'' he said. ''We should consider new proposals to promote greater military transparency between neighboring states.''
In the third, area, economics, Mr. Baker did not provide much in the way new ideas beyond the aid package to Prague and the notification to others that the progress any Eastern European Government makes in meeting the challenges of moving toward a free market ''will influence the availability of the full range of aid'' that Washington will extend from the $300 million pool of new funds the White House has budgeted for Eastern Europe for this year.
 
Overcoming Old Animosities
The final area involves what is still a loosely defined proposal for new regional associations in Eastern Europe to provide stability and mutual support for the new governments there as they try and get on their feet without the aid, or hindrance, of Moscow.
''We believe voluntary associations follow naturally from democracy and are, in a sense, a natural way for democracies to build an international civil society and overcome old animosities,'' said Mr. Baker.
''We welcome the recent discussions of mutually beneficial economic cooperation by the Governments of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, including a possible free-trade agreement. If you do your work together, we will respect your decisions by providing our assistance in a way that supports your association.''

World Bank Approves Its First Loans to Warsaw, in Support of Economic Reforms

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The World Bank today approved its first two loans to Poland, totaling $360 million, part of a package of more than $2.5 billion that it is preparing over the next three years to help break economic bottlenecks and support reforms of the Solidarity-led Government.
The action, taken after a daylong board meeting here, follows approval on Monday by the World Bank's sister lending organization, the International Monetary Fund, of $723 million in shorter-term credits to shore up Poland's international accounts over a period of transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy.
The moves represent a Western seal of approval on Warsaw's reform plan, the most far-reaching of any in Eastern Europe. The plan calls for scrapping price controls while maintaining wage controls, ending many subsidies for goods and services, selling state-owned enterprises and making the currency convertible to dollars. 
 
Cushioning the Shocks
The large-scale international support, which is being supplemented by aid packages from the United States and the European Community, among others, is aimed at cushioning shocks on consumers and workers. Already prices have shot up, and unemployment is expected to rise sharply.
Poland's Labor Minister, Jacek Kuron, has cited I.M.F. estimates that the number of jobless could rise to 1 million by the end of this year. This is more than twice previous estimates.
Some of the Western aid would help the Polish Government prepare a safety net to help the jobless similar to unemployment insurance programs prevailing in most Western nations.
The World Bank loans include $260 million for projects in industries including chemicals, electrical power and forest products, and $100 million for agricultural programs. In the farm sector, the money would be spent on imports of cattle feed to build meat supplies and on food freezing, storage and processing facilities. Much of the money will flow back into purchases of equipment from Japan and Western industrial countries including West Germany and the United States.
Barber B. Conable Jr., the president of the World Bank, said at a news conference here that the loans would make the Polish economy more efficient, help it boost exports and provide more and better goods for the population.
 
'A Close Partner'
The World Bank, which altogether commits more than $22 billion a year to promote development in the third world, ''intends to be a close partner'' of Poland in the process of economic transformation, Mr. Conable said.
The loans are the first by the World Bank's principal lending unit, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which makes loans at subsidized rates to about 80 countries. But a subsidiary of the bank, the International Finance Corporation, which helps the private sector in developing countries, made a $17.9 million loan to a Polish frozen-food enterprise in 1988.
The loans are for 17 years, and the first repayments do not have to be made until 1995. The interest rate is 7.75 percent but is subject to change every six months, based on the bank's own cost of borrowing in international capital markets.
Poland already has a major external debt problem. It owes $40 billion to foreign creditors, half of which comes due in the next three years. About $30 billion of the total is owed to foreign governments and the rest to commercial banks, mainly in Western Europe.
The international support now being mobilized includes what are expected to be generous rescheduling terms when the Warsaw authorities go before the so-called Paris Club of creditor nations to negotiate repayment terms.
Poland has been allowed to suspend interest payments and has not been paying principal for years. American Treasury officials said they expected Poland to be given at least 10 years to repay its official debts. On commercial debts, the Treasury has told Poland that it could qualify for reduction under a plan put forward last March by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The Germans;
Exchange Rate Crucial In a Move to One Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
If West Germany and East Germany move rapidly toward a single currency, the crucial decision for both the politicians and the economists will be the rate at which the East German mark is exchanged for the West German mark, several economists said yesterday.
Moreover, some economists warned, a monetary union should not occur until other important economic changes, like the removal of price controls and Government subsidies, were undertaken in East Germany. Without such reforms, the potential benefits of a single currency and monetary policy would be undermined. They also agreed that the biggest concern about such a move at this time is that it would create a burst of inflation in West Germany, which would then force a sharp increase in interest rates to curb the price rises. 
 
Knocking the Dollar
As for the dollar, the prospect of a unified Germany alongside a fast-changing Eastern Europe has also knocked it down more than 10 percent against the mark since November, when the Berlin wall was opened. A successful move toward economic union would mean an even weaker dollar, economists say, but if the process falters that could strengthen the dollar temporarily.
For the politicians, like Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who proposed immediate talks on such a union yesterday, the more favorable the rate is to East Germany the more likely it will be to slow the flood of East Germans to West Germany, now running at about 2,000 a day. The West German Government is pushing for a quick union as a way to slow this outflow and avoid the collapse of the East German economy.
The more favorable the rate, the stronger the lift for East Germany's sagging economy and the country's standard of living, which are both changes that could keep more East Germans at home. The closer the exchange rate is to one East German mark for one West German mark, the more generous it will be to East Germans, giving them more purchasing power. In West Germany, the exchange rate being talked about now is four East German marks for one West German mark. The official rate is one to one, while the unofficial rate in West Berlin is about six to one.
 
Inflationary Pressures
But for economists and, especially the West German central bank, the more favorable the rate the more likely it is that there will be inflationary pressures as the central bank, the Bundesbank, has to print more West German marks to meet the demand in East Germany.
The president of the Bundesbank, Karl Otto Pohl, opposes the quick move to monetary union. But he does acknowledge that the flood of East Germans leaving the country could lead to the collapse of the economy. And in a speech in New York last week he suggested that there could be some ''gradual'' linking of the two currencies under the right circumstances, which means prior moves by the East German Government toward broader, free-market economic reform.
John Lipsky, director of international bond market research for Salomon Brothers in London, said that no matter what exchange rate was set it would be difficult for the West German central bank to gauge the right policy to follow in setting interest rates and supplying currency to the two economies.
The expectation now, Mr. Lipsky said, ''is that the politicians will decree an inflationary monetary reform'' for East Germany.
If the move to monetary union moves ahead, it is not yet clear how the transition would be made. Based on comments of the West German Finance Minister, it is possible that the two currencies could become exchangeable relatively soon but that the West German mark would not fully replace the East German mark until 1993.

HEADLINE: Come Snow, Rain or Heat, 30/ Letter Seems Likely

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
It looks as if it will cost 30 cents, a nickel more, to mail a first-class letter next year.
The increase, which would be the first since 1988 and the largest ever, will be considered by the United States Postal Service's board when it meets March 6. And if things follow their usual course, stamp prices will go up next February, 11 months after the rate-raising process begins.
Although an increase in 1991 had been expected for some time, the size of it did not begin to come into focus until last week. That was when the Postal Service issued the text of a speech, delivered by Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank to the Economic Club of Indianapolis on Jan. 25, in which Mr. Frank said it appeared that 30 cents was the most likely new price of a first-class stamp. 
 
Criticism Is Expected
Mr. Frank made clear he did not expect the increase to play well with the public. He noted that the raise would be 20 percent, substantially above the 14 percent that he estimated consumer prices will have risen in the three years since the last rate increase, and he said he was ''committed to paying back to the American people that 6 percent'' difference.
Today, addressing a California meeting of the Postal Service's board, Mr. Frank offered one way to do so, saying, ''We may very well be able to hold increases in rates after the 1991 adjustments to one more increase in the balance of this century.''
But that ''would be no small achievement,'' he said.
 
Relatively Low Rates
Regardless of whether there is an outcry over the new increase, as Mr. Frank expects, the United States will continue to have the lowest first-class rates among industrialized countries. By comparison, the rates are 47.2 cents in West Germany, 46.5 cents in Japan, 38.3 cents in France and 31.8 cents in Britain.
If, as seems certain, the postal board acts next month to raise rates for all classes of mail, the independent Postal Rate Commission will then ask for comment and hold long hearings before making its recommendation.
It will then be up to the board to put the new rate into effect. Only once since the rate commission was created in 1971 has it proposed a lower increase than the board had asked for. In that case, the board overruled the recommendation and did what it had proposed.
 
Expected Battle Over Charges
While public attention focuses on the cost of sending a first-class letter, the real battles occur over second- and third-class rates.
Advertising firms, charities and publishers of magazines and newspapers inundate the rate commission with pleas to hold down their portions of the overall rate rise.
Although the Postal Service managed to achieve a $404 million surplus in the last three months of 1989, it expects a record $1.6 billion deficit for the fiscal year that will end Sept. 30. And the outcome of contract negotiations this summer could make the deficit even worse.
Mr. Frank, addressing postal costs in his Indianapolis speech last month, noted that the Postal Service had been required in the last two years ''to contribute $800 million to deficit reduction, even though we don't use a penny of tax money,'' and that ''health benefit costs are out of control - a problem we share with the private sector.''
The Postal Service was created in 1971 out of the old Post Office Department. It was separated from the Federal budget, and tax subsidies were eliminated. Later, when the service was showing a surplus, the agency was returned to the Federal budget.
The service was subsequently taken back off the budget, but was also required to cover some retirement and medical payments for people who had been employees of the Post Office Department. That expense has added millions of dollars to the service's annual costs.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers Farm Plan, but Without Specific Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today sent Congress a package of recommendations for new farm legislation but did not spell out how farm subsidies should be cut to help meet Federal spending cutbacks next year.
In releasing a list of more than 60 recommendations for the 1990 Farm Bill, the debut of the Administration's farm policy, Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter said the Administration did ''not intend to make specific recommendations on how to meet budget requirements.''
Last week, in his Budget Message, President Bush called for a $1.5 billion decrease in Federal price supports in the fiscal year 1991. But the Administration is apparently looking to Congress to come up with the blueprint for those cuts. 
''We'll have to legislate in cooperation with Congress,'' Mr. Yeutter told reporters.
The debate on the farm bill comes at a time of soaring incomes for the nation's farmers and declining levels of government price supports. Federal farm price support outlays for 1990 are forecast at $11.3 billion, down from a high of $22.4 billion in 1987, according to figures supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.
 
Bill to Set Minimum Prices
The bill, the Food and Agriculture Act of 1990, regulates and finances a wealth of programs ranging from food stamps to setting the minimum price that farmers can receive on crops like peanuts, sorghum and rice. The bill will replace the 1985 farm bill, which expires at the end of this year.
Lawmakers, farmers, lobbyists, environmentalists and commodity traders have been eagerly awaiting some sign of the Bush Administration's view on questions like commodity-price supports, Federal disaster relief for farmers and programs to halt soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and the pollution of water by pesticides and chemical fertilizers.
Congressional Democrats and environmentalists characterized the administration's first foray into agricultural policy as timid and said it failed to go beyond much of what is currently embodied in law.
''Unfortunately, the heart of the farm bill is simply not there,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ''The administration fails to tell farmers what it thinks target prices should be. American farmers don't know what their incomes will be and Congress does not know how much the administration will be willing to spend on farm programs.''
The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has projected that farm income will be $54.5 billion this year, up from $46.7 billion in 1985. Economist say the rise in farm income has resulted from Federal subsidies, a weaker dollar, which helped exports, and the drought conditions of 1988 and 1989, which drastically reduced grain surpluses.

To the Editor:
Leonard Silk attributes to Edward M. Bernstein, first research director of the International Monetary Fund, the belief that the chronic United States trade deficit with Japan is chiefly the result of the undervaluation of the yen, which represents deliberate Japanese policy (Economic Scene column, Jan. 12). Moreover, Mr. Silk believes this to be part of the reason trade pressure is mounting on the Japanese. I would like to clarify United States-Japan trade issues.
As for the assertion that the yen is undervalued because of a Japanese policy to purchase billion-dollar bonds, I would mention first that the fundamental relationship of international balance of payments components is that the surplus of current balance is equal to the deficit of both capital balance and balance of monetary movements (the amount of inflow of money to Japan must be equal to the outflow). This is not economic theory, but accounting fact. 
Japanese investors have to invest surplus money overseas, but the monetary authority of Japan does not manipulate how or where that money is invested, nor can it influence the investment with regulations or guidelines. Japanese investors are said to have bought West German mark assets and, since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, are starting to shift money from the United States to West Germany. The yen has thus weakened against the mark and become more stable against the dollar in the last two months.
Political changes aside, one striking feature of the recent past is the dominant influence of nominal interest rate differentials on international capital flows. This has led to the somewhat paradoxical result that countries with deficits, like the United States, with relatively high inflation rates and high interest rates, have experienced large-scale capital inflows, which have put upward pressure on their exchange rates. Countries with surpluses, like Japan, have the reverse effects. Such situations produce clear risks.
As the upward movement of the currencies of deficit countries with high inflation rates implies a real appreciation, and conversely a real depreciation of the currency of surplus countries with low inflation rates, there is a strong possibility that current-account imbalances will worsen and that unsustainable foreign investment levels will give rise to serious policy dilemmas and disturbances in financial markets. To counter these risks, the Japanese Monetary Authority is monitoring and acting in the foreign exchange market in close contact with other countries in the monetary Group of Seven (the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada).
To cut trade imbalances, we must keep in mind the basic relationship, which is also the accounting fact, that the difference between a country's exports and imports is exactly equal to the difference between its savings and investments. In recent bilateral talks, the United States focused on such Japanese problems as the tendency to save a lot, but not invest enough on infrastructure, an inefficient distribution system and business practices that exclude newcomers. Japan responded with its list: the American tendency to consume a lot, but not save enough, lack of emphasis on exporting, inadequate worker education, business practices that focus on short-term profits, rather than long-term productivity.
The Bush Administration and Congress have to make a plan to cut the budget deficit in real terms and should not resort to bookkeeping gimmicks anymore.
As for increasing America's savings rate, the following episode has relevance. Before World War II, Japan had one of the lowest savings rates among major countries and just after the war the rate plunged even further with inflation. In this crisis, the United States brought in a Detroit banker, Joseph Dodge, as the Occupation's economic adviser. He proposed a sharp increase in income tax rates, even on fairly low incomes, a well-known balanced budget principle, and an exemption from all taxes on the interest earned on deposits of up to three million yen a person. Inflation disappeared within weeks, and six months later, the savings rate turned up and kept climbing. Tax revenues also began to rise almost immediately.
Finally, I would like to point out that the United States has been counseling countries whose deficit of international balance of payments is caused by excess domestic demand to take a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy and to push through structural changes to raise savings rates through the International Monetary Fund (where the United States is a top voting power). It's time for the United States to put into practice the same principles.

HEADLINE: Bicycles, Not Cars, Show True Progress

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The caption on the photo of bicycle traffic in Ho Chi Minh City accompanying your ''Phnom Penh Journal'' (Jan. 9) calls bicycling a ''primitive'' means of transportation. The further implication is that although bicycles outnumber cars in traffic there, progress will reverse that. 
The situation for most developing countries is very different from the late 19th century in the West, where the bicycle industry was the precursor to the automobile and aircraft industries. Economic and resource constraints make it most unlikely that societies such as Vietnam will take this route.
In global ecological terms, moreover, it is not clear that such development would be welcome. Air pollution, the greenhouse effect and resource depletion will escalate dramatically if the entire human population reaches the high energy use of societies that rely heavily on the private automobile.
Sensible and sustainable transportation development will see industrial countries moving toward a combination of efficient mass transit and human-powered transport like the bicycle, rather than the automobilization of developing countries.
Signs are in evidence. The president of the Volvo Corporation has called for elimination of cars from the urban areas of Sweden. Bordeaux, France, plans to eliminate motor traffic from 50 percent of its streets within 10 years. In Italy, partial car bans are in effect in the centers of Naples, Milan, Bologna and Florence.
New York City public officials have yet to offer a serious initiative to restrict auto traffic. They will have to if New York is ever to become a truly livable city.

HEADLINE: Time to Stop Bashing The 'Wealthy' Elderly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The final paragraphs of Charles Peters's ''Disturbing Signs From the Bush Team'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 15) repeats the canard that the repeal of the catastrophic health bill was the work of the wealthy elderly.
How does Mr. Peters define ''wealthy''? Elderly couples whose income from pensions and Social Security combined seldom exceeds $30,000 annually were united in opposition to the bill. Why? Their income in these inflationary times seldom leaves them much in discretionary funds. It may hardly equal the money they earned when there was far less inflation; it scarcely allows them to maintain the standard of living they enjoyed in less inflationary times. At the present cost of living, it keeps them above the poverty level, but that is all that one can honestly say. Is it any wonder that the supplemental Medicare premium was seen as discriminatory? Are the elderly required to be impoverished?
The ''greedy geezer'' rhetoric was used by members of Congress who were embarrassed by having passed a flawed bill. Failure to study the consequences of the legislation was a bipartisan failure.
Those whose annual income is far more than that of most of those ''wealthy'' retirees whom they attack should not engage in the popular sport of blaming the victim; they should rather earn their salaries by doing the work for which they were elected.

HEADLINE: How To Fight Global Warming

BYLINE: By Elliot L. Richardson; Elliot L. Richardson headed the U.S. delegation to the Law of the Sea Conference from 1977 to 1980.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Environmentalists and politicians can argue the costs and benefits of international action on global warming from now until doomsday, and they probably will. But nothing will get done without an institutional mechanism to develop, institute and enforce regulations across national boundaries.
The need for a mechanism emerged clearly from this week's meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group sponsored by the United Nations. President Bush's speech at the conference, in which he called for more research on the ''uncertainty'' of global warming, may have disappointed some. But that misses the larger point. 
Little can be accomplished in the absence of multilateral institutions that will eventually carry out whatever remedial environmental actions the world community can agree upon. In short, we need an international treaty, modeled perhaps on the Law of the Sea Treaty, to coordinate and enforce international action on the environment.
Of course, many scientific questions need to be answered. We need to know the costs and benefits of various means of stopping the buildup of greenhouse gases. We need to discuss regulatory standards and cost-effective enforcement measures. Eventually, however, we will have to act.
The world cannot afford to rely on independent action by individual countries. The results are bound to be highly uneven: One nation could cut back on its carbon dioxide emissions; one could stop the destruction of its own forests; still another could do nothing. The least responsible transnational corporations will seek out and encourage the most permissive regulatory environments.
For maximum impact as well as equitable burden-sharing, there will have to be universal standards universally accepted. Deliberation about the political palatability and enforcement of these standards should be concurrent with, not subsequent to, deliberation about science and regulation.
Take, for instance, the question of whether to strengthen organizations like the United Nations Environmental Program or the International Maritime Organization, combine them or build a new one - a global Environmental Protection Agency -from scratch. Or take the question of what powers should be granted to the chosen institutions. Should these institutions be limited to formulating recommendations or should they also have the power to promulgate and enforce regulations?
Political considerations must also be discussed. Will there be a single governing body with universal representation? What kind of voting arrangement will govern its decisions - a one-nation, one-vote system like the United Nations General Assembly, a weighted system like the World Bank or Intelsat or something in between? Dispute-resolution mechanisms must be put in place.
Whether the international institution is given power to enforce rather than merely recommend regulations obviously affects representational and decision-making issues. In fact, the more power the organization will be expected to exercise and the more money it will be authorized to spend, the fiercer will be the battles.
The arena in which these battles are fought will be an international conference of some 160 sovereign states to be held in Brazil in 1992. These states will vastly differ in their contributions to environmental degradation. Their delegates will represent every race, culture, ideology, geographical circumstance and state of economic development on earth.
Given the scope and complexity of this conference's task, a thorough preparatory process is indispensable. The U.N. took four years to lay the groundwork for the Law of the Sea Conference, and the conference spent nine more years, with twice a year meetings, to produce a treaty.
The U.S. has not yet taken a prominent role in laying the groundwork for an environmental treaty. Our leadership in such effort nevertheless can make a critical difference. It is in our own interest and in that of the entire world community to take the initiative.
Our responsibility, our economic stake and our breadth of regulatory experience are unequalled. It is not too late.

HEADLINE: The 'Half Free' Are 'Half Enslaved'

BYLINE: By Albert Gore Jr.; Albert Gore Jr., Democrat, is Senator from Tennessee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The poem was a simple, dramatic dessert to a long dinner around a table laden with delicacies rarely seen during a Soviet winter: plates full of beef and fish and a pyramid of fresh oranges.
We listened, Soviets and Americans, as Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the legendary poet of conscience, declaimed it, freezing into awed silence what had been a spirited debate about the course Soviet leaders must adopt. The poem, Mr. Yevtushenko said, was a new creation, but it was delivered with such command that it seemed to be recited from memory. He said that it would be called ''Half Measures.'' 
Our host, in an ornate room in an old Moscow restaurant, was Vitaly Korotich, editor in chief of the controversial magazine Ogonyok. He is also a member, in the Congress of People's Deputies, of the Inter-Regional Group - a loose alliance of delegates who believe perestroika will fail if Mikhail Gorbachev does not dramatically accelerate economic reform. Mr. Yevtushenko is also a delegate to the Congress, which meets at least once a year. He brings an unusual blend of poetic insight and knowledge of insider politics to his responsibilities.
When asked how virulent national rivalries and ethnic hatreds could boil over at a time of relatively unfettered political life, he spoke of a mastodon, perfectly frozen in time. Imagine, he said, that the scientific expedition that discovered the animal takes great pains to defrost it. Even if they proceed flawlessly, unseen to their eyes but thawing with the huge beast would be tiny microbes carrying ancient diseases with the ability to destroy it. Only the onset of decay would signal the microbes' presence. This is equally true of ethnic conflicts and anti-Semitism, which are now thawing along with political processes frozen for so long, Mr. Yevtushenko said.
It was while we talked of the possibility of a ''third path'' that Mr. Gorbachev might follow to lead the Soviet Union to safety that Mr. Yevtushenko's low, musical voice captivated us with ''Half Measures.''
For some, the ''third path'' involves an economic transition from the discredited ''command'' model to something approximating a free market, yet not quite capitalism. To others, it involves giving up the old imperial structure for something resembling a confederation, yet not quite entirely a union of sovereign equals. For still others, it means a society in which people need no longer lock their thoughts away in secret places, yet a society that is not quite based on the paramount value of individual rights.
The essential truth about the circumstances of the Soviet Union is conveyed in Mr. Yevtushenko's few lines. None of us in the West can presume to know how the Soviet Union can best make the excruciatingly difficult transition it is now attempting. After all, this is a society organized along lines so alien to our own that opening a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow has been accompanied by planning and economic life-support arrangements worthy of sending a mission to the moon.
It is worth appreciating, however, that many in the Soviet Union believe that the only real choice may be all or nothing: full economic and political freedom or the possibility of a return to conservatism: ''Those half free - are half enslaved.''

HEADLINE: THE TALK OF CAMDEN;
A City in Pain Hopes for Relief Under Florio

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
When people here talk about the future, they do so in a most guarded manner. ''I wouldn't call it anticipation,'' said the Rev. Michael Doyle, the pastor of the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic parish, who has worked among Camden's poor for 21 years. ''But there's a general feeling that things are going to improve. Or at least that they won't get any worse.''
Rosemary R. Jackson, executive director of the Camden Urban Women's Center, said, ''So many things have been promised to Camden. I hope we don't get more of what we've been getting for the last 30 years.''
There is reason for a trace of hope in this poorest of American cities. 
A $42 million state aquarium is taking shape on the Delaware River waterfront. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority is wooing two of Philadelphia's major-league teams, the 76ers and Flyers, promising to build an arena in Camden if they agree to move across the river.
Perhaps most important, Camden's Congressman for 15 years, Jim Florio, is now governor, and its mayor for three terms, Melvin R. Primas Jr., is Mr. Florio's commissioner of community affairs. While offering no specifics, Governor Florio has vowed to make Camden an urban laboratory for trying new ways to overcome the old problems of poverty, unemployment and despair.
Driving along any of the city's streets reveals how much still is wrong. And there is a chance that things could get still worse. The city's most prominent resident, the Campbell Soup Company, is undergoing a restructuring that has prompted speculation about a takeover. It is re-examining all existing plans, including one to build a new international headquarters on the waterfront. Next month it will shut down its old Market Street plant, ending nearly a century of food production in Camden.
But some people here say that if anything managed in any way to turn around Camden, it would be a victory for urban areas everywhere.
They say that this city is so poor, so devastated by drugs and crime, so bereft of the qualities that make a place a community, that if Camden can be saved, any city can.
 
Rust on the Soup Can
The water towers atop the seven-story building are painted in the familiar red and white of a Campbell soup can. But they are streaked with rust, and the old factory on which they stand looks like the remnant of another age that it is.
It was on this spot in 1897 that condensed soup was invented. And it will be here next month that the last jar of Prego spaghetti sauce, another Campbell product, will come off the factory line as the plant is closed. Some 940 workers will lose their jobs. The closing was announced last August, a few months after the death of John T. Dorrance Jr., whose family owns 58 percent of the company. Campbell's director of community relations, Jeremiah F. O'Brien, said the plant was just too old and inefficient.
As part of Camden's efforts to revive its waterfront, Campbell had agreed to build a 20-story office building alongside the aquarium and a planned hotel. Now those plans are being reviewed.
Campbell is still planning $45 million in improvements to its adminstrative offices, where 1,800 people work. And while the company is no longer the center around which this city revolves, Mr. O'Brien, who has worked here since 1956, said Campbell is not abandoning Camden.
''If anything,'' he said, ''we'll become more involved in some type of human service or community interest activity.'' One possible project could be to work with local schools to make sure students get the training they need to fill corporate jobs.
''We're here, and we're concerned,'' he said.
 
No Warmup to be Mayor
The day after Aaron A. Thompson was sworn in as interim mayor, succeeding Mr. Primas, a group of ministers marched on City Hall. They charged that Mr. Thompson had been selected by the City Council because he was a puppet of the Democratic bosses. A 59-year-old retired telephone serviceman, he had been a councilman for only six months.
Mr. Thompson defends his qualifications, citing his long involvement in Camden's neighborhoods, mostly in volunteer or ward positions.
''In this seat has sat a plumber, a judge, a lawyer, a high school dropout and a degree man,'' he said, slapping the swivel chair in the mayor's office. ''There is no preparation to be mayor. Not this seat.'' Mr. Thompson said he expected to be able to get the ear of the Governor and the Commissioner of Community Affairs when he needed to, but he did not expect Mr. Florio and Mr. Primas to give Camden special privileges.
''They've got responsibility for all the communities now,'' he said. ''They can't just worry about Camden. But they know Camden well and their hearts are here.''
 
Wooing Flyers and 76ers
The state owns 100 acres of riverfront, now used by the South Jersey Port Corporation. Some months back, under Gov. Thomas H. Kean, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority started trying to interest the Philadelphia 76ers and Flyers in crossing the Delaware and playing in an arena the state would build.
At a news conference last week, Governor Florio said he supported bringing over the teams. But neither he nor the sports authority would give any details of the negotiations.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Robert P. Casey and Mayor W. Wilson Goode say they have made their best offer for keeping the teams, which now play in the 23-year-old Spectrum. But they, too, won't discuss details.
They have expressed pique at New Jersey for not putting its offer in writing, and there have been suggestions that the teams were playing one state off the other. The owners deny it.
In Camden itself, people seem to be divided over whether having the 76ers and Flyers cross the river would be good for the city. Some believe it would boost Camden's image, but others say most residents will neither get jobs at a new arena nor be able to afford tickets to go there.
''Nobody's saying hip-hip-hooray about it,'' said Miss Jackson of the women's center. ''People here know it's not for them.''
 
'It's Not Good Here'
Camden must still bear the burden of its statistics: unemployment tops 12 percent, more than half of its high school students drop out, 61 percent of its children live in poverty, with the rest never far from it. The city has about 80,000 people, down from over 120,000 in the 1960's.
''There's too much fighting, too much drugs,'' said seven-year-old Maria Christina Feliciano, who was spending a few minutes outside with her mother and sister before going in for the night.
Next her family's blistering two-story rowhouse on Clinton Street is an empty lot, and next to that, abandoned buildings, spilling over with garbage. A rooster crowed as Maria Christina said she will leave when she grows up. ''It's not good here.''
A few blocks away, outside the new Camden County jail, Tracey Best stood with a cluster of young women using hand signals and gestures to talk with their men inside the jail. They spell out letters, sometimes using abbreviations for frequent words like ''what'' and ''you.'' Pressed to windows that don't open, the men sign back.
Miss Best, 25, the unmarried mother of two, said she didn't know whether having Mr. Florio and Mr. Primas in Trenton would help Camden, but she hoped it would. She said she wished Governor Florio could know just how bad it is on the street.
''We don't go out at night,'' she said, rocking her year-old daughter, Bianca, in a stroller. ''Everybody's strung out.''
 
Invincibility Still a Dream
The gray stone of City Hall still bears the inscription ''In a dream I saw a city invincible.'' It is from ''Leaves of Grass,'' which Walt Whitman finished in Camden. It is a phrase used frequently here, a mantra for a whole city.
Where the inscription leaves off is important, for what came after ''invincible'' was ''to the attacks of the whole rest of the earth.''
Camden has suffered attacks of fear, of racism, of disinvestment, of time. It has not proved invincible. But it may yet prove to be ''the new city of friends'' Whitman dreamed of, especially, say people like Lucy Aveni, if its friends in Trenton don't forget it.
''It was a pleasure to live around here,'' said Miss Aveni, a surprising 75, and even more surprising 44-year resident of the same neat rowhouse where she was washing windows and even the electric meter on a recent afternoon. ''Now I'm afraid. I don't even sit outside in the summer anymore. But maybe it'll be different.''

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Hard Work As Closing Of Classes Approaches

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Last August, Katherine R. Stearns came to classes at the Mercer University branch here despite casts on both feet. Another student, Geri S. Brown, quit a part-time job to increase her class load from 15 hours a quarter to 25 hours.
Both women say it was desperation, not love of learning, that drove them: they must complete their degrees by June 30, because that is when Mercer's trustees will close the Cecil B. Day College of Arts and Sciences here. 
Earlier this month, a DeKalb County Superior Court jury ruled that all the college's students and faculty have the right to recover damages from Mercer for what it decided was ''bad faith'' on the trustees' part. It said Mercer's rules required the trustees to consult the faculty before making a decision to close the arts and sciences college, and it also said Mercer breached its contract with the college's students.
Seven students, including Ms. Stearns and Mrs. Brown, filed a lawsuit on behalf of 465 others enrolled at the college. Separately, five faculty members filed suit for 57 colleagues who may lose their appointments when the college closes.
 
Goal Pushed Back
''Our ultimate goal in filing suit was to keep the college of arts and sciences open,'' Ms. Stearns said. ''From a financial standpoint, we were attempting to make it more economically sound for them to keep the school open than to pay the damages and close it.''
Mrs. Brown, 41 years old, said she could transfer her credit hours to another university, but other schools have told her that she must retake several courses she completed at Mercer toward her education major.
Mrs. Brown said she had hoped to be teaching by 1991, but thought that goal was now out of reach.
Mercer, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, is more than 150 years old and has its main campus in Macon, Ga. In 1972 it took over a small, struggling Baptist college in Atlanta that had failed to win academic accreditation after almost a decade in existence. Mercer then used the campus for the arts and sciences college, a school of pharmacy and a graduate school of business and economics.
University administrators gave several reasons for the closing. ''It was not purely money,'' said Mercer's general counsel, Corinne A. Houpt. ''I think for most of the trustees the overall financial condition of the university was the trigger for the need to make a decision.''
 
'Unique Case' in U.S. Education
Ms. Houpt said Judge Carol W. Hunstein of DeKalb Superior Court had ruled that students and faculty members were not entitled to an injunction to prevent the closing, which she said would happen as scheduled.
Mercer announced last April 21 that the arts and sciences college would close.

Milwaukee Plans a College Guarantee for Pupils

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
This city is pledging to guarantee a spot in college, with financial aid, if needed, for any student in the city who graduates from high school with at least a C-plus average.
Or for those who want to learn a skill, the city would make certain that training was provided, along with a job afterward.
''I want that guarantee to go out to every youngster in our school system as soon as possible,'' Mayor John Norquist said recently. ''They need to know and believe that somebody is behind them and that hard work and achievement will be rewarded.'' 
The Milwaukee Guarantee, as it has been named, is the latest measure by a big city to join with business in making specific promises of education, training and jobs to students who meet a certain standard. About a dozen cities, including Boston, Detroit and Baltimore, have similar programs.
And Rhode Island plans to start a program next year that gives third graders the option of signing a contract aimed at strengthening their resolve to stay in school. If the children do so and do not become pregnant and stay off drugs, they will be given a scholarship to a public university or college in that state after graduation.
In New York, the Liberty Partnership Program links colleges and universities with elementary and high schools around the state. The university provides counseling, tutoring, testing and visits with children considered at risk of dropping out of school.
 
Business Leaders Involved
In Milwaukee, the pledge buttresses a campaign by business leaders that provides one-on-one tutoring for elementary school pupils deemed at risk of dropping out of school. The business leaders also provide awards of $500 each to about 30 teachers annually who have been chosen as superior.
Officials here concede that the odds facing inner-city pupils are daunting. Days after the Mayor's announcement, The Milwaukee Sentinel published a school system report showing that 11.5 percent of black male pupils were held back this school year. According to the report, only 22 percent of black boys attained a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.0, a C average. Only 2.2 percent attained a grade point of 3.0, a B average, or better.
With unemployment rates below 5 percent here, business leaders have complained recently of a dire shortage of trained workers.
''Business has a strong self-interest in seeing that these students - the future employees - are better trained,'' said Robert H. Milbourne, executive director of the Greater Milwaukee Committee, a consortium of business and civic leaders here. ''We are increasingly finding that employers are desperately in need of trained workers.''
Few details of the Milwaukee plan have been worked out. A group of business, labor, education and political leaders will meet next week to begin studying the proposal.
Mayor Norquist has said he wants to avoid a major expenditure of tax money for the program and will seek financial help from business and industry.
Officials at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee are hopeful about the plan.
 
'Need for More Counseling'
''It's a great idea, but it's not going to be an easy issue,'' said Frank Cassell, dean of the School of Social Policy at the university. ''The fees are going to have to be paid for those students. They may need special help, so there will be a need for more counseling.''
Moreover, he said the school would not want to compromise its standards. ''This is an urban university, but it's also a research university,'' he said. ''It has very high standards. And the worst possible thing would be to simply let in a lot of young people who would quickly fail.''
For now, Wisconsin residents who graduate in the upper half of their high school class are admitted to the school. Indeed, those who achieve a C-plus average are, in most cases, already accepted at the school.
But Milwaukee officials believe that the prospect of a written guarantee of college would improve pupils' motivation in early grades.
''It's the message that's most important here,'' said James H. Miller, executive director of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a private group. ''My impression is that C-plus students from the inner city can already get into college. But if they don't understand that, early on, it doesn't matter until it's too late. There is something important about a guarantee. It's tangible.''
Of the 98,000 pupils in Milwaukee public schools, about 70 percent are minority members and about 60 percent live at or near the poverty level, according to school officials.

HEADLINE: Bernard Bernstein, Aide to Eisenhower In 40's, Dies at 81

 BODY:
Bernard Bernstein, a lawyer and Treasury Department official who was a financial adviser to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in World War II, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan. 
Mr. Bernstein was one of a group of finance officers identified with Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., who pressed for hard-line proposals in dealing with postwar Germany. But career military officers and State Department officials who favored softer treatment, particularly on economic issues, prevailed.
When his faction lost, Mr. Bernstein, an Army colonel, was removed from the Control Commission for Germany and put in charge of investigating cartels. He soon requested a return to civilian status.
Mr. Bernstein was born in New York. He had bachelor's and law degrees from Columbia University. After practicing law, he joined the legal staff of the Treasury Department in 1933. He was promoted to assistant general counsel in 1938, and from 1940 to 1942 he administered foreign funds.
After the war Mr. Bernstein was a legal adviser to the American Jewish Conference and was chairman of a committee of Jewish organizations dealing with proposals for treaties with enemy countries. He continued practicing law until his death.
Surviving are his wife, the former Bernice Lotwin; three daughters, Elinor Balka of Forest Hills, Queens, Dr. Kate Bernstein of Manhattan and Anne Chesnin of Seattle; a brother, Hilliard, and a sister, Blanche, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

A Mandela Life
Harper & Row said yesterday that it was rushing publication of ''Higher Than Hope,'' the authorized biography of Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela, the longtime leader of the African National Congress, is scheduled to be released soon after 27 years' imprisonment in South Africa.
The author is Fatima Meer, who teaches sociology at the University of Natal in South Africa, and whose friendship with Mr. Mandela dates to the 1950's. The manuscript was approved by Mr. Mandela, and his wife, Winnie Mandela, has written the book's foreword. Harper's publisher, William Shinker - who acquired the book at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1988 - said that Professor Meer had had exclusive access to Mr. Mandela, as well as his correspondence and close associates in the African National Congress. 
A first printing of 50,000 copies is planned, and Harper expects to begin shipping books the first week in March.
 
More About Gotti
John Gotti, the reputed Mafia leader, continues to fascinate authors and publishers. In 1988, Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci wrote a book about him, titled ''Mob Star'' (Franklin Watts). Now two more Gotti biographies are planned for publication by this summer.
The first, ''Goombata: The Improbable Rise and Fall of John Gotti,'' by John Cummings and Ernest Volkman, will be published in April by Little, Brown. Since the book is already at the printer, it will not include the verdict in the current trial in Manhattan State Supreme Court in which Mr. Gotti has been charged with assault and conspiracy in the shooting of a union official.
''But we feel it's more important to have the book out now, to benefit from the trial publicity, rather than wait for the verdict,'' said Jennifer Josephy, the book's editor. ''And the subtitle indicates the authors feel that Gotti is headed for a fall.'' Ms. Josephy emphasized that the contract for the book was signed in December 1987, not written to capitalize on the trial.
The other forthcoming biography, ''Sleeping the Good Sleep: The Life and Times of John Gotti,'' by Doug Feiden, is to be published by Random House in August. While the book is likely to include the verdict, which is expected soon, ''it doesn't hinge on the verdict,'' said David Rosenthal, the book's editor.
The authors of both books had previously written competing books about the multi-million-dollar robbery from the Lufthansa Air Cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport in 1978.
 
For Managers of Chaos
On Monday, Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked about economic reform in a speech to the Communist Party's governing Central Committee. Less than 24 hours later, Carol Janeway, the director of international rights for Alfred A. Knopf, received an inquiry by fax from VAAP, the Soviet copyright agency, ''urgently inquiring'' whether Russian language rights are available to Thomas J. Peters's book, ''Thriving on Chaos.''
Ms. Janeway responded within the hour that rights to the book, whose subtitle is ''Handbook For a Management Revolution,'' were indeed available.
 
Home to Britain
Derek Johns, who last November was appointed editorial director of Times Books, part of Random House, has decided to return to Britain. He said yesterday that his family preferred to live in England but that he would remain a consultant to Random House and to Times Books.

HEADLINE: For Sears's Discover, Next Step Is Harder

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 6

 BODY:
In the rough-and-tumble world of credit cards, Sears, Roebuck & Company's Discover has been the card with nine lives.
Competitors predicted that Discover, introduced in 1986, would go to an early grave, unable to attract enough consumers in a market glutted with Visas and Mastercards. But Discover officials signed up more than 20 million people in the first two years alone. When skeptics predicted the card would fail because merchants would balk, thousands of stores accepted it virtually from the start.
And while Wall Street analysts said Sears would grow despondent over Discover's deep initial losses and close the operation before it had a chance to prove itself, Discover broke into the black in the first quarter of 1988. On Monday, Discover reported that its profit had more than tripled last year, to $80.2 million. 
But those accomplishments may seem easy compared with the task the Discover organization now faces: proving that it can make enough money to justify Sears's $1 billion investment.
Even top Discover officials acknowledge that for the card not to be considered a big waste of the shareholders' money, profits must rise to at least $150 million a year. That Discover's profits are not even close to that, industry experts say, is proof that the card is far from the blockbuster success that Sears had hoped for.
 
A Needed Boost
Still, Discover's progress has been welcome news at Sears's headquarters here. With the company's core retailing operation in the throes of an overhaul that is eroding earnings, Sears executives need the boost that Discover is providing. The card group is proving to be particularly helpful to the results of Dean Witter Reynolds, the Sears subsidiary that contains Discover. The financial services subsidiary reported that Discover accounted for just under half of its 1989 earnings.
Considering that Discover did not exist five years ago, many industry analysts consider it remarkable that the card has made it as far as it has. By relying on the existing base of Sears credit-card customers, the Greenwood Trust Company, the Sears-owned bank in Wilmington, Del., that issues Discover, has been able to place 33 million cards in more than 20 million households. That represents more than 20 percent of American homes.
In fact, by adding Discover, Greenwood Trust has surpassed Citibank as the largest card-issuing bank in the country, measured by the number of cards. And with customers owing $8.5 billion on their cards nationwide, Discover has clearly grabbed business from banks issuing Mastercard and Visa.
 
'One of the Great Success Stories'
After suffering combined losses of $230 million in 1986 and 1987, Discover reported profits of $26.8 million in 1988 and $80.2 million last year. Some 1.1 million stores and restaurants now accept Discover, which amounts to about two-thirds of the merchants who take credit cards.
''The Discover card is one of the great success stories in financial services in the 1980's,'' said Mark Kamm of SMR Research, a consulting firm in Budd Lake, N.J.
''Sears has done a fantastic job of getting the card into people's wallets,'' added Bruce J. Brittain, president of an Atlanta consulting firm that has tracked Discover.
There are several reasons that achieving much higher profits will not be easy for Discover, and some of those reasons have to do with the card's success so far. While Sears has succeeded in getting Discover cards into consumers' hands, the acceptance reflects that card holders pay no annual fee and receive annual cash rebates of up to 1 percent of their total charges.
 
Negative Reaction to Fee
Consumers reacted negatively in two states where Discover officials, unable to charge the card's full 19.8 percent annual interest rate, imposed a $15 annual card fee. Other research shows that most card holders say they would cancel Discover rather than pay a fee.
And people are not charging merchandise on the card with anywhere near the frequency necessary to give Discover a larger piece of the charge-card pie. Analysts say persuading people to use the card more will be a lot harder than getting them to take a card.
''It will be very tough given the competition,'' said Michael Blumstein, a financial-services analyst at the First Boston Corporation. He contrasted it to the bright ''use me'' image of American Express, which, he said, ''has screamed, 'Don't leave home without it' so many times that people don't dare.''
 
A Big Job Ahead
Thomas R. Butler, president and chief operating officer of Discover Card Services Inc., acknowledges the job ahead, saying, ''We have to add some additional value features that will make people use our card.''
Even as Discover officials work to increase use of their card, other perils remain. A recession could send Discover's percentage of uncollectible accounts, now one of the industry's lowest, soaring. Higher interest rates could squeeze the profit Discover earns on the difference between what it pays for money and the 19.8 percent it charges card holders on unpaid balances. That rate is already above the industry average.
Perhaps because Discover is a relatively new card, nearly 10 million, 30 percent, of the 33 million Discover cards in circulation have either never been used or have not had charges made on them in months. At Visa, with 120 million cards, and Mastercard, with 85 million, inactive cards amount to about 20 percent of the total.
 
Lower Outstanding Balances
Discover also trails the competition in average balances outstanding. The average owed on a Discover card is $750; the comparable figures for Visa and Mastercard are $1,223 and $1,230 respectively. And while the typical customer charges $1,500 a year on a Discover card, for Visa and Mastercard the figure is nearly $2,000. Comparisons with the American Express basic card are difficult, because it is not really a charge card that encourages consumers to carry monthly balances on which they pay interest.
Low usage would be less of a problem at the other card companies than at Discover. The reason is that unlike American Express and banks issuing Mastercard and Visa, which receive up to $75 a year in fee income from each of their cards, Sears receives no such income from Discover. And the commission that store owners pay Discover on credit sales is generally about 2 percent, compared with 2.5 percent or more for Mastercard and Visa and 4 percent or more for American Express.
Discover's profitability, in short, is heavily dependent on card holders' running up large amounts, then incurring hefty interest charges by not paying their bills in full.
 
Effort to Gain Merchants
''Merchants are not giving the card the same acceptance as Visa and Mastercard, and shoppers are still reaching for other cards first,'' said George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago research firm that has also tracked Discover. ''These are big barriers that are not overcome overnight.''
But Mr. Butler, Discover's chief executive, is convinced that, over time, Discover can be as popular as Visa and Mastercard. Believing that shoppers will use their cards more if given the chance, he has been on a campaign to increase the number of merchants accepting Discover. The card is accepted at many well-known stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue, the Dayton Hudson department-store chain in the Middle West, and the Sharper Image, the purveyor of high-tech gadgetry based in San Francisco.
Although there are many conspicuous holdouts, including J. C. Penney, Federated Department Stores, Macy's and Walmart Stores, the card recently passed a milestone when the one-millionth merchant accepted Discover.
Discover officials have also developed programs making it easier for merchants to use the card, through ways of getting money to merchants, providing them with information on customers and lowering the merchant commission charge at stores where Discover volume is high.
 
Promotions to Card Holders
Discover has also been attacking the usage problem by going directly to card holders. Advertising of the annual rebate has been stepped up. But the maximum 1 percent rebate applies only on purchases that total more than $3,000, way above what most Discover card holders are spending. On total puchases of $1,000, the amount returned is $2.50.
To encourage Saks customers to use their Discover cards, the card group recently offered 10 percent off on all Saks purchases appearing on Discover bills. Mr. Butler says more promotions can be expected.
The lack of an annual fee has produced strong ''response rates,'' with roughly 5 percent of customers who are solicited to apply for a Discover card ending up receiving one. Industry response rates average 1.5 percent. The high response rate, in turn, has lowered Discover's customer acquisition costs, as has Discover's use of Sears's existing bill-processing centers. Equally important, because Sears processes all Discover transactions, Discover does not incur the 1.5 percent fee that banks charge to process one another's Visa and Mastercard transactions.
 
Debate Over Fees
''These are the reasons we seem to defy gravity and make money when others said it could not be done,'' said William H. Hodges, the former Citibank credit-card executive who now runs marketing at Discover.
But for Discover to earn the big returns it needs, many industry experts argue that it will have to impose an annual fee. By charging, say, $15 a year, Discover's 33 million cards would bring in nearly $500 million. Since most of that additional revenue would flow directly to the card operation's bottom line, Discover's profit could be increased strikingly.
But when Sears imposed a $15 fee in North Carolina and Wisconsin, because laws on interest rate ceilings in those states prevented it from charging 19.8 percent, many Discover holders cut their cards in half.
So for now, Mr. Butler says that there are no plans to impose a fee and that his group will continue to focus on getting customers to choose Discover.
''My guess is that next year we will be at an acceptable rate of return, and beyond that our returns will be better than acceptable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Investors Rush to Bid For Notes

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The first leg of the Treasury's $30 billion quarterly refunding auctions received a thunderous welcome from investors yesterday. More than $34 billion worth of bids were placed for the $10 billion worth of three-year notes that were sold.
Bidding by Japanese investors was particularly intense, dealers said.
The total size of the bids, which in Wall Street parlance is known as the ''cover,'' was the largest for an auction of three-year notes since the auction of August 1987, credit market analysts said. 
 
Yield Up Sharply
At the auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.43 percent, up sharply from the 7.77 percent average yield on the three-year notes sold at the last auction, on Nov. 9.
The Japanese, who normally eschew such short-term shorter-term maturities at these auctions, placed bids on about half the issue, or more.
Individual investors and smaller commercial banks, seeking to take advantage of recent sharp increases in interest rates, placed nearly $1.2 billion worth of noncompetitive bids for the new securities, meaning they would take the issue at whatever price and interest rate the average bid produced.
''Bids from Japanese houses could well have exceeded half the issue,'' said Gib Clark, a senior vice president and head trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''But the actual award will probably be more like 35 percent'' of the total, he added.
Despite the size of the bidding from Japan, Mr. Clark and others said that unless interest rates rise further, the Japanese are unlikely to be active participants when the 10-year notes and 30-year bonds are offered at auctions scheduled today and tomorrow.
 
Effect of Higher Japanese Rates
''At these yield levels, I think this says that Japanese interest has been spent on the three-year,'' he said. ''But if the yield on the long bond gets above 8 5/8, that could spark some demand since it improves the spread to the yen bond market.''
Interest rates have been moving up in Japan for much of the last month, narrowing the advantage that dollar-denominated interest rates have generally enjoyed.
Robert G. Graustein, a managing director at Sanwa-BGK Securities Company L.P., said ''there is always some participation'' from Japanese investors at the 10-year and 30-year auctions.
''But right now we are not looking for an overwhelming bid,'' he said. ''What we saw at the three-year auction may be illustrative of a new tack by Japanese investors to stay away from the longer-term securities.''
Late yesterday, the 10-year notes to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.54 percent. Meanwhile, the 30-year bonds were offered late in the day in when-issued trading at 8.54 percent.
 
Selling of Outstanding Issues
In what could be a portent of today's market activity, after the results of yesterday's auction were announced at about 3:30 P.M. selling accelerated in the outstanding 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes and 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds.
Those issues posted the biggest price declines in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 94 3/32, down half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.58 percent, up from 8.52 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes fell 11/32, to a late offered price of 95 14/32, to yield 8.57 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, down 3/32, to yield 8.40 percent.
 
Treasury Bill Rates Mixed
Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.78 percent, down 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Rates on six-month bills rose 1 basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.71 percent.
In the corporate bond market, no new issues were priced yesterday, as corporate treasurers were unwilling to compete with the Treasury for investors.
''Nobody wants to get in the way of the Government,'' one investment banker said.
Prices of secondary issues of investment-grade corporate bonds fell in line with those of Treasury notes and bonds. Actively traded intermediate-term securities dipped by a range of one-eighth point to one-quarter point, while long-term bonds fell by about one-half point.
 
Sale of California Bonds
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was dominated by a competitive sale of $425 million of general obligation bonds from the State of California.
A bid from an syndicate led by Bank of America won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2010.
The bonds were reoffered at prices to yield 5.50 percent on bonds maturing in 1991, to 7 percent in 2010.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Will Federated's Chief Have Time?

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
At the helm of Bullock's five years ago, Allen I. Questrom ordered the West Coast department store chain to pull out of a data exchange through which competing chains tracked short-term shifts in market share. He warned his merchandisers and buyers to think of the long term because short-term gains mean little in the life of any business.
The advice epitomizes the strategy of Mr. Questrom, who left Neiman Marcus last week to become the chairman and chief executive of Federated Department Stores and the Allied Stores Corporation, the financially troubled divisions of the Campeau Corporation.
Given his outlook, some people who know him well are wondering whether he will have the opportunity to apply it at a company that within months must develop a bankruptcy reorganization plan that satisfies creditors.
 
'A Tough Case'
''It's a case where a long-term thinker will also have to worry about paying the daily bills and have all the creditors looking over his shoulder; it's a tough case,'' said Michael Gould, president and chief executive of Giorgio Beverly Hills, the cosmetic producer in Los Angeles. The chairman of the J. W. Robinson Company when Mr. Questrom was at Bullock's, Mr. Gould said: ''I really don't know if he can do it, although I am certain he knows what should be done.'' 
Left to his own devices, Mr. Questrom, who is 49 years old, has carried out similar plans throughout a career spent mostly at Federated. ''His pattern of operation is similar wherever he goes,'' said Norman Matthews, a former president of Federated Department Stores and now a consultant and investor. ''He doesn't believe in a constant round of price cutting. He's a long-term player who will do what's necessary to bring inventory, taste level and physical conditions of the stores up to where they should be. I expect him to do that at Federated.'' Asked what he would most apply from his experience, Mr. Questrom said in an interview yesterday: ''I have not been responsible for any breakthroughs in retailing, just a deep conviction that fundamentals are what count, like having the proper merchandise, fresh, clean inventories and good service. It's when we have to give up on those fundamentals that we run into trouble.''
Federated and Allied, the two American retailing arms of Federated Stores Inc., the American holding company for the Campeau Corporation of Toronto, filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15 saying they had debts of $7.5 billion. The stores include Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and Abraham & Straus.
Clearly, Federated Stores faces enormous difficulties.
To satisfy creditors, its 260 stores must develop a strategy to produce stronger revenue and profit while making their operations more economical. In trying to reach that goal, Mr. Questrom will work with G. William Miller, an investment banker and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who is the chairman of Federated Stores. He will also work with James M. Zimmerman, the president and chief operating officer.
Among their choices are whether Bloomingdale's should be taken off the market and sold later if better bids develop, or not be sold at all. Should other divisions be put on the block? What of marginal stores? And, above all, can Federated Stores be refinanced so that its more urgent debt needs are met?
 
Will Aid in Credibility
Because of Federated Stores' immense problems, some retail executives think Mr. Miller and Mr. Questrom were hired more for their public relations value than for any miracle aid they can provide. Mr. Questrom headed two of Federated's best-known divisions, Rich's and Bullock's, the latter of which has since been sold to R. H. Macy & Company.
Their selection will go a long way to creating new credibility for Federated at a time when its stores need fresh merchandise and sympathetic creditors.
Mr. Questrom is expected to guide Federated Stores away from a policy of price-cutting promotions to an emphasis on more fashionable goods at higher prices, which would provide increased profit margins.
When he arrived at both Rich's and Bullock's, he found that the emphasis was on price cutting and on moderate-priced apparel. He changed the approach to higher quality and stressed ''congruity'' of merchandise. As Mr. Matthews put it: '' 'Congruity' in his lexicon meant that a woman who bought a dress for $200 should not be offered $29 shoes but should be offered much more fashionable shoes at $70 to $100. He just wouldn't allow any gap in the taste level.''
 
The '88 Resignation
Given his long-term strategies, it is not surprising that Mr. Questrom resigned from Federated to become president and chief executive at Neiman Marcus in 1988 when he feared that Federated would have to arrange a leveraged buyout to counter the takeover threat from Campeau at the time. Leveraging the company would increase the push on short-term gains or volume for volume's sake, he feared. It was not his view of what the retailing business should be.
Mr. Questrom said his immediate objective now was to visit all the store divisions in the next month and meet with suppliers. ''We are focusing on deliveries of merchandise and making progress there,'' he said. ''About 111 of our top 117 suppliers have resumed shipping to us and we think that is good.''
He said he would stress ''good day-to-day running of the business, which means taking care of the customer in a manner that will make us the best.'' He added that Federated has nine store divisions that ''were well keyed into their markets; but this was disrupted by the financial problems that developed.'' He added, ''We want to get back to what made us good before that happened.''
 
'Pep Rally'
Yesterday, at the company's Cincinnati headquarters, Mr. Questrom met with the chairmen and presidents of the nine store divisions in what was described as both a welcoming session and pep rally.''
The evening before, at a dinner with the group, he told them he had not returned for the money - he will receive about $12 million in a five-year contract - but to respond to the challenge of helping the company survive. ''From the moment I turned down the job two weeks ago, Federated people have been calling me in Dallas to ask me to change my mind,'' he said at the dinner.
Two women influenced his decision, he told the executives. One was Gladys Lazarus, the widow of Ralph Lazarus, a former chairman and chief executive of Federated, whose father, Fred Jr., founded the company in 1926. ''If you don't take this job, Allen, you will always wonder if you couldn't have made a difference,'' Mrs. Lazarus said. ''Besides, there are 100,000 employees whose future could depend upon you.''
 
A Wife's Advice
He discussed that plea with his wife, Kelli, and said he was taken aback when she said: ''You know, when you become successful at any job, what happens to you? You become cranky and you put on weight. That's what's happening now. Take the job!''
A native of Massachusetts, Mr. Questrom started his career in 1965 on the executive training squad at Abraham & Straus, and in eight years advanced to merchandise manager. After running both Rich's and Bullock's, he added to his top post at Bullock's an executive vice presidency at Federated in 1987. In May 1988 he became a vice chairman. When Campeau acquired Federated, it wanted to appoint him chairman, but he left for Neiman Marcus.
Mr. Questrom and his wife frequently visit restaurants and museums, where they study what people eat, wear, watch and buy. Mr. Questrom, who says his wife has been a major influence on him, credits her with ''dragging me to events to make sure I get exposed to them.''

HEADLINE: Bush Calls For Some Regulation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
In the most thorough presentation of his economic views since he took office, President Bush today embraced the mainstream Republican philosophy of reliance on private initiatives and market forces. But his first Economic Report to Congress did not have the ideological edge of those submitted by Ronald Reagan.
For example, where Mr. Reagan insisted uniformly on less Government participation in economic and business affairs, Mr. Bush advocated greater Federal involvement in such areas as child care, education, basic research and environmental protection.
''In some cases,'' the President declared, ''well-designed regulation can serve the public interest.''
Moreover, where the Reagan reports were often sharply critical of the Federal Reserve, blaming the central bank for whatever woes the economy was facing at the time, Mr. Bush endorsed the Fed's policies. 
 
'Inflation Must Be Controlled'
''I strongly support the Federal Reserve's goal of noninflationary growth and share with them the conviction that inflation must be controlled and reduced in a predictable fashion,'' he said.
The President predicted ''strong, sustained economic growth'' in the years ahead but said the economy's ''potential'' must be ''more often fully utilized than in previous decades.''
Mr. Bush's Economic Report and the accompanying report by his Council of Economic Advisers, both of which are required by law, broke no new ground in terms of policy proposals. But the documents provided the economic rationale behind many of the policies detailed last month in the President's budget and State of the Union Message.
 
Cautious on Promises
Perhaps seeking to justify his Administration's lack of bold new initiatives, Mr. Bush said, ''The American people are ill served by promises that cannot be kept.''
His ''primary goal,'' the President said, ''is to achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic growth.''
To that end, he set forth five ambitious, if general, principles that he said guided his economic policies: to achieve a budget surplus so that Government borrowing can be reduced; to support a monetary policy that insures maximum economic growth while reducing inflation; to reform the tax, legal and regulatory systems; to design regulations that do not impede market forces, and to promote freer trade worldwide.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who was primarily responsible for preparing today's report, said Mr. Bush ''stays actively informed about the economy.''
The President, Mr. Boskin said, was particularly concerned that the report emphasize the view that a strong economy and an improved environment are not conflicting goals.
In his report, Mr. Bush called strengthening the Clean Air Act ''one of my top legislative priorities.''
The President did not mention in his report the caution he expressed on Monday, in a speech to an international environmental group, when he warned against steps to counteract global warming if such steps might damage the economy. But his economic advisers discussed the reasoning behind the President's position, saying that important scientific uncertainties needed to be resolved before costly moves were made to produce small reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr. Boskin is an Administration insider who advised Mr. Bush on economic matters during the 1988 election campaign and is influential now in policy making. That is in sharp contrast with the role of economic advisers in the previous Administration. During the Reagan years, the economic advisers were often scorned and almost always ignored.
The other members of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, who re participated in writing the report, are John B. Taylor, also of Stanford, and Richard L. Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
Accent on the Positive
Mr. Bush emphasized the positive characteristics of the economy of the 1980's - strong overall growth, an increase in employment and steady inflation rates. He did not mention an aspect his Democratic opponents have seized on - the shift in the tax burden away from the wealthy and toward the middle class.
He said he was committed to the low income tax rates and broadened tax base enacted in the last decade, but he said a reduction in the capital gains tax rate was one of his ''highest legislative priorities.''
Opponents of a capital gains tax cut believe such a cut violates the fundamental principles of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Among the other points in Mr. Bush's report and the more detailed one prepared by his economic advisers are these:
* The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law should be extended as an end in itself, rather than a measure of last resort.
* The Government no longer needs to worry about whether enough jobs are available for workers but must shift its focus to whether there will be enough skilled workers to fill the available jobs in this decade.
* Industrial policy and protectionism are detrimental to economic growth and should be avoided.
* A ''fundamental reassessment'' should be made of financial regulations to take account of new banking and market practices.
 
Would Extend Gramm-Rudman
Mr. Bush and his economists stressed the Administration's proposal to extend the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, requiring annual targets for spending and revenues, through the end of the decade so that an overall budget surplus could be attained and a start made on cutting the Government's $3 trillion debt. The law now would expire in 1993.
In the past, the law has been viewed as an unpleasant alternative to invoke when Congress and the President could not agree on budget terms. In his report today, Mr. Bush did not mention working with Congress on the budget.
Mr. Boskin said this was the first time to his knowledge that a President in his Economic Report had specifically advocated a budget surplus. Mr. Bush said it would turn the Government into ''a saver, providing funds for capital formation and economic growth by reducing the national debt.''
The Administration maintains that if its policies are followed and economic growth continues, the budget can be balanced by 1996. Many economists believe that view is overly optimistic.
The policy of achieving a surplus is not a new one for the Administration, but the President and other officials have begun to emphasize it as a counterweight to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's plan to cut Social Security taxes.
 
Stress on Skilled Workers
The report's chapter called ''Human Resources in the 1990's'' highlights how demographic and economic changes in this decade will lead to the need for more skilled workers. ''These developments,'' Mr. Bush said, ''will shift attention away from worries about the supply of jobs that have haunted us since the 1930's and toward new concerns about the supply of workers and skills.''
That would mean bringing more disadvantaged Americans ''into the economic mainstream,'' the President said. His economists' report suggested it might also mean changes in immigration laws to favor skilled workers.
Mr. Bush reaffirmed his strong opposition to industrial policy, in which the Government would use tax laws and regulations to help some industries over others. ''Second-guessing the market is the way to raise Government spending and taxes, not living standards,'' he said.
In the same vein, he said he would ''continue to resist calls for protection and managed trade'' and declared, ''Increased global competition is an opportunity for the United States and the world, not a threat.''
Some Democrats advocate industrial policy and trade restrictions to reverse what they see as a competitive disadvantage the United States faces, especially in dealing with Japan.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Social Security: Paying the Piper

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FOR most of Washington's movers and shakers, the big question about Social Security is whether there will be enough cash to honor the pension promises made to the giant baby boom generation. For Stephen J. Entin, a Reagan Administration Treasury official now at the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, the big question is whether the promises should have been made in the first place. It was foolish, he argues, to commit trillions of scarce tax dollars to a doubling of future benefits.
Mr. Entin's view is pure poison to elected officials, who would rather stand trial for wife beating than be accused of touching one curl on Social Security's carefully coiffed head. But the politics of benefits growth may change, as wage earners are asked to underwrite the escalating costs of both pensions and medical care for retirees. 
Employers and employees each pay a 6.2 percent tax on wages to cover old-age and disability pension costs, with a maximum combined levy of $7,387 a year. That is a whopping tenfold increase over the maximum paid as recently as 1970. But an overwhelming majority in Congress supported the last round of tax increases in 1983 in the belief that the public was behind them. And not without reason: A New York Times/CBS Poll taken just before the vote showed that most Americans accepted higher taxes as the price of guaranteeing future pensions.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat whose proposal to roll back the tax rate by one-fifth has caused much gnashing of teeth in Washington, does not challenge the sanctity of this implicit bargain. Quite the contrary: He argues that the higher tax is not worth paying only because Congress and the White House have reneged on their side of the deal. The revenues, he says, are being used to cover current budget deficits rather than future pension costs.
Mr. Entin's attack on Social Security-as-usual is far more radical. As a supply-sider, he likes the idea of cutting the payroll tax because it is a barrier to employment. And as a conservative, he thinks Government has gone too far in fattening prospective retirees' benefits at the expense of workers' take-home pay.
Under current law, initial benefits are computed for each group of workers as they reach normal retirement age. The formula replaces an average of 41 percent of pre-retirement wages, with low-wage earners receiving more (55 percent) and high-wage earners receiving less (27 percent). The monthly benefit is then frozen, save for cost-of-living adjustments.
Today's benefits certainly do not keep retirees in caviar and Dom Perignon: The typical unmarried worker reaching 65 this year will receive a modest $8,300 annually. But initial benefits will climb with average wage rates, which the Social Security Administration estimates will grow by 150 percent over the next 75 years.
The average single retiree in the year 2065 can thus expect to receive $20,300 in 1989 dollars. In that same year, the inflation-adjusted pension for a married worker eligible for the maximum benefit will reach $47,900. And today's tax rates have been set accordingly to cover the anticipated costs.
What is wrong with a rich nation sharing the bounty with its retirees? Nothing at all, say the policy makers who have shaped and guarded the Depression-born public pension system.
But Mr. Entin is unpersuaded. ''Only a handful of people'' have thought through the philosophy of matching benefits to wages, he said. And ''only in the last few years has there been any real understanding'' of the taxes that would have to be levied to support the constant replacement rate.
Even those who support more generous pension benefits, Mr. Entin contends, might think twice if they understood what was happening to the payroll tax-supported Medicare program. Federal hospital insurance for pensioners now costs 1.2 percent of gross national product. But that figure is expected to hit 3 percent by the year 2050. And the combined costs of pensions and health care for the elderly and disabled are likely to reach 9.66 percent of G.N.P. - almost double the current level.
Mr. Entin's proposed fix: Raise the age at which today's young workers could retire at the regular wage-replacement rate. They would still be free to retire at 65, or even 62, and at average benefits no lower than those leaving the work force this year. But to qualify for the hefty increases anticipated in the current formula, they would have to keep working until age 72.
For the moment, this proposal could not fly with the aid of a 100-mile-an-hour tailwind. But under the right conditions, political turkeys have a way of growing the wings of eagles. The politics of Social Security will change if and when a majority decide that Social Security benefits have reached the level of luxury rather than necessity.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes Day Mixed As Mark Remains Strong

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed against other primary currencies yesterday as buyers were preoccupied with the West German mark.
Currency dealers described dollar trading as uneventful because the mark has been the center of attention. The mark has been buoyed by developments in Eastern Europe that are expected to benefit West Germany economically. 
''It's more of a mark-driven market right now rather than a dollar-driven market,'' said Thomas Palladino, a dealer at the New York office of the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank. ''The sentiment still seems to be in favor of selling the dollar but more so of buying the mark.''
