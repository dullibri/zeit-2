HEADLINE: In the Oil Trading Pit, Reflexes Must Be Fast

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
At 8:30 yesterday morning, Albert H. Helmig Jr. figured that world crude oil prices were about to head downward. He had the reasons all worked out, based on his assessment of supply and demand, his experience as a broker and his studies of economics and finance.
A little more than an hour later, as he prepared to lead a team from Energex, his oil and petroleum products brokerage firm, into the crude oil trading pit at the New York Mercantile Exchange on the eighth floor of the World Trade Center, he was putting his projections out of mind. In the trading pits, theories can inhibit reflexes. Ever since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the oil trading pit at the New York Merc has been no place for slow reflexes.
''The only thing that matters is where people put their money,'' said Mr. Helmig, a 38-year-old who first visited a commodity trading floor as a child to watch his father trade wool. ''You have to let the market tell you what's happening and not think too much, or you can lose a lot of money.'' 
The Merc's crude oil pit is home to the world's largest market in oil futures, which are contracts to deliver oil at specific dates from next month - the practical equivalent of a spot oil price for immediate delivery - to dates up to 18 months away. The November contract lost 72 cents yesterday to close at $37.53.
In the early 1980's, most oil was sold under long-term contracts geared to prices posted by OPEC overseas and by the leading oil companies in the United States. But that has changed.
Today, most oil users buy in the spot market, and the New York Merc has emerged as the place investors, Governments and consumers alike track the spot market. In some cases, price jumps in Merc futures contracts have kicked off immediate price increases for end products like gasoline, as skittish retailers try to build up profits in anticipation of higher costs.
The Merc contract specifies delivery of 1,000 barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude, or one of nine domestic and foreign oils of a similar quality, to Cushing, Okla., a big oil storage and distribution center. Less than 2 percent of the Merc trades actually result in such deliveries. But each trade gives an instant snapshot of the value of the benchmark crude, the clearest price signal available anywhere in the oil market. As a result, traders off the exchange adjust their actual deals, depending on whether the crude they are trading is more or less valuable than the Texas crude and the costs of delivering it to other terminals.
Merc contracts for other petroleum products, including unleaded gasoline, heating oil, propane and natural gas, also act as benchmarks.
 
World's Meeting Place
Thus, although it is smaller than a modest street intersection, the Merc is, in effect, the meeting place where all of the world's major buyers and sellers of oil and oil products come together.
''We don't set prices here, but this is where the market discovers the price,'' said Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the exchange's board.
These days, with oil prices seen as a key factor in the vulnerability of the United States and other industrial countries to recession, the Merc's trading day is closely followed by stock markets, bond traders and other markets around the world.
To the uninitiated, the trading pit is bewildering. At 9:45, in a tornado of screaming and waving arms, the crude oil pit erupted into its trading day. Some 200 men and a smattering of women, most of them considerably younger than the tall, balding Mr. Helmig, crowded into the trading ring. Telephone clerks in booths nearby added to the pandemonium, trying to get the buy and sell orders to their brokers.
 
Price Swings Begin
As the first deals were struck, brokers ripped off tickets recording them and tossed them into the center of the ring, where they were collected by exchange employees and sent off to be entered into computers. Copies were also being handed off to runners to take to telephone clerks for confirmation. Soon the ''Novee'' crude oil price - crude oil for November delivery - was sliding, down to nearly $37 a barrel. Then a number of large ''trade'' customers - oil companies, refiners and others that actually have or want oil supplies - jumped in with buy orders, and the first of a number of price swings began.
Throughout the day, Mr. Helmig and other participants, including brokers connected to the crowded floor by telephone, kept one eye on the activity and another on news headlines. Everyone was on edge in case of an event that might suddenly change the outlook for oil prices.
Much of the trading involves balancing price spreads between different products. In recent weeks, for example, futures contracts for home heating oil have been surging in anticipation of winter demand. But events in the Persian Gulf have overshadowed every other trend.
''Your nerves get frayed in markets like this,'' said Richard D. Donovan, the Shearson Lehman Hutton vice president who oversees Shearson's international energy department. ''The fundamentals of supply and demand aren't as useful as usual, and you are reduced to trading headlines, the most difficult type of trading.''
The Merc introduced energy futures trading with a contract for home heating oil in 1978. Gasoline was added in 1981, crude oil in 1983, propane in 1987, residual oil, or boiler fuel, in 1989, and natural gas this spring.
 
The Main Attraction
In every case, the main attraction of a futures contract for corporate traders, from oil producers to major consumers like airlines, is to hedge against risks that prices will change. Some buy futures contracts to guarantee that they will have supplies at a predictable price. Producers may sell contracts to lock in a profit margin.
As the contract becomes due, its price and the actual spot price for immediate delivery of the oil come together. In calmer times, the price for futures in oil and oil products typically increases with the length of the contract, reflecting the greater uncertainty over what the distant spot price will be.
Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, however, the short-term prices have been highest. Oil experts say there is plenty of oil in the world, which serves to hold down long-term prices, but everyone is afraid that war in the Persian Gulf could drastically interrupt supplies in a matter of weeks.
''The higher the price goes, the more dramatic the eventual fall will be,'' said Mr. Donovan, whose Shearson team is the largest in the Merc market. ''This market would drop $10 a barrel in a week if there was some quick end to the Kuwait situation in sight.''
On Monday, the short-term price, which is the only contract that trades without any limit to how far it can rise or fall in a day, climbed so rapidly that all of the contracts for ''Deece'' (pit talk for December) and later months hit their limit of $2 in the crude pit. Trading in those contracts was frozen. Yesterday, some of the contracts rose the limit again to close the differential with the ''Novee'' contract, then softened enough for trading to resume.
 
An 11-Minute Break
Mr. Helmig had a fairly typical day in many respects, given the market's extreme volatility. He managed an 11-minute break before the 3:10 closing, which he used to call a customer. (''Lunch is for wimps,'' said one of his employees.) And Energex was among the busiest independent brokers, ending up arranging trades for 10,000 contracts, accounting for crude and oil products worth $400 million.
But it wasn't all smooth by any means. Late in the day, a client asked Energex to trade 30 lots for a number of delivery dates far into next year. The farther out a contract is, the harder it is to find anyone to trade with, so Mr. Helmig and his staff found themselves forced to turn down the chance to handle 400 other potential contracts to concentrate on the earlier order.
''It can be brutal,'' he said wearily at the end of the day, noting that about 40 percent of the floor brokers depart within two years.

HEADLINE: When Is It a Recession?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
At a time when many Americans believe that a recession has descended on the country, they are being told by Government officials to put their worries aside for the moment because other economic issues, mainly inflation, have to be dealt with first.
This message is coming from the Federal Reserve, but the Bush Administration is not openly challenging the thesis. And the top financial officials of the six other major industrial nations, meeting in Washington this week, have also declared that recession, or the threat of it, is still a second-rung issue.
The Group of Seven industrial nations - the United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy - even issued a communique calling recession talk too pessimistic. The communique spoke of ''solid growth'' in the industrial world, ignoring the obviously sluggish economies in the United States, Canada and Britain. 
Millions of Americans, in particular, are experiencing unemployment, wage freezes, bankruptcies and falling real estate prices, and concluding that what they are living through constitutes a recession. How can their perception, reported in public opinion polls, differ so strikingly from that of the Federal Reserve and its counterparts elsewhere?
The answer is that the central banks remain more worried by the threat of inflation than of recession, and that to ignore the inflationary dangers now will only mean a deeper recession later. The Middle East crisis is the principal reason for the anti-inflationary consensus, mainly because it pushed up oil prices so sharply.
Apart from the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates up to slow a sharp fall in the dollar since July. A weak dollar is inflationary because it pushes up the price of imports and the Federal Reserve tries to counteract this by keeping interest rates high enough to convince holders of foreign currency to buy dollars and invest them in American securities.
The problem with this strategy is that high interest rates, the tool used by Western central banks to fight inflation, tends to make weak economies, like that of the United States, even weaker, by discouraging the borrowing that finances purchases and investment.
''The Federal Reserve, in particular, is admitting, in effect, that under the current strategy, it cannot avoid a contraction in the economy over the next one or two quarters,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. ''Most of us consider that to be a recession.''
 
A New Definition
No wonder, then, that Alan Greenspan, in testimony last week before the Joint Economic Committee, argued for a definition of recession that is more stringent than the traditional public concept of one. The popular view is that a recession occurs when the gross national product - the total value of the new goods and services that the nation is constantly producing - shrinks for six consecutive months.
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the economy was very sluggish, so much so that the G.N.P. grew at an annual rate of only 1 percent during the first six months of 1990, including a minuscule four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. Without much change in the public's current sense of malaise, the G.N.P. could easily slip into negative growth for two quarters, he says.
A true recession, Mr. Greenspan argued, is a ''cumulative unwinding of economic activity,'' and not simply a few months of mildly negative G.N.P. growth that might be reversed when the Commerce Department issues its annual revisions of earlier statistics.
The Greenspan formula requires a steep, widespread decline in economic activity, the sort of trouble that develops when stockpiles of unsold goods build up as consumer spending drops. As a result, factory orders are canceled, corporate profits fall, capital investment is cut back and the unemployment rate shoots up. Looking for Elbow Room? Many economists accept this process as a key cause of some postwar recessions. But some note that by raising the issue now, Mr. Greenspan might be trying to give the Fed elbow room to keep interest rates high, even during a quarter or two of negative G.N.P. growth.
''The Fed declares that there is no recession, so there is nothing that requires drastic policy changes,'' said Alan Levenson, an economist at the WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm. ''But an individual can look at what is happening to himself and end up behaving as if he were in a recession.''
If the Federal Reserve is seeking elbow room, it is doing so largely out of concern that rising oil prices, if not countered with high interest rates, will produce a situation in which workers successfully push for wage increases to offset the higher costs of gasoline, heating fuel and numerous petroleum-based products. The resulting wage-price spiral, Mr. Greenspan argues, would force the Federal Reserve to counterattack by pushing up interest rates very sharply, in the end provoking greater economic weakness than exists today. Something like this occurred after the Arab oil embargo in October 1973.
The Group of Seven's communique, signed by Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, made the same argument, stating that ''stability oriented monetary policies'' - a euphemism for high interest rates - would ''reduce the risks of lower economic growth'' in the future. And Mr. Brady joined in the recession putdown, stating at a news conference that the American economy still has ''underlying power.''
Nevertheless, the danger for the Fed, and for the nation, is that the United States will fall into recession while Mr. Greenspan and the 17 other Federal Reserve policy makers are still maintaining rates at present levels. The interest payments on mortgages and most other consumer loans are at 10 percent or more.
 
'You Hear of Real Weakness'
No economist knows how long it might be before the oil price shock wears off and the Consumer Price Index, which jumped in August, subsides to an annual rate of less than 5 percent, the level that has prevailed for most of the last five years. But even if the oil shock inflation does not subside soon, the recession danger has prompted some economists to urge the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates anyway. A minority among the Federal Reserve's policy makers favor this approach, including Martha Seger, a governor.
''If you talk to people who are real business people and not economists sitting in a library or the Federal Reserve, you hear of real weakness,'' she said. ''And if you talk to people in construction and housing, it is really terrible.''
That raises the definition question again. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a prestigious private institute that has become the nation's official arbiter of when recessions begin and end, offers a definition that seems closer to the Greenspan view than the popular one. It says a recession is ''a recurring period of decline in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year and marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Can Banks Survive a Recession?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
While economists disagree on whether a recession has started, many large American banks are concluding that by some measures their loan portfolios are already in the worst shape since the end of the 1974-75 recession. That fact has helped to create the gloomiest investment outlook for many of these banks in more than a decade.
''Heading into a recession, we're worse now than we were coming out of the last major recession,'' said Thomas H. Hanley, a bank analyst for Salomon Brothers, referring to the level of nonperforming assets at large banks. He forecast that loan problems would increase substantially over the next few years. 
By his calculation, problem loans at 35 large banks, excluding those to developing countries, amounted to 2.6 percent of total loans at the end of last year. He estimates that they will rise to 3.5 percent by the end of this year. Problem loans include those listed as nonperforming, which normally means payments are overdue or likely to become so, and loans renegotiated to provide breaks for the borrower, as well as real estate loans on foreclosed property.
 
Highest in a Decade
By contrast, the problem-loan ratio in the 1980's peaked at 3.4 percent in 1984, as the country recovered from the 1981-82 recession. The expected 1990 level would be the highest since 4 percent in 1977 and 5.3 percent in 1976, after the most severe postwar recession ended in 1975.
At the moment, rising real estate problems are the biggest concern to many analysts. In the last three years, the amount of troubled real estate loans at the nation's banks almost doubled even before the Chase Manhattan Corporation said last week that real estate problems were the largest single cause of a $1 billion charge against earnings that will cause the bank to report a loss for the current quarter.
Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service cited the real estate problems in lowering the rating on Chase's bonds, putting its subordinated debt just below investment grade - an area that is commonly referred to as ''junk.''
Despite such problems, there remains optimism that the commercial banks will not follow the path of the savings and loan industry, where losses mounted until a huge Government bailout was required.
''The data suggest it will take further weakening of the economy, to the point of massive defaults in other than the real estate sector, before the banking industry could be pushed from its present uneasy state into massive insolvency on the scale suffered by the S.& L.'s,'' said Warren Heller, the president of Veribanc Inc. in Wakefield, Mass., a company that monitors bank safety.
At the end of March, the most recent date for which comprehensive data are available, banks counted $48.6 billion in nonperforming real estate loans, including foreclosed lands, up 37 percent from a year earlier and up 91 percent from 1987.
In the first quarter of this year, Veribanc estimates, all banks together lost $1.3 billion on real estate activities, as profits from mortgages that were being paid were more than offset by losses on loans that went bad.
With real estate problems now appearing in the South as well as the Northeast, the general expectation is that the level of bad loans is likely to rise if business activity continues to slow. Typically, many real estate developers manage to hang on for a time, making payments on loans even though their projects are not providing sufficient cash flow, but eventually they are unable to meet their obligations. That is why problem-loan levels usually peak after a recession and why the rise this early has sounded alarms.
Most of the losses being recorded stem from loans for commercial real estate and property development. Losses on single-family mortgage loans remain very low, although that could change if more homeowners cannot meet payments on loans that are larger than their property is now worth.
Over all, the banks followed by Salomon charged off as uncollectible a total of $7.60 out of each $1,000 in loans in 1989. Mr. Hanley expects that to rise to $10.20 this year, a figure that would be higher than in any year since he began compiling the data in 1971.
The real estate problems vary widely, and one disturbing fact is that while the situation seems to be improving in some of the worst-hit areas, including Texas and Oklahoma, Veribanc says levels of nonperforming loans are rising in most other states. Banks in all six New England states saw the level of such loans at least double in the 12 months through March, and there were also sizable increases in many Middle Atlantic and Southern states.
Bank accounting is both complicated and full of discretion, which is one reason many investors apparently fear that the reality may be worse than the figures indicate. Although most bank stocks rose yesterday as the stock market rallied, most bank shares are down well over 50 percent over the last 12 months.
''We've got a mini-panic out there'' in the bank stocks, said Mr. Hanley, who thinks the bottom in such stocks is approaching but is not yet here.
An encouraging fact is that banks are generally better capitalized than they were a decade ago. The Salomon figures indicate that the average large bank had shareholder equity equal to 5.5 percent of assets at the end of last year, compared with 4.5 percent in 1973, before a recession began. In 1979, before higher oil prices helped set off a small 1980 recession and a more severe downturn in 1981 and 1982, the equity ratio was 4.2 percent.
But while banks are generally better capitalized today, many borrowers are not. The leverage boom of the 1980's left many companies with debt levels far above those of earlier eras. Consequently, they are probably more vulnerable to a recession.
While commercial real estate is now getting most of the attention from worried bank watchers, loans to what bank regulators now officially call ''highly leveraged transactions,'' such as leveraged buyouts, are also of concern. Investor worry over those loans is one reason banks now hesitate to make loans that will be included in that listing.
Exposure to such loans varies widely. Mr. Hanley calculates that Bankers Trust has 41 percent of its loans in one of the risky categories -commercial real estate, highly leveraged transactions or medium- to long-term loans to developing countries. By contrast, Republic New York has just 7 percent of its loans in those areas. Most other major banks are in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent.
The fact that a loan is in a risky category, or even that the borrower has stopped paying interest, does not mean that it will prove to be a bad loan. But at the moment, investors are fearful that as the economy weakens, many more loans will end up appearing to have been unwise.

HEADLINE: Bank Law Overhaul Proposed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed sweeping changes in the nation's banking industry today, including the repeal of the three main Federal regulatory laws, to ease the financial stress on the industry and on the Federal fund that insures deposits.
The chairman, L. William Seidman, told the House Banking Committee that Congress should drop significant portions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts investment banking activities of commercial banks; the McFadden Act, which limits interstate banking, and the Bank Holding Company Act, which generally limits non-banking institutions from controlling banks.
 
Other Remedies Needed
''We can only hold the fort if we do substantial restructuring of the industry,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''You can't cure this problem just by charging higher insurance premiums.'' 
While Mr. Seidman's proposal would permit banks to diversify into other businesses and enter new geographic regions, and would make it easier for other industries to acquire banks, he emphasized that it would not deregulate the banking industry. By permitting banks to enter other industries, Mr. Seidman said investors would be more likely to add capital to these institutions.
Mr. Seidman is the second important banking and finance official in recent days to tie changes in the strained deposit insurance system, which lawmakers and regulators agree are urgently needed to avoid its collapse, to an overhaul of the entire banking system.
 
Greenspan Urges Repeal
Two weeks ago, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that it should repeal the 57-year-old Glass-Steagall Act. In recent years, banks have been allowed through regulatory action to enter a variety of securities-related businesses, eroding Glass-Steagall restrictions. That trend continued last week when the Fed permitted a unit of J. P. Morgan & Company to engage in limited underwriting and trading of corporate shares.
As far back as 1987, Mr. Seidman has suggested significant modifications to the three Federal laws he discussed today, but his latest proposal comes as the Bush Administration and Congress are studying ways to prevent the depletion of the F.D.I.C. fund that insures bank deposits, which is at its weakest level since it was created during the Depression. The fund, which has $13.2 billion, lost money in the last two years and is expected this year to post another loss of at least $2 billion.
Bank regulators and auditors from the General Accounting Office have said an economic downturn or the failure of one or a few large institutions could exhaust the insurance fund, forcing a taxpayer rescue similar to the bailout of the savings and loan industry, whose insurance fund was depleted last year.
 
Significant Changes
Efforts over the last few years to overhaul the laws, particularly the Glass-Steagall Act, have failed. But the growing fear on Capitol Hill and at the White House that the banking problems could start to resemble those plaguing the savings and loan industry have fueled strong views among lobbyists and legislators that significant changes could be made when Congress returns in January.
While the Treasury Department has not yet announced its views on reforming the deposit insurance system, senior Treasury officials have said insurance changes should be linked to an overhaul of the banking system. The Treasury Department is required by the savings and loan bailout legislation of last year to produce a comprehensive plan for all deposit insurance by early next year.
In a speech on Monday before the Institute of International Bankers, Under Secretary of Treasury Robert R. Glauber said such an overhaul was necessary ''to make U.S. institutions more competitive.'' He also said that by increasing shareholder risk, more stringent capital standards would be useful in ''bringing a marketplace discipline'' to institutions that have come to rely too heavily on the Federal insurance fund.
 
Bill to Restrict Insurance
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, introduced a measure today to restrict deposit insurance coverage. Federal law protects deposits up to $100,000, but as a practical matter the F.D.I.C. has been reimbursing most depositors with more than $100,000 in accounts at both banks and savings and loan associations that fail.
Mr. Seidman defended that practice today, saying it is often cheaper to have a failed institution transfer all of its deposits to another institution rather than closing down and having all depositors paid by the insurance fund.
Mr. Seidman said that as part of his proposal significantly greater limits would be placed on what types of investments could be made by that part of a company that holds insured deposits.
Mr. Seidman said, for instance, that rules should be adopted restricting the ability of banks to use Government-insured deposits to make loans for raw land, speculative investments like ''junk bonds,'' loans to lesser-developed nations and many other types of long-term lending, except for home mortgages.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Apparel Makers' Last Stand?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE sighs of relief from the White House were almost audible last week when the House went along with the Senate, voting for sharper restrictions on imports of clothes, textiles and shoes. While Administration economists view the measure as a horror show of protectionism, to their delight the vote fell short of the two-thirds needed to override President Bush's expected veto.
But the cheering may prove premature. Textile makers, who led the charge to limit import growth to 1 percent annually, reportedly did not expect to win this time around. And the close call will force United States diplomats to watch their backs as they negotiate away import restrictions on apparel and textiles in return for much-desired concessions on business services and agriculture. 
Economists have agreed to disagree over the proposition that freer trade is always better trade. An articulate minority argues that protection of strategic high-technology sectors - electronics, perhaps - would increase America's future income. But it is hard to find an independent analyst who believes that America should protect ill-paying jobs and fat profits in textiles and apparel.
Under the ''temporary'' international Multi-Fiber Arrangement created 29 years ago, America negotiates import quotas by fabric and by country in the third world. The restraints, calculates William Cline, a researcher at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, are equivalent to a 50 percent tariff: consumers now pay an extra $20 billion annually for apparel.
A bit of this cash, about $250 per American family, ends up in the United States Treasury as added revenue from tariffs and corporate income taxes. But much of it, Mr. Cline estimates, goes directly to the manufacturers' bottom lines. Ironically, a good chunk of the windfall is scooped up by foreign producers, who are able to charge more because the system protects them from competition from more efficient third world countries that have already filled their quotas.
Trade barriers do mean more work in the domestic industry, Mr. Cline concedes. But the benefits to working America are limited; wages in the apparel industry average about $6.50 an hour, 40 percent less than the average manufacturing wage. And there is little reason to believe that the loss would raise unemployment for long: Most states where apparel and textiles are produced suffer from shortages of semi-skilled labor, and the labor market is apt to tighten more as the baby boom generation grows old.
The bill passed by Congress would have further painted the textile and apparel industry's protectionist lilies. Cutting the rate of growth of imports from about 7 percent to 1, Mr. Cline estimates, would raise Americans' annual bill for clothing and cloth by another $30 billion by the year 2000. And the poor would suffer most: Higher prices for clothing would cut the purchasing power of the poorest fifth of Americans by 8 percent.
An additional 250,000 apparel workers would have to be hired to replace roughly the same number reaching retirement age over the decade. But each of these jobs - relatively low-wage jobs -would cost consumers about $190,000 a year.
With President Bush's veto, the measure will be dead. But it may yet rise from the grave to deal a mortal blow to plans for trade liberalization in the so-called Uruguay Round negotiations, scheduled to end this year. The Administration is asking Europe to eliminate restrictions on American farm exports. And it wants third world countries to give a fair shake to exporters of services - banking, insurance, computer software and the like. In return, the American team has offered to phase out textile and apparel quotas over the next decade.
But the proposed deal is no more credible than the Administration's ability to win ratification by Congress. Under United States law, the trade package can be presented to legislators for a single up-or-down vote. And the White House is counting on the muscle of exporters who stand to gain from trade liberalization to neutralize the textile, apparel and shoe lobbies.
That is a plausible strategy. Legislators from North Carolina, for example, who routinely carry water for the textile industry, would find themselves under pressure from local farm groups to vote for liberal trade. But the strategy is by no means a sure winner.
Much depends on the willingness of Democrats to break with organized labor, which has decided to treat a threat to apparel jobs as a threat to the union movement. And much turns on the determination of the agriculture and service business lobbies to put trade liberalization at the top of their political agendas. Consumers, who would benefit from an end to apparel and textile quotas no matter what happens to exporters, hardly count at all.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Dip Slightly After 3 Big Increases

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
After three trading days of large increases, the price of oil dipped yesterday, with crude for November delivery off 72 cents a barrel, to $37.53, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gasoline and heating oil for October delivery were also down slightly.
Traders attributed the modest drops to profit taking and technical factors.
Crude and heating oil for delivery this winter and next spring, however, increased in price again yesterday. Gasoline rose for delivery in November and December but fell for delivery in January through April. 
No clear consensus on oil prices emerged, and the market remains susceptible to sudden rallies and plunges, said Michael Wilner, the president of the Hilltop Trading Company, a trading and brokerage firm on the floor of the Merc.
''It's like a car skidding on ice,'' he said. ''There's no predicting what it will do.''
 
Effect on Consumers
Consumers are already feeling the effects. The American Automobile Association said yesterday that its nationwide survey of service stations found an average price of $1.31 a gallon on Monday for self-service regular unleaded gasoline. That was up 23.5 cents since Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait - still below the 1981 record of $1.388, which adjusted for inflation would be comparable to $2 a gallon today.
Wholesale gasoline for October delivery fell 2.18 cents a gallon, to $1.0205, while heating oil slipped 2.72 cents, to $1.0120.
After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, reported that the nation's stocks of gasoline had risen sharply last week, to 222.3 million barrels from 217 million the week before. Supplies of heating oil and diesel fuel also rose. Crude oil stocks fell slightly, but supplies in all three categories were above last year's levels.
Less than 1 percent of the oil consumed each year in the United States is bought or sold on the New York Merc. But because the exchange represents competitive bidding by everyone from producers and refiners to professional traders and small investors, the resulting prices are used as benchmarks for the many private deals in which most of the world's oil changes hands.
 
Price Fluctuations
The cash price for immediate delivery in the United States tends to fluctuate within two to five cents of the nearest Merc contract, although the difference can widen if traders expect market conditions to change greatly before the contract's delivery date, said Peter C. Beutel, an oil price analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., a consulting firm in Hoboken, N.J. And while the Merc contract is for 10 low-density, low-sulfur grades that are easily refined, like West Texas Intermediate, grades that are heavier or more sulfur-laden tend to trade at certain discounts or premiums.
''The Merc is basically the central point of reference for everybody trading West Texas Intermediate, and everybody trading crude oil in the whole country,'' Mr. Beutel said.
Futures trading of the light, low-sulfur Brent blend on the International Petroleum Exchange in London provides the benchmark for trading in Europe, while East Asian futures contracts tend to be based on the heavy, high-sulfur Dubai blend. Trading of Brent and Dubai blends influences trading on the Merc and private deals in the United States.
 
When Prices Were Posted
Until a decade ago, most oil-producing countries posted official prices for their exports and signed long-term supply contracts with oil companies calling for delivery at the price prevailing when the oil was loaded. But this system collapsed when world markets became glutted with oil and producing countries were reluctant to reduce posted prices, quietly undercutting them by striking barter deals with international brokers instead. The brokers then resold the oil for cash to oil companies.
Today, oil-producing countries have generally abandoned posted prices, and have reduced the possible profits for middlemen by selling most oil under long-term supply contracts with oil companies. But the contracts call for the price to be set at the market level when the oil is delivered to the refinery, not when the oil is loaded aboard the tanker, said Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist for the Amoco Corporation in Chicago. The oil-producing country usually owns the oil until the tanker arrives.
As a result, an increase in oil prices on futures markets affects the cost of oil for refineries on the same day or the following day. It then takes five to seven days for the refinery to process the oil and deliver it to service stations and heating oil companies.

HEADLINE: Midmonth Vehicle Sales Decline by 4.7%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Rebates and year-end clearance deals helped sales of cars and light trucks in mid-September, but sales for the period were still 4.7 percent below the unusually strong volume of last year.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.9 million between Sept. 11 and Sept. 20, well above the 7.1 million rate for the first 10 days of the month. But the mid-September volume was below last year's comparable rate of 8.2 million. Through August, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.9 million. 
The sales results for mid-September surprised analysts, but several cautioned that auto makers would have difficulty sustaining them at current levels.
''We expected sales to go sideways instead of up or down,'' said Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. ''These numbers suggest that the drop in consumer confidence we are seeing in surveys does not spell an immediate collapse of the car and truck market.''
 
'Too Good to Pass Up'
''Even skittish consumers are finding the model year closeout bargains too good to pass up,'' said Tom Webb, an economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. ''The next test will be harder, though. Will sales survive falling real income levels? I doubt it.''
Philip K. Fricke, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, said ''the next 30 to 60 days will be key in terms of telling where the floor is going to be in the car and light-truck market.''
Analysts offered several theories for the sales results, including the possibility that mid-September sales may have been overstated unintentionally by the formula developed by the Commerce Department to correct for seasonal variations in auto sales activity. The formula renders a seasonally adjusted annual rate by dividing raw sales data by a correction factor, which is based on prior years' sales activity.
''But rebates have not been consistent with the seasons, making seasonal factors kind of suspect,'' Mr. Fricke said.
 
Car Sales Down 1.1%
The 10 companies that manufacture vehicles in the United States sold 209,663 cars between Sept. 11 and Sept. 20, down 1.1 percent from 211,966 cars a year earlier. Light-truck sales, which account for about one-third of vehicle sales, declined 10.6 percent since last year to 115,830 units.
Sales gains were posted by most Japanese car companies, while the Big Three domestic auto makers reported a collective decline of 10.1 percent in sales of cars and light trucks. In cars alone, Japanese auto makers with plants in the United States captured 15.6 percent of the domestic market, compared with 9.8 percent in the comparable period a year earlier.
The Chrysler Corporation continued to post the largest sales declines of any manufacturer. Chrysler's car sales fell 12.1 percent, to 24,700 cars, and light-truck sales dropped 18.5 percent, to 20,172 units.
The General Motors Corporation's car sales fell 6.4 percent in mid-September, to 99,924 cars. G.M.'s light-truck sales dropped 16.3 percent, to 50,969 units.
 
Escort Sales Help Ford
The Ford Motor Company sold 52,255 cars, a decline of 7.3 percent, while Ford's light-truck sales dropped 7.9 percent, to 38,750 units. Ford's car sales were helped by a rise in demand for the Escort subcompact in mid-September.
The No. 2 auto maker's light-truck sales were helped by continuing strong sales of the Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle. However, sales of the company's popular F-series pickup truck slipped.
The Honda Motor Company sold 13,364 cars manufactured at its plant in Marysville, Ohio, a gain of 21.1 percent over the similar period last year.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of cars made in Georgetown, Ky., more than doubled, to 11,596 cars.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Making Computers a Million Times Faster

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25

 BODY:
In 1983, the International Business Machines Corporation dropped an ambitious project to develop blazingly fast computers using superconducting circuits, concluding that such machines would never be economically feasible. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Sperry Corporation scaled back similar research efforts, and American work virtually halted on superconducting computers, which would operate far faster than today's machines because electrical resistance is eliminated.
Now some researchers are advocating a renewed attempt to develop superconducting computers, inspired by promising discoveries in the last few years.
But as American researchers contemplate entering the field once again, they find themselves well behind the Japanese, who have continued their efforts all along. And again questions are being raised about whether the United States, by not maintaining long-range research, has blown another opportunity. 
''As a result, we have allowed the Japanese to get ahead of us in some of these device areas,'' said Herbert Dwight, president of Superconductor Technologies Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., start-up company that develops electronic devices from superconductors.
Superconductors are materials, either metal alloys or ceramics, that lose all resistance to the flow of electricity. That means that microelectronic switches made from superconductors can switch on and off far faster than transistors made from silicon, the usual material for computer chips. In addition, because of the lack of resistance, superconducting circuits can be packed close together, allowing computers to be smaller. Silicon circuits must be far enough apart that machines will not overheat.
The call for a greater effort in superconducting computers is included in a report recently completed by the National Commission on Superconductivity, which Congress established in 1988 to advise the Government on superconductor industrial development. The report said that superconductors might be used to develop computers that would operate a million times faster than today's fastest computers, enabling them to solve scientific problems beyond the ken of today's machines.
 
'Fresh Look' Sought
Another study, sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Pentagon research agency, is also drawing up recommendations for a renewed effort in superconducting electronics.
''I just think we have to take a fresh look at this,'' said Bruce Murdock, senior scientific program manager at Tektronix Inc., a Portland, Ore., electronics company, who is heading the Darpa study.
By proving the basic concepts, the Japanese ''have minimized the risk for us,'' Mr. Murdock said.
Superconductor circuits can outperform circuits made not only with silicon but also with gallium arsenide, a material that is faster than silicon.
The superconductors used by I.B.M. and others until the early 1980's were metal alloys that had to be frozen to near absolute zero, a theoretical point about 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit where resistance to electricity is lost.
 
New Materials
But in the last few years, new ceramic materials have been discovered that achieve superconductivity at higher temperatures - up to minus 235 degrees Fahrenheit, permitting the use of smaller and less costly cooling systems. That gives rise to a renewed hope that superconductors could be put to more practical uses.
But as work started gearing up in new ''high temperature'' superconductors, interest also began to revive in the older lower-temperature materials.
That is especially true in computer chips. Researchers have found they cannot use the new materials to make superconducting digital switches known as Josephson junctions, which are the superconducting equivalent of silicon transistors.
There is some fear that this problem could stem from fundamental characteristics of the new materials and might never be overcome, said Theodore Van Duzer, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley.
Instead of using Josephson junctions, researchers are beginning to explore another technique known as flux quantum logic that could allow computer chips to be made with the high-temperature superconductors.
Still, most work for now in superconducting computers is focusing on the low-temperature materials. These materials have also improved a great deal since I.B.M. abandoned its work. New compounds with niobium, which the Japanese have been using, have proved more reliable than the lead alloys I.B.M. was using.
 
Steady Progress in Japan
The Japanese program, backed by Government financing, has involved a handful of researchers at each of three companies - Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC - as well as at the Government-run Electrotechnical Laboratory. Yet progress has been steady. At a semiconductor industry conference in San Francisco earlier this year, Fujitsu described a signal processor chip it had developed that can perform one billion operations a second, at least 10 times faster than any similar silicon device.
Nevertheless, many contend that superconducting computers will never be practical and that fears about the Japanese progress are unfounded. They argue that silicon chips continue to improve in speed, and thousands of them can now be used in parallel to provide even greater speeds, making it less and less likely that superconducting computers will ever be economically feasible.
I.B.M. officials, for instance, stand by their decision. The company dropped its work not because of the expense of cooling or because of problems with lead-based alloys, officials said, but because silicon technology was advancing so fast as to make it unlikely that superconductors would be competitive.
''We just didn't think it worth it to work on this exotic technology when you can get almost the same performance from one of the most conventional technologies,'' said William J. Gallagher, manager of exploratory cryogenics at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
 
A Key Obstacle
One problem was producing superconducting memory chips with a meaningful capacity, he said, and that obstacle has still not been surmounted. Japan's best superconducting memories still store only 1,000 bits, while silicon memory chips can now store four million bits. And some specialized silicon memory chips are almost as fast as superconducting memory chips.
Others also point out that the Japanese, despite their laboratory progress, do not seem to be moving quickly to develop commercial computers using superconductors.
But supporters of a new push in digital superconductors say the problems in building memory chips can be overcome by combining a small amount of superconductor memory with a larger amount of slower semiconductor memory. Others say that while superconducting electronics might not be appropriate for an entire mainframe computer, which was I.B.M.'s goal, it might be useful in making individual chips that would handle, say, high-speed calculations in a computer, or feed telecommunications signals onto an optical fiber.
The report by the National Commission on Superconductivity said superconducting processors, arranged in parallel, could be used to build a ''petaflops' computer, a machine capable of performing one million billion operations a second.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs 32.67, Reversing a 4-Day Slide;
By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After four down days that toppled the market 118 points, or close to 5 percent, stocks headed up yesterday as traders and investors opened the spigot. Program traders helped spark the rally, but many expect the rise to be short-lived.
By the end of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average had jumped 32.67 points, to 2,485.64.
 
Big Lift From MCA
Many said that MCA, the media giant, gave the market a big lift, also helping other media and leisure stocks. Matsushita, the Japanese electronics giant, said it was holding merger talks with MCA although the Los Angeles-based company said there was no assurance anything would come of it. 
The market seemed willing to believe something would happen. MCA soared $19.50 a share, to $54, with 3.7 million shares trading. It was the most active stock on the Big Board, and if the deal actually happens, it will be the first really big one the market has seen in a long time, possibly involving as much as $7.5 billion.
Even so, one trader said: ''Everybody wants to sell and nobody wants to buy. The fact that somebody wants to put money into our stock market helped a lot, psychologically.''
''The market got itself into a slightly oversold condition,'' said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president in the trading department of S. G. Warburg & Company, ''and some of the selling seems to be exhausted.''
 
'We've Gone Down So Much'
''We're bound to have a rally,'' said Greg A. Smith, chief investment officer for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., ''simply because we've gone down so much. But I don't think it'll last very long or go very far.''
The traders contended that the rally could be brief because most buying came from short-term traders rather than long-term investors. Many sought bargains among the hundreds of depressed stocks or rushed to buy back stock they had sold short in expectation of buying it back later for less.
As a result, the rise in the Dow, while a big relief, was small in light of recent losses. Advancing issues only narrowly outstripped declining ones, 770 to 745, and while 5 stocks set new highs, 314 hit new lows. With many investors on the sidelines with an enormous bundle of cash, trading fell to 155.9 million shares, from 162.2 million on Monday.
Although oil prices dropped slightly, among the few stocks reaching new highs was Louisiana Land, the oil and gas company. Among the many hitting new lows were J. P. Morgan, Sears, Roebuck, Sony and UAL. Among the issues advancing on short covering were Fannie Mae and Disney.
Fannie Mae, which packages and resells mortgages, rose 1 3/8 in heavy trading, to 27 5/8. Disney rose 1 5/8, to 90 1/8, in sympathy with another media company, MCA. Paramount and Time Warner jumped for the same reason, with Paramount climbing 3 1/4, to 34 7/8, and Time Warner 1 1/4, to 70 7/8.
 
Another New High
Louisiana Land, which hit a new high on Monday, reached another yesterday, of 53 5/8, but it ended at 52 7/8, down 3/8. Morgan fell to a new low of 30 5/8 before closing at 31 1/4, up 1/8. Sears fell to a new low, 26, before ending at 26 1/2, up 3/8. Sony, another Japanese electronics giant, hit a new low of 45 3/4 before closing at 46 5/8, up 1/8. UAL hit a new low of 87 1/4 and ended at 89, down 3 1/4, as sentiment mounted that a union buyout seemed to have faltered.
About the only people who seem to be constantly in the market on one side or the other were the program traders, working the percentages between, say, the price of the Standard & Poor's average of 500 issues and of the 500 stocks themselves. Birinyi Associates, which tracks such activity, said that one selling wave and five buying waves throughout the session raised the Dow 20 points.
 
Jumps 10 Points at Opening
The Dow jumped 10 points at the beginning of yesterday's session, quickly fell 14, then steadily climbed the rest of the day.
''People are starting to live with the Middle East crisis,'' said Mr. Ducey of S. G. Warburg. ''But if the market goes up any further, it'll run into resistance and the selling will start again.''
Mr. Smith of Prudential-Bache argued that the rise might not last ''more than a week or so or more than 50 or 100 points.'' He said that still to be dealt with were the Federal budget deficit and ''more bad news on inflation.''
As shown in the averages, the gain seemed most pronounced among the big stocks. The S. & P. 500 rose 1.2 percent, to 304.59, up 3.67 points. In the smaller stocks, the American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose a tenth of 1 percent, to 312.84, up 0.33 point. The Nasdaq composite rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 352.16, up 2.62 points.

Prices of Treasury Securities Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates eased yesterday, as a surprisingly large reduction in the Government's reading of second-quarter economic growth and a decline in oil prices outweighed other factors that could have sent prices lower.
The drop in the Commerce Department's second-quarter growth figures - to four-tenths of 1 percent from 1.2 percent previously -showed that the economy was on the brink of recession even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, private analysts said.
''We have had a year of growth that was not really growth, with profitability under strain,'' said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''Now we face what probably will be a long but rather shallow recession.'' 
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. research firm, said: ''The G.N.P. number told me that the worst still lies ahead as far as the economy is concerned. In looking at the data, it is extremely difficult to find any sources of growth.''
 
Comments Erase Gains
The report on the gross national product pushed up prices early, but some of those gains were erased later when comments by a Federal Reserve Board governor, Wayne Angell, flashed across trading screens.
Mr. Angell said that in spite of the lower growth figures, he saw no reason for the Fed to ease interest rates soon.
In a speech to a farmers group in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Angell said that ''attempting through an easing of policy to somehow avoid or postpone the implied real adjustments of the oil shock would only serve to undermine the credibility of policy and lead to potentially more severe adjustments over the longer run.''
A strong auto sales report, which showed that auto makers sold at an annual rate of 7.8 million units in the middle 10 days of September, also came as a negative surprise.
In addition to the drop in oil prices and the downward revision of second-quarter gross national product, traders said the market was buttressed by a successful auction of $11.5 billion worth of two-year Treasury notes.
The notes were sold at an average yield of 8.18 percent, virtually unchanged from the 8.19 percent average yield at the last two-year note sale on Aug. 28. 4-Year Notes at 8.52% In advance of today's auction of four-year notes, the securities were offered late yesterday on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.52 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds due in 2020 were offered at a price of 96 1/8 late yesterday, up 13/32, to yield 9.12 percent. That compared with a yield of 9.16 percent on Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 98 14/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.98 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 13/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.63 percent.
Mr. Angell's comments helped push up short-term Treasury bill rates, which are usually very sensitive to changes in Federal Reserve policy.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.35 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by 7 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.39 percent.
 
Finance Companies
In the secondary market for corporate bonds, traders said that worries over outstanding commercial bank obligations were spreading.
''People are worried about all finance company paper, not just the banks,'' one corporate bond trader said. ''This is like the Salem witch hunt. People are looking for something to worry about, and I think it will continue.''
In addition to securities issued by major commercial banks like Citibank, whose bonds dropped sharply again yesterday, traders said that bonds of companies like the General Motors Assistance Corporation and the Marriott Corporation were also hammered.
Away from the financial sector, prices of most corporate bonds dipped by 1/2 point to 3/4 point.
Among the new issues priced yesterday was a two-part, $400 million offering from the Coastal Corporation.
The first $250 million piece consists of 10 3/8 percent 10-year notes. The notes were priced at $99.875, to yield 10.395 percent, 1.375 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $150 million worth of securities are 10 3/4 percent 20-year bonds.
These securities were priced at $99.59, to yield 10.80 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020.
Lehman Brothers acted as sole manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Yen Show Gains; German Comments a Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in the United States yesterday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, which took center stage on world foreign exchange markets.
Gold prices declined slightly in domestic trading but moved sharply higher abroad.
Strength in the dollar came largely as a reaction to a selloff Monday against every major currency but the yen. A rebound on Wall Street, combined with a steadying in oil and gold prices in New York, also renewed interest in dollars. 
Comments by an unidentified West German Finance Ministry official, carried by news services, contributed to the purchases of yen, which dealers have tended to dump in favor of European currencies lately because of concern about the impact of rising oil prices on the Japanese economy, which depends heavily on imported oil.
In an interview with reporters, the German official said the yen could appreciate further against the mark. He also said that he did not foresee a ''free fall'' in the dollar, a statement that tended to increase the demand for dollars.
The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo with a decline to 136.70 yen from 137.33 at Friday's close. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. Later, the dollar was quoted at 136.50 yen in London and at 136.70 late in New York, down from 137.50 late Monday.
The British pound lost ground, falling to $1.8765 late in London from late Monday's $1.8810. A pound was quoted at $1.8785 late in New York, down from $1.8805 late Monday.
Against the German mark, the dollar was trading late yesterday at 1.5735, up from 1.5595 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, were: 1.3080 Swiss francs, up from 1.2980; 5.2665 French francs, up from 5.2210; 1.15055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14975, and 1,177.00 Italian lire, up from 1,167.75.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Nearly Steady; Other Precious Metals Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices held nearly steady yesterday, despite a drop in energy prices and similar reversals in other markets that usually are regarded as signposts for the precious metals.
Silver and platinum futures fell sharply, though, lending support to the growing perception that gold is losing its traditional appeal as a store of value in times of rising consumer prices and international political turmoil.
Gold futures settled 50 cents to 70 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in September off 60 cents at $402.40 an ounce. 
Silver futures ended 8 cents to 8.8 cents lower, with September at $4.834 an ounce.
Platinum futures fell $7.70 to $8.90, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for September delivery finished at $451 an ounce.
Analysts had no problem explaining the declines in silver and platinum as reactions to the Government's report that the economy grew at a barely perceptible annual rate of four-tenths of a percent in the second quarter.
The white metals are used in a variety of manufactured products, so the report of unexpectedly slow growth led to expectations for reduced silver and platinum consumption, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Harder to assess was gold's relatively strong performance in light of sharply lower oil prices, sharply higher stock prices and a stronger dollar against European currencies - all reversals of the factors that were viewed as contributing to gold's strong advance on Monday.
John Jonat, a precious metal trader with the New York-based metal and currency dealer Deak International Inc., said gold's stubbornness was further evidence of a change in investor attitudes toward the metal.
But he and others were at a loss to define what Mr. Jonat called a new school of thought about gold. Some believe investors are turning to other markets as havens against inflation. Some concede they just don't know. ''It's a real confusing market to call,'' Mr. Jonat said. ''Something's changing here - it's not the same old rules.''

HEADLINE: TALKS ON BUDGET TURN TO INDEXING OF CAPITAL GAINS

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept 26

 BODY:
Under pressure from moderate Republicans in Congress, White House budget negotiators today signaled a willingness to drop their demand for an actual cut in the capital gains tax rate and instead accept a plan that would index capital gains for inflation.
The plan is a variation on President Bush's demand for cutting taxes on the profits on investments. It would allow investors who sell assets to exclude from their income taxes the portion of their profits solely attributable to inflation.
''Indexing is becoming their new bottom line,'' said a Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he added that Democrats still viewed this arrangement as one that would primarily benefit upper-income taxpayers, and said the tax break would have to be offset by higher taxes on the wealthy. 
 
Unlocking the Impasse
Nonetheless, negotiators from both parties said that they remained optimistic and that there had been more movement in the talks over the last two days than there had been in weeks.
Some political strategists see the indexing proposal, or some derivative of it, as a way to unlock the budget impasse. Indexing capital gains could allow the President to say he had lowered taxes, but in a somewhat watered-down form that could also permit the Democrats to say they had prevented a disproportionately large windfall for the very rich.
Despite this shift and signs of progress on other issues in the budget negotiations, Mr. Bush and the Democrats intensified their public posturing over who is responsible for blocking agreement on a budget deal and who should get the blame if automatic spending cuts take effect as scheduled on Monday.
 
Bush Sticks to His Plan
Even as White House budget negotiators were signaling a shift on capital gains in their private meetings with Congressional negotiators, Mr. Bush continued publicly to stick to his original plan for an outright cut in the capital gains rate. Campaigning for Republican candidates in Akron, Ohio, he threatened to stump all 50 states to argue that his proposal to cut the capital gains rate was not the real sticking point.
The real problem, he told reporters while flying to Ohio, is recalcitrant Democrats who ''have not come forward with a package'' even after the White House took ''political heat'' for agreeing to consider new taxes.
''And if and when the ax falls, the Democratic Congress knows that it will be held accountable,'' the President said in Akron. ''I will take that message to every state in the Union. It is their fault for holding up a budget agreement.''
Furious Democratic leaders, noting that they had exchanged a series of budget offers with Administration negotiators over the last 24 hours, quickly moved to counter Mr. Bush's charges and hurl some of their own.
''He should get off Air Force One and the campaign trail and join us,'' said Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania, the House Democratic whip. ''We ask him to stop acting like a party chairman and start acting like a President.''
The House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, called Mr. Bush's comments ''damaging to the negotiating process and not helpful to the result.'' But he was particularly critical of the President for ''the suggestion that he is somehow waiting on the outside for other people to reach an agreement.''
''He is a party to the negotiations,'' Mr. Foley said. In a later speech in Chicago, Mr. Bush apologized for saying the Democrats had not come forward with a budget package. ''I accept the fact that in private negotiations there have been such proposals,'' he said.
But he said Administration officials had ''yet to see a comprehensive plan'' that encompased spending cuts, changes in the budget process and incentives for economic growth.
 
How the Talks Are Divided
The spectacle of Mr. Bush attacking the Democrats while his Treasury Secretary, budget director and chief of staff huddled with them over the bargaining table illustrated that the most important division in the budget battle was not between Democrats and Republicans, but between the White House and Congress. And even as the political charges were flying, Congressional leaders and the White House officials seemed to be edging closer to a final compromise.
The high-level talks in the Capitol are expected to continue late into the night, but if no agreement is reached Democrats will have to decide whether to proceed with a House vote Thursday on a stop-gap spending measure that would keep the Government running after Sept. 30 and delay the automatic cuts that would take effect on Oct. 1.
Democrats are also considering an alternative strategy to push their own budget plan through Congress. All proposals under consideration in the talks aim to cut $50 billion from the deficit in 1991 and $500 billion over five years.
The plan that party strategists say the Democrats contemplate would return to a position they held before the latest narrowing of differences. It would closely resemble an offer they made last week, and cut more from military spending, less from domestic programs and raise more in new taxes than Republicans would accept.
 
Differences Are Narrowed
According to officials close to the budget talks, the negotiators substantially narrowed their differences on spending cuts in military and domestic programs in a nine-hour session that ended early today. Still at issue are the components of the tax portion of the package, intended to raise about $130 billion in new revenue over the next five years.
Besides the issue of capital gains taxes, Republicans want the package to include extension of a number of popular tax breaks scheduled to expire at the end of this year. While the tax breaks have support in both parties, the money they would cost the Treasury would have to be offset with deeper spending cuts or other tax increases.
Democrats, mindful that a cut in the capital gains tax rate enjoys strong support among some factions in their own party, have floated their proposal for a narrowly defined version of the cut aimed at promoting long-term investment in small, high-risk businesses. Officials familiar with the proposal say it would provide a capital gains tax break only for future investments, thus reducing the revenue loss to the Treasury.
 
Focus on Automatic Cuts
For lawmakers not directly involved in the negotiations, the threat of automatic spending cuts starting on Monday, initially totaling some $85 billion, remained the main focus of concern.
In the Senate, lawmakers voted to include their own salaries and those of top officials in the executive branch, including Vice President Dan Quayle, in the automatic cuts from which they would otherwise be exempt.
In the House, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said he would introduce legislation giving the President authority to exempt essential services involving public health or safety from the automatic cuts.
Mr. Gingrich insisted that his legislation did not amount to abandonment of the spending discipline required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. ''This action will make Gramm-Rudman manageable so the American people will not have to suffer because of the incompetence of Washington politicians,'' he said.

HEADLINE: SOVIETS' WARNING TO IRAQIS ON WAR PRAISED BY WEST

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other Western diplomats praised the Soviet Union today for its warning to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that a war in the Persian Gulf may be imminent if he does not pull out of Kuwait.
The Western officials said in separate conversations that the speech at the United Nations General Assembly by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Tuesday marked a significant shift in Kremlin policy.
Only two weeks after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, at a news conference after meeting in Helsinki with President Bush, stated his categoric opposition to any use of force, his Foreign Minister surprised a United Nations audience not used to such surprises by suggesting that if the boycott failed to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, Moscow would not shrink from supporting a military operation sanctioned by the United Nations. 
 
Loss of Help From West Feared
Interpreting the speech, a top Administration analyst of Soviet affairs said: ''Shevardnadze was telling the Iraqis something more than just 'don't count on us to veto a use of force at the United Nations.' He was saying, 'You'd better count on us to support, and maybe even participate in, such an effort by the United Nations.' I think the Soviets may have concluded that the indirect pressure of the embargo is running its course, and when it finally grinds to a halt, they don't intend to be the odd men out.''
On the Soviet warning to President Hussein, analysts of Soviet affairs say they believe Moscow decided to sharpen the tone of the military threat because of two other concerns, as well. First, the Soviets are clearly worried that the longer this crisis drags on, the more damage will be inflicted on Western economies and the less they can be expected to help Mr. Gorbachev's economic efforts.
 
Anxious About U.S. Buildup
Second, the Soviet military is clearly anxious about the buildup of American forces 800 miles from the southern Soviet borders. When concern is already high about Soviet vulnerability in Europe, the massing of American troops, armor, missiles and other advanced weapons in the gulf is something that cannot be ignored by Soviet military planners.
Mr. Shevardnadze said that while diplomacy had to be given every chance to work, ''War may break out in the gulf region any day, any moment.''
He added: ''In the context of recent events we should remind those who regard aggression as an acceptable form of behavior that the United Nations has the power to 'suppress acts of aggression.' There is ample evidence that this right can be exercised. It will be, if the illegal occupation of Kuwait continues.''
Mr. Baker began his meeting today with Mr. Shevardnadze by praising his speech. From the start of the gulf crisis, American officials have feared that there was a potentially serious contradiction between their efforts to assemble an international consensus to isolate Iraq diplomatically and their desire to keep the military option open. Finding partners for an embargo of Iraq was one thing, and finding partners for a shooting war quite another.
 
Concern of Administration
The Administration's concern was that the fragile international coalition would break apart - beginning at its Soviet-American core - the minute it was concluded that a boycott would not move Baghdad and that therefore the only option was war. What Mr. Shevardnadze's speech at the United Nations on Tuesday suggests, officials said, is that it may actually be possible to maintain a large degree of American-Soviet consensus if a resort to arms is deemed necessary.
 
Bluntness of the Message
But American officials also calculate that either as a result of a Chinese veto, or Soviet reluctance to commit troops abroad in the wake of their Afghanistan debacle or some other complication, the Security Council may find it difficult to actually agree on a military operation. In the event of such a deadlock, and depending on the actions of the Iraqis, Administration officials increasingly think that the Soviets may be ready to quietly acquiesce in an American-led operation.
''The speech says to me that the Soviets feel that this guy, Saddam, has to be brought to heel,'' said an Administration official. ''At worst, I think the Soviets would mildly criticize our use of force outside the U.N., if it becomes clear that diplomacy cannot work.''
A senior British diplomat also found the Soviet policy a significant change that can only result in additional pressure on Mr. Hussein. The Iraqis have already attacked the Soviet Union for Mr. Shevardnadze's speech.
By being so blunt, said Ghassan Salameh, a Middle East expert at the University of Paris, ''Shevardnadze was telling Saddam: 'Don't have any illusions that I will mediate some compromise for you. Shevardnadze's comments remind me of an old Palestinian proverb: 'I will cry and then walk away.' When war comes, he told Saddam: 'I will cry for you and then walk away, so you better withdraw before it is too late.' ''
 
Evolution in Attitudes
Traditionally, the Soviets have understood the relationship between force and diplomacy much better than the United States, argued Martin Indyk, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. President Hussein is only going to be persuaded to leave Kuwait, argued Mr. Indyk, ''if he is convinced that the alternative is a war which he will lose.''
There has been a steady evolution in Soviet attitudes toward the use of military force in the gulf, with the idea becoming more conceivable with each passing week. In the joint American-Soviet statement issued on Aug. 3, immediately after the Iraqi invasion, the Soviets resisted American appeals for a reference to a possible use of force if Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait.
At the Helsinki summit on Sept. 9, the Soviets agreed to a final communique that said if the economic sanctions did not work ''additional steps'' would have to be considered. But during the news conference after the meeting, Mr. Gorbachev strongly affirmed that it was too early to discuss a military option and that diplomacy had to be given a real chance to succeed.
 
Coordination Stressed
In his address to the United Nations yesterday, Mr. Shevardnadze apparently decided that it was time to let the Iraqis know that an internationally sanctioned military operation was now a real live possibility.
A senior State Department official said that in the four-hour meeting between Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Baker today, the Soviet Foreign Minister emphasized to the Secretary of State the need for their two countries to continue closely coordinating on the gulf and, at the same time, to make sure that they are steadily increasing the pressure on Mr. Hussein. Mr. Shevardnadze said it was important that the Iraqi leader see a clear trend mounting against him.
Besides the Persian Gulf, Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze discussed the remaining obstacles to a conventional-arms-reduction treaty in Europe and a United States-Soviet treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons.
A senior State Department official said that the two Cabinet ministers exchanged some new ideas, but that there was still no breakthrough. Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze are planning another meeting on Thursday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Sale Of Reserve's Oil To Lower Prices

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Complaining that there is ''no justification'' for the recent run-up in oil prices, President Bush announced last night that the United States would sell five million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a test.
The sale is a token amount in the oil market and will have little effect on total supplies since the United States imports that much oil every 18 hours. But after weeks of speculation in the industry and among economists about whether the reserve would be used, industry experts said last night that the announcement would be, in effect, a warning that market participants who are tempted to pay high prices for oil could end up holding barrels that could soon decline in value.
 
Hint of Further Sales
Indeed, President Bush hinted that if prices did not stabilize, he would consider larger sales from the reserve, presumably in a coordinated effort with America's industrial partners that also hold oil reserves. 
''I'm prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to insure that America stays strong here at home,'' President Bush said in a speech at a fund-raising dinner last night for a Senate candidate from Illinois.
The Administration's decision to tap the oil reserve seems to have been motivated as much by politics as by economics. The sharp rise in oil prices during the late 1970's, political analysts note, damaged not only the American economy but also the Presidency of Jimmy Carter and the Administration seems eager to avoid a similar oil-related political setback, if possible.
Commenting on the recent advance in oil prices, a senior White House official said last night, ''From a political point of view, as well as an economic standpoint, we cannot let this go on.''
Earlier in the day, more than three dozen Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives urged the President to begin tapping the reserve. Citing the price climb, they said that ''it was for just such circumstances that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created.''
 
Coordination Urged
The lawmakers urged that the United States coordinate the releases with Japan and West Germany, which have almost 400 million barrels in their stockpiles. ''Just as our military efforts require equitable burden sharing, so do our economic efforts to reduce the impact from the loss of oil,'' they said in a letter.
The signers included Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Misssouri and the House majority leader; William H. Gray, Democrat of Pennsylvania and the Democratic whip; John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Norman F. Lent of Long Island, the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce panel.
The price of oil has approached $40 in recent days, more than double the level at the beginning of the summer, putting increasing pressure on the President to tap the 590-million-barrel reserve, which is in salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, and was assembled over 15 years at a cost of about $16 billion. It is designed to deliver oil at rates of up to 3.5 million barrels a day.
 
Net Loss of 1.7 Million
In contrast, the embargo against oil from Iraq and Kuwait cut world supplies by about 4.3 million barrels. The Department of Energy said yesterday that because other oil-producing nations had increased their pumping, the net loss was now about 1.7 million barrels a day, and could shrink to one million barrels a day by November.
The current global shortfall could be met by the reserve for more than 400 days, and if the global deficit fell to one million barrels a day, the reserve could make up the difference for nearly two years.
But prices are at their highest levels since 1980, and in his remarks at the fund-raising dinner, Mr. Bush said there was ''no justification for the intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures.'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that recent price rises ''cannot be explained by market forces.''
The announcement, which was made after the close of futures trading yesterday, caused a price drop last night in the spot, or cash, market for oil sold for immediate delivery and is likely to depress the oil market at least briefly.
At Cargill Investor Services, Arnold G. Stifel, a broker, said, ''We could back off a dollar, maybe $2 or $3. But that is not a whole lot, considering that we move so much daily. This market is so scared that these prices are going to hold.''
Daniel C. Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said, ''This is more like a test drive, to demonstrate that it works.'' Mr. Yergin, the author of a major report on the reserve for the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this year, said in a telephone interview last night that ''there has been a lot of skepticism about how it will work physically, and in market terms.''
 
Different From Imported Oil
The oil differs in some physical characteristics from the kind of oil that the United States imports.
Mr. Yergin added, ''You don't want to do a test drive when everybody's in a total panic, and have something not go right.''
Some traders reached last night were skeptical that the test would have much value. ''I wouldn't expect it to have a big impact - I still think it's a fear market, not a supply and demand market,'' said Michael Wilner, the president of the Hilltop Trading Company in New York. The sale, he added, could ''get lost in the bigger picture.''
Driving the market in the last few weeks, according to experts, is a desire by everyone who uses oil to increase inventories well above normal levels, as a hedge against future shortages. Pushing demand up at a time when supply is down, the result has been sharply higher prices.
 
Expected to Happen
Another broker, Andrew B. Shasha of Star Supply Inc. in Englewood, N.J., said that ''the sentiment has been that it was expected to happen.''
But the White House is clearly hoping that the prospect of large new supplies hitting the market will depress oil prices, which are a big factor in the economy, and the economy is already weak. Figures released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday indicated that the United States was very close to a recession in the second quarter, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent convulsions in the oil market.
In his remarks last night at the dinner for Representative Lynn Martin, the Illinois Republican candidate for the Senate, Mr. Bush said: ''Today, it's especially important that America is economically healthy and militarily strong. At home and abroad, let me caution those who might take advantage of the current crisis in the Persian Gulf, those who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions or, here at home, those speculators who might try to drive up the price of oil.''

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA TO GET TOUGHER AIR RULES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 26

 BODY:
California, which has long had the nation's toughest air-quality rules, is on the verge of approving an even stricter set of regulations intended to create a new generation of less-polluting fuels and vehicles, including electric cars.
The plan, which is expected to be approved Friday by the California Air Resources Board, would have an immense impact on the types of cars and fuels sold in California, the nation's biggest and most influential car market. As they have in the past, the rules adopted in California could serve as models for other states and for Federal clean air legislation.
 
Changes Will Add to Cost
''It's the most far-reaching set of emissions regulations the state of California has ever proposed,'' said Joseph Calhoun, the assistant director of the emissions control program at the General Motors Corporation. G.M. and other auto manufacturers say they are concerned that the new standards and the timetable for meeting them may be technologically unrealistic. 
Consumers would eventually pay for the technology required by the new rules, as it is certain to add to the cost of cars, although no one could say how much.
Under the rules, automobile manufacturers will have to begin introducing models starting in 1994 that emit no more than half the hydrocarbons allowed for 1993 models under current California regulations, which are already the nation's strictest. Hydrocarbons are a primary component of smog.
The regulations would require that by 1998, two percent of all the automobiles sold in the state would have to have zero emissions, meaning the sale of electric cars. By 2003, 10 percent of all cars sold in the state would have to have zero emissions, and most of the rest would have to meet emission standards 70 percent below the 1993 level.
For the first time, the rules would also set standards for less-polluting gasoline as part of an effort to insure that there are cleaner-burning fuels available for the more advanced automobiles the plan requires.
 
Reduction by 50 to 80%
The ultimate goal of the plan is to reduce pollution from automobiles by 50 to 84 percent.
''Our program has historically set the pace for the country and created the technology that has made reducing emissions feasible, said Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the Air Resources Board, which has drawn up up the regulations. ''This proposal lays the groundwork for a whole new generation of cars and technology.''
The air resources board is an agency comprised of nine appointed officials with jurisdiction over all air-quality regulation in California. The panel's actions do not require legislative approval and there is no process by which opponents can appeal the board's regulations, although they could challenge them in court. Since the board was formed in 1968, none of its rules have been challenged in court.
The board has long enacted stricter rules than the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, and the rules now being considered would go further than clean air legislation now before Congress. The board will hold two final days of public hearings on the plan in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday, with the formal approval expected on Friday. Mr. Sessa said the board did not expect to make any substantive changes.
Environmentalists said they generally supported the plan, although they said the board was moving too slowly in some respects.
''We absolutely agree that there's no way to meet clean air standards without introducing clean vehicles in significant numbers,'' said Lynne T. Edgerton, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles. ''Having said that, we think the plan for phasing in the low-emissions vehicles and the zero-emissions vehicles is too slow.''
 
Board Consulted Industry
The board has consulted closely with the automobile industry and the oil industry in developing the rules. The oil companies have expressed reservations about some elements of the plan, although they support its basic thrust. The car companies, however, say they are concerned that the plan requires emissions improvements based on technology that does not yet exist, and that the timetable it sets may be unrealistic.
''The plan is asking the industry to take on responsibility that it is not in any shape to fulfill at this point,'' said Marcel Halberstadt, the director of the environmental department at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Detroit, a trade group.
Mr. Calhoun of General Motors said that if the proposals are adopted, ''Obviously G.M. will try to meet them.'' He said the company would like the plan to be modified to allow reviews of the technological progress being made by industry, and to permit a postponement of the timetable if it is warranted.
''We may start down the wrong road with a technology and realize that and head in another direction,'' Mr. Calhoun said. He said it was impossible to say what effect the regulations would have on retail car prices, but that ''if new technology has to be developed it's going to be costly.''
The new regulations come at a time when Californians and others are starting to question whether stricter environmental controls are worth the economic price they impose, especially as the national economy seems to be headed into a recession. Economic concerns have been one factor in the reduced public support in California for an initiative on the November ballot that would impose a host of new environmental restrictions.
 
Tension Between Industries
There is also some tension between oil companies and the car makers over the plan. The oil companies would prefer that gasoline remain the primary fuel for automobiles, and they are investing heavily in research into cleaner-burning gasolines. The auto companies, however, have some incentives under Federal legislation to develop vehicles capable of running on a methanol-based fuel.
Methanol is made most often from natural gas, and a widespread shift to the use of methanol as an alternative fuel would require huge investments by the oil companies in new refining equipment and additional natural gas pipelines. A methanol-based fuel is also likely to be more expensive at the pump than a reformulated conventional gasoline, said George Babikian, the president of ARCO's refining division. Mr. Babikian and other oil industry executives are pushing for development of cleaner-burning gasolines that would work in conjunction with improved catalytic converters in vehicles to reduce emissions.
California's plan has already prompted the oil companies and the auto makers to begin cooperating and coordinating to a much greater degree than ever. The two industries have jointly financed a $15 million research project exploring how best to match improvements in fuels and engine technology to reduce emissions.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE: THE REJOINING OF GERMANY - EUROPEAN VOICES;
Finding a New Weak Link

BYLINE: By Martin Gilbert/British Historian: MARTIN GILBERT, 53, a British historian, wrote two volumes of the official biography of Churchill. Among his other books are ''Final Journey: The Fate of the Jews of Nazi Europe,'' and ''Auschwitz and the Allies.''

 BODY:
I always thought the division of Germany after 1945 was unnatural. The wartime allies, at Teheran and Yalta, were clearly thinking of Germany as a whole, even while demilitarizing and deindustrializing it to make sure that it could not start another war. In a sense, what is happening on Oct. 3 is what might have happened shortly after the war, if the United States and the Soviet Union had not been at odds. 
I was always taught to look for the weak link in the chain, the cause of potential trouble in the apparently stable order of things. As it looks now, potential trouble lies not in a united Germany, but in a disintegrating Soviet Union. The phase of history that is opening with the unification of Germany is, in a sense, the reversal of processes that began in 1918 with the overly severe Versailles Treaty terms against Germany.
One must assume and hope that for most Germans, Germany will be complete once its two parts are united; that it will have no more unresolved territorial claims. The problem in the future will not then be the eastern border of Germany, it will be the western border of Russia. The issues to be resolved are not those between Germans and their eastern neighbors; they are between Russians and Ukrainians, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians, and their other western neighbors, and they stem from the way Stalin created the western border of the Soviet Union in 1940.
In the next decade, a united Germany could be a lifesaver, a source of economic strength and political stability for all the countries of central Europe, and it could continue to be the driving force for the unification of Europe.
Now that the Germans have acknowledged and paid for their war crimes, they can put behind them the last great question from their past. But the Russians are still agonizing over their past, and living uncomfortably through its still-emerging consequences. The questions the Russians are asking are things like, ''Father, what were you doing during Katyn?'' And, ''Uncle, how can we justify and legitimize the annexation of the Baltic states, of East Prussia, and the Polish-Russian border?''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Newest Tanks Are Included In U.S. Arms Sale to Saudis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
President Bush, in the first phase of a planned $21 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, has decided to include the most modern M-1 tanks and other sophisticated weapons worth $7.5 billion as an immediate response to the Iraqi threat, Administration officials said today.
The officials said Congress was being notified this evening of the proposed sale, which they said would include M1-A2 tanks, Patriot anti-aircraft missiles, Bradley fighting vehicles, multiple launch rocket systems and Apache helicopters.
The Administration will seek Congressional approval for an additional $14 billion worth of arms in January, including F-15 fighters.
Though the Bush Administration bowed to Congressional pressure by deferring the biggest part of the sale until next year, Mr. Bush's decision was debated on Capitol Hill. One Congressional staff member said the proposed sale was generally ''in keeping with the consultation process'' and reflected the will of lawmakers to limit the initial sale to immediate Saudi defense needs, with the exception of the proposed sale of M1-A2 tanks. 
 
Question of Immediate Need
The reported inclusion of M1-A2 tanks in the first phase drew particular criticism from some lawmakers. They said that, because production of the M1-A2 tank is not scheduled to start until November 1992, it would not be used for immediate Saudi needs. But one Congressional staffer suggested that production could be accelerated.
The proposed sale includes about 150 M1-A2 tanks, 6 Patriot antimissile batteries, 200 Bradley fighting vehicles, about 150 TOW-2A antitank missiles, about 10 Apache helicopters and less than a dozen launchers for the Multiple Launch Rocket System. These launchers would be equipped with more than a thousand missiles.
Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, the majority whip, has said he was particularly concerned about the proposed sale of sophisticated weapons, like the M1-A2 tank.
Other lawmakers who have been supportive of Israel said that they thought an understanding had been reached with the Administration to provide items in the first part of the sale that would meet Saudi Arabia's immediate needs while postponing until next year consideration of other, longer-term items that were likely to cause more debate. But some lawmakers said the nature of some of the weapons the Administration is now proposing to sell shows that such an understanding has not been reached.
''They certainly gave us the impression when they decided to divide the sale that they were doing it as a result of our concerns and were trying to meet our concerns,'' said Mel Levine, a California Democrat.
''If they can make a convincing case that the items are needed immediately they will not face opposition,'' Mr. Levine said. ''I would still be concerned if it appears that they are continuing to use this crisis as a fig leaf for racing through the process items that do not meet that criteria,'' Mr. Levine said.
 
'Disappointed,' He Says
Earlier today, based on preliminary reports of the planned sale, Representative Larry Smith, a Florida Democrat, said, ''I am disappointed that what they have put in this package does not accord with my understanding of what would be done in the short term and the long term.''
A Bush Administration spokesman declined to comment on the sale, saying that he could not discuss the proposal until formal notification was transmitted by the White House.
Other Bush Administration officials who defended the sale said that only a limited number of the sophisticated ground weapons would be sold in the first phase.
One senior Administration official said the sale of M1-A2 tanks was a ''necessary complement'' to the items that needed to be delivered immediately to take care of Saudi Arabia's defense needs. He suggested that the order for the tanks needed to be made soon to keep to a schedule for delivering the tanks years from now.
 
New Saudi Transfers
The proposed sale came as the Pentagon was considering a new step to improve the military abilities of the United States forces in Saudi Arabia.
Maj. Peter Keating, an Army spokesman, said the Pentagon was considering the transfer of M1-A1 tanks from Western Europe to American Army units in Saudi Arabia. The American units being sent to Saudi Arabia only have a small number of this model of M-1A1 tanks, currently the most modern version of the M-1 tank in the Army arsenal and the shipment of the M-1A1 tanks would beef up the Army's capabilities there.
The M1-A1 tank has the 120-millimeter gun, a bigger gun than the M-1 model and better protection against chemical weapons. The Pentagon's consideration of the new tank deployment was disclosed in The Washington Times today.
Regarding the air embargo voted by the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the United States does not plan to use military force to enforce the new sanction.
''We've not been given any such instructions and I don't expect that we would be,'' Mr. Cheney told a meeting of the National Association of Business Economists.
'' I think the intention, in terms of how it will operate, is that the nations around Iraq will deny overflight rights to flights that are headed for Baghdad,'' Mr. Cheney said.
''And as I say, we may have seen, with his threats in the last couple of days, that he may resort to military force in response to the sanctions, the first beginning evidence that in fact he's really beginning to feel the pain,'' Mr. Cheney continued.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: OPTIONS FOR BUSH;
If There Is No Provocation by Iraq, The U.N. May Offer a Route to Unity

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, Sept. 26

 BODY:
If Iraq should sanction a major terrorist strike, harm American hostages or attack a United States warship or warplane, President Bush would certainly respond with military action, citing ''provocation'' by President Saddam Hussein to explain his decision.
''That much is clear,'' said a senior White House aide. ''If we have a pretext, a casus belli, we go. But the much more difficult question is how we proceed if the weeks and months go by, and there is no provocation.'' 
President Bush has suggested, without ever actually saying so, that at some point soon, if United Nations economic sanctions do not persuade Iraq to pull its troops out of Kuwait, he will use force to get them out. But it is not as simple as issuing an order to his commander in the Persian Gulf, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. There is the matter of Congressional acquiescence. Key Democrats on Capitol Hill insist that their support for Mr. Bush's policies in no way constitutes a mandate for offensive operations against Saddam Hussein.
This time, there will be no hastily passed, open-ended measure like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which Lyndon B. Johnson and later Presidents used to justify their military actions in Vietnam. Indeed, some influential lawmakers, including a few Republicans, are searching for a formula that would give Congress a major say in deciding when or whether to go to war.
There is the matter of public support. All the evidence in the opinion polls suggests that the President has the backing of the overwhelming majority of the American people for what he has done so far. So does the warmth with which he has been received on his political forays out into the country, such as the one he began today in Akron, Ohio and Chicago.
But so far Mr. Bush has sought support only for defensive action: guarding Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. Neither the White House nor anyone else really knows how enthusiastic the public would be, and for how long, about a desert campaign against the Iraqi Army or an air offensive.
Interviews with Bush partisans who turned out for a fund-raising lunch here today suggested that their support is highly conditional. Stuart Giller, an Akron businessman, said: ''People are solidly behind Operation Desert Shield, but they have their doubts about an Operation Desert Strike. They'd support a short war - a week or so - but beyond that, heavy losses, body bags, he loses support quickly, especially if we fire the first shots.''
 
Playing in Paris
A dental assistant who declined to give her name said, ''I'm afraid they've thought a lot in Washington about how to get into battle and not enough on how to get out.''
Finally there is the matter of allied participation. ''This administration has made a basic decision that it can't handle this alone,'' says one of its principal policymakers, and Mr. Bush is well aware that a justification for war that may sell on Capitol Hill and in Peoria may be much less effective in Paris, Damascus and Moscow. So the search is on for a predicate that would allow the preservation of allied unity, or most of it.
The route, it appears, may lie through the United Nations.
French diplomats are making it clear that despite President Francois Mitterrand's fury over Iraqi penetration of the French embassy in Kuwait, and the dispatch of crack French troops to the Gulf, Paris has little enthusiasm for a war policy. Other European countries that have backed Mr. Bush are firmly opposed to a unilateral United States decision to attack, even if it were dressed up with a round of ''consultations'' about the next step.
''Bush has three choices,'' said a minister from one European country who is visiting the United States. ''He can do nothing, he can risk our opposition or he can use the U.N. None perfect, but that's the way it is.''
The trouble with the United Nations in this context, from the Administration's point of view, is that it is too slow and it is too public. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d made it clear last Sunday that an appeal to the international organization to authorize military action has by no means been ruled out.
 
Taking Stock Before Christmas
Describing himself as ''extraordinarily pleased'' by the role of the United Nations to date, Mr. Baker said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' ''If the President felt it was necessary to use force, I think he would want to move in a manner that would seek to preserve as much of the international consensus as we could, and hopefully all of it.'' The Administration has been thinking hard, he said, about ''how to implement U.N. resolutions'' calling for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait ''in the absence of some specific act of provocation.''
Tom King, the British Defense Minister, said in Washington last week that his country had placed no limitations on its support for Mr. Bush. But in New York on Tuesday, a senior British official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that when Mr. Bush and his allies ''take stock of the situation'' sometime before Christmas, war would not be the only option; the decision might be to give the sanctions more time.
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union indicated in a General Assembly speech that, however cumbersome the United Nations Military Staff Committee might be, giving it a major role might be Moscow's price for participation in any military operations against Saddam Hussein. If it had been working properly, he said, ''there would be no need now for individual states to act unilaterally.''
That could cause problems in Washington, which is reluctant to put United States forces under a United Nations flag, but a compromise might be reached under which the United Nations authorized but did not control military action. Such a deal was worked out to permit the imposition of a naval blockade.
A United Nations mandate might also make it easier for the Egyptians, Moroccans and Syrians to commit their troops to battle alongside the Americans, despite the opposition that might arouse from the Arab masses in their capitals and elsewhere.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
At the U.N., Many Issues Are Called, but Only One Is Chosen: Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Security Council's backing of an air embargo against Iraq and the current preoccupation in the United Nations with the Persian Gulf crisis have overshadowed the range of other issues and statements that usually get heard during the opening of a General Assembly meeting.
Heads of state, prime ministers, foreign ministers and ambassadors have trod across the emerald green carpet in the General Assembly hall to the imposing granite podium and held forth on topics ranging from safeguarding the environment to the condemnation of the occupation of East Timor.
But the statements on these topics, and the normal pomp and circumstance that surround the arrival of such visitors, has caused barely a ripple this year.
''The Iraq-Kuwait crisis has dominated everything that is happening here,'' said Francois Giuliani, the spokesman for the Secretary General. ''It has upset the balance and the focus. Usually heads of state speak about everything under the sun and maybe they are doing so now, but nobody listens.'' 
Ambassadors from several countries, especially those in the developing world, said they accepted that the crisis in the gulf must be a priority, but not to the exclusion of other issues that threaten their own stablity.
 
'A One-Issue Assembly'
''I applaud the speed with which the Security Council has been acting in recent weeks, in more or less united fashion, to deal with this very serious crisis'' said Chinmaya R. Gharekhan, the Indian delegate to the United Nations. ''This is as it should be. But I wish the Council would act with equal dispatch to deal with some of the other concomitant consequences of this crisis, like the economic crisis. For India the net impact will be upwards of $4 billion.''
''There are other issues, particularly development, the debt problem, the reverse transfer of resources and the environment that are not receiving the attention they should,'' the Indian delegate said.
''It looks like a one-issue Assembly,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''which is regrettable because there are many other serious problems.''
Several diplomats, however, said that if the United Nations could play a pivotal role in solving the gulf crisis it might have beneficial ramifications for their own regional disputes.
''Every diplomat has issues that are very important to their own country,'' said a West European diplomat who asked not to be identified. ''When one issue absorbs the whole meeting it is difficult. But for the first time the United Nations is united to face a crisis and resolve it. If we manage to resolve this crisis it will probably be one of the biggest successes of the United Nations. It will create a climate to solve other regional conflicts.''
 
Meetings Upon Meetings
Diplomatic missions, confronted with visits by high-ranking Government officials, have been putting in 12- and 14-hour days to arrange schedules, reserve tables at New York's best restaurants and book hotel accommodations.
There are about 28 heads of state, including President Bush, who are scheduled to arrive at the United Nations, along with some 15 prime ministers and 72 foreign ministers.
Much of the work during the opening of the 45th General Assembly, as is the case every year, goes on behind closed doors. The visiting political leaders hold numerous rounds of bilateral meetings on a range of issues.
''Much of our mission activity is devoted to setting up bilateral meetings,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Our job is to call the Japanese or the Kuwaitis to see if they can have lunch with us at the Waldorf.''
India's Foreign Minister, I. K. Gujral, has more than 50 scheduled bilateral talks, according to the Indian delegate.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has more than a dozen bilateral meetings, a Group of Seven dinner and two breakfast meetings, one with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the other with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
 
Little Time for the Lofty
''These bilateral meetings are as important as the General Assembly meeting itself,'' said Nicolaos Dictakis, a member of the Greek Mission.
Diplomats in the missions frequently have little time to pursue the loftier apsects of their calling.
''I have been so busy organizing the visit of our Foreign Minister that I haven't had time to follow the debate in the Security Council and the General Assembly,'' Mr. Dictakis said.
United Nations chief delegates, when they accompany their bosses to the General Assembly or Security Council, give up their seats to the higher ranking visitors.
On Tuesday night, the American delegate, Thomas R. Pickering, sat behind Secretary of State Baker at the Security Council, as did the 13 other United Nations delegates who accompanied their Foreign Ministers to the session.
''I don't think our Foreign Ministers would like it described that they take our seats,'' said Mr. Gharekhan, while admitting that Foreign Minister Gujral, now sits in the chair that is usually reserved for him as head of the Indian mission in the General Assembly.

HEADLINE: AIDS Rising Fast Among Black South Africans

SERIES: A CONTINENT'S AGONY: A PERIODIC REPORT.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Nthato Motlana, a prominent doctor in the black township of Soweto, was visited recently by a young man suffering from a venereal disease. When Dr. Motlana proposed that his patient also be tested for signs of AIDS, he recalled, the young man scoffed.
''That's white man's propaganda,'' the patient told Dr. Motlana. ''I'm not homosexual.''
AIDS in South Africa, which first appeared among white homosexuals, has now begun spreading among black heterosexuals at an alarming rate. 
Doctors hope the country can head off the kind of epidemic that is devastating neighboring countries like Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. With its modern medical system and economic resources, South Africa appears better equipped than those nations to resist AIDS, even with its inequities between health services for blacks and whites.
The Black Mistrust Of White Rulers But the preoccupation of leaders, black and white, with the current political violence and black mistrust of the white minority Government could erase this advantage, doctors fear. There are already signs that some conservative whites are trying to use the epidemic to further inflame racial tensions.
The incidence of AIDS in South Africa is still modest compared to that in some other African countries. Only about 500 outright AIDS cases have been reported so far among 37 million inhabitants, of whom 5 million are white.
But it is estimated that 1 percent of the country's black adult population is carrying the AIDS virus and that this number is rising fast. Two Johannesburg researchers have forecast that as many as 446,000 adult South Africans, almost all of them black, could be infected by the end of next year.
''There is a window of opportunity that is very short, of perhaps a couple of years,'' said Dr. Paul H. Grundy, an American physician who has tracked AIDS as the State Department's regional medical officer in southern Africa. ''Unless some way is found to reach the masses of people likely to become affected, South Africa will be in the same situation as its neighbors.''
In several countries to the north, including Malawi and Zambia, infection rates among urban adults have soared to over 20 percent over the last several years, and there is evidence that more than 10 percent of urban adults in Zimbabwe may carry the AIDS virus.
Is It Too Late To Stop Epidemic? Other specialists wonder whether South Africa has already missed the chance to head off a major epidemic. ''I'm not too sure whether it's not too late already,'' said Dr. Ruben Sher, an immunologist who heads the AIDS center at the South African Institute for Medical Research in Johannesburg.
The Government's decision this year to open its formerly segregated hospitals to all races has not eliminated the disparity in medical care for blacks and whites, because black patients still rely on the overcrowded hospitals and clinics near their homes in the segregated townships rather than the under-used hospitals near the white suburbs.
An AIDS epidemic among blacks could quickly overwhelm the medical system available in the townships like Soweto, where patients have already been sleeping on floors for lack of beds at its Baragwanath Hospital. The strain will be felt even faster in the ethnic homelands where medical installations are often rudimentary; for example, the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu in Natal has one doctor for each 15,000 inhabitants, which is seven times the national ratio.
Moreover, some blacks may be afraid to come forward for diagnosis and treatment of AIDS for fear of losing their jobs. In a policy supported by the Government, the mining industry since 1987 has screened prospective foreign mine workers for the AIDS virus, rejecting those found to be infected. The Malawi Government refused to allow the testing of its citizens, so no new workers from that country are being admitted. Migrants already working in the mines who are found to be infected during routine medical examinations are not sent home as long as they can work.
Some blacks now fear that the same policy could be applied to migrant workers from the four ethnic homelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei and Venda, which South Africa treats as ostensibly independent.
First Isolation, Then Migrant Labor The disease first appeared here among white men who contracted it through homosexual contacts in the United States and Western Europe. Of 215 South Africans who died of AIDS, 26 were flight attendants for South African Airways. The first case in a black heterosexual was not diagnosed until December 1987.
Although the country's relative isolation because of its apartheid may have helped protect its people from contact with AIDS, truck drivers and guest workers from countries to the north are believed to have introduced the disease into the black population, researchers say. The spread has been accelerated by the country's internal migrant labor system, which forced blacks to leave their families in rural areas and seek work in mines and factories around the white cities. This has caused a breakdown of the traditional family and an increase in prostitution and other promiscuity.
''The pillar of the educational program is one sexual partner,'' Dr. Sher said. ''But with the migrant labor system, it's condoned for a man to have a sexual partner where he's working.''
Black suspicion of Government motives has undercut the effectiveness of its limited AIDS education program. There has been widespread resistance to the use of condoms, which has been perceived as a Government trick to suppress the black birth rate.
''The Government isn't credible in the townships. Even where the Government has made a contribution, it's been minimal,'' said Dr. Nicky Padayachee, an epidemiologist who is national AIDS coordinator for the South African Health Workers Congress, a professional organization allied to the African National Congress.
Infection May Hit The Workers Hard ''The worst kind of scenario would be infection of about 30 to 40 percent of the black community,'' Dr. Padayachee said. ''At best, with the best program in the world, we would look at 5 percent,'' he said. But he added, ''I think once you hit 5 or 6 percent of the population, you're really in trouble.''
A report by the AIDS Economic Research Unit, a private group that advises South African businesses on the potential impact of an AIDS epidemic, concluded this year that a 10 percent incidence could devastate the country's economy, which is based on cheap black labor.
Among South African white heterosexuals, the incidence of AIDS has been so low as to be statistically insignificant. With the limited apparent threat to white families, the Government has been slow to respond. Last year, South Africa budgeted a little over $2 million for AIDS education and research, or half of what was spent by its war-ravaged neighbor Mozambique.
The Government has also been unwilling to introduce sex education in schools or let condoms be mentioned on state-controlled television, which some physicians say perpetuates the ignorance of AIDS.
''Bring AIDS out of the closet,'' said Dr. Motlana, the Soweto physician. ''Bring sex talk out of the closet.'' He and other physicians receive condoms from the Department of Health to distribute free to patients, but these do not reach healthy young people. Dr. Motlana wanted condoms made available in the shebeens, or township taverns, and minibus taxis.
Unpopular Condoms And Scare Tactics Condoms are commercially available, but a 60 percent import surcharge imposed on condoms, which are not produced locally, increases their cost to about 35 cents each. ''The guy would rather buy a beer than buy a condom,'' Dr. Padayachee said, The Conservative Party and other right-wing groups have exploited AIDS as a racial scare issue. Although South Africa has a reliable blood screening program, the Conservatives have asserted that there were dangers in not labelling blood donations by race. They also warned against integrating hospitals once restricted for whites only. The World Apartheid Movement, an extremist group, circulated a leaflet claiming that whites could catch AIDS if blacks sneezed or used the same hospital beds.
Politically motivated sanctions against South Africa have restricted its access to information about strategies used to combat AIDS in other countries. In keeping with United Nations resolutions, the World Health Organization, for example, does not cooperate with the South African Government. But South Africa has recently asked for technical assistance in fighting AIDS and the agency is now exploring the possibility of providing it, possibly by using a private group as an intermediary, according to Dr. Gottlieb L. Monekosso, W.H.O.'s regional director for Africa.
''South Africa is going to be forced to repeat the mistakes that other countries have made because they're out of contact,'' Dr. Grundy said. ''They don't lack money or resources. They lack experience.''
Dr. Padayachee said a joint effort was needed by the Government, white business and township organizations loyal to the African National Congress, to stop AIDS from spreading.
Plenty of Politicking; Health Is Ignored The African National Congress has said it takes the AIDS threat seriously. Some members died from AIDS after contracting the disease in Zambia, the headquarters of the A.N.C. in exile. With the prospect of sharing political power on the horizon, the congress does not want to inherit a health nightmare. Its secretary general, Alfred Nzo, stated that his liberation movement ''stands committed to support the programs and strategies that will alleviate the suffering of the AIDS victims and at the same time control the transmission of HIV infection.''
Yet after being banned for 30 years, the A.N.C. has been too involved organizing for open political activity to devote more tangible resources to the threat. Its leader, Nelson Mandela, has yet to address the AIDS issue publicly.
Despite rumors that returning exiles may be asked to undergo testing for the AIDS virus, the Government has not raised the issue formally with the African National Congress. Gill Marcus, a spokeswoman for the A.N.C., said the organization would never agree because such testing would discriminate against its members. Besides, Miss Marcus said, ''it's a total infringement of individual rights.''
In the absence of broader dialogue on the issue between blacks and whites, immediate political concerns will keep taking precedence over a concerted effort to forestall an AIDS disaster.
''We need the leaders,'' Dr. Sher said. ''We need Mr. Mandela to get up and stress the need for safer sex. But I can see he'll have political problems with that.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Poverty Is Down but Inequality Is Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Census Bureau reported today that there had been a slight decline in the proportion of Americans living in poverty but confirmed, more explicitly than ever before, that inequality in the distribution of income has increased substantially in the last two decades.
Last year, the bureau said, 12.8 percent of Americans had income below the official poverty level, which was $12,675 for a family of four. The poverty rate for 1989 was the lowest in the 1980's but was higher than for any year in the 1970's. The rate was 13 percent in 1988 and 13.4 percent in 1987. 
The bureau estimated that the number of Americans living in poverty declined to 31.5 million in 1989, from 31.7 million in 1988.
But, in releasing its annual report on poverty, the bureau said, ''There seems little doubt that the income distribution has become somewhat less equal over the past 20 years.''
 
Women Narrow the Gap
Today's report does not take account of economic developments since December. Many economists say poverty may rise this year, since the unemployment rate and the number food stamp recipients have been increasing amid signs of a recession after seven consecutive years of economic expansion.
The Census Bureau reported that the earnings of women who worked year round in full-time jobs increased 1.8 percent last year, after adjustment for inflation, while the earnings of men decreased 1.8 percent.
The median earnings for women, $18,780 last year, were 68 percent of the earnings for men, $27,430. The gap has been narrowing slowly since 1980, when it was 60 percent, the bureau said. The median is the midpoint; the number of people with income above the median is the same as the number below it.
Edward J. Welniak Jr., a Census Bureau statistician, said in an interview: ''A possible explanation for the increase in the earnings of women is the movement of the baby boom generation into its peak earning years, which tends to occur earlier for women than for men. The peak occurs from age 35 to 44 for women, while for men it occurs in the 45-to-54 age bracket.''
 
Household Income Compared
The bureau reported that median household income rose 1.3 percent last year, to $28,906, with black households showing an increase of 5.1 percent, to $18,083.
Household income was substantially higher for Asian-Americans than for whites: $36,102, as against $30,406. One reason was that Asian-American households tended to have more people than white households.
As used by the Census Bureau, ''Asian'' is a racial category that includes people from Japan, China, the Philippines, Korea, India and Vietnam.
Last year half the nation's poor were either children or elderly. ''The poverty rate for children continues, as it has since 1975, to be higher than that for any other age group,'' the report said.
The rate was 19.6 percent for children under 18 years of age and 22.5 percent for those under 6. Half of black children under 6 were living in poverty. Forty percent of Hispanic children and 17 percent of white children under 6 were poor, the bureau said.
 
The Poverty Level Defined
A family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less than $12,675 last year. The poverty level is adjusted each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The official poverty statistics are based exclusively on cash income. They do not reflect the value of a person's assets or of noncash benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, public housing and fringe benefits provided by employers.
If such benefits were counted as income they would reduce the poverty rate. But Census Bureau officials said the trend in poverty over the last decade would be very similar to that reflected in the official statistics.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said, ''The figures released today paint a discouraging picture of recent trends in poverty and income distribution.''
The Census Bureau observed that the share of all income going to the most affluent fifth of all households last year was ''significantly higher than the comparable figures for 1979 and 1969,'' while middle-income and poor households received ''somewhat lower shares.''
For the most affluent 5 percent of all families in the United States, average income rose to $148,438 in 1989, from $120,253 in 1979, the bureau reported. In the same 10-year period, it said, the average income for the poorest one-fifth of all families declined to $9,431, from $9,990.
Income distribution is an emotional issue in politics. Changes in such distribution from year to year are small. The Census Bureau has been much more cautious than many economists in commenting on the changes. But bureau officials said the trend was now clear, so they had no hesitation in writing about ''the growing inequality of the income distribution,'' as it was called in today's report.
The bureau said the reasons for the increased inequality of American incomes were not entirely clear. It listed several possibilities, including growth in the number of elderly people, in the number of people living alone and in the number of families headed by a woman, with no husband present.
Median household income for the elderly is about half that for the nonelderly, even though the poverty rate for the elderly, 11.4 percent, is lower than for the nation as a whole, the bureau said. Because of Social Security, many elderly people have incomes just above the poverty level, the report said.
The poverty data were based on interviews with 60,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation's population.

HEADLINE: President's Tax Plan: Benefits for the Not-So-Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The latest White House proposal to break the deadlock in the budget negotiations would be less beneficial to the very rich and help people who are moderately affluent more than would the Bush Administration's initial plan to cut the tax rate on capital gains.
But the new proposal, to adjust the capital gains tax so that profits attributable only to inflation would not be taxed, would still disproportionately cut the taxes of high-income taxpayers.
For that reason, Democrats in the budget talks oppose this proposed indexing of capital gains for inflation unless the Administration agrees to an offsetting higher tax on the wealthy. So the impasse remains. 
 
New Movement on Old Issue
Nevertheless, the new proposal has at least produced some movement on the issue that has been the sticking point in the budget talks: how to treat capital gains taxes. Many of the negotiators, including the Republican leaders, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, have suggested that if this hurdle could be cleared, the negotiators could reach the finish line in their negotiations before across-the-board spending cuts become automatic on Monday, the first day of the new fiscal year.
Capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments like stocks, bonds and real estate. Since 1986, they have been taxed at the same rate as salaries and wages.
In his election campaign, Mr. Bush promised to lower the capital gains rate. He said the change would generate more investment and savings, create new jobs and lead to greater national prosperity. Moreover, he has recently suggested that such a cut is especially important now to stimulate a flagging economy.
The Democrats in the budget talks maintain that most of the beneficiaries of a reduction in the capital gains tax, whether from a lower rate or from indexation, would be the well-to-do, a hardly arguable point, since affluent people make the vast majority of their profits from the sale of investments.
Studies show that about two-thirds of all capital gains are received by taxpayers with income above $200,000 and that more than three-quarters goes to those with incomes above $100,000.
With the new proposal, the White House is taking a somewhat different tack. It is saying that it is unfair to tax people on gains that are solely due to inflation.
 
Details Are Not Disclosed
Economists doubt that the advantages of indexation would be much different from those that would be obtained from a lower capital gains tax rate.
The details of the Administration's proposal on indexing have not been made public, and may not have been completely worked out.
Consequently, it is not clear whether the measure would apply indexation to all capital gains or just some, how capital losses would be treated and whether it would apply to investments bought in the past or just new investments.
Lowering the capital gains rate and tying the tax owed to inflation would both be more favorable to investors than would the existing tax law.
Under the current law, if taxpayers buy stock for $4,000 and sell it five years later for $8,000, they pay tax on the full 100 percent profit of $4,000. But under indexing, if the rate of inflation over the five-year period was 25 percent, they would pay tax on only $3,000, the 75 percent of their profit that represents a real increase in purchasing power and is not due just to inflation.
Capital gains taxes are indexed ins ome other countries, including Britain and Australia. The idea has been discussed here for years by scholars but has never seriously been considered in Congress.
A study published last month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded, ''Because capital gains are received primarily by higher-income taxpayers, any tax reduction could be expected to benefit higher-income taxpayers disproportionately.''
But the study went on to show that the tax reductions from a lower capital gains rate ''would be concentrated to a greater degree among higher-income taxpayers than would the reductions from indexation.''
 
Study Shows Rich Are Taxed More
Using 1981 tax returns of people who sold common stock, the budget office found that taxpayers with incomes below $100,000 would pay less taxes with indexation than with a 30 percent lower tax rate, while those with higher incomes would be better off with the lower tax rate.
An income of $100,000 in 1981 would be equivalent to an income of about $130,000 today.
The inflation rate was especially high in the late 1970's and early 1980's, which might have skewed the study. But the budget office said the same results were obtained when tax figures from other years were examined.
The budget office did not speculate on why indexation seemed to be more favorable for the very rich and less favorable for those less well off.
C. Eugene Steuerle, a top tax official in the Reagan Administration who is now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a research organization here, suggested that the richest people were probably better at playing the markets and that those less affluent were more likely to buy stocks that did not appreciate so rapidly.
The reason is not, Mr. Steuerle and other scholars emphasized, because the rich tend to buy and sell stocks rapidly, while the less affluent hold stocks longer.
First, they said, over almost any long period of time examined, the stock market tends to outperform inflation. Second, capital gains are not taxed when the owner of the investment dies, so the wealthy have an incentive to hold property for their heirs.
 
Large Loss of Revenue Is Seen
The budget office said the economic effect in terms of stimulating investment and saving would be about the same with indexing as it would with a lower rate.
But it suggested that the loss of revenue to the Government might be much larger under indexing.
That is another reason why lawmakers might not find the suggestion appealing.
An attraction of the original Bush plan to cut the tax rate was that it would actually generate more revenue for the Government in the first year, since people would be encouraged to sell property. That would make it easier to reduce the Federal deficit at first.
Over five years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, it would cost the Government more than $20 billion.

HEADLINE: College Tuition Costs Increase at Slower Pace

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
The cost of a year of college in the United States rose in a range of 5 to 8 percent this year, marking a modest slowing of increases in college tuition and fees for the country's 12 million undergraduates, according to a College Board survey that is to be released today.
The average rate of increase was lowest among public two-year instutitions and highest among two-year and four-year private colleges and universities. In dollars and cents, students this academic year are being charged an average of $884 for tuition and fees at public two-year schools and $9,391 at private four-year colleges and universities, the survey reported. 
The previous year, the average costs of entering a four-year public college rose 8 percent, while four-year private institutions showed a 9 percent average increase. Comparative information for two-year institutions last year was not available, said Janice A. Gams, a board spokeswoman.
''It's not a big drop,'' said David W. Breneman, an economist and visiting professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. ''If it keeps going up by 8 percent a year, the cost will double in nine years.''
But Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, called the slight drop a ''welcome sign of moderation.''
College students are also paying more for housing. Average annual costs for students living on campus rose to $4,150 from $3,160 for room and board, a 5 to 7 percent increase over last year, the survey found.
Precise reasons for the overall increases are unclear, economists said yesterday. But a recent study prepared for the American Council on Education and the College Board found that, since the early 1980's, public institutions have been getting declining state support, while private or independent schools have required higher tuitions and student fees to pay for improved services, faculty salaries, services and increased student financial aid.
But Dr. Breneman speculates that the rapid inflation rates of the 1970's caught college administrators off guard, so to catch up, they began increasing tuition and fees.
''They found that it was good money,'' Dr. Breneman said. ''The colleges started putting the extra money into quality improvement and ways to make themselves more competitive. It has achieved a momentum now.''

HEADLINE: Rinfret Snubs G.O.P. Peace Session

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EASTCHESTER, N.Y., Sept. 26

 BODY:
The New York State Republican Party rented Alex and Henry's Roman Gardens catering hall today for a political wedding. They hired a Dixieland jazz band, prepared a slide show, enlisted attractive women with Rinfret for Governor signs and even offered a choice of chicken or steak for the guests.
Then, the bridegroom, Pierre A. Rinfret, the party's candidate for governor, did not show up. Just as he was stood up on Friday by a half dozen Republican leaders when he called a meeting, he stood up 40 of them today. 
Instead of attending the session here, Mr. Rinfret, whose public feud with Republican leaders has embarrassed the party, sent an ultimatum. In it he demanded recognition as the ''undisputed leader'' of the party. He only recently became an enrolled Republican.
He also called on party leaders to endorse his fiscal programs, including one calling for a 20 percent cut in the state work force in his first term, even though many Republican legislators receive contributions from the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents most state workers.
 
Republicans Don't Cry
The result was more attention for Mr. Rinfret than he received when he suggested privatizing the subways. It also meant more attention for a party in so much turmoil that its leaders were reduced to laughter here today because, several said, men, particularly Republicans, do not cry.
The party's state chairman, J. Patrick Barrett, had prepared them for what was supposed to be a love fest aimed at repairing the damage caused when Mr. Rinfret called Republican Senate leaders bedmates of his Democratic opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Rinfret's son, Peter, his associate in an economic consulting firm, presented a letter from his father and a resolution that Pierre Rinfret wanted passed intact before he would fly from Manhattan to the meeting.
Pierre Rinfret wrote that the Republican leaders had tried to ''buy me off with a hand full of money.'' He said he was offered the ''grand total of $40,000 to shut up, go away and run a dismal campaign for governor.''
 
Lots of Chicken Uneaten
While most Republicans picked at their chicken and steak, several, led by Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County Republican chairman who had offered Mr. Rinfret $25,000 of the $40,000, spent 50 minutes negotiating with Pierre Rinfret, by telephone, and Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate majority leader.
The negotiations failed, at least for now, and the ceremony ended with a lot of chicken uneaten, the band unheard and the slide show unseen.
Mr. Mondello, in an interview later, sounded as if he were trying to get President Bush and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq together, saying that he was confident that somehow, somewhere, he would get Pierre Rinfret and Mr. Marino ''in a room together.''

HEADLINE: New York Told To Hire Advisers On Drug Abuse

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
William Bennett, the nation's chief drug policy official, said yesterday that New York City was not doing enough to combat the cocaine and heroin epidemic. He recommended that the city hire three or four special consultants.
Mr. Bennett said Mayor David N. Dinkins must ''get control of the streets.'' 
''He should take the best three or four minds in the business and put them on the payroll as consultants,'' Mr. Bennett said in a conversation with several reporters at a midtown hotel. ''You've got an emergency situation. You've got to grab for all the help you can get.''
In response, Mr. Dinkins said: ''I'm pleased to have Secretary Bennett's advice and counsel. Perhaps he's unaware of that which we have already done.'' Mr. Bennett is a former Secretary of Education.
''What we need,'' Mr. Dinkins added, ''is a little more help out of the Federal Government.''
 
New Drug Policy Director
At the same time, Mr. Dinkins announced the appointment of David Condliffe as director of the city's newly created office of drug abuse policy. The post was recommended last spring by a mayoral study group on drug abuse.
Mr. Condliffe, 42 years old, a former City Hall aide in the Lindsay administration, has been special adviser to the city's Human Resources Administration since late 1989.
Mr. Bennett made his remarks at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza after a news conference in which the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, a Washington-based coalition of business organizations, reported that in a survey of professional and blue-collar workers in New York state, 62 percent said they thought their employers should set up drug-testing programs.
Mr. Bennett said that other studies have shown that 70 percent of the regular drug users in the United States hold full-time jobs and that he considers the workplace to be one of the important fronts in fighting drugs.
In the new survey, in which 501 people were interviewed by telephone by the Gallup Organization Inc., 64 percent said employers should have the right to test employees suspected of drug use; 58 percent said they favored testing job applicants for drugs. The employees were almost evenly divided, 45 percent to 40 percent, on whether employers should be able to test workers randomly for drugs.

HEADLINE: President of Colombia Tours A Drug Center in New York

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The President of Colombia visited a Queens drug-treatment center yesterday and told the residents that their addiction is taking a terrible toll on his country.
''Thousands of Colombians are losing their lives because of the narcotics traffickers,'' President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo told the residents of Phoenix House in Long Island City. ''A lot of their money comes from the streets of the United States and Europe. And some of that money goes to terrorists, people who kill police, judges and politicians. Three hundred police in Colombia have been killed this year.'' 
President Gaviria, who was elected in May on an anti-drug platform, emphasized the need for increased efforts to reduce drug consumption.
''We have to work on the problem of consumption, not just interdiction,'' he said after an hour tour of the 300-bed residential treatment center.
Phoenix House, which was founded in 1967, operates five other centers in New York and four in California.
 
Renouncing Drug Addiction
Mr. Gaviria, who arrived in New York on Tuesday night and will address the United Nations today, praised Phoenix House for its work in rehabilitating former drug addicts, and said that drug abuse had to be fought with ''individual principles.''
The 43-year-old President, who was inaugurated on Aug. 7, became a candidate after another Presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken critic of the country's drug cartels, was assassinated in August 1989. Mr. Gaviria, an economist, had been Mr. Galan's campaign chairman.
Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House, said: ''The solution to the drug problem is on the demand side. President Gaviria saw a solution here, because as individuals renounce drugs, the nation renounces drugs.''
Larry Grant, one of several Phoenix House residents who escorted the Colombian President and his wife, Ana Milena Munoz, through the center, was impressed by his warmth and interest in the program. ''He asked us how it prepares us when we leave,'' he said.
Leslie Alvarado, another resident who accompanied Mr. Gaviria, said: ''He was interested in how a person who uses drugs comes into a treatment program and changes. I think he was surprised that we as individuals really want to change.''

HEADLINE: A Magazine for Every Child

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
WHEN John Papanek was an editor and writer at Sports Illustrated, he was well known in certain circles. But no one ever sent in a T-shirt asking for his autograph.
But since Mr. Papanek began editing Sports Illustrated for Kids last year, he has felt like a celebrity. Besides numerous requests for his autograph, he receives more than 100 letters a day filled with cartoons, personal stories and even jokes, like the one from Kristi Geise, age 11, in Yuba City, Calif. She wrote: ''What do you get when you spill soda pop in a golf bag? Ickey Woods!''
Randi Hacker also receives passionate letters from the children who read the new magazine she publishes, P3, which is dedicated to the environment. ''Children are using their letters to tell us how they feel about earth, and how scared they are,'' Miss Hacker said. 
Magazines for children is hardly a new idea: Highlights for Children, which is 45 years old, is thriving, leading the field with its circulation of three million. But in the last two years, dozens of new ones have started as publishers try to appeal to a growing, economically powerful and loyal audience.
Although the overall magazine business is losing advertising these days, publishers of children's magazines believe they are in a better position because the number of children has been growing and because they are not seeking ads in categories that have been declining, like alcohol and cigarettes.
The range of magazines is evident in Magazines for Children, a guidebook with 123 entries that was published last year by the Educational Press Association of America in Glassboro, N.J., and the International Reading Association in Newark, Del. The editor, Donald R. Stoll, has the names of 30 new magazines for the next issue.
Magazines sometimes appeal more to children than books do, said Mr. Stoll, whose organization began publishing the guidebook as a way to promote literacy. ''It seems to be a more exciting kind of learning experience that's not associated with the classroom,'' he said.
Magazines for children, like those for adults, are targeted to diverse and specialized interests. There are glossy, trendy publications as well as serious, literary ones. Budding consumer activists can get shopping advice from Zillions, put out by Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports. Young writers can publish their poems and stories in Merlyn's Pen, a literary magazine made up solely of their contributions.
And like adults, children seem attracted to magazines that fill some particular need or desire. ''I like scientific stuff,'' said Kelly McInnis, a 9-year-old in St. Charles, Mo., who reads National Geographic World, a publication for children.
Spencer Wolff, who is 10 and lives in New York, reads several magazines, including Nintendo Power. ''It gives me hints about how to win games.'' Ashley, his 7-year-old sister, reads Ranger Rick, a nature magazine published by the National Wildlife Federation, because it has stories about animals. She also reads the magazines that come to her mother in the mail. ''I like to look at the clothing,'' she said.
Akilah Nelson, a 9-year-old who lives in Lawnside, N.J., reads her mother's copy of Ebony. ''Sometimes I cut out pictures and put them on paper,'' she said. ''Pictures of Janet Jackson and Nelson Mandela.'' She said she likes children's magazines that give her facts about people and tells her what other children are doing.
The children's magazine field, although growing more crowded, still seems appealing to publishers. New this month is Ladybug, a magazine with stories, puzzles and poems for children age 2 to 7. It is being put out by Open Court Publishing the publishers of Cricket, a similar magazine for 6- to 14-year-olds.
Walt Disney Publishing in Burbank, Calif., will begin publishing Disney Adventures, a 132-page digest-sized publication for children age 7 to 14 on Oct. 9, with nearly a million copies scheduled to be printed. The magazine will have profiles, nature and science stories, games and, of course, cartoons.
In its November issue, Field and Stream will include a junior version as a prototype. Time has been considering a similar plan,and Fortune, too, is studying the possibility of publishing a Fortune for children or teen-agers. ''There's so little out there that's sophisticated,'' said Emma Dockendorff, a spokeswoman for Fortune.
One publisher came to that conclusion eight years ago and has profited by it. Donald E. Welsh, president of Welsh Publishing Group in New York, decided to start a magazine when his daughter, who was then 9, asked for a subscription to People magazine for Christmas. Wondering why, he looked at what was available for children.
''They all talked down to kids,'' Mr. Welsh said. ''It was all about little lambs and bears, like being in 1950.'' His four magazines, devoted to Barbie, Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mickey Mouse and the Real Ghostbusters, have a circulation of almost four million.
Many publishers have been inspired by the success of Sports Illustrated for Kids, which has attracted a great deal of advertising and reached a circulation of 850,000 since starting in January 1989. Surveys show the readers are so loyal that they go through each monthly issue seven times, said Ann S. Moore, the publisher.
''The demographics for kids are terrific,'' said Michael Lynton, the vice president of marketing for Walt Disney Publishing. ''There are more of them, and they are more active in making decisions.'' Children not only have their own money to spend; they are also influential in deciding what foods, drinks, vacations and even cars the family will buy.
But children present both advantages and disadvantages for publishers. Being in tune with what they want is the first challenge for adults who are used to writing for their peers. At Sports Illustrated for Kids, editors frequently sit behind one-way mirrors and watch as children have discussions with moderators about what they are interested in.
Still, children's interests can be difficult to know. Alden Nusser, an 8-year-old New Yorker, reads Sports Illustrated for Kids and Zoobooks. But he dislikes some children's magazines even though their editors believe he is part of the target age group. ''I don't really like the ones for little kids, like Ranger Rick,'' Alden said. Sometimes, he added, he looks at magazines like National Geographic and Conde Nast Traveler.
Because children outgrow magazines directed at them, publishers have a constant need to find new subscribers. ''There is going to be a turnover every three years,'' said Mr. Stoll of Magazines for Children.
Since it is so expensive to replace subscribers, some publishers say advertising is a better way to finance operations.
But some publishers find the idea of advertising distasteful. Mark Diamond, who started Atlanta Kids in June 1989 with his wife, Francine Kaplan, quickly found that each issue needed 10 pages of advertising to make a profit. That bothered him, so he has suspended publication while he looks for financing.
''I have an opposition to hype, and that's what advertising is,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''Many kids have not been taught to be wary.''
 
Current Reading
THERE is an enormous range of magazines available to children. Here are some of the articles they are offering:
The winter issue of BARBIE, a quarterly, will include a profile of the Simpsons, a piece called ''Move It'' about fitness, and one called ''Bow Wow,'' a fashion spread about velvet dresses in which dogs wear some of the accessories.
The current HIGHLIGHTS has fiction, puzzles and nonfiction, including a profile of the baseball player Jim Abbott; ''What Happened to the Dinosaurs?,'' written by a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and an article about Africans who use dolphins to track fish.
P3, about the environment, has a story about how seals are killed by plastic garbage; a profile of the Ranger of the Month; and stories about the Earth Patrol, people the magazine says are making the earth a better place to live.
ZILLIONS has ''Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Twinkies'' and ''The Inside Story on L.A. Gear.''
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED FOR KIDS has stories on Christian Okoye, a top N.F.L. running back, and the adventures of ''Jack B. Quick, Sports Detective.''
CRICKET has a recipe for pumpkin muffins, a haunted-house maze and articles about Japan.
The Magazines for Children directory is $5.25 and can be ordered from the International Reading Association, Order Department, P.O. Box 8139, Newark, Del. 19714-8139.

The Argument That Japan Guides the U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Agents of Influence
By Pat Choate
Illustrated. 295 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $22.95.
Here's a book highly critical of Japan that all but dares its readers to accuse it of Japan-bashing. For anyone tempted to accuse his provocative ''Agents of Influence'' of being biased against Japan, Pat Choate would cite Chapter 10, ''Japan's Six Excuses,'' where he lists the major ''themes'' that Japanese ''propaganda'' now stresses in dealing with critics of what he characterizes as Japan's manipulation of America's political and economic system. 
Here Mr. Choate writes: ''Although Japan has dozens of excuses to justify its closed markets'' - by which he means what he sees as its refusal to allow American companies to sell their goods in Japan's domestic market - ''they can be grouped into six general themes. (1) 'Japan creates jobs for Americans.' (2) 'Japan's critics are racists.' (3) 'It's America's fault.' (4) 'Globalization.' (5) 'Japan is unique.' (6) 'Japan is changing its ways.' '' Obviously, Mr. Choate contests each of these assertions.
Yet once having freed himself to speak by saying, in effect, that one can criticize the Japanese without being anti-Japanese, whom does he level his main fire against? None other than his fellow Americans.
To him it's a given that Japan has always aimed to capture the United States' markets without allowing penetration of its own. That's the way things have been, he argues, ever since the end of World War II, when American banking and business interests with holdings in Japan prevailed against Gen. Douglas MacArthur's plan to break up ''the family-owned super-conglomerates that dominated Japan's prewar economy and fueled its militaristic and imperial ambitions.''
To begin with, Mr. Choate maintains, Japan ''destroyed the American television industry,'' by first creating ''an anti-competitive cartel'' and then reinforcing it with ''diplomacy, fraud, and the influence of Washington insiders in a direct assault on the American consumer electronics industry.'' Then came ''victories'' in ''supercomputers, machine tools, ball bearings, optical fibers, satellites, rice, biotechnology, air transport, telecommunications, semiconductors, legal and financial services, among dozens of others.'' Today, the author concludes, ''no American industry - regardless of how competitive - is safe.''
What distresses Mr. Choate is that Americans are permitting this invasion of their economy to proceed apace. ''In a sense,'' he writes, ''this book is not about Japan or any other foreign interest. It is about a fundamental problem with American governance - one that allows foreign interests to assume a dangerously large role in America's politics and policymaking through political manipulation.''
The list of the United States' vulnerabilities is extensive, in Mr. Choate's view: The country is too dependent on foreign capital. States and localities compete too vigorously to attract foreign corporations. These companies are too free to participate in American elections. Too many loopholes exist in the laws requiring registration of foreign agents. Most damaging of all, ''a revolving door'' permits too easy passage from public service to the payroll of foreign interests. (A prominent feature of this book is an appendix identifying 207 former American officials of the decade just past, including diplomats, members of Congress, C.I.A. personnel and White House staff members, who have gone on to represent foreign governments and corporations in Washington.) These flaws in the system make America pregnable to Japan's corrupting cultural and economic influence, Mr. Choate concludes. It is not that thinkers are paid to believe that free trade is best for Japanese-American relations. It is that those who believe in free trade can be promoted by subtle means. It's like the invasion of the body-snatchers, as Mr. Choate depicts things; they come in the night and their victims don't even know they've been possessed.
Unfortunately, Mr. Choate's argument is weakened by irritating flaws in its presentation. His text is haphazardly organized and choppily written. Only once or twice does he settle into a case history that truly absorbs the reader. On the one hand, he blames the budget deficit for making the country prey to Japanese influence; on the other hand, he dismisses Japan's blaming of the budget deficit for America's trade imbalance.
He makes occasional statements unattributed to any source. Discussing Japanese reaction to his earlier book ''The High-Flex Society,'' he refers to officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry getting in touch with ''executives in the Tokyo office of my corporate employer,'' but never identifies that employer, a lapse of tact in a book about hidden influence. A biographical note describes Mr. Choate as a political economist, lecturer and writer living in Washington.
For a book that purports to be about ''our'' problem, he throws a remarkable number of rotten tomatoes at ''them.'' But then, one can see what he is getting at. ''They'' have become ''our'' problem, if he is right, and at the rate things are going, we are in danger of becoming theirs. Despite all its fireworks, this book really does raise the level of the debate above mere name-calling. Most tellingly, it identifies what may be a flaw in our society that goes deeper than Japan's purported economic infiltration. Mr. Choate writes: ''The lobbying game is played by 'lawyers' rules.' . . . The lawyer-client relationship of the adversarial court proceeding has been grafted on to the lobbyist-client relationship. In the process, many lawyer-lobbyists have learned to adhere to the adversarial standards of the courtroom. They proceed as if they had a fiduciary and ethical responsibility to help their client win at all costs, even when winning for a foreign company or government runs counter to the interests of the nation.''
This has a ring of truth about it that makes the issue of Japan-bashing really beside the point.

HEADLINE: Treasury Urges Restrictions On Bank Deposit Insurance

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that restrictions should be placed on insurance coverage of deposits at banks and suggested that the insurance premiums paid by the banks be pegged to the risk involved in their investments and loans.
In presenting the Administration's latest views before the Senate Banking Committee today, Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber said the current level of deposit protection, $100,000, should not be lowered. But he added that the Government should close loopholes that permitted virtually unlimited coverage through multiple accounts held by individuals, pension funds and institutions.
Mr. Glauber thus joined a growing debate in Washington among lawmakers and regulators about the necessary steps that must be taken to avoid the collapse of the weakening bank insurance fund, which now stands at $13.2 billion. 
In July, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady signaled in Congressional testimony that the $100,000 amount of insurance coverage should not be lowered. But he said then that the Administration was leaning toward limiting individuals and businesses to a maximum of $100,000 in deposit insurance, whether in one or several accounts.
Mr. Glauber said today that ''adverse trends in both the banking industry and the bank insurance fund are clear causes for concern,'' but he emphasized that the difficulties encountered by the banking industry were smaller than those plaguing the savings and loan community.
Nearly a dozen proposals to ease the financial stress on the banking industry have been introduced in Congress, ranging from drastically cutting insurance coverage to increasing significantly the premiums paid by banks to overhauling the whole banking system.
The ratio of insurance to deposits is now about 70 cents for every $100, its lowest level since the fund was created during the Great Depression. Regulators have warned that an economic downturn or the collapse of one or several large banks could exhaust the fund. The fund has declined by $5 billion in the last two years, and it is expected to lose at least $2 billion this year.
The worsening condition of the fund comes as many large banks are struggling with growing real estate portfolios in softening markets, continued problem loans to lesser-developed nations and borrowings by corporations with their own financial difficulties. As a result, many larger banks are finding it increasingly difficult to raise additional capital.
 
F.D.I.C. Seeks Maximum
In response to these problems, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has proposed increasing bank premiums paid to the fund by 30 percent, to 19.5 cents per $100 in deposits, the maximum amount allowed by law, beginning next year.
Senior Republicans and Democrats in Congress, as well as the Treasury Department, have agreed in principle to eliminate caps that prevent the insurance agency from further raising the premiums. They expect that a measure removing the limits will be adopted before Congress takes a recess next month.
But strong concern has also arisen among regulators and lawmakers that too steep an increase in insurance premiums could create more problems by causing more banks to collapse. A study released this week by the Congressional Budget Office starkly posed the difficulties confronting the bank insurance fund.
The study concluded that premiums would have to rise to 43 cents for every $100 in deposits to get the insurance fund to the level required by Federal legislation adopted last year - $1.25 per $100 in deposits by 1995. But a levy that high, the study said, would cause as many as 40 large institutions to become insolvent.
Treasury officials expect to complete a report by the end of the year describing what steps should be taken to overhaul the nation's banking system. The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., said Congress would be willing to put aside much of its regular business to get the changes implemented quickly.
The remarks of Mr. Glauber today before the banking committee reflected how the Treasury's report had been evolving.
As a practical matter, deposit insurance coverage is now virtually limitless. A customer avoids the limitations by taking out multiple accounts, each insured for up to $100,000. In a majority of bank failures, the F.D.I.C., in effect, protects accounts of more than $100,000 by transferring the deposits of the collapsed institutions to a solvent one, giving it a cash infusion.
Mr. Glauber told the committee that limiting the number of accounts protected by insurance would be a formidable but not insurmountable administrative problem.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has said that the most likely method of keeping track of multiple accounts would be through Social Security numbers, although he did not elaborate.
 
Insurance on Other Accounts
Mr. Glauber also said the Administration was committed to limiting the number of insured accounts for each depositor. He also questioned whether ''pass-through'' accounts - like pension funds, brokered deposits and other funds that are placed in bank accounts to gain the benefits of bank insurance - should be federally insured.
He added that the Administration had also supported the concept of ''risk-based'' premiums, so that the contributions to the insurance fund would be based on an institution's financial condition.
 
A 'Useful Complement'
Mr. Glauber acknowledged that it would be difficult to determine levels of risk in setting the premiums on deposit insurance, but he said that such premiums would be a ''useful complement to capital in deterring excessive risk at the margin.''
He also told the banking committee that the Administration was studying the idea of encouraging private insurers to become involved in deposit insurance. But he expressed concern that such companies ''would not step up to bat when they're really needed'' should a major catastrophe occur.
Bank lobbyists and Government officials have said that a critical issue yet to be determined is whether to abandon what is known as the ''too-big-to-fail'' policy. Under this tacit policy, in effect for years, the Government has made whole all of the depositors of some large institutions, even those with deposits greater than $100,000, as well as other creditors of a failed bank.
Mr. Glauber did not address the policy at today's banking committee hearing. But in an afternoon appearance in Washington at a private meeting of world bank regulators, he said the policy should not be removed by Congress because regulators should continue to have the authority to handle bank collapses that jeopardize the entire financial system.
In recent days, Mr. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, and the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, have come out against the ''too-big-to-fail'' policy.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A G.M. Car With a Japanese Feel

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Saturn, the soon-to-be-introduced car that General Motors has for five years heralded as an import fighter, lives up to the company's game plan: It feels and drives very much like a Japanese car.
A test drive and close examination of the Saturn, which the General Motors Corporation has continued to keep under wraps in the weeks before its Oct. 11 introduction, reveals a car with none of the parts or styling flourishes that signal a model from the company that builds Chevrolets, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Cadillacs and Buicks.
For example, Saturn's windshield wiper wand, radio and gauges do not resemble those used on every other G.M. car, and indeed give the impression that one is driving a Japanese car. And the G.M. logo does not appear anywhere on the car and will not appear in its advertising material. 
The Saturn's ride and handling have a Japanese feel. The manual shifter on the SC coupe moves through the gears with the buttery smoothness of a Honda shifter, which is regarded as the world's standard by many in Detroit. And unlike many domestic cars that sway or roll in turns or over bumps, the Saturn has a more precise, tightly controlled feel like the Japanese cars it is intended to imitate.
G.M. executives say they want Saturn to sell at least 80 percent of its cars to customers who normally would buy imports like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. Merely to entice Pontiac and Olds owners to buy Saturns would accomplish little. Hence, the intended resemblance to Japanese cars.
The $100 million task of selling Saturn to the public is in the hands of the San Francisco advertising agency Hal Riney & Partners, which gave a preview of its campaign in Los Angeles yesterday. [Page D21.] Times have changed: Where the Japanese once came to the United States to learn how Americans build cars, the Saturn project is the boldest example so far of how the Americans are now learning from the Japanese.
G.M. in recent months agreed to allow a few outsiders to test the three Saturn models. This week a New York Times reporter was allowed to drive the three models over a hundred miles of country roads near the auto maker's proving grounds in Milford, Mich. However, the company is embargoing until next month any official photos or specific details about the car's performance, including its fuel-efficiency rating and horsepower.
General Motors has been trying for three decades to build a small car that is competitive with small, efficient and high-performing imports. Among G.M.'s unsuccessful attempts to blunt the surge of imports were the Pontiac Sunbirds and Chevy Cavaliers of the early 1980's and the Chevy Vega of the early 1970's. The Corvair, introduced in 1960, was G.M.'s first response to cars like the Volkswagen Beetle.
In the last decade G.M.'s share of the United States market has fallen to 35 percent from roughly 45 percent, translating into lost sales of about 1.5 million cars and trucks annually. Japanese car makers now hold about a third of the United States market. Moreover, the erosion has occurred mostly among younger buyers, whose loyalty is critical to any auto maker's long-term success.
The three Saturn models to be introduced next month are the SL 1, a sports sedan; the SL 2, a more luxurious sports sedan, and the SC sports coupe. Saturn executives have not decided on a price yet, but they say all three base models will start at between $10,000 and $12,000.
The cars will be distributed through a limited number of Saturn dealers, only 30 or so of which will be open when cars start arriving from the factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., on Oct. 25. Within a year that number should rise to more than 100. The first cars will be shipped mostly to California, where import buying is strongest, providing the truest test of the car's appeal.
 
Prospects for Success Uncertain
But as with any new vehicle model, Saturn's prospects for success are uncertain at best. The situation in Iraq and concern over the economy and energy prices have cast a shadow over an already-crowded automotive market. Indeed, a diplomatic or military crisis close to the time of the public introduction might overshadow advertising and promotional efforts.
Saturn executives say production and sales of the car will rise slowly over the next year. Depending on demand, production could exceed 200,000 cars annually. If Saturn reaches full production - and sells 80 percent to import buyers - it could win back as much as 1.5 percentage points of G.M.'s lost market share.
The new car's looks have already fooled some Americans. ''We were testing the car out on the street in Fort Lauderdale and some guy drove by yelling 'Buy American,' '' said Stan Sowler, chief of vehicle development for Saturn. ''We got a kick out of that.''
While the car seems different from other G.M. models in many ways, some people who have seen it say Saturn's exterior styling vaguely resembles that of other G.M. cars. Mr. Sowler acknowledged that many who have seen the car remarked on a strong resemblance to the Geo Storm sold by Chevrolet. Saturn stylists at first had considered bolder, more expressive lines, but surveys of potential customers convinced them it was a bad idea.
The SL 1 sedan, designed to compete with the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, features many of the little touches that come as a result of careful engineering, such as a door that opens a few inches more than normal to allow easy entrances and exits.
Saturn's exterior, unlike its Japanese competitors, is mostly made of plastic panels bolted to a steel frame. The plastic is resilient, as a Saturn engineer demonstrated with a few swift kicks and no apparent damage.
The Saturn project was announced as a new G.M. subsidiary in 1985. Roger B. Smith, who retired in August as chairman, dedicated it to reinventing the way cars are designed, built and sold.
Before developing the car, Saturn executives had to create a new manufacturing organization and a new factory complex in Spring Hill. Engineers and managers were picked from within G.M., but the operating procedures were designed with less bureaucracy and far more flexibility than at regular G.M. divisions.

The Commerce Department reported that the orders for durable goods, relatively expensive items expected to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $127 billion after a revised 2.7 percent rise in July. 
Analysts saw special significance in the 11.2 percent drop, to $35.4 billion, in nonmilitary capital goods orders, which are often a barometer of business plans to expand and modernize.
 
Effects of Oil Rise Cited
''On the surface it seems to suggest that producers are wary about the economic outlook,'' said Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. ''There's no way that producer investment won't be affected by oil prices, particularly if they stay above $35 a barrel.''
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, oil prices have soared from less than $15 a barrel to nearly $40. The price shock has further weakened an already sluggish economy that some economists say is slipping into a recession.
William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in both new and unfilled orders meant the economy ''will fall into a recession in the fourth quarter.''
 
Rise in Consumer Spending
Another Commerce Department report today showed that consumers' spending and income grew at a sluggish pace last month. The department said August consumer spending was up five-tenths of 1 percent from July, but the June and July figures, at sixth-tenths of 1 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, were slightly stronger than first reported.
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. The report said personal income grew three-tenths of 1 percent in August.
In durable goods, military orders, which are often volatile, jumped 12.4 percent, to $8.4 billion, after a 5.6 percent decline in July. ''My guess is that almost all of that was due to the Persian Gulf,'' Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington said. Excluding the military category, orders fell 1.6 percent.
Both electrical machinery and transportation categories posted gains while orders for nonelectrical machinery and primary metals fell.
 
Transportation Increase
Orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3 percent, to $35.2 billion, mostly for motor vehicles. Aircraft orders fell about $3 billion. Excluding the transportation category, durable goods orders fell 1.6 percent. Transportation orders jumped 4.5 percent in July.
Electrical machinery orders rose 2.6 percent, to $20.8 billion, after a 1.5 percent gain a month earlier.
But nonelectrical machinery orders fell 6.1 percent, to $21.2 billion, after rising 3.5 percent in July. Orders for primary metals slipped 1.7 percent, to $11.6 billion, after rising 2.8 percent the previous month.
Shipments of durable goods rose 2.9 percent, to $128.7 billion, in August, most of which consisted of motor vehicles. Shipments had fallen 1.8 percent in July.
Unfilled orders edged down three-tenths of 1 percent, to $499.3 billion, after rising six-tenths a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Spending And Income In Slow Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The incomes and spending of Americans grew at a sluggish pace in August, the Commerce Department said today, adding fresh evidence that consumers pinched by rising energy prices are worried about a slowing economy.
Personal income went up by three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.68 trillion, after an increase of five-tenths in July. It was the smallest income gain in four months, since a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in April. 
Spending picked up by only five-tenths of 1 percent last month, after rises of six-tenths in July and 1.2 percent in June. Spending in May was unchanged from a month earlier.
After adjusting the figures to eliminate the effect of inflation, spending fell by one-tenth of 1 percent in August, after gains of three-tenths in July and 1 percent in June.
 
Impact Since Iraq Move
The August spending drop showed the impact of higher inflation since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 that sent oil prices soaring.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, so reduced personal consumption eventually shows up in lower factory output.
Today's figures also showed that lower personal spending did not mean more money was going into bank accounts or investments, because personal savings fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $171 billion in August, from $179 billion in July and $182 billion in June.
As a percentage of disposable income after taxes, the personal savings rate went down last month, to 4.3 percent, from 4.5 percent in July and 4.6 percent in June. Commerce Department officials said that was the lowest savings rate in nearly a year, since a decline to 4 percent in September 1989.
 
Pool for Expansion
In many other countries, high personal savings rates create a pool of investment capital that can be borrowed for economic expansion. For example, Japan's savings rate is 15 percent and Canada's is 10 percent.
Total personal consumption spending dropped in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.69 trillion from $3.67 trillion in July.
Spending on durable goods was down to an annual rate of $480 billion, from $486 billion in July, but spending for nondurables went up slightly, to $1.2 billion from $1.19 billion. Spending on services increased to $2.01 billion last month from $2 billion in July.

NCNB and Meridian Hurt by Bad Loans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The NCNB Corporation and Meridian Bancorp yesterday joined a growing list of banking companies admitting that problems with real estate loans would hurt earnings in the third quarter.
Analysts are expecting many such reports. Already, the Chase Manhattan Corporation said it expects to lose $625 million in the third quarter because of losses on real estate loans and expenses associated with cutting its payroll by 5,000 workers. 
''This is shaping up as a wasted year for bank earnings,'' said Rai Archibold, a New York-based banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, a securities firm. ''Bankers are deciding that if they have problems, it is better to take action now rather than wait.''
NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., is the seventh-largest banking company in the country. It said that problem loans would reduce third-quarter profits to between $55 milliion and $65 million, down from $137.4 million in the second quarter. It said the loan problems required that $145 million be set aside as a reserve for losses in the third quarter, and that it would charge off as a loss $75 million to $85 million in loans.
Meridian, based in Reading, Pa., is the fourth-largest banking company in Pennsylvania. It said bad real estate and business loans were the primary reason for an expected third-quarter loss of about $35 million to $39 million, down from a profit of $21.1 million in the second quarter.
''The economy is getting worse before it gets better, and we decided this was a time to focus on our basic banking businesses,'' said Samuel A. McCullough, chairman of Meridian.
Besides setting aside a large reserve to cover its losses on real estate loans, Meridian plans to sell $300 million of credit card loans, about $300 million of automobile loans and its American Title Insurance subsidiary.
The stock of NCNB and Meridian fell sharply yesterday. NCNB, which did not announce its plans until late in the day, fell by $2.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, to $23.25, its lowest price of the year. Meridian's stock fell $1.50 a share in over-the-counter trading, to $11.75, also its lowest level of the year.

HEADLINE: Bankers, in Washington, Curb the Lavish Parties

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
When Citibank took over Union Station here last year for a party for hundreds of the world's most powerful bankers, it was a circus - literally.
''We hired a small European circus, and there were some acrobats, some jugglers and several other acts, including a guy in a bear outfit,'' said John Maloney, a Citibank spokesman.
But as international bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the theme has been austerity - relatively speaking.
Major commercial banks are in trouble. The economies of several third world nations are nudging closer to collapse and a former World Bank executive created a stir by accusing the agency of waste and inefficiency in Washington Post articles. 
But the hosts and guests assembled this week in Washington appear to understand the public relations risk of extravagant entertaining.
 
Chase Sits It Out
Citibank says it will hold a few dinner parties to coincide with the annual meeting, but nothing like last year's lavish bash. The parent company of the Chase Manhattan Bank, which last week announced layoffs of nearly 5,000 people and a $1 billion charge against earnings, is not sponsoring any major public events.
The entertainment cutbacks may be helping the bankers' images, but it is hurting the limousine companies and catering services, who say that their business is off by as much as half compared with last year. Expensive restaurants like the Jockey Club, once known as Nancy Reagan's favorite Washington bistro, have tables available at short notice.
''It isn't a question of everything stopping,'' said William Brannigan of the World Bank. ''There is still quite an active social schedule. But obviously a lot of the big commercial banks, which were the big entertainers in years past, have either canceled or reduced their entertainment this year.
''It's probably only appropriate. I suppose if I were one of the 5,000 people let go by Chase and then I saw that Chase had thrown a big party, I'd be a little annoyed.''
 
Hotels Are Exception
One major exception to the new relative frugality is that the city's luxury hotels report that they are booked solid through Thursday, the last day of the three-day annual meeting.
''We have nothing available - no rooms, no suites, no broom closets,'' said a front desk receptionist at the Grand Hotel, known to be a favorite of Japanese and German bankers visiting the capital. The Grand's rates start at $200 a night, with two-bedroom suites costing $850.
While the bankers are making an effort to curb their public displays of big spending, they apparently drew the line at doing without the private luxury of a well-appointed hotel room. The catering departments in the hotels report far fewer cocktail receptions and formal dinners, however.
For many of the bankers, the emphasis is on the appearance of austerity in tough times. ''What they want to do is have a lower profile,'' said Keith McKoy, manager of the Washington office of Dav-El Limousine.
 
Limousines Go Begging
Instead of hiring a $50-an-hour stretch limousine, he said, many bankers are instead requesting his chauffeured Lincoln town cars, at $38 an hour. The price difference may not seem huge, but ''they don't want to be perceived as spending a lot of money on perks like limousines,'' he said.
Mr. McKoy did say that one group of clients did not cut back on long limos this year: bankers from the Middle East. Despite the turmoil in the Persian Gulf and the threat of war after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he said, ''my clients from the Middle East are ordering cars and using them as much as last year.''
One of the week's more elaborate receptions was sponsored Monday night by a state-run bank from South Korea, the Korea Development Bank.
As guests entered the mammoth ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel, they were greeted by a reception line of well-dressed Korean bankers who bowed as each guest passed through the ballroom doors and by a 10-foot-high ice sculpture of a pagoda. A placard with the bank's logo was imbedded in the fast-melting ice.
 
Luxury Not Up to Snuff
All manner of alcohol, including fine champagnes, flowed freely for the Koreans' guests. A rainbow of hors d'oeuvres, spread out over several tables, included smoked salmon, freshly shucked oysters, roast beef, vats of steak tartare and a variety of Korean delicacies served by young women dressed in traditional Korean robes. The guests were serenaded with Schubert by a trio brought in from the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.
Yet even this was below the standards of years past, several bankers said, somewhat wistfully.
''It's a very nice little reception, but it's really not the sort of event that we'd been used to,'' said a British banker, holding a glass of champagne and laughing at what he insisted was his ''feigned pomposity.''
''I do remember the days when caviar was de rigueur at banking functions and there would be a dozen parties like this each night and they would be followed by dinners in the most wonderful restaurants,'' he said. He refused to give his name for fear of alienating his Korean clients.
''We certainly live well now,'' said a portly Italian banker who stood nearby, admiring the Korean ice pagoda as he nibbled on fresh shrimp and canapes. ''But I assure you, we lived better before.'' Citicorpd (Citibank)

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 25.99 on Signs of Weak Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks turned around again yesterday and continued to burrow deeper into negative territory as investor sentiment darkened, the price of oil rose another notch and new data showed that the economy was still weakening.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which slid as much as 42 points by noontime, was off 25.99 at the close, to 2,459.65.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said six waves of selling starting within an hour of the opening bell chopped 29 points off the Dow. 
A.T.& T., the nation's most widely held stock and one of the weakest of the blue chips today, dropped 3/8, to 31 1/2, after Joel D. Gross, telecommunications analyst for the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, trimmed his earnings estimates because of the weak economy.
It was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with 7.4 million shares changing hands, and gave further confirmation that investors were abandoning even solid blue chips at the first sign of weakness.
Trading activity on the Big Board fell slightly, to 155.6 million shares, from 155.9 million a day earlier.
In another sign of the daily erosion of stock prices, 1,119 stocks dropped in price and 309 fell to new lows, while only 421 issues advanced in price and only 2 rose to new highs.
While much of Wall Street seemed to feel that a huge pool of capital was waiting to jump into the market, Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman, argued that the cash level was ''not so high.''
One thing that would lift the market quickly, he said, would be a resolution of what he called ''the stalemates.''
''Investors are giving up on the stalemates,'' he said. ''There's a stalemate in the Iraq crisis. There's a stalemate on the budget and there's a stalemate on lower interest rates. The longer the stalemates continue, the more likely the negative effects move deeper into the economy.''
In New York, the price of oil continued to move higher, ending the day at $38.67 a barrel, up $1.14. But in London, some analysts urged clients to get out of oil shares, arguing that even if war broke out, crude prices might not move much higher.
Although several analysts are still bullish on oil, nearly every leading oil stock fell yesterday. Among the Dow stocks, Chevron sank 1 1/8, to 76; Exxon 5/8, to 49 7/8; Texaco 5/8, to 62 5/8, and USX 3/8, to 31 5/8. Among other oil issues, ARCO fell 1 7/8, to 137; Unocal 1 1/8, to 32 1/8, and Pennzoil 2, to 77 5/8.

Commitment by Sumitomo For Denver Airport Project

 BODY:
The City and County of Denver, which are building the first new large airport in the United States in the last 20 years, closed a $319 million commitment from the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company yesterday for a tax-exempt variable rate financing to be used for the airport project.
Sumitomo Trust, one of Japan's premier financial institutions, is providing a letter of credit to support the Denver Airport System subordinate revenue bonds, with the initial issue providing $200 million and a subsequent one providing $100 million. 
The bonds will be issued next Wednesday as commercial-paper-type instruments, with the interest rate fixed for anywhere from overnight to 180 days at various rates. Goldman, Sachs & Company was the lead underwriter and remarketing agency for the transaction.
Goldman, also the lead undrwriter for a $700 million fixed-income issue for the airport's financing earlier this year, said the variable rate issue carried the highest short-term rating of P-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and of A-1+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The long-term debt is rated Aa-2 by Moody's and AA by S.& P. According to some brokers outside the deal, this may be the largest tax-exempt financing to receive a letter of credit from Sumitomo.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
4-Year Treasury Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury held an unexpectedly successful auction of four-year notes yesterday, despite growing concerns about oil-fed inflation, Washington's failure to produce a budget agreement and a Government securities market that was otherwise uncommonly dull with minimal price changes.
Dealers said the market was surprised by the excellent reception given the $8.25 billion of 8.5 percent four-year notes because there was relatively little retail interest on Tuesday when the Treasury auctioned $11.5 billion of 8 1/8 percent two-year notes.
Not only was the ''cover'' unusually high - there were $28.3 billion in bids for the $8.25 billion of four-year notes - but dealers were also surprised by the absence of a ''tail,'' which is the difference between the high and average yields.
 
Highest Since March Sale
The bids produced an average yield of 8.53 percent, compared with 8.50 percent at the last auction of this maturity, on June 27, and was the highest since last March's sale, when the average yield was 8.58 percent. Meanwhile, the yield on the two-year notes fell to 8.14 percent, from the average of 8.18 percent at the Tuesday auction. 
''What the absence of a tail and the high cover tell us is that many small banks and other financial institutions were interested in the four-year notes,'' said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo. ''The large amount of noncompetitive bids, $1.4 billion, also tells us that many individual investors were interested.''
One factor that may have drawn individual investors is that the four-year notes are issued in units of $1,000, compared with $5,000 for the two-year Treasury maturity. Another incentive was that the current average yield on money market funds, where many investors have been placing funds shifted from the stock market, is roughly 7.75 perent.
 
Concern on Funds Rate
Earlier in the session, many market participants were concerned about the persistently high Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans. Despite the Fed's infusion of reserves into the banking system, the funds rate held at 8.25 percent for most of the day before easing to 8 3/16 percent near the close. At 8.25 percent, the funds were 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above the Fed's perceived target level.
Mr. Braverman said the firm funds rate was caused in large part by the reluctance of some large banks to borrow in the commercial paper market or through certificates of deposit. ''It is still far less expensive for banks to tap the funds market than issue commercial paper or C.D.'s,'' he added.
For example, he noted that while the 90-day commercial paper rate for ''top name'' banks ranged between 9.10 and 9.30 percent, many banks were being asked to pay more. Many banks are also paying substantially more on 90-day C.D.'s than the 8.35 percent quoted by dealers.
Meanwhile, many banks are charging Wall Street brokers 9.5 percent for temporary, often overnight, loans.
 
'Window Dressing' Seen
Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank, said some of the upward pressure on the Federal funds rate could be attributed to ''some third-quarter window dressing'' by portfolio managers here and in Japan, where Sept. 30 marks the end of the fiscal half-year. Mr. Chandross also noted that the firm funds rate might also reflect the hesitancy of some smaller banks to lend reserves to the larger banks, which had considerable publicity later about their problems.
But the firm funds rate had little impact on the discount rates of Treasury bills until late in the day, when demand swelled. As a result, the discount rate on 90-day bills fell 6 basis points, to 7.31 percent; six-month bills lost 6 basis points, at 7.35 percent, and one-year bills declined 3 basis points, to 7.30 percent.
The closely watched Treasury long notes, the 8.75 percent issue due in August 2000, were offered late in the session at 98 18/32, up 2/32 on the day, while the yield held at 8.97 percent. The 10-year notes are increasingly being used as a comparison with the longest maturities of Japanese and West German Government securities because of the rising global demand for capital.
 
Japanese Yield Increases
The yield on the 10-year Japanese long bonds rose to 8.72 percent, from 8.68 percent the day before and 8.60 percent at the end of last week. The yield on the 10-year West German long bonds held steady at 9.11 percent, but it was still above the 9.03 percent of last Friday.
As for the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, they were offered late in the day at 96 6/32, up by 1/32, while the yield held at 9.12 percent.
Following are the details of the Treasury's auction of four-year notes:

Gold Prices Rise on Rumors Of Fighting in Middle East

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices overcame early choppy trading yesterday and settled higher amid unconfirmed rumors of fighting in the Middle East and worries that an already sluggish economy is giving way to inflation.
Gold settled $4.20 to $5.80 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in September at $406.60 an ounce. The December contract jumped as much as $10.80 before settling lower. 
Demand for gold was prompted by an uncomfirmed rumor around midday that an Iraqi jet had been shot down in the Persian Gulf. Higher crude oil prices and investor worries of inflation also helped the market along, analysts said.
 
Higher Gold Price Expected
''With oil prices approaching $40 and inflation, that changes the picture for gold,'' said Peter Cardillo, director of commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York. ''It puts gold at a higher level. We may see it trading at $435 to $440 in the coming days.''
On the New York Mercantile exchange, crude oil settled 3 cents lower to $1.14 higher, with November at $38.67 a barrel.
Analysts said platinum and silver extended losses from Tuesday on signs of weakening economic activity in the United States and a further decline in the Tokyo stock market.
Platinum futures settled $4.10 to $3.80 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with October at $448 an ounce.
Silver fell 4.2 to 3.6 cents on the Commodity Exchange, with September at $4.798 an ounce.
 
Effect on Farm Commodities
Agricultural commodities were also affected by the Middle East rumors. On the Chicago Board of Trade wheat rose, corn settled mixed and soybeans were lower.
Choppy trading throughout the day reflected a growing nervousness that the Middle East crisis could not be solved diplomatically, said John Frazier, director of the agricultural division for Gerald Inc.
Rumors that the Government might be interested in offering subsidized flour to the Soviet Union also contributed to wheat's gain.
Corn was mixed after large purchases of futures contracts by a big grain dealer prompted speculation of impending export sales of corn, Mr. Frazier said.
Soybeans extended Tuesday's losses as traders expected a bumper harvest and waited for the release of the Agriculture Department's quarterly grain stocks report after today's trading closes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed After a Lackluster Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday against major currencies in thin and choppy trading.
Japanese and American banks refrained from heavy trading in the foreign exchange markets. Dealers said the institutional investors were catching up on paperwork because the first half of Japan's fiscal year as well as the calendar-year third quarter both end on Sunday. 
''It was a rather lackluster day in terms of liquidity,'' said Scott Horwitz, a trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
The dollar closed in New York near its lowest levels of the session against the German mark, at 1.5660, down from 1.5735 late Tuesday. Renewed speculation about a possible interest rate rise in Germany after the two Germanys unite on Oct. 3 lifted the mark.
High oil prices continued to weigh down the Japanese yen. Worries about how Japan's oil-dependent economy will cope caused a big selloff on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday and eroded confidence in the yen.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose, closing at 137.40 yen, up from 136.70 yen on Tuesday. Later, in London, it fell to 137.20 yen. The dollar traded at 136.855 yen late in New York, higher than late Tuesday's 136.70 yen.
Fresh news confirming the sluggishness of the United States economy, including durable goods, personal income and consumer spending data, was virtually ignored.
European currency dealers, meanwhile, said the dollar gained there on news that the United Nations Security Council had adopted a resolution to tighten its economic embargo against Iraq by halting air traffic into that country.
The dollar is usually seen as a haven in times of international tension.
The British pound fell to $1.8635 in London, from $1.8765 there late Tuesday. A pound fetched $1.8718 late in New York, compared with $1.8785 late Tuesday.
Against the German mark, the dollar was up late in the day in Europe, to 1.5715 marks, from 1.5630 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Sorry, I'm No Crime Fighter

BYLINE: By Janusz Glowacki; Janusz Glowacki is a playwright.

 BODY:
A day after Mayor Dinkins revealed his strategy to fight crime in New York with the ''city's greatest resource -our pride and collective will'' - I was stopped by a neighbor on my Lower East Side street.
This elderly lady grabbed my hand and, following the Mayor's appeal, demanded that I dismantle the iron window gates behind which my family and I had been hiding, and that I join a neighborhood block patrol.
With an insincere smile, I started to make excuses: I wear glasses, I never scored high in knife fights, I have a deadline for my play. The old lady looked at me scornfully and warned me that if anything should happen to her or to anyone on our block, the responsibility would be mine. 
Though brief, this encounter moved me, for it brought forth a flood of memories from my youth. Growing up in Poland, I was made to feel responsible, along with my fellow citizens, for the inefficiencies of our Communist Government. I was told that the shortage of food was caused by the voracious appetite of the Polish people, and that the lack of housing was the result of the Polish tendency to procreate.
Indeed, from time to time the Government introduced special strategies to solve economic problems. For example, surgeons were forced to help farmers with the harvest, and farmers were sent to hospitals to assist in the emergency room. Later, on TV, they would embrace and thank each other, and point out that socialism will prevail. However, unofficially, the farmers whispered that it often took a week to repair the damage caused by the surgeons during a single day. The surgeons whispered back that they needed much more time to make up for well-meaning farmers. The point of view of the sick was never released.
When Mayor Dinkins began his term by reducing the police force, I was a bit surprised, but not overly concerned. On my street, I am considered the lucky one. I've had two encounters with muggers. Once I managed to escape. The second time, though, I was caught and robbed. I sustained only a few bruises, which evoked the envy of all my neighbors.
When Mayor Dinkins recently called upon the ''good people'' of New York to take to the streets and wage war against crime, I was a bit more surprised. So far the police had appealed to New Yorkers not to do the job of the police, as often such attempts had tragic endings. The enthusiasm of good people, I suspect, is rarely efficient when confronted with guns and skillful criminals.
I would like to point out, for example, that President Bush didn't ask the Saudis to arm themselves with baseball bats and walkie-talkies and stand on their border. The President applied a more traditional strategy: he mobilized the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Marines. I'm ashamed to admit that this kind of solution appeals to me more.
Perhaps I am allergic to the strategies forced upon good people by authority. These strategies never worked in Poland. But perhaps I am wrong, and pessimistic, and the good people in New York are better than the good people in Poland, and New York will prevail.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Pledges a Vigorous Response If Iraq Attacks Israel, Officials Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
United States officials have told Israel and its supporters in recent days that any Iraqi attack on Israel would set off a vigorous American response.
Administration officials have avoided stating categorically that if Israel were attacked, the United States would be prepared to commit American forces to Israel's defense, but Israeli officials said today that they had been left with this impression.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, on Wednesday that the Bush Administration ''remains committed to Israel's security and you can count on that fact'' if Israel is attacked by Iraq, an Administration official said.
The American assurances, which came in a wide-ranging discussion about Israel's security requirements, followed a threat on Sunday by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to strike Saudi Arabia and Israel if the United Nations boycott ''strangled'' the Iraqi people.
But Israeli officials said that even though they appreciated the American assurances, they were concerned that, at a time of sharply increased threats to Israel, the Administration had yet to produce any new economic or military aid. 
Mr. Baker did not go into any detail about how the Administration would respond to an Iraqi attack, and Mr. Levy did not seek such details, Israeli and American officials said.
The United States and Israel do not have a mutual defense treaty, but successive American administrations have made a general commitment to maintain Israel's security and qualitative military edge over the Arabs. This is apparently the first time, however, that the United States has indicated that it might take direct military action in Israel's behalf.
One reason the United States has avoided commiting itself militarily in Israel's behalf was concern that this would compel the Soviet Union to enter the fray on the side of Israel's Arab enemies, provoking a global war. But in the current crisis, the Soviet Union has joined in condemning Iraq, and has warned Iraq that it runs the risk of being attacked if it does not pull out of Kuwait.
Speaking of Israel, an Administration official said, ''They have some legitimate concerns and we want to address them.''
The reason that President Bush has not publicly made this general assurance to Israel, officials explained, is that Washington does not want to ''give Saddam an Israel issue'' to rally Arab support. At the same time, though, the Administration does not want the Iraqi leader to believe there is any ambivalence in its commitment to Israel.
 
Fighters in the Skies
For this reason, American officials were also reluctant to discuss the substance of the American assurances.
One reason they want to put Israelis at ease is that they would prefer that Israel not become involved alone in a conflict with Iraq. President Hussein could exploit such a situation, turning the gulf crisis into a case of Iraq against Israel instead of Iraq against the world.
American officials said that Israel took the threat from President Hussein seriously enough to maintain a group of fighter aircraft in the skies over Israel 24 hours a day to defend against any Iraqi missile that might be launched.
It is not immediately clear how the United States would respond to an Iraqi attack on Israel. It would be unrealistic to expect that Saudi Arabia would allow American fighter jets and troops based in Saudi Arabia to come to the defense of Israel. But the United States has an aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean, several squadrons of advanced fighter jets in Turkey and B-52 bombers based in Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean. American officials declined to speculate on how they might respond.
Officials said that in his 90-minute meeting with Mr. Baker, Mr. Levy explained that before last Sunday, President Hussein was talking about ''retaliating'' against Israel with chemical weapons for any Israeli attack on Iraq. But Sunday, he changed his threat and began talking about an Iraqi first strike against on Israel.
 
Low Profile Is Called Hard
Mr. Levy said that given the new threat, the Israeli leadership could not be expected to sit idly and maintain the low profile Washington prefers at this time.
He said that when all of Israel's neighbors were either getting American, Japanese or European funds or new American weapons to bolster their ability to resist Iraq, Israel was getting nothing from anyone. The Israeli official also asserted that Israel was the most likely primary target for Baghdad.
Mr. Baker responded, according to officials, that Washington appreciated Israel's low profile, which was making it easier for the United States to assemble an Arab coalition against Iraq. But he said that Israel should keep in mind that the United States has 200,000 troops stationed in the region and that these constituted a deterrent to any Iraqi attack on Israel.
''Levy indicated that there was some urgency to our needs,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''Our impression is that there is no urgency on the Administration's part. We get a lot of nice messages about what good boys we are for keeping a low profile, but no money yet and no arms. Everyone is being looked after but us.''
As far as Israel's aid requests, Mr. Baker said that the Administration was prepared to deal with them sympathetically, but in a ''phased manner.'' That is, he explained, given budgetary constraints in Washington, the United States was not in a position to suddenly produce a multibillion dollar arms and economic aid package for Israel. Unlike the Saudis, who purchase their arms in cash, the Israelis are dependent on American grants and easy credits.
 
Surprise from Arens
Two weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, when the United States was asking Israel to stay as much out of sight as possible and not send any ministers to Washington, David Ivri, the director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry, met in Washington with Reginald Bartholomew, Undersecretary of State for Security Assistance, and Henry S. Rowen, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. He asked that Israel be given two batteries of Patriot anti-missile missiles and 15 F-15A fighter planes, which the United States is retiring from its stocks in Europe. Mr. Ivri was told that both requests would be met, Israeli officials said.
A month later, on Sept. 17, Israel's Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, asked to see Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at the Pentagon. Mr. Arens surprised American officials by saying that in addition to the F-15A's and the Patriots, Israel needed an emergency infusion of $1 billion in aid to buy advanced American fighter planes, as well as an increase in its annual military assistance grant from $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion.
Mr. Arens argued that Israel's oil import costs had increased by $500 million a year as a result of the gulf crisis, that its need to keep more aircraft in the air had sent its military budget out of kilter and that, in light of the new weapons being acquired by its Arab neighbors, the only way Israel could maintain any kind of qualitative edge would be through purchases of the most advanced fighter jets, not F-15A's that were produced in 1976.
 
Some Private Complaints
Mr. Cheney told Mr. Arens that the Israeli request would be ''considered,'' but made no promises. Israeli officials said they came away from the Cheney meeting with the impression that their requests would be treated more sympathetically if they did not complain publicly about the proposed $21 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which has now gone ahead in two packages. American officials said that an earlier article in The New York Times saying that the United States was preparing to transfer $1 billion in military equipment to the Israelis was inaccurate.
Meanwhile, Israeli officials have begun to complain privately that even the promised Patriot missiles and F-15A's don't seem to be forthcoming.
Pentagon officials say they are not dragging their feet. There is a great deal of competition for the surplus of F-15A's between Turkey, the Philippines and the American Air National Guard, and that trying to satisfy everyone's requests takes time to coordinate. Approval for the Patriots, which would be given to Israel, is working its way through the bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
KUWAITI EMIR ASKS U.N. TO STAND FIRM

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The Emir of Kuwait came before the United Nations General Assembly today to plead for his country's liberation from Iraq, urging the organization to stand by the sanctions it has imposed on Iraq as he offered poor third-world countries relief on debts to Kuwait.
Dressed in traditional Arab robes, the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, received an ovation as he arrived in the packed Assembly hall just in time to see the Iraqi delegation ostentatiously stalking out. He was also applauded loudly at the end of his speech, spoken in Arabic and lasting barely 10 minutes.
Speaking softly and rapidly, as is his fashion, the Emir said that ''the multitude of resolutions'' the United Nations Security Council had passed condeming and punishing Iraq showed ''the rock-solid international rejection of the assassination of the norms of international law, rules of good-neighborly relations and established customs and practices at the hands of armed military invaders whose tanks rolled over and crushed these concepts.'' [Excerpts from speech, page A7.] The Emir of Kuwait, who is not often seen in public and rarely travels outside the Middle East, came to the United Nations with several other members of his government in exile, Arab diplomats said, to dramatize his country's plight, lobby for support and establish his position as head of his country's legitimate Government. 
Iraq, which occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2, has annexed it, but that action has met with worldwide condemnation, and other countries continue to recognize the Emir's Government as the legitimate one.
He is scheduled to travel to Washington on Friday to meet President Bush and return to New York on the weekend to attend the World Summit for Children organized by the United Nations Children's Fund.
 
International Tragedy
His General Assembly address today, though short and low-key, was strenuously endorsed by Arabs who oppose Iraq. Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, said afterward that the Emir's address ''reflects the agony that the Kuwaitis are feeling about the Iraqi invasion.''
Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, said the Emir had ''stressed not only the tragedy to the country of Kuwait but the tragedy to the whole international community from this crisis.''
Saudi Arabia's Ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, said the Emir had ''spoken to the conscience of the world.'' The address showed ''Kuwait's generosity in talking about haves and have-nots and debt forgiveness,'' Prince Bandar said.
Urging the General Assembly and the Security Council to stand fast and maintain pressure on Iraq to withdraw, the Emir said, ''We trust that you will not waver in deciding on the measures needed to compel the invading aggressors to restore the legitimate authority and put an end to their barbaric acts and deviations.''
On a day when representatives of several of the world's poorest nations, including Bangladesh, also addressed the General Assembly, Sheik Jaber sought to counter Iraq's attempts to portray Kuwait as a rich and selfish princedom and the invasion as a blow struck on behalf of millions of poor Arabs from lands without oil.
He said Kuwait had always been generous with its assistance to poorer countries, adding that the nation had the highest ratio of aid to gross national product of any donor nation in the world.
''From the earliest years of independence, my country has been privileged to be in the forefront of states that gave development aid to other countries,'' he said.
Recalling a plea for more debt relief for poorer nations he made to the General Assembly two years ago, Sheik Jaber said the Kuwaiti government in exile, which he heads, would forgive the world's poorest countries interest payments on loans it had made them.
 
'Terror and Torture' the Rule
He also hinted that Kuwait might be willing to write off some of those debts completely, saying, ''Kuwait will consider with the poorest nations arrangements regarding the principal of its loans with a view to easing the burden of their debt.''
Sheik Jaber presented Kuwait as a small, peace-loving country that had been suddenly and brutally attacked as it was trying to negotiate a solution to Iraq's complaints against it.
Iraq, he said, was ''bent on sweeping through the entire territory of Kuwait, violating its sovereignty and violating the sanctity of Kuwaiti citizens' lives and property.''
''Rape, destruction, terror and torture are now the rule of the day in the once peaceful and tranquil land of Kuwait,'' he said. ''Hundreds of thousands of Kuwaiti citizens, along with nationals of various other countries who were our guests, have been homeless, and many of them have had their life savings robbed. Hundreds have lost their lives. Others have been made hostage.''
 
Changes in Nicaragua
In her address to the General Assembly, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua said her country had experienced ''a new taste for liberty and respect for human rights'' since she defeated the Sandinistas in United Nations-supervised elections seven months ago.
During that time, she said, the Nicaraguan Army has been reduced from 96,000 to 34,000, compulsory military service abolished and 18,000 rifles belonging to various political parties ''buried in concrete.''
Bangladesh's President, Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who has sent armed forces to Saudi Arabia, emphasized the economic hardship that the gulf crisis was causing for his country and many other of the world's poorest nations.
He mentioned the cost of repatriating and housing thousands of workers fleeing from the gulf, the loss of their remittances, reduced exports and higher oil bills.

HEADLINE: WITH ACCORD NEAR, BUDGET TALK FOCUS IS SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept 27

 BODY:
White House and Congressional budget negotiatiors, in substantial agreement on most elements of a budget deal, today returned to the politically explosive subject of cuts in Social Security benefits in a search for the final savings needed to meet their deficit reduction goals.
Both sides have agreed that savings in Social Security are needed, but differences remain on how to apportion the burden. The decision to even look for savings in the Social Security program is so perilous for both parties, particularly in an election year, that it could risk the collapse of any chance for compromise.
 
Differences Are Narrowed
The negotiators, who planned to meet late into the night, have narrowed their differences to two basic issues: the Social Security savings and a way to pay for an Administration proposal that would exclude the portion of the profit on capital gains attributable to inflation.
White House negotiators formally advanced the proposal, known as indexing, today as an alternative to the outright cut in the capital gains tax rate that President Bush has sought. The emergence of the indexing proposal Wednesday injected new optimism into negotiations that had virtually deadlocked on the tax issue. 
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said he hoped a deal on the budget package was imminent. He said that the negotiators have ''tentatively agreed'' to much of the budget package. Democratic leaders have scheduled a rare Sunday session of Congress to vote on a stop-gap spending bill needed to keep the Government running after Sunday, the end of the fiscal year, with or without a budget agreement.
 
Great Pressure on Democrats
However, Social Security cuts were so unpopular with older voters in the 1982 and 1986 Congressional elections that no one on Capitol Hill was flatly predicting that a deal would take place or that Social Security would be in the final package.
But the Democrats, who have held themselves up as champions of Social Security, are under great pressure. Officials involved in their deliberations said the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, told his House counterparts today that he was not certain that he could deliver enough votes from Democratic senators to assure passage of an alternative Democratic budget. Democrats had hoped that if negotiations with the White House failed, they could get a plan of their own through Congress.
The Republicans' Social Security proposal is a one-time delay of two months in the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. But Democrats argue that such a delay is unfair because it would amount to lower benefits for even the poorest retirees.
 
Democrats Would Raise Tax
The Democrats have proposed an increase in the tax that Social Security recipients now pay on a portion of their benefits, arguing that this would require wealthier retirees to bear a bigger share of the burden. Under current law, Social Security beneficiaries who are single and have incomes above $25,000 a year are taxed on 50 percent of their benefits, while married recipients with incomes of more than $32,000 are taxed on 50 percent of their benefits. Democrats are discussing raising that level to 85 percent.
''Increasing the tax is one giant step towards making Social Security a means tested program,'' said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. Such a tax increase may prove nearly as unpoular with rank-and-file Democrats, which is one of the reasons the Democratic leaders spent much of today huddled in meetings trying to decide if they were prepared to even contemplate it.
The discussion of increasing taxes on Social Security benefits represents a sharp turnaround from discussions only a few months ago about cuts in Social Security taxes. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, caused a political firestorm in earlier this year with a proposal to reduce the payroll taxes that finance the Social Security system.
Mr. Moynihan has long complained that surpluses in the Social Security trust fund that were intended to pay benefits to the generation of babies born after World War II after they retire in the early part of the 21st century were being improprerly used to mask the size of the Federal deficit. He has argued that unless the Government removes the Social Security trust fund from its deficit calculations, the surplus should be returned to workers in the form of a cut in the Social Security payroll taxes.
 
Looking for $50 Million Cut
Officials close to the deliberations said Democrats could not meet the budget neogtiators' goal of reducing domestic spending by $120 billion over five years unless they found savings in the Social Security program. Over all, the negotiators are seeking to cut the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year 1991 and $500 billion over five years.
Democrats must also decide whether a stop-gap spending bill would also include a delay in huge automatic spending cuts that take effect on Monday under provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. President Bush has said that in the absence of a budget accord, he will veto a bill that calls for such a delay.
Negotiators spent part of the day wrestling with the Administration's latest proposal, the indexing of capital gains for inflation. Officials close to the the deliberations said the indexing plan would cost the Treasury about $4.5 billion in lost revenue over five years, considerably less than the $21 billion revenue loss for the actual cut in the capital gains tax rate that Mr. Bush had sought.
The officals said that as currently structured, the proposal would begin the indexing arrangement on Jan. 1, 1991. That means that while it would apply to both current and newly acquired assets, investors would not realize any tax break on their asset sales until they file their returns in 1992. Capitial gains, the profits on the sale of real estate, stock, timber and other assets, are now taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, or 28 percent for most taxpayers.
While Democrats continue to insist that the indexing must be offset by some tax increase for the wealthier Americans, who would benefit most from it, they note that Republicans may have an easier time finding such an offset under indexing because the amount of revenue involved would be so much smaller.
 
Floor on Deductions Proposed
Democrats have suggested an offsetting tax increase that would place a floor on deductions for wealthier taxpayers, a proposal so far rejected by Republicans, who say it amounts to a tax rate increase. Conceptually, the proposal accomplishes the same thing as a ceiling on itemized deductions, essentially reducing the amount of deductions to which wealthier taxpayers would otherwise be entitled.
The Democratic proposal is based on a suggestion by Representative Don Pease, a liberal Democrat from Ohio and a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
A deduction ceiling was, in fact, suggested at one point in the negotiations by the White House Budget Director, Richard G. Darman. But Mr. Pease and other Democrats see the notion of a floor on deductions as more politically palatable for both parties than a ceiling because it would not discourage contributions to charities or raise the anger of the housing industry.
Assuming the proposal applied to married taxpayers with taxable income of more than $100,000, or $50,000 for single taxpayers, it would work like this: A married couple with taxable income of say $200,000 would subtract $100,000 from that amount. They would then take 5 percent of the remaining $100,000, or $5,000, which would become their deduction floor.

HEADLINE: Anticipation, Not Actuality, Holds Sway Over Oil Prices

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Brushing aside President Bush's decision on Wednesday to tap the Stategic Petroleum Reserve as a test, traders pushed oil prices up to near $40 a barrel yesterday as worries about the conflict in the Middle East continued to dominate the markets. But so far, the run-up, which has more than doubled oil prices since the beginning of summer, reflects expectations, not reality.
''We're not one barrel short yet on a global basis,'' said Anthony E. Reinsch, vice president of the Canadian Energy Research Institute in Calgary, Alberta. ''The price appears to reflect the anticipated impact of a global shortage.''
Moreover, the anticipation could be worse than the outcome. No one knows just what a war would bring, of course, or what the effect would be on oil supplies. Some analysts, looking at the bidding in the oil markets so far, say the price could reach $65 a barrel, maybe more. The former Saudi oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said yesterday that it could reach $100 if his country's fields were damaged. 
Oil prices in New York trading rose 87 cents yesterday, to $39.54, the highest since 1980. Traders took little notice of the decision to test a release from the strategic reserve, a stockpile that could contribute up to 3.5 million barrels a day for months. [Page D1.] One school of experts finds the oil market's anxieties about the Middle East conflict greatly exaggerated. Indeed, they note that depending on the nature of the military action, the price could come down quickly in the event of fighting between the United States and Iraq, largely because nearly half of the current price reflects not actual scarcity but anticipation of war.
Thus the world is already absorbing much of any wartime price increase, without the war. If and when action on the battlefield makes a war effect clearer, the price could plummet, especially if the Iraqis fail to dislodge the 150,000 American troops that stand between them and the Saudi oilfields. One lesson of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, experts say, is that without control on the ground, it is hard to disrupt oilfields and oil terminals more than briefly.
The initial market reaction to a war might approach panic, however. Thomas R. McHale, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, said that at first ''psychologically, people are going to worry about having inventory; they'll pay anything for it.'' But, he added, ''then it will sink in, the fact that there is sufficient physical oil.''
The popular image of oil in a war zone is from the movies, the submarine skipper sighting the ''nice fat tanker'' in the periscope crosshairs. But in real life, oil targets have proved hard to knock out for any extended period. Colombian guerrillas, for example, have repeatedly bombed oil pipelines in that country but their most recent attacks have shut the lines for only a few days at a time.
Oil tankers, as the Iranians and Iraqis learned in their war, are much harder to set afire than most people had imagined.
In eight years of desperate effort, experts point out, Iraq could not stop Iran's exports, and Iran did not have the help of protection from the United States military as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf exporters do.
The war and the revolution did hurt Iran's production, which now runs at about three million barrels a day, half what the Shah's regime managed. But most of the Iranian shortfall is a result of lack of capital and personnel, a problem that presumably would not afflict Saudi Arabia or Kuwait.
 
Terminals Prove Tough
Export terminals may be hard to disrupt for long periods, too; the Iraqis tried hard but never knocked out Iran's Kharg Island for more than a few days at a time. And Saudi Arabia, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly noted recently, could export 7.5 million barrels a day, or very nearly as much as it could produce, from any two of its three largest terminals. One of those three is Yanbu, on the Red Sea, far out of reach of direct Iraqi attack.
Oil refineries are a more vulnerable target; in fact, they have a tendency to explode in times of peace. But some military analysts say that they, too, would be hard to disable for long periods.
And all this equipment is ancillary to the main asset of the Persian Gulf, oil in the ground.
''You cannot destory oilfields,'' said Charles T. Maxwell, the senior energy strategist at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan, Grenfell. ''You can blow up pieces of equipment on the surface, measuring devices, valves and so on, but those can be flown over from Houston the next day. There's lots of that around.'' He predicted that half of Kuwaiti production could be restored in 30 days, and the rest in three months.
Others see different problems in Kuwait, saying the threat to its wells is not from aircraft above, but from demolition experts on the ground. James R. Schlesinger, who has served as Energy Secretary and Defense Secretary, said, ''If we do come to war, the Kuwaiti oilfields will likely be destroyed for a year or a year and a half.
''Right now, there are explosives on Christmas trees,'' Mr. Schlesinger said, referring to the tree-like array of valves on top of each well. ''And they can put explosives down in the bore hole.'' After that sort of destruction, a well would probably have to be redrilled, he said.
Other experts said that most of the Kuwaiti wells flow by natural pressure, so getting explosives into them would be a technical problem, requiring pumping the oil back down first.
Still, the markets are clearly nervous about damage. ''All you would need is a few headlines saying Iraqi troops are advancing on Saudi oilfields, or a few missiles,'' said George F. Friesen of the Deutsche Bank Group. ''Even if they didn't hit the oil installations, that would build up anticipation.''
 
Some Price Predictions
Mr. Friesen was reluctant to offer numbers. Last week, the World Bank said, however, that if a war did long-term damage to the Iraqi and Kuwaiti fields, oil prices would rise to $65 a barrel, dropping to $45 in 1992 and $20 by 2000. In contrast, the price was less than $20 a barrel before tensions between Iraq and Kuwait began to build in July.
But another school of thought holds that if a war broke out, oil prices would fall quickly and sharply.
''It should shoot up by about $20 on the day of the war,'' Mr. Maxwell said, ''and $5 on the next day. On the day after, when it becomes clear that the American forces are winning and the Iraqi forces are not able to wreak damage on the Saudi refineries with their missiles, it will fall $5, and the next day, fall $15. Within two months of the start of the war, the price of oil will cross back over the $22 line.''
 
Hitting the Water Supply
Mr. Maxwell added that it would not be difficult for American forces to cripple the Iraqi army, by destroying the desalinization plant that supplies 80 percent of Kuwait's water and hitting other vulnerable points, forcing Saddam Hussein to withdraw.
A short war won by those allied against Iraq would remove the threat to Saudi exports, analysts point out, and even if one result of the destruction would be no Kuwaiti or Iraqi oil for years to come, production from other sources is probably now roughly equal to world consumption. Thus, prices would fall. Others are not so optimistic. Mr. Schlesinger contends that at a time of uncertainty, comparing global need with global supply is inappropriate; more relevant, he says, is the reaction of oil companies or even individual homeowners, who will cling to their inventories and seek more.
Mehdi Varzi, an oil expert at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London and a former Iranian diplomat, said that the price is now at $40 a barrel and not higher because the market is expecting ''a clean victory; it may be slightly bloody, but it's quick and there's no disruption of Persian Gulf exports.''
''Given the history of Middle East wars, when there is decisive technical superiority on one side, it tends to be over pretty quickly,'' he said.
In the longer term, prices would tend to fall because people will use less, but no one is sure how much less.

HEADLINE: Quebec Mohawks' Standoff With Soldiers Ends in Melee

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
After 11 weeks of armed confrontation near the resort town of Oka, Quebec, the standoff between Government soldiers and a group of Mohawk Indians ended in a melee on Wednesday night.
The Mohawk warriors and about 22 women and children laid down their arms and left the Kanesatake drug and alcohol treatment center, where they had held out against Canadian soldiers who had surrounded them.
But as the Indians tried to walk toward the town of Oka, scuffling broke out, and the soldiers tried to herd them into military tents and buses that were waiting nearby. It appeared that in a last act of defiance, the Mohawks left the center and veered off toward the town rather than in the direction they had agreed to earlier in the day, according to a military spokesman. 
After several minutes of scuffling, the army succeeded in forcing the Indians onto school buses that took them to a military base for questioning. A military spokesman said they would be brought before a Quebec judge who would determine whether charges would be lodged against any of them.
 
Mulroney's Popularity Falls
In Ottawa, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney praised the armed forces for helping to bring about the settlement and added that the Government had made no concessions.
The messy end to the long standoff comes at a troubled time for Mr. Mulroney and his Progressive Conservative Party. According to the latest Gallup Poll, his approval rating among Canadian voters has fallen to 15 percent, the lowest of any Western leader. The country is on the brink of a recession, and the Prime Minister is in a bitter legislative battle over an unpopular value added tax that he is determined to push through Parliament.
Alongside these other more immediate problems, the issue of how Canada will satisfy the demands of its native peoples is growing pricklier for the Government, and some of his opponents say Mr. Mulroney has not even begun to address these demands.
''The Mulroney Government believed it was impossible to negotiate with the people who were behind the lines,'' said Robert Rae, the Premier-elect of Ontario, whose New Democratic Party won an upset victory in parliamentary elections on Sept. 6.
''They decided to tough it out,'' he said of Mr. Mulroney's representatives. ''And that approach has left us with a legacy of bitterness.''
The Oka crisis began in the spring as a municipal disagreement over the town's plan to expand a golf course onto land that the Mohawks claimed as their own. It quickly grew into armed violent confrontation with the Quebec provincial police, and eventually the military was called in. don't cut last graf.

HEADLINE: De Klerk's Trip Lifts His People's Hopes

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 27

 BODY:
President F. W. de Klerk's trip to the United States this week has encouraged South African whites to believe that his policies may be breaking their country out of the international isolation that came about as a result of apartheid.
Even though economic sanctions have not fallen away, the visit, in which President de Klerk was out of the country for only four days, showed whites that his policies of change are being taken seriously in the United States.
Mr. de Klerk flew home on Wednesday night and was greeted at the airport by several hundred supporters, a somewhat smaller crowd than had turned out for Nelson Mandela when he came back from his lengthy foreign tour in July.
''We will soon be accepted back in the international community,'' Mr. de Klerk told the small but enthusiastic crowd. ''There is understanding for what we are doing.'' 
''We will do a thing which will echo through the centuries,'' Mr. de Klerk said, referring to his promise to dismantle apartheid and extend political rights to the black majority. ''We will build a new South Africa.''
 
Another Meeting Sought
Today, the African National Congress asked Mr. de Klerk to arrange another meeting between his Government and the congress leadership to get their negotiating process back on track after the violence that has racked black townships around Johannesburg. Gill Marcus, speaking for the A.N.C., said a third ''summit'' meeting had been requested for next week, before Mr. Mandela leaves on another foreign trip on Oct. 7. The first two meetings took place in Cape Town in May and in Pretoria last month.
Even before his South African Airways jetliner touched down here, Mr. de Klerk was drawing criticism from both political flanks - the congress, which contends he is not moving fast enough, and the Conservative Party, which accuses him of overreaching the mandate given him by white voters last September.
Thabo Mbeki, the congress's secretary for international affairs, said in a speech at the University of Pretoria on Wednesday that the change set in motion was not yet irreversible and that sanctions should not be discarded.
And Andries Treurnicht, the leader of the right-wing Conservative Party, which forms the official opposition in Parliament, issued a statement saying, ''As a white South African, I feel humiliated by both President de Klerk and President Bush.''
 
Gratification over U.S. Trip
Mr. Treurnicht said Mr. de Klerk appeared to be reneging on his promise to submit a negotiated new constitution to white voters in an election or referendum, because Mr. de Klerk said in Washington that the last white election had already been held.
But other white South Africans seemed gratified today that there was some appreciation in the United States for what President de Klerk was trying to do. Though he received a warm welcome in nine Western European nations in May, a trip to the United States was considered essential for setting a climate for South Africa's new acceptance, in part because the most stringent sanctions were set by Congress in 1986.
''The visit was far more successful than what anyone here had hoped,'' said Carl A. Noffke, director of the Institute of American Studies at Rand Afrikaans University.
The Star of Johannesburg, in an editorial Wednesday, said President Bush's acknowledgment that the process of reform was ''irreversible'' would have important consequences for South Africa.
''Irreversible is a code word which could begin to dismantle the machinery of sanctions in America and Europe,'' the newspaper said.
And The Citizen, a pro-Government tabloid, today hailed Mr. de Klerk's visit to Washington. In its editorial today, The Citizen said that ''our re-entry into the community of nations is assured.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Kaifu Outlines His Proposal For Unarmed Japanese in Gulf

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu unveiled a long-awaited proposal today to send unarmed military personnel to the Persian Gulf in a noncombat role.
It would be the first time since World War II that Japanese military forces would be given a mission overseas. The measure, presented on the eve of Mr. Kaifu's departure for the United States, is designed to counter accusations that despite its $4 billion package of financial aid, Japan is not doing enough in the Middle East.
But it was far from clear whether Mr. Kaifu's proposal could be approved by the Japanese Parliament in the coming months. 
Criticism of the legislation has already begun in the upper house, which is controlled by a coalition of opposition parties led by the Socialists. China and other Asian countries that were the victims of Japanese aggression in World War II are also opposing the plan.
Moving to resolve an unusually bitter debate within his own Government, Mr. Kaifu told a news conference this evening that unarmed defense agency personnel could go abroad to provide transportation, equipment maintenance, communication facilities and medical care.
 
Size Unspecified
''The gulf crisis showed us that Japan has no system whereby it could cooperate with the United Nations to contribute to peace,'' the Prime Minister said, adding that a ''peace cooperation'' team of military people, civilian officials and private volunteers would be based in his own office.
Mr. Kaifu did not specify the size of the force, but other officials have said it would number in the thousands. He said that because the new contingent would neither use nor threaten force, it would not violate the ban on the use of force in the Japanese Constitution.
Mr. Kaifu is to leave on Friday for the United States after an extraordinary period in which he has been troubled by party infighting and a series of blows to his political prestige.
He plans to confer with President Bush and to make several public appearances, including television interviews and a news conference, to counter what Japanese officials fear is a tide of resentment over Japan's role in the Persian Gulf.
''Before this latest crisis, we used to think that the Japan-U.S. relationship had bottomed out,'' a Japanese official said this week, referring to tensions earlier this year over trade and economic issues.
 
A Vigorous Debate
Politicians say Mr. Kaifu will also be trying to repair his own reputation at home, which has been battered by Japan's indecision over the gulf and other embarrassments, including a racist comment by a Cabinet member.
Next week, the Prime Minister will travel to Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman to provide details of its $2 billion emergency package of economic aid to help the countries hardest hit after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Another $2 billion has been proposed to assist the multinational military effort by supplying housing, medical equipment and vehicles and by paying for the shipment of military supplies other than arms and ammunition.
A vigorous debate has opened in Japan over the wisdom of increasing Japan's role in the Middle East. Some Japanese fear that Tokyo might be drawn into internecine Arab warfare, while others accuse the nation of inaction in the face of a threat to its dependence on foreign oil.
There has also been disarray in Mr. Kaifu's cabinet. Defense agency officials wanted to send personnel to the gulf, but the move was opposed by others. The Foreign Ministry has sought more economic aid, but Finance Ministry officials replied that there was no money.
Mr. Kaifu has been accused of paying too much and too little attention to President Bush's demands. There are jokes about the Prime Minister's ''Bush-phone,'' a play of words referring to the Japanese term ''push-phone'' for a push-button telephone.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
House Panel Backs Bush on Gulf Crisis, but Avoids Endorsing War

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a resolution today that endorsed President Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf crisis but carefully avoided giving him open-ended support for military action against Iraq.
Mr. Bush has not asked Congress to approve military action, nor would he necessarily do so before sending American forces into combat. But some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, wanted to signal the White House that they are not yet prepared to see the United States go to war in the Persian Gulf. The resolution is not binding. At the same time, lawmakers wanted to make clear to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that Congress opposes Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait. 
The resolution, which was adopted unanimously by the panel and is likely to win quick House approval, praised Mr. Bush's reliance on international sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council.
''The United States shall continue to use diplomatic and other nonmilitary means, to the extent possible, in order to achieve those objectives and policies, while maintaining credible United States and multinational deterrent military force,'' the resolution said.
 
Arms Sale to the Saudis
As Congress debated the resolution, President Bush sent to Capitol Hill the first part of a $21 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The initial phase, valued by the Pentagon at $6.7 billion, includes 150 M-1A2 battle tanks, 6 Patriot antimissile batteries, 200 Bradley fighting vehicles and 150 TOW antitank missile launchers.
In a much smaller deal, the Pentagon announced the sale of 27 M-60A3 tanks to Bahrain for $37 million.
The Administration originally sought to submit the Saudi sale in one large package, but supporters of Israel on Capitol Hill threatened to fight the deal.
As the Saudi arms sale went to Capitol Hill, senior officials from the State Department, Defense Department and the White House met today in New York and Washington with about 40 prominent American Jews to repeat the Administration's pledge to maintain Israel's military superiority in the Middle East.
 
'Received Assurances'
''We received reassurances across the board that America is committed to Israel's security and considers Israel as a strategic asset,'' Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said.
Mr. Foxman said the Administration officials, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, made no explicit promises about American military aid to Jerusalem, but left no doubt that the United States would ''continue to keep Israel's qualitative edge.''
Despite the Administration's efforts, some lawmakers continued to express reservations about the Saudi sale, arguing that some of the weapons could not be delivered readily and thus met no immediate Saudi needs. Production of the M-1A2 tank, for example, is not scheduled to begin until November 1992.
''I still have doubts about this since it was my understanding that only truly emergency items would be included in this package,'' said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, a supporter of Israel.
 
Hearing Planned Next Week
A Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, described the arms included in the sale as ''material they urgently need for their defense,'' but Mr. Williams could provide no immediate explanation when the M-1A2 tanks could be delivered.
The Foreign Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing for next Thursday, at which Administration officials will be asked to explain the urgency of the sale.
Some lawmakers said that by selling a small number of the more sophisticated, and more controversial, weapons to Riyadh now, the Administration was seeking to set a precedent for the larger sale early next year. In the past, critics of American arms sales to Arab countries have argued strenously against introducing new military technology into the volatile Middle East.
''The so-called emergency arms sale to Saudi Arabia raises more questions than it answers,'' Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, the majority whip, said in a statement. He said that Congress should postpone the sale of any weapons that do not meet the Saudis' immediate needs.
In the northern Red Sea today, the American frigate Elmer Montgomery stopped and searched an Iraqi oil tanker after firing shots across the freighter's bow. The vessel, the Tadmur, which was headed away from the Jordanian port of Aqaba, was found to empty and allowed to proceed.

HEADLINE: Judge Fines USX $4.1 Million in Conspiracy Case

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sept. 27

 BODY:
A Federal District judge here levied the maximum possible fine on the USX Corporation today and gave prison terms to two top union officials who had been found guilty of conspiring with the company to obtain lucrative pensions in exchange for granting concessions in labor negotiations.
The judge, E. B. Haltom, fined the steel company $4.1 million and ordered it to repay nearly $300,000 to the pension fund, which had illegally paid pensions to the union officials. Judge Haltom said he had chosen the maximum fine in an attempt to punish and deter the company from repeating the offenses. The company was found guilty of 14 counts of conspiracy, violations of Federal labor law and mail fraud in a four-month trial that ended in July. 
The two officials of the United Steelworkers of America, Thermon Phillips, 62 years old, and E. B. Rich, 60, drew prison terms of two and a half and three years, respectively. Mr. Phillips is district director for union locals in several Southern states and he conducted labor negotiations for locals in the region. Mr. Rich was his chief aide.
Each man was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to accept a bribe and one count of violating Federal labor law. Mr. Rich had been acquitted of mail fraud charges; similar charges against Mr. Phillips had been dropped. Although they say they will appeal their convictions, both officials must now relinquish their union posts under Federal labor law.
 
Company Will Appeal
L. Drew Redden, a lawyer for USX, said the company would appeal the conviction and the sentence.
As this phase of the criminal case was ending, lawyers picked up activity in a large civil lawsuit growing out of the accusations of collusion between the union and USX. Today lawyers for rank-and-file union members in the civil case filed motions asking that the company, the union and the pension fund be barred from saying there was nothing illegal in the granting of the pensions to the officials.
Last month a Federal judge certified the suit as a class action, potentially increasing the number of plaintiffs from 38 to 5,500 and raising possible damages from a few million to more than $180 million. J. Vernon Patrick, lawyer for the union members, said the plaintiffs were also charging a violation of the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which allows recovery of triple the damages.
 
Sentences Applauded
The sentences were applauded by some rank-and-file members of the union who had crowded into the tiny courtroom. Lorenzo East, a retired steelworker, said there was some justice in the fact that the company was punished as well.
At the same time there was criticism by officials of the local union as well as officials of the international union who continued to maintain that the case was an attack by the Government on unions in general.
''These are Republicans and Reaganites and they don't miss an opportunity to hurt the unions,'' said Howard E. Strevel, a retired steelworkers union official who was in the courtroom.
The case dates back to a period of upheaval in the steel industry in the early 80's in which factory after factory succumbed to the effects of a recession and foreign competition. It was a time of retrenchment in which Birmingham's huge Fairfield Works, with its 3,500 employees, faced a shutdown.
Mr. Phillips, who sits on the union's international board, was at the center of the scramble to save jobs here. On Christmas Eve 1983, he and Mr. Rich entered into an agreement that kept the Fairfield Works open while granting concessions in the number of jobs and incentive pay and dropping of all pending grievances. The work force was to be cut by 1,500 employees, who would retire and receive pensions.
 
Once Local Heroes
The officials were hailed as heroes locally, and the company said that the cuts and concessions would save them $24 million.
The Fairfield agreement set a pattern for agreements between the company and other locals around the country, especially in the area of job levels.
But the trial here heard evidence that the union officials' acceptance of the concessions was linked to their receiving pension benefits to which they would not ordinarily be entitled.
The international's headquarters in Pittsburgh, in a letter sent out to its staff nationally, called the officials' convictions ''a tragedy'' and maintained that the cases' outcome had implications for all union officials Mr. Patrick, the lawyer in the civil case, said his office would send letters this weekend to 5,500 current and former USX employees in the Birmingham area letting them know that they might end up being entitled to damages.He said that the number represented not only those people employed at the time of the 1983 Fairfield Agreement but also those employed at the plant anytime since then.
''People have worked under the Fairfield agreement from 1983 to now and the corruption of these union officials by the company affects people from then until now,'' said Mr. Patrick. ''They have been denied adequated representation since then.''

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Veteran of Rights and Poverty Wars Tastes Bitter Fruit of Many Battles

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
When the Civil Rights Act of 1990 was proposed in Congress, its backers fervently hoped for a Rose Garden signing ceremony, as a triumphant cap for the long career of Representative Augustus F. Hawkins.
Far from a crowning achievement, the bill's halting progress through Congress and the threat of a veto has been a bitter disappointment for the man who since 1963 has represented not only south-central Los Angeles, including Watts, but also the big government liberalism of the New Deal and the Great Society.
''You could get frustrated by staying here,'' Mr. Hawkins said in a recent interview. ''But I have more confidence in the people outside than I do in public officials inside.''
Now 83 years old, the California Democrat announced in January, a month before the anti-discrimination measure was introduced, that this would be his last term. His frustration is rooted not only in the veto threat the White House renewed this week when the measure emerged from a House-Senate conference, but also in Congress, which has increasingly turned its back on goals he espouses and approaches he advocates. 
 
Irked at Budget 'Obsession'
''This obsession we seem to have with spending cuts as the only way you can balance the budget is to me so devastating and so wrong,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''And yet, I can't see them changing it.''
Like a cherished elderly uncle who stays too long at dinner telling a story he has forgotten he has told before, he is viewed by many as a relic whose ideas have grown stale.
''He is more wedded to a policy approach that is grounded in the 60's,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey, a New York Democrat who has battled with him over the best way to finance child care programs. ''That would have been great, but Lyndon Johnson is not going to come back and sign a bill for child care.''
This year's civil rights bill would reverse a series of Supreme Court rulings last year that made it harder for people to bring damage suits against employers charging discrimination. It would also mandate the payment of punitive monetary damages by businesses guilty of discrimination.
But over his objections, the conferees limited to $150,000 the amount juries may award victims of intentional discrimination. Mr. Hawkins wanted any such ceiling to apply only to small businesses, arguing that large corporations ought to be made to pay severely for maliciously denying individuals their civil rights.
 
Disappointment With Caucus
Mr. Hawkins is equally critical of the Congressional Black Caucus, which he helped found in 1970 and hoped would supplement political organizing efforts by financially strapped civil rights groups. The caucus, Mr. Hawkins feels, has yet to act as a cohesive unit.
''It's pretty difficult to get individual politicians, in particular, to subordinate their own egos to group activity,'' he said. ''This, I think, unfortunately, is the outgrowth of early childhood. We are not brought up to act in groups.''
''That's why I'm such a staunch supporter of early childhood education and child care,'' he continued. ''Child care children act differently from other children when they are brought up that way. It's not just blacks - it's Americans in general. But we're the ones who suffer the most from it.''
The 5-foot-5 Californian, so light-skinned that many on meeting him mistake him for a white, remains steadfast in his belief that the programs developed in the New Deal and the Great Society represent the best way to attack the problems of unemployment, poverty and to educate disadvantaged youngsters.
''They have worked,'' he said of the programs he still cherishes. ''I don't see anybody moving to repeal them or to eliminate them. The 'war on poverty' did a good job. It reduced poverty. How better can a thing work than by accomplishing its objectives? Head Start is a wonderful program. The business community favors it. The education community favors it. Social Security worked; deposit insurance for banks worked; aid to elementary and secondary schools works. They'll all on the statute books, and they're all documented successes.
''The biggest problem is that they were never sufficiently funded, and efforts are now being made to sabotage them. So I think that anybody who says you are out of date by supporting these programs is not fully aware of them.''
 
Still an Icon Among Many
Mr. Hawkins, who first won elective office, to the California General Assemby, during Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, remains an icon among many members, including those who disagree with him, and few will criticize him directly. But even his allies concede that his way of dealing with racial problems and poverty is not today's way.
''He is one of the last warriors of the Great Society'' said Mr. Dixon, another of the 24 blacks in Congress, who considers Mr. Hawkins a mentor. ''But we are now looking for other creative ways to help minorities -economic development and the like.''
Mr. Hawkins's sense of not being fulfilled may also be fueled by his experience on Capitol Hill. When he arrived in 1963, he was assigned to the Education and Labor Committee, then under the chairmanship of Representative Adam Clayton Powell, the flamboyant New York Democrat.
In the early 60's Mr. Powell was at the height of his power. Under his leadership, the committee was a legislative dynamo, churning out bills setting up a $1.25-an-hour minimum wage, increasing aid to higher education, setting up programs for those with disabilities, and establishing the Job Corps, a critical component of the war on poverty.
 
An Impressive Record
Quietly toiling in the legislative trenches, Mr. Hawkins amassed an impressive legislative record. It included drafting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination in employment; writing the law setting up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and playing a pivotal role in the Civil Rights Restoration Act, enacted in 1988 over a veto by President Ronald Reagan, mandating that Federal funds be cut off to any institution if any of its components is found to discriminate.
But when Mr. Hawkins became chairman of the Education and Labor Committee in 1984, he inherited a panel that was a shadow of what is was under Mr. Powell. Dispirited by Reagan-era cutbacks in programs under its jurisdiction and a flow of power from the committees that authorize legislation to the panels the appropriate funds for them, the committee found it hard to fill all its Democratic seats.
''He played the game the way it's supposed to be played, but when he finally got on top, he found he had few opportunities to make any headway,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. Disappointment with the direction of domestic policy is not the only reason Mr. Hawkins has decided to retire. Friends say he simply wants to devote more time to his wife, Elsie, and to fishing in Chesapeake Bay on his 33-foot cabin cruiser.
''He's had great success on most of the legislation he has pushed,'' said Representative Don Edwards, a fellow Democrat from California who entered Congress along with Mr. Hawkins in 1963. ''But he's in his 80's. He's got a place on Solomon Island and a nice wife. Maybe he wants a few years of contemplation in his remaining years.''
 
Still Has Political Goals
But Mr. Hawkins has no intention of merely hanging up a ''gone fishing'' sign. He says he intends to rally grass-roots political support - the kind he feels has been sorely lacking on the pending civil rights bill - for more money for education. And he wants to fight what he considers ''crazy ideas,'' like government vouchers that parents would ''spend'' to send their children to public or private schools.
''I think I could do a better job on the outside of calling attention toward what needs to be done,'' he said. ''We've been successful in getting bills through, and that's about all I can do: get laws passed.''
Can the diffident Mr. Hawkins, who has quietly battling for liberal causes in the legislative trenches, rally the troops?
''Unless he gets emotionally charged, he's not one to take to the stump,'' said Mr. Edwards. ''He's not a Jesse Jackson or a Martin Luther King.''
Mr. Hawkins presents no argument to this characterization. ''I'm not built for leadership,'' he said. ''I don't like the frivolities that go along with being out front. It's not a matter of sour grapes. It's just that some individuals are made for certain things. I would rather just enjoy myself and not worry about being a leader. There are others who want to be out front. They want to get the recognition. They love the television cameras.''

HEADLINE: Panel Backs Bill on Puerto Rico Vote

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Taking another step toward giving Puerto Rico the right to choose statehood, independence or a continuation of its commonwealth status, a House panel approved a bill today to authorize a vote next year. The bill would also force Congress to decide within six months of the referendum whether to accept its results.
The bill approved by a subcommittee of the House Rules Committee will probably go to the full committee next week, where approval is almost guaranteed, and then to the full House. The bill was passed by the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee last week. 
House staff members said it was still unclear whether both the Senate and the House could pass legislation and present it to President Bush for signing this year, since Congress was rushing to finish its legislative agenda by the middle of October.
But they noted that House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and the Republican leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, had expressed particular interest in the legislation, which would give Puerto Rico the power of self-determination. President Bush made statehood for Puerto Rico an issue both in his 1988 Presidential campaign and in his 1989 State of the Union message.
 
Years of 'Divisive Debate'
The issue of self-determination for 3.6 million Puerto Ricans living on the Caribbean island and 2.5 million living in the United States has been a thorny issue for both the United States and Puerto Rico.
''For years now, the divisive debate on Puerto Rico's future political status has prevented action on many of the very serious social and economic problems facing our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico,'' said Representative Ron de Lugo, the island's delegate in the House.
Until 1988, the island's three major parties - the Popular Democratic Party, which supports continued commonwealth status, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood. and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which supports independence -opposed a referendum.
 
A Vote in 1991
While sentiment for statehood has risen and fallen over time, opinion now runs slightly in favor of it over continuing the commonwealth relationship.
The bill in the House would provide $13.5 million in administrative and educational money to pay for a referendum on Sept. 16, 1991. The bill would require Congress either to approve the results of the referendum and decide on steps to carry them out or to modify them in six months. After that Puerto Rico would vote a second time on ratifying the steps set out by Congress.
One issue that had been a major point of dispute in the bill was whether the 2.5 million Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States could vote. Experts noted that because those Puerto Ricans tended to favor statehood, allowing them to vote would favor those backing statehood. The bill would leave the decision about whether those Puerto Ricans could vote to the island's three political parties and its Legislature.
 
Statehood Means More Aid
Still, statehood at this point appears to be preferred, primarily because it would mean greater economic aid for the island's residents and give Puerto Ricans, who already have United States citizenship, full political representation, including two United States senators and what Congressional aides estimated was likely to be six members of the House.
But the economic argument appears to be compelling, particularly since United States law does not force the Government to provide Federal aid to residents of territories like Puerto Rico at the same level that residents of states receive.
Half the island's residents receive some form of Federal aid, for a total of $6.5 billion a year, but that group would receive $3 billion more if Puerto Rico became a state.
Favorable tax laws, which could be threatened by a change of status, continue to be a compelling reason for many to support an enhanced commonwealth status. These laws have attracted to Puerto Rico operations by almost one-third of the Fortune 500 companies, leading to the creation of 150,000 jobs. The enhancements would result in greater Federal aid.

HEADLINE: Tribes to Hear Proposal to Revamp Indian Bureau

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. Sept. 27

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has called American Indian tribal leaders from around the country for a meeting on Friday that he says will point a course toward greater self-determination for the tribes.
At the meeting here, Mr. Lujan plans to outline a proposal to revamp the Bureau of Indian Affairs and to modify the system of delivering Federal funds to the tribes.
''I think this will give them more sovereignty, more opportunity to make their own decisions,'' Mr. Lujan said in an interview this week. ''I think they ought to take as much responsibility as possible.'' 
 
Skepticism Among Indians
A number of tribal leaders voiced skepticism about the meeting, which they said followed a pattern of periodic overhauls by the Federal Government, and which they complained offered little chance for input from the tribes themselves.
The issue of greater self-determination for the tribes is one that has drawn increasing attention in recent years.
''This should be the story of the 90's,'' said Tim Giago, a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe who is editor of The Lakota Times, a weekly newspaper in Rapid City, S.D. ''Tribal sovereignty is the key word in Indian country now.''
A Senate committee report last November proposed greater tribal autonomy after a two-year committee investigation of the current system found widespread corruption and mismanagement of Indian land and money.
The report proposed that tribes be given the opportunity for tighter control over and accountability for their individual shares of more than $3.3 billion in annual Federal grants for education, health, economic development and natural resources development.
The issue remains a complicated one on which the more than 500 tribes are far from united. The steps Mr. Lujan described are incremental and drew advance criticism from some Indian leaders who said they amounted to little more than bureaucratic reshuffling.
 
New Budgeting Control
Mr. Lujan said one of the steps he would outline would be a shift away from the current system in which tribes receive Federal financing for specific uses like law enforcement or economic development.
''What I want to do,'' Mr. Lujan said, ''is take the same amount of money and say, 'O.K., here are the dollars,' but instead of us doing it categorically, say, 'You decide where the money will be spent, just like a state or a city.'''
Last summer, the Interior Department started a pilot program in which six tribes were given greater control over the budgeting and spending of Federal funds for Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.
Mr. Lujan said his second step would involve dividing the bureau into separate sections overseeing trust relations, delivery of services to tribes and education.
He said improving the quality of education on Indian reservations was a cornerstone of future tribal sovereignty, and was one of his priorities.
''For the last year and a half, since I've been Secretary, we have been talking to all the different tribal leaders on an individual basis,'' Mr. Lujan said. ''Now the time has come to sit down with the group as a whole and look at where we are and where we are going.''
Wendell Chino, chairman of the Mescalero Apache tribe for more than 30 years, the longest tenure of any tribal chairman in the country, said he would attend the meeting, but like a number of other Indian leaders he said he had doubts about its usefulness.
 
Secret Motives Are Seen
''I think it is very unfair to invite tribal leaders even from as far away as Alaska for just a one-day meeting,'' the 66-year-old chairman said. ''I think the meeting is going to be used as a guise that 'We have consulted with the Indians and now we are going to go ahead with the plan.' ''
He suggested that Mr. Lujan's proposals might be an attempt to pre-empt the recommendations of the Senate committee.
Sam Deloria, an expert on Indian affairs at the University of New Mexico Law School, said modifications of the current financing system, like those described by Mr. Lujan, had been opposed in the past because of concerns that overall fund levels could be adversely affected.
In addition, Indian leaders have argued that many tribes are not prepared to manage their own financial planning.
''Right now, most of the tribes are looking at survival,'' said Mr. Giago, the Indian newspaper editor. ''When you talk about budget cuts you are talking about something that would absolutely decimate an Indian tribe. We are totally dependent on the Federal dollar.''
 
'An Old Story'
Mr. Giago said he viewed the gathering with a skepticism born of experience. ''Big meetings are an old story,'' he said.
Mr. Deloria said the idea of reorganizing the bureau was also one that had been entertained by most administrations.
''It's a standing joke in Indian affairs that if you can't think of a policy, you reorganize,'' he said. ''The Bureau of Indian Affairs could be reorganized in a variety of ways that all make sense, and this one probably makes about as much sense as any other.''

HEADLINE: Social Security: A Tinderbox Both Parties Handle Gingerly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
There are few subjects more perilous for politicians, particularly in an election year, than the suggestion that they might be tampering with Social Security.
That is the reality that budget negotiators were dealing with as they gingerly searched for budget savings today in this most sacred of all American benefit programs.
''We've seen that in the past to be a very explosive subject,'' said Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Conference.
''We've been up and down that hill many times,'' said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. ''There's a concern about doing anything to the elderly.'' 
In the course of the 1980's the issue was highly partisan as well. In both 1982 and 1986 the Democrats depicted the Republicans as a threat to Social Security and made big gains in the elections.
 
Cycle of Negative Campaigns
Indeed, Republicans often cite the 1982 campaigns Democrats ran against Republicans on Social Security as the start of the cycle of negative campaigning that came to dominate politics in the decade.
''The Republicans feel as burned on this issue as the Democrats feel burned on the tax issue,'' said Anita Dunn, communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In a political sense, for the Democrats to agree to changes in Social Security, and thus weaken one of their best issues, is the rough equivalent of President Bush's willingness to abandon his no-new-taxes pledge.
With 40 days until the midterm elections, there are few members of Congress who would voluntarily want to go to their districts to explain any curtailment of Social Security benefits.
America's older citizens are among the nation's most potent constituencies. They vote at higher rates than most other Americans. In addition, their organizations, lead by the American Association of Retired Persons, swing great weight on Capitol Hill.
At least 39 million Americans receive regular benefit checks from Social Security, and millions more have parents or grandparents who receive benefits and plan to receive benefits themselves some day.
The subject is so sensitive that many Democrats rebuffed the suggestion of cutting the payroll tax imposed to pay Social Security because pollsters told them that it made many Americans nervous that the tax cut might endanger their Social Security payments.
 
Selecting an Issue
Tony Coelho, a former Representative from California, was a leading architect of the Democratic strategy to invoke Social Security as an issue.
''In 1982 we were looking for an issue to run the campaigns to try to offset Reagan,'' he said, ''and we decided to take on the issue of Social Security.''
Democratic candidates tried to tie Republicans wherever they could to a budget plan, offered in 1981 by David A. Stockman, a budget director under President Ronald Reagan, that would have cut Social Security.
That issue, combined with a recession that developed in the final weeks of the campaign, led the Democrats to a gain of 26 seats in the House.
But there was a downside, Mr. Coelho said. ''It became a motherhood issue much stronger than we ever expected,'' he said. ''You couldn't even tinker with the system when you needed to.''
On Capitol Hill there is a growing anger toward the elderly. Last year, some older people staged an uprising against a program to provide insurance against the soaring costs of catastrophic illnesses. They were happy to receive benefits, but many objected to premiums. In Chicago, some threw themselves in front of the car carrying Representative Dan Rostenkowsi, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The program was repealed.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the debacle of the catastrophic health care program was a warning of the storm that would greet any changes in Social Security. ''Whatever happened on catastrophic,'' he said, ''multiply that by two.''

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Capital Gains: Plus, Minus or Neither?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
To President Bush, cutting taxes on capital gains is a matter of common sense: a lower rate, he says, would mean more investment without sacrificing tax revenue. To most Congressional Democrats, a break in the tax rate on capital gains would amount to a windfall for the rich and a giant step back from the goal of taxing all forms of income equally.
But economists are generally less eager to assign the capital gains initiative a permanent place in heaven or hell. A cut in the capital rate would indeed distort economic incentives and enrich wealthy Americans at the expense of the Treasury Department, many argue. But there is still a plausible case to be made for special treatment of capital gains as part of a broader change in the tax system. 
Until 1986 only a portion of the income from profits on the sale of assets were taxed as income, effectively reducing the maximum rate on capital gains to 20 percent. But when the maximum income tax rate was reduced, the capital gains preference was dropped. The effective maximum bracket is now 33 percent.
The architects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 considered this move toward tax neutrality as a shining achievement. No longer, they argued, would decisions about investment be distorted by considerations of how income would be realized or when.
 
Taxes As Incentives
But like many other Americans, George Bush never abandoned the idea of using taxes as incentives. From his first days on the campaign trail, he has been pressing for capital gains tax relief as an inducement to invest.
A tax cut would induce investors to take profits, the Treasury contends, increasing tax revenue in the short run. And in some instances it would induce investors to sell assets during their lifetime, generating revenue that would otherwise be lost entirely because heirs never pay taxes on capital gains. By the Administration's reckoning, a 30 percent exclusion - the equivalent of a maximum 23 percent bracket - would generate an additional $12 billion in revenue over the next five years.
The staff of Congress's nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee disagreed, saying that while revenue would increase in the first two years, over five years, losses would exceed $11 billion.
Other economists are skeptical that a general tax break on profits from sales of assets would stimulate investment in the sort of high-risk innovations that President Bush wants to encourage. James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the bulk of capital for risky new ventures now comes from sources that would not be affected by tax changes - notably pension funds. Thus to be effective, the tax break would have to draw in investors with little experience in the area of venture capital.
 
Most Benefits to Affluent
Hardly anyone, though, disputes the charge that most of the direct benefits from a capital gains break would go to an affluent minority. By the Administration's estimate, $27 billion of the $49 billion in capital gains this year will be realized by families whose incomes have averaged $200,000 or more over the last five years. Just $4.8 billion in capital gains income will go to families with incomes of less than $50,000.
That raises the prospect of stretching an income gap that widened sharply during the Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations. For some experts, that is more than enough reason not to change.
''Any kind of differential for capital gains,'' said a senior adviser to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, ''would erode the carefully balanced reform of 1986 and lead to increased tax rates on ordinary income.''
But others said the current treatment of capital gains income did not really meet a rigorous test of tax neutrality. Taxing capital gains income at regular rates penalizes those who hold assets in periods of inflation. For example, someone who bought an asset for $25,000 in 1978 and sold it today for $50,000 would pay taxes on the $25,000 gain. But since prices have doubled in 12 years, the entire gain is an effect of inflation. That is why budget negotiators are said to be considering a compromise of adjusting gains for inflation, or indexing.
 
One Bias Untouched
One giant catch, says Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, is that indexing would offset only one bias, leaving intact another that effectively reduces the tax on long-held gains. Under current law taxes are deferred until property is sold, allowing gains to compound untouched. Equally important, the law gives investors leeway to realize capital gains in years when their incomes (and tax rates) are low.
Mr. Aaron offers a more general objection to indexing capital gains. Taxes are affected by inflation in myriad ways, he says. Changing one without changing all could produce major distortions in the system.
Tax brackets have been indexed since 1986, ending ''bracket creep'' that automatically increased revenues by billions a year. But taxes on interest income have not been indexed. This year an investor who earns 8 percent on a bank deposit will pay taxes on the entire 8 percent, even though three-quarters of the return will already have been wiped out by inflation.
But inflation works in both directions. Interest paid by homeowners has not been indexed, effectively doubling the tax break on the average mortgage deduction. By the same token, inflation artifically increases the value of business deductions for interest and depreciation.
If capital gains are indeed indexed, Mr. Aaron said, interest deductions had better be indexed, too. Otherwise investors would be able to buy property with borrowed money, get the benefit of inflated interest deductions for years and then pay little tax when they sell the property for a profit.

HEADLINE: Peter J. Ottley, 82, Head of Local In the Hotels and Hospital Union

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Peter J. Ottley, a former elevator operator who became president of Local 144 of the Hotels, Hospitals, Nursing Home and Allied Services Union for 37 years, representing tens of thousands of workers, died on Wednesday at La Guardia Hospital in Queens. He was 82 years old and lived in St. Albans, Queens.
He died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said. 
Mr. Ottley was head of the union from 1950 until he retired in 1987. When he joined the local, it was primarily a hotel union with a predominantly white membership. Over the years its membership changed to a majority of black members and expanded to represent nursing-home and hospital workers, as well as licensed practical and registered nurses. #33,000 Union Members Today more than 200 hotels, 100 nursing homes and 40 hospitals, with a total of 33,000 members, are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Local 144 in the metropolitan New York area, according to the union.
In 1950 Mr. Ottley became an officer of the Hotel and Motel Trades Council, a coalition of unions that bargain for employees in the city's large hotels. He became a vice president of Local 144's parent body, the Service Employees International Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O., in 1962.
Two years later he was named director of civil rights and economic opportunity for the international union.
 
Conviction Overturned
In 1973 Mr. Ottley was one of two union officers indicted by a Federal grand jury and accused of embezzling more than $186,000 in union funds. He was convicted the following year of aiding in the embezzlement of union funds and failing to keep adequate expense records covering about $20,000 during a four-year period that ended in 1972.
His conviction later was overturned by an appeals court on the grounds that an improper charge to the jury had been made, and the case was dismissed.
Peter Jerome Ottley was born in Grenada and came to the United States in 1927, where he was employed as an elevator operator in the Caxton Building on West 28th Street. He went to night school to complete high school and attended New York University for a year. The first strike he led was of building workers at the Caxton Building during the Depression in 1933.
Mr. Ottley is survived by his wife, the former Mabel Farrell; a son, Arthur, of Brooklyn, and a grandson.

HEADLINE: When Leaves Fall, Red Sox Do, Too;
Autumn Swoon Pains New Englanders

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
It happens every fall. Or so it seems in New England, where the Red Sox are virtually a religion and good citizens have come to expect the team to collapse in September. The Red Sox have not won the World Series since their owner sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees more than 70 years ago to finance a Broadway musical, and this year the pattern seems to be repeating itself. Ahead by six and a half games in early September in the American League East, the Red Sox have lost 9 of their last 12 games, falling a game behind the Toronto Blue Jays.
 
Her Teeth Ache
But even for the descendants of the Puritans, believers in predestination, there is still pain.
''My teeth ache every morning when I think about the Red Sox,'' a caller said Wednesday evening on the Eddie Andelman show on WHDH radio, the most popular sports talk program in the region. 
''I don't know what to do,'' she said in despair. ''My brother just moved to New York, so I'm almost thinking of becoming a Yankees fan.'' It was a blasphemous statement, and she knew it.
''After all,'' the woman explained, alluding to the angry mood of Massachusetts voters this fall, ''I've already gone from being a Democrat to being a Republican.''
Her thoughts, mixing sports and politics, Bostonians' two favorite passions, were echoed across the Charles River in Cambridge by Henry Rosovsky, the acting dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. ''This is an angry state,'' said Rosovsky, one of the most respected academic leaders in the country and a Red Sox diehard. ''If the people could vote on the Red Sox, they would throw out the manager, the general manager and the owners,'' he said.
''I am terribly saddened,'' Rosovsky added. ''I do feel the curse of the Bambino lays heavily on my shoulders,'' he said, referring to the popular myth that the ill fate of the Red Sox is traceable to the sale of Ruth, the Bambino.
The fans' anxieties and the team's plight have been made worse by the absence of Roger Clemens, the superstar pitcher, who has been out since Sept. 4 with a sore shoulder. The glum feeling about the Red Sox has been exacerbated over the past week by disputes involving players on two of Boston's other professional sports franchises, the Celtics and the New England Patriots. On Friday, Dee Brown, the Celtics' first-round draft pick this spring, was forced by the police in Wellesley to lie face down on the pavement at gunpoint when they mistakenly identified him as a bank robber. Brown contended the police acted simply because he was black and he has threatened to sue the affluent, largely white suburb.
At the same time, The Boston Herald today took the highly unusual step of calling for a boycott of Sunday's football game between the Patriots and the Jets at Foxboro Stadium because of incidents in which several players were said to have made lewd coments to a Herald Reporter, Lisa Olson, who later said she was insulted by the team's owner, Victor Kiam. The trouble began in the Patriots' locker room on Sept. 17 when, Olson said, several unclothed players positioned themselves close to her face and ''dared me to touch their private parts.''
Then on Monday The Herald reported that Kiam, the president of Remington Products Inc., had referred to Olson as ''a classic bitch.'' Kiam has denied making the remark, saying he had only called her an aggressive reporter.
''Stay home this Sunday,'' The Herald said today. ''Don't do it for Lisa Olson, because she'll handle this like the pro she is. Do it for all the women in your life. Do it because it's the right thing to do.''
Controversy over Olson's treatment has almost obsured the Red Sox swoon, with some callers on the radio talk shows suggesting that a female reporter should not be allowed in a men's locker room. But Andelman, the talk-show host, has been strongly supportive of her.
''I'm not a prude,'' he said today, ''but we can't allow this to go unpunished.''
 
Simply 'Gruesome'
To Andelman, a genial, opinionated millionaire businessman who has run his radio program as a hobby for more than 20 years, the recent troubles of the Red Sox, the Patriots and the Celtics have been ''gruesome.''
''You also have to add to this the bad economic news in New England,'' he said, referring to a recession that has hit the region after a decade of spectacular growth. ''It's really been a lot to swallow.''
In commiseration, Andelman began his show Wednesday with the sound of tolling church bells. ''There must be some good news out there,'' he said to his listeners. ''Doesn't anyone have some good news?''
Although the Red Sox still have a three-game series with the Blue Jays in Fenway Park this weekend, many people seem to have already given up. ''If there is a way to lose, we're going to do it,'' said Jeff A. Swartz, who was selling Red Sox hats and souvenirs from a cart outside the ballpark.
''Even when they were in first place, people were waiting for them to lose,'' Swartz said. ''Give them a chance to choke, and they will,'' he said, recalling the playoff game between the Red Sox and Yankees in 1978 when Boston squandered a 2-0 lead and lost, 5-4, on a pop fly home run by Bucky Dent that just cleared the short left-field wall.
Similarly, in 1948 the Red Sox lost the only other one-game playoff in American League history, to the Indians. And in 1949, with the Red Sox one game up on the Yankees with two games to play in New York, Boston lost both contests.
 
Thinning Crowds
Still, this year seems a little different around Fenway Park. After sellouts virtually all summer, the crowds have suddenly thinned, despite the heat of the pennant race. Wednesday night, when the Red Sox actually beat Cleveland, 7-2, the team drew only 28,630 people, fewer than went to games against the Indians back in June.
''I think this year is different because in the past the fans always blamed the players or the manager,'' Andelman said. ''But this year they've realized this is a team without speed, without home-run power, and without pitching beyond Roger Clemens. They know the team has overachieved for the talent it has.
''So the fans have finally started to blame the front office. They see the owners are content because Fenway fills up every night, and they aren't committed to making trades or acquiring top players.''
Andelman said callers to his show were particularly irate after the Oakland Athletics acquired Willie McGee, who was among the National League's leading hitters, on waivers from St. Louis, and Lou Gorman, the Red Sox General Manager, said Boston had no use for him.
''That's because the Red Sox don't want two black players in the outfield,'' Andelman said. The only regular black player on the team now is Ellis Burks, the center fielder. No one from the team was available for comment on Andelman's statement.
Emily Vermeule, a professor of classics and fine arts at Harvard, agreed. ''The owners are a bunch of cheapos,'' she said. ''You could make a distinguished team just from the pitchers they've let go,'' she said, pointing to pitchers like Dennis Eckersley, Bobby Ojeda, John Tudor and Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd.
''In the past I used to really care about the team,'' Vermeule said. ''But these are just like a bunch of Hellenistic mercenaries. All they care about is money.''

After weeks of bickering about cutting the capital gains tax, and with Monday's deadline looming, budget negotiators appear within reach of a compromise. And not just any compromise. This may be one case in which political posturing is about to produce an economic pot of gold.
The negotiators have been deadlocked for weeks over Mr. Bush's persistent demand for a lower tax on capital gains - the increased value of stocks, bonds and other assets between purchase and sale. The Republicans say that a cut is needed to spur economic growth. The Democrats say no, because the cut would overwhelmingly benefit the rich. 
The deal could still disintegrate. But under the tentative compromise the capital gains tax would be indexed for inflation, meaning that only capital gains in excess of the inflation rate would be taxed. And, some summiteers are proposing, the indexation would apply only to future investments in, say, small companies.
To the summiteers this is the ordinary business of political compromise. Everybody gets only part of what he wants and thinks he deserves. But to the economy, the outcome could be a whole lot more. Indexation, if so targeted, would give a welcome boost to emerging companies struggling to attract investors yet not wreak havoc with the rest of the tax code.
The President has stalled the deficit negotiations by doggedly insisting that the deficit package include a cut in the capital gains tax. His argument that this would spur economic growth strains credulity. By cutting the tax on old and new investments alike, the plan amounts to a fabulous giveaway for his rich supporters. Mr. Bush never answers how handing investors billions more for what they did in the past will cause them to invest more in the future.
Nor does he explain why the tax cut ought to apply to real estate and other tax-advantaged investments. The empty office buildings and half-filled shopping centers across the Southwest are proof that foolish tax subsidies can make wasteful investments profitable.
The sobering truth is that a sweeping capital gains tax cut won't jump-start the economy. The cut wouldn't affect tax-exempt pension funds and foreign investors. To make a noticeable dent, the cut would have to produce a herculean response on the part of taxpaying individuals. Most economists dismiss that possibility.
Mr. Bush is correct, however, when he argues that the capital gains tax imposes an excessive burden during inflationary times. Upon the sale of stocks and bonds, investors are taxed on price increases that, in large part, represent no real profit. Of course, inflation also distorts taxation of interest from bank accounts, deductions of mortgage interest, depreciation allowances on corporate plants and equipment and scores of other tax calculations. Across-the-board indexing of capital gains alone could distort investment patterns even more and wind up doing as much harm as good.
That said, there is a case to be made for tinkering with the capital gains tax. A tax cut that is limited to new investment in venture capital and other risky start-up companies could produce real economic gains because those types of businesses are struggling to survive. But such focused relief is light years away from Mr. Bush's plan.
The Democratic response to that plan has been something less than enlightened. Yes, a capital gains tax cut would shower profit on the rich. Yes, that's unfair. But the important task is to set the capital gains tax to spur investment and growth. Any inequity that might result should then be undone by socking the rich in some other way, as the Democrats have consistently proposed.
Now comes the possibility that from all the political posturing and errant economics, something constructive will emerge. Indexing capital gains for new investments in stocks allows Republicans and Democrats to claim partial victory. And the economy gets to claim complete victory. The process would be weird, but the result glorious.

Capitalism, Soviet Style

BYLINE: By JACK ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
PEMOHT: It may be the most frequently seen word on Soviet streets. What the Cyrillic word says is ''remont,'' what it supposedly means is ''under repair'' and what it really means is ''broken.''
Much is broken in Moscow now, as it was in Europe after World War II. Then, Dondi-like urchins emerged from bombed-out buildings to beg for Juicy Fruit. To wan, exhausted adults, American cigarettes were gold. Food was scarce, water was dangerous to drink and paper napkins, let alone toilet tissue, were rare, and rough. 
There are no bombed-out hulks in Moscow or Leningrad now but there is no end of paint-peeling, cracked and even crumbling buildings behind their ''remont'' signs. Children rush up to foreigners to trade souvenir insignia pins for gum. Cab drivers insist on payment in Marlboros or dollars. Food is scarce, water is dangerous to drink and paper napkins come, if at all, in single-ply sheets four inches square.
But for all these similarities, there's an overriding difference between Western Europe then and the Soviet Union now. In postwar Europe, the people were stunned and exhausted but knew how to rebuild their economies. In the post-cold-war Soviet Union, there's no sense that people have any idea how to get from here to there.
In truth, as economists teach us, no one knows how. No Communist society has ever converted itself to the free market. There's not even a respectable economic theory of how to do so. Yet Soviet laymen and scholars alike lunge for the forms and slogans of the market while giving little sign that they understand where they are going.
The most obvious difficulty is money. Visitors are subjected to five kinds - dollars, Marlboros and three kinds of ruble, worth $1.75 or 16 cents or a nickel. What rational outsider will invest in a society that finds it so hard to answer the simple question, ''How much?'' Ah, Soviets insist, but there's progress on that. For instance, we know how much land will cost, says a scholar occupied with creating a new master plan for the city of Moscow. ''We have developed a complex urban simulation model to set prices on a general scale.'' One hectare of land in downtown Moscow could cost 20 million rubles, but only 2 million outside the 10-mile ring. Fine, but which ruble? Well, he says, that's unclear. These prices are meant only to establish relative values.
There's no trouble stating prices in the few private enterprises already in place. In the cooperative profit-making restaurants, the waiters, captains and singing strings knock themselves out to please patrons able to spend $40 apiece, in dollars, for dinner.
And a literal kind of free market already exists among the people who crowd around the folding tables outside a soccer stadium in Moscow, the Ismailova Market, or in Ostrovsky Square in Leningrad. Dozens of peddlers offer paintings, dolls, lace - while hundreds more walk past whispering ''Militaravotch?'' From seemingly bottomless duffel bags they proffer uniforms, belts, caps. One flashes a Red Army staff officer's leather map case, including a compartment for ''sikret meps.''
There are other touches of a free market. On certain days one official enterprise closes to let employees do ''research''; it sounds more like moonlighting. Still, for all these surface signs of capitalism, Soviet citizens seem impatient for change but uncomprehending of what that will require.
They hail radical economic reform but perhaps more out of impatience than understanding. Pavel Podlesny, a shrewd analyst at the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, says many Soviets do so out of a burning impulse for tak ili syak - one way or the other, fish or cut bait. To do either will require changing the meaning of remont.

HEADLINE: Investment Tax Credit Is Worth Trying Again

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As Congressional leaders horse-trade over income tax increases and capital-gains tax reductions, an opportunity to head off decline into serious recession is being missed: a targeted investment tax credit program.
While a capital-gains tax reduction would free capital for investment, the desired result is by no means certain. We must hope that the beneficiaries of these cuts would invest in activities that create jobs and growth. But the added revenue could also spur a new round of buyouts, mergers and other paper shuffles that contribute little to the overall economy.
Investment tax credits would encourage business and industry to invest in physical plant upgrades, new machinery and high technology. These are the things that create jobs, boost the economy and, ultimately, increase tax revenues.
Investment tax credits worked in the 1960's and 70's, and they can work today.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Pocketbooks Expected to Shape Race

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: MONROE, Conn., Sept. 27

 BODY:
When people here go to vote for a new governor in November, local nightmares like the Alamo are likely to follow them right into the booth. The Alamo is what residents call the pink Southwestern-motif shopping center on Route 111 that belly-flopped in the Northeast's real-estate downturn. It has sat empty, apparently with no survivors, for the last 18 months.
That is not to say that the world has fallen apart in this community of 17,000 people on the eastern edge of Fairfield County. Monroe mostly remains a well-tended, heavily Republican former farming town. What has changed, politicians and residents say, is that Monroe, along with almost every other Connecticut community, has been forced to acknowledge its limitations. 
But in a state and region where the main questions until recently were ''how high?'' and ''how fast?'', the news of mortality has been disturbing enough, and politicians say that how voters express their disappointment is generally expected to decide the election.
In the last 18 months, applications for welfare here have quadrupled. The dollar value of losses from property crimes -particularly burglaries - has nearly doubled, attributed by the police to the rise of crack use in nearby Bridgeport and the resulting need for quick cash.
 
The Hot Button: the Economy
The local construction industry has all but died. Residents twice rejected budgets before approving one that raised property taxes by nearly 6 percent and cut spending for schools. The action followed cuts in state aid last spring.
The votes also deeply divided Monroe along lines of age and economics, with hard-pressed young families joining retirement-age people to force cuts in once-hallowed school spending.
''That's the hot button this year: the economy and the resulting impact on local taxpayers,'' said Kenneth S. Heitzke, a retired Army colonel who runs Monroe's town hall as Selectman. ''We're cutting anything that reeks of being something nice to have. We're down to the real hard nuts.''
Yet in dozens of recent interviews with residents, it was clear that no easy equation would directly link voters' frustration or anger to the success or failure of any candidate.
Though United States Representative John G. Rowland, the Republican nominee, has represented Monroe since 1985 and is expected to do well here, former United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Greenwich Republican running under his own party label, is considered almost a local son.
The questions are the extent to which those candidates will carve up the vote - a result that could benefit the Democrat, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison - and how much voters will make local issues a basis of how they cast their ballots. All three candidates have vowed to maintain local aid as much as possible next year, but with a projected $1 billion deficit in a state budget of only about $7 billion, many people here are skeptical.
 
Of Beer and Bread
''It's fine and well that they want to keep their commitments, but what are they going to do about it?'' asked Henry W. Cortina, a systems analyst who has lived here seven years.
Patrick C. O'Hara, a native who opened a wholesale nursery this summer, said, ''The thing is, they've got to stop spending our money.''
Mr. O'Hara, in a sentiment echoed by several, said he was bothered that the town had to scrimp on its school budget, while it continued to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in state money to develop a town park.
''In your house, if you don't have enough money for bread but you go out and buy a six-pack of beer, something's wrong,'' Mr. O'Hara said. He said he would probably vote for Mr. Weicker because he seems ''craftier.''
 
Little Growth in 2 Years
For Monroe, where the population grew by 22 percent in the 1980's alone, one of the most ominous portents for the future is that growth has all but stopped in the last two years. Permits to build new houses are down to a few a month, compared with 30 to 40 a month in 1988, according to town figures.
''That's deadly for this town,'' said Daniel Tuba, Monroe's town planner. ''This town relies heavily on the residential property tax base, and without a reasonable annual growth rate in the grand list, the burden becomes that much worse.''
In some areas, the drop-off has translated into fear.
''I'm scared to death,'' said a woman who, with her husband, planned to move this winter into a condominium at Great Oak Farm, a sprawling development of $300,000 homes that was halted in mid-construction last year.
The project is overgrown, weathered and neglected. The couple, who refused to give their names, have spent thousands of dollars to fix up their condominium, even though the overall project remains in doubt. Foreclosure against the developers began this month.
''There is the need for a change, that's for sure,'' said Joseph Dellaquila, a home builder who said he has seen his business dwindle in the last year.
Mr. Dellaquila said he believed that the next governor should bring new businesses into the state and that the best way to do that would be to cut corporate taxes, which are now the highest in the nation at 13.8 percent. But he added that making up the difference through other tax increases, especially a personal income tax, would be ''devastating.''
All three of the major gubernatorial candidates have pledged to try and cut corporate taxes, but none have set a time table. All oppose an income tax for the state, which currently taxes income on only dividends, interest and capital gains, but only Mr. Rowland has vowed to veto an income-tax bill.
Some people said they feared that whatever happens next year may be too late.
 
'You Just Worry'
Larry Easter, a nine-year Monroe resident who works as a mechanic at Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, said he has seen the company cut back its nearly 12,000-member work force by hundreds of employees. ''It's a shame,'' he said. Susan Nikola, who moved here three years ago from nearby Shelton because of the reputation of the Monroe schools, said, ''You see everything being cut and you just worry.'' Mrs. Nikola said she had not thought much yet about the governor's race.
''It can't keep going on the way it is, though,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tradition Falls as Princeton Club Selects First Women in 111 Years

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 27

 BODY:
A 111-year tradition will end on Friday as the Ivy Club, an eating club for Princeton University upperclassmen, admits women for the first time.
After an 11-year legal battle, a Federal judge ruled on Sept. 19 that the Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn, the only other remaining all-male eating club at Princeton, had to admit women when membership decisions were next made. The Tiger Inn will not have a bicker - the weeklong process of interviews and meetings by which some of Princeton's eating clubs select members - until February, but Ivy went ahead and interviewed more than 20 women in this week's bicker. 
Many of the women say they are more concerned about gaining entrance to the Ivy Club for social reasons.
''I'm not making a political statement at all,'' said Marilyn White, an Albany senior majoring in comparative literature. ''It's just the fact that I would like to be in the club. Almost all the women feel the same.''
 
Ruling Is Appealed
Last week's ruling stemmed from an 11-year-old sex-discrimination lawsuit filed against the two clubs and a third, The Cottage Inn by Sally Frank after she unsuccessfully took part in a bicker at the Ivy Club. The Cottage Inn turned coeducational in 1986.
In 1987 the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled that the Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn were in violation of state anti-discrimination laws by refusing to admit women. This July, the State Supreme Court upheld that ruling, and on Sept. 19, Judge John C. Lifland of Federal District Court in Trenton denied a motion by the Ivy Club to stay the court's ruling while the case was being reopened in a Federal court.
''The issue that's at stake for us is an issue of privacy,'' said Blair Haarlow, the president of the Ivy Club and a senior economics major from Hinsdale, Ill. ''According to the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, they deemed us an issue of public accommodation which we don't think we are.''
Ivy and Tiger are continuing their Federal Courtappeal even though their undergraduate members voted last spring to admit women. Both clubs require two consecutive years of votes in favor before enacting an official change in policy.
The Tiger Inn, which decided not to hold a fall bicker this year though it has in the past, has irked some students who feel the club is trying to bide time for the Federal appeal.
Stockton Williams, the Tiger Inn president, said a decision was made last spring not to hold a fall bicker because the club is filled nearly to capacity.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Seeks 25% Reduction In 10-Year Plan

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Squeezed between ambitious plans to build schools, modernize hospitals and improve highways and the fiscal constraints of a faltering economy, Mayor David N. Dinkins has called for a 25 percent cut in the 10-year capital spending plan now being drawn up.
City officials said that projects under way would not be affected, but that plans could be scaled back for repairing bridges and parks, building new jails and rehabilitating housing.
In a recent letter sent to city agency heads as they prepare their 1992-2001 capital strategy, Mayor Dinkins said that the weakness of the local economy, coupled with cuts in Federal and state aid, dictate restraint in deciding the timing and financing of projects. 
A spokesman for the Mayor, Leland T. Jones, said yesterday that specific targets for individual agencies have not been established.
 
Growing Debt Service Costs
In the last few years the city has embarked on an ambitious building plan for its schools, begun rehabilitating thousands of abandoned apartments and stepped up repairs of bridges and highways.
''We must control the proportion of future operating budgets allocated to debt service costs by limiting the size of our capital program,'' the Mayor's letter said. It noted that debt service costs, which are paid for with operating funds, are projected to increase to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 1994, compared with $1.8 billion in fiscal year 1991.
''If you talk about a 25 percent reduction you're talking about an impact on sewage lines, rebuilding schools, modernizing hospitals, a new elephant house at the zoo,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Obviously, some projects will go ahead. We're not going to stop the third water tunnel project or sewer treatment programs. Schools are exceedingly important to the Mayor.''
Projects under way, like expansion at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn and the construction of new jail cells, are expected to continue.
''We will remain active on all fronts,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The question is, how active?''
The new City Charter requires that a preliminary 10-year capital strategy be prepared by Nov. 1, although pending City Council legislation could extend that deadline to Dec. 15. The draft will be subject to a public hearing, with a final plan issued next spring.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about New York City's 10-year capital plan misstated Mayor David N. Dinkins's position on the possibility of cutbacks in spending.
He is considering cuts of about 25 percent; he has not called for them.

HEADLINE: Free Outdoor Fun: Watching Movies Being Made

BYLINE: By ELLEN PALL; Ellen Pall, the author of the novel ''Back East,'' is currently teaching a course in writing about the arts at Fordham University's Lincoln Center campus.

 BODY:
On a quiet evening in Greenwich Village, a hundred or so people stare, fascinated, as a couple leaves a movie theater on Bleecker Street. The couple pauses in the doorway. The man puts his arms around the woman. She smiles at him. They stroll away.
There is a palpable tremor of excitement in the crowd as the couple approaches. Then the two stop, turn around and return to the theater. The onlookers, murmuring furiously, are joined by more passers-by. The couple leaves the theater again, walks away and turns around. And they do it again. And again. And the crowd keep watching.
As the whisky-sodden gangsters in ''Miller's Crossing'' would say: What's the rumpus? Well, these spectators may have stumbled onto the best bargain entertainment in New York City: location shooting - in this case, for ''The Prince of Tides,'' a movie based on Pat Conroy's 1986 best-selling novel. The couple that mesmerizes them is Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte. 
New Yorkers may enjoy pretending to be unaffected by celebrities, but there are still plenty of them out there willing to wait an hour or two or three on a Friday or Saturday night - arms full of packages, briefcases in hand - for the chance to gaze at a movie star: especially one as elusive as Ms. Streisand, who is also directing ''Tides.'' Even for the most jaded Manhattanites, there's a strange satisfaction in seeing a star's face assume human proportions (and, if it is a glamorous face, display human flaws). For out-of-towners - and there were many this night on Bleecker Street - glimpsing a star up close may be a cherished souvenir long after the Big Apple ashtrays are broken. And it's free. Movie locations are also a chance to see how a film is made - or, at least, to witness an hour or two of the largely incomprehensible conferences and adjustments and delays of people trying to shoot a tiny fragment of one.
 
Patient Spectators
Ted Churchill, a Steadicam operator on ''The Prince of Tides'' - a romantic drama about a Southern football coach and a New York psychiatrist - has worked on many movies in New York, including ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' which finished shooting here in June. He said he was often amazed by the patience of the spectators. ''They're interested in the process,'' he said. ''It doesn't seem to frustrate them that there's no way to tell that, because everything goes so slowly.''
Once a crowd gathers at a movie location, though, a distinctly sociable atmosphere develops. ''A cocktail party without the alcohol,'' as Mr. Churchill describes it.
When the ''Tides'' crew took over a block of Bleecker Street recently, two young men - an Australian and a Welshman - fell deep into conversation with a New York woman. Later they all went out for a drink. A California woman, overhearing three West German tourists, guessed their hometown from their accent and eventually invited the students - two women and a man - to stay with her when they reached the West Coast.
There was even a certain amount of outright propositioning. ''Here I am, you lucky stiff!'' a woman in a car rolling past the set called to Mr. Nolte between takes. The car moved on before the actor (if he intended to) could answer.
Given the distractions crowds can create, many film makers pray their location shooting will escape the public's attention. ''The last thing I want is anybody knowing where I'm filming,'' said Richard Brick, the producer of a low-budget film called ''Hangin' Out With the Homeboys,'' which involved location work in the South Bronx. ''It leads to costs, delays, sound problems. We're slinking around, trying to be unnoticed.''
 
Sometimes Old Hat
But if some productions want to avoid members of the public, the feeling is often extremely mutual - especially in neighborhoods where film crews seem to be present more often than not. The two-block stretch along Prince Street between Sullivan Street and West Broadway in SoHo, for example, could almost qualify as a multiplex. In the past five weeks, ''The Prince of Tides,'' ''What About Bob?'' (a movie with Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss) and ''The Godfather Part III'' have used the area as a backdrop.
Even when asked to do no more than walk on the opposite side of the street, residents of photogenic neighborhoods are often less than delighted. The crew members who have most to do with the public are called Production Assistants, or P.A.'s. They stand at the edges of locations and keep passers-by from inadvertently wandering into a shot. It's their job, too, to see that spectators observe film-location etiquette: keep back from the set and be quiet when the cameras are rolling.
New Yorkers might be more cheerful about the inconveniences caused by trailer-jammed streets and megawatt lights shining in their windows at night if they knew location shooting brought more than $2 billion into the city last year. According to the Mayor's Office on Film, Theater and Broadcasting, 110 feature films and 314 television series and specials were at least partly shot here in 1989. Outside the city, location shooting generated an additional $69.5 million for the state. In New Jersey, 354 film and video projects added $24.8 million to the economy. Connecticut trailed in the three-state region with a 1989 income of about $13 million from location shooting last year.
On the other side of the cameras, a day of shooting a major feature film in New York costs about $100,000 - more at night or on weekends. Expenses include the salaries of 75 or so crew members, equipment rental, vehicle rental and the location site rental. For all of that, three minutes of usable film is considered a good day's work.
 
Expensive, but Still Exciting
Yet film makers keep coming back. ''The traffic is murder and it's very expensive,'' said Ted Zachary, executive producer of ''Another You,'' a comedy with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder now filming around the city. ''But the crews are terrific, and it's still the most exciting city in which to make movies.''
Don Scardino, the director and producer of ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' a half-hour series on the Lifetime cable channel, agrees: ''What you get in New York is a detail and a character of the city you can't get in Toronto, you can't get in L.A.''
Among those who linger to watch, most are satisfied with a glimpse of the celebrities on a set. But some feel the need to make their presence known. For the last month, Spike Lee has been shooting his new movie, ''Jungle Fever,'' an inter-racial love story, around New York. (The filming has not gone entirely smoothly: two weeks ago, a store Mr. Lee had rented for the project was vandalized; the police, who say they suspect the incident may have been racially motivated, are still investigating.) Huge crowds have gathered to watch Mr. Lee work, especially in Harlem, and scores of people have tried to funnel notes to the director through his P.A.'s. Sometimes they offer screenplays or audiotapes. Mr. Lee's P.A.'s don't accept notes, however; instead, they give out the director's office address. On ''The Prince of Tides'' set, dozens of onlookers have sent flowers to Ms. Streisand. One offered a yarmulke.
 
Mingling With the Crowd
Even better than sending a message, of course, is meeting a celebrity in person. Mr. Lee is reputed to mingle freely with the public when he has time. But waiting for the right moment can take patience. A few weeks ago, Jacqulyn Frasier (who lives near one of ''Jungle Fever's'' main locations) spent both her days off waiting from 7 A.M. until 5 P.M. to meet Mr. Lee. She says she didn't mind.
''People think he's not a brother because he doesn't have time to give his autograph,'' she explained. ''He is a brother. He's just working.''
For many who stop to watch Mr. Lee direct, of course, seeing him is more than just a chance to brush up against fame: it's an opportunity to feel closer to a man who has managed to raise issues of passionate concern to a wide array of people.
''It's good because he's young, he's black, and we need a black perspective,'' said Pam Decuir, who stood on Lenox Avenue watching the ''Jungle Fever'' crew walk in and out of Sylvia's Restaurant, where Mr. Lee, Wesley Snipes, Annabella Sciorra and the rap artist Queen Latifah were shooting an interior scene recently.
 
From Passer-by to Performer
The ultimate thrill for a spectator on location, surely, is to be drafted into the production. And it can happen. Yaacov Piates, a young man watching ''The Prince of Tides'' filming, said that a few months ago he was asked by a crew member to wear a waiter's white jacket and sell a slice of pizza to Al Pacino in ''The Godfather Part III,'' then shooting in Little Italy. And Steven Smalls, after doggedly following ''Jungle Fever'' from set to set for weeks, finally got his wish and was cast as an extra in a vast crowd scene. Is he an actor? ''Yes,'' Mr. Smalls, a television cable installer before entering show business, answered happily. ''Now I am.''

Southeast Asia and India
The most important New York auctions of Southeast Asian and Indian art in many years are to take place next week at Sotheby's and Christie's. Both houses report that the market for such Oriental objects came alive again in London and New York in recent seasons. And after Sotheby's announced in July that it would auction the bulk of what remains in the Pan-Asian collection owned by Robert Ellsworth, a New York dealer, on Oct. 5, other major properties were acquired by both houses for these sales.
When asked this week how Sotheby's expects its two-day sale to do in this economic climate, Carlton C. Rochell Jr., a specialist in this type of art, said: ''A lot of people are asking this question, especially consignors. I am hoping the quality works will sell well. I don't think the best works will be affected.'' 
The Ellsworth holdings - 137 stone and bronze sculptures of the second to 16th centuries - are to be auctioned at 2 P.M. next Friday. This collection of Asian art was formed from the 1950's through the 70's, with Mr. Ellsworth's advice, by the New York financier Christian Humann. After Mr. Humann's death in 1981, Mr. Ellsworth bought the collection of about 1,600 paintings and objects for about $12 million.
He sold many works to museums and collectors. Widespread interest in works from the collection stems in part from the fact that the Humann holdings were exhibited and catalogued, which made the collection immune to claims from the countries of origin that the artworks had been smuggled.
''It was all recorded in museums in the United States by 1972,'' Mr. Ellsworth said, citing the date when the statute protecting archeological sites internationally under the Unesco convention was enacted by Congress.
The works commanding the most interest include a ninth-century red sandstone figure of a voluptuous river goddess, which is estimated to bring $250,000 to $350,000; a dancing study of the elephant-headed god Ganesha from the 10th or 11th century ($80,000 to $100,000); a 13th-century seductive celestial nymph ($60,000 to $90,000); an imposing 12th-century sandstone Khmer Vishnu ($200,000 to $250,000), and a beautifully modeled south Indian bronze of a Bodhishattva from the 12th or 13th century (150,000 to $200,000).
Sotheby's sale is to continue at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Oct. 6, with the auction of sculpture from other owners, including a life-size 12th- or 13th-century figure of a divinity from the estate of Richard B. Gump, the San Francisco retailer, who died a year ago. The presale estimate is $60,000 to $90,000.
The sale at Christie's, to be held at 2 P.M. on Wednesday, is the first of Indian paintings and Southeast Asian sculpture at the New York house in eight years.
''The demand for Indian art is slowly expanding,'' said Caroline Blyth, one of Christie's London specialists in Asian art, who helped organize the sale here. ''There is a very strong market in London, and at Sotheby's recent New York sales, prices were improving.''
Among the Indian paintings at Christie's is a previously unrecorded 16th-century Mughal depiction of men battling a sea monster in the Indian Ocean. The whereabouts of this illustration from the book ''Dastan-i-Amir Hamza'' was unknown until the owner submitted a photograph to Christie's in April.
''I knew instantly what it was,'' Ms. Blyth said. ''I took the next plane to Europe to see it in person.'' She said the owner had no idea of the importance of the illustration, which Christie's estimates will bring $150,000 to $250,000.
Outstanding among the bronzes at Christie's is a rare 11th-century figure of two deities - Siva embracing Parvati - standing on a lotus leaf, formerly in the collection of John D. Rockefeller 3d. The 17-inch-tall Chola dynasty sculpture, carried in salvation processions, is ''one of only four or five known works of two such figures in public or private collections in this country,'' Ms. Blyth said.
The presale estimate for this sculpture, being sold by Senator John D. Rockfeller 4th of West Virginia, who inherited it, and his wife, Sharon, is $150,000 to $200,000.
 
Garbo Writes
Twelve letters and a cablegram identified as handwritten by Greta Garbo to the photographer Cecil Beaton are to be auctioned on Nov. 7 by R. M. Smythe & Company of New York at the Dorset Hotel, 30 West 54th Street. Wilmer S. Roberts, a vice president of Smythe, said the anonymous owner of the letters said they were a gift in 1977 from Mr. Beaton, who insisted they not be disposed of until after he and Garbo died.
Only four letters bear dates, from 1946 to 1965, and only seven are signed or initialed with variations of Garbo's pseudonym, Harriet Brown - as Harriet, Harry, H or G. The letters express affection, irritation and, in one case, a threat: ''If you publish more than one permitted photograph, I shall not forgive you.''
The presale estimates range from $1,200 to $3,000 each.
 
SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street (606-7245). Viewing hours for the Pan-Asian collection of Indian and Southeast Asian art: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow; 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Wednesday; 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. on Thursday. From other owners: as above through Wednesday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Thursday; 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. next Friday.

Ray Parker's Piece of the Abstract Puzzle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON

 BODY:
Ray Parker had talent. His high-pitched, low-key abstract paintings are pleasurable and occasionally eye-opening. He was daring in his color, inventive (although not always successful) in his experiments with line, and capable of easy and expansive surfaces that surely bear the memory of the big spaces of South Dakota, where he was born.
But Parker also underlines the problems facing revisionist art historians whose mission is to make room within art history for artists who have been pushed aside or left out of it. He did not have the force of vision, imagination or personality of a great artist. He deserves a place in the history of American abstraction, particularly in the postwar American effort to reconcile the open-endedness and sweep of Abstract Expressionism with the refined lyricism of Matisse, but it is a modest place - and it is not so easy to define what that place is. 
The mini-retrospective now at Hunter College was planned to commemorate Parker's retirement in 1989 from Hunter, where he had taught for more than 30 years. However, he died in April at the age of 67, and the exhibition became a memorial. The curator is William C. Agee, the noted scholar of American art, who teaches at Hunter. He was assisted by four Hunter students: Douglas Canfield, Michael Rubenstein, and Kate and Caroline Parker, the artist's daughters. The 18 paintings date from 1955 to 1990; there is no trace of the pre-New York years. In the earliest painting, in oil, Parker, like many other painters in New York City in the 1950's, began to pull apart the Cubist grid by enlarging individual sections and turning them into irregularly shaped blocks of color. In an acrylic painting from 1977, he squeezed lines directly from the tube onto a monochromatic ground in a way that predicts the recent webs of Brice Marden. There are lyrical paintings from the 1980's in which colors billow and slide and remain entirely at peace with the colors around them, no matter how different.
In one economical painting, from 1962, a big red vertical brushstroke is suspended and flattened on an off-white ground, an emblem of expressionism that has become an icon and a specimen. In a more elaborate painting, from 1984, two large, boulderlike red forms rest weightless on a blackish horizon with a two-toned blue sky leaning against them or touching them as gently as silk. Here the color, shape and line play with and against one another in a way that eventually negates any impression of pictorial unity.
Parker comes out of modernism. Like Stuart Davis and many other American painters, he loved jazz (he played trumpet) and had faith that an improvisational, musical approach to painting could provide a viable alternative to traditional composition. (Isn't it about time this pictorial faith in jazz is both fully acknowledged and seriously questioned?) He loved Matisse, whose book ''Jazz'' was published in 1947, and continued to be inspired by Matisse's approach to color and shape. Parker's relationship to the Abstract Expressionists was essential. His work has obvious similarities to the paintings of Robert Motherwell and less obvious similarities to the work of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. Parker shared the Abstract Expressionist belief in painting as possibility and freedom.
But Parker was not an Abstract Expressionist. His ambition was not heroic. There are almost no signs of struggle, heaviness and brooding in his work. There is no metaphysical longing. Parker was a formalist in his belief that the medium of painting could determine its message.
One reason his work is not fuller is that color and shape can be sufficient in themselves only with an artist of the rarest touch and imagination. Another reason is a conflict within the work. On the one hand, Parker wanted a painting to be a place in which everything fit together. On the other hand, he made paintings in which the pieces of the pictorial puzzle move in so many directions that there cannot be a seamless fit. The work in this show swings between classicism and anti-classicism. It does not come down on one side; unlike the work of an Abstract Expressionist like de Kooning, for example, it is not both together. The paintings of Ray Parker remain at the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery in the Hunter West Building, on 68th Street at Lexington Avenue, and on the 11th floor of the Hunter North Building, across 68th Street, through Oct. 26.
 
'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein (1910 to 1983)'
Edward Thorp Gallery
103 Prince Street
Through Oct. 13
Was Eugene Von Bruenchenhein really born or was he invented by the romantic imagination? He was a self-taught painter who worked most of his life in a flower shop and then in a bakery, painting passionately whenever he had time, as well as making sculptures (sometimes with chicken bones), writing clipped metaphysical poetry, studying botany and astronomy, and developing quack theories about the origins of life.
When he died in 1983, every nook and cranny of his shacklike house on the outskirts of Milwaukee was stuffed with art; his wife, Marie, had almost no money, and this obsessed, possessed, diminutive artist (too short for the Army), who had warned against the dangers of fame, was unknown.
The Edward Thorp Gallery, ever on the lookout for eccentric visionaries who are true painters, has brought 37 paintings and photographs by Von Bruenchenhein to New York. Most are from 1957 to 1960. This is definitely not art about art. Everything in the work seems to evolve from natural history. Where there are human images, as in paintings inspired by the explosion of the hydrogen bomb in 1954, they are generated by clouds. The mythical creatures looming and hovering within the paintings resemble flowers and plants. This was an artist for whom the National Geographic was a good deal more important than Symbolism or Surrealism.
The bottom line is that Von Bruenchenhein was a good painter. He often applied pigment directly to the surface and then painted with his fingers. He also drew shapes with sticks, cardboard, leaves and combs. His paintings were usually made in a single session or bout, which helps explain their freshness. Von Bruenchenhein had a good idea how to create space, sometimes making the backgrounds seem vast and distant and then pulling the imagery into the foreground plane so that the plant or insect forms seem to erupt. Von Bruenchenhein rarely overplayed his hand. Precision and intuition balance each other. The painting is not finicky.
More than half the works in the show are photographs of Marie. Von Bruenchenhein clearly loved her, and his photographs have an odd combination of voyeurism and purity. He photographed her as his muse, his Eve, his queen, his wide-eyed innocent, his pinup girl, his temptress. He saw her in the same way he saw the universe he painted - as seductive, forbidden, innocent, lovely, overflowing with desire and wonder too great for him, too great for the world.
 
Anish Kapoor
Barbara Gladstone Gallery
99 Greene Street
Through Oct. 6
This fine show of 21 works on paper, from 1987 to the present, is likely to increase the public of the sculptor Anish Kapoor. Although the works are abstract, many suggest nature - plants, or the sun or moon. There is a feeling for the single shape, for its relationship to space, and for the power of light, even in darkness. Throughout the works, there is faith in materials and an attempt to use pigment, ink and paper to arrive at a sensation that is intoxicating and fearsome. The works are economical in form only. A black oval spits white. A black rectangle, like a modernist square, has lines coming out of it like snakes out of Medusa's head. Particularly in the circles and ovals, there is a sense of something unpredictable and irrepressible about to happen.
 
Nick Ghiz
Penine Hart Gallery
568 Broadway (at Prince Street)
Through tomorrow
This is Nick Ghiz's most distilled and pointed show. It consists entirely of wall sculptures, assembled, as always, with found objects: everything here was once part of a chair. They leave no doubt about his ability to make sculpture that activates space through controlled surfaces and through lines that are supple and sure. The titles (like ''Ninevah,'' ''Ozymandias'' and ''Isaurian'') come out of history, literature and myth. In ''Tarquinia,'' it is easy to see in the movement of the sculptural line the memory of bulls' horns and dancing arabesques in Etruscan tombs. Take a look at the way Mr. Ghiz uses light: in ''Maschera,'' the light falling on a black wood chair back, which seems to have just split in the middle, produces shadows like wings around the mask.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
After Eight Years, the Bear Is Back

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
At first, as the stock market tumbled in early August, the denizens of Wall Street talked of ''an air pocket'' or ''a correction,'' reminding one another that the market had quickly recovered after even sharper declines in 1987 and 1989.
But the reality seems to be setting in: After a greedy, giddy, eight-year bull market, the bear is back.
And unlike the short-lived market drops in 1987 and 1989, this market downturn is likely to last long enough to be felt as much on Main Street as on Wall Street, economists say. ''I think this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. ''And from a Main Street standpoint, a bear market hurts, because of the loss in wealth that it causes.'' 
In the vernacular of the investing world, a bear market is one in which stock prices shuffle downward, more or less steadily, for a sustained period. There is no universally accepted rule about how long a downtrend must persist to qualify as a bear market. Like the recessions that often accompany them, bear markets are usually acknowledged well after they have actually begun. And with the Dow Jones industrial average down 19 percent since July, to its lowest level in 16 months, all but the most stalwart Wall Street optimists seem to be bracing for a prolonged bear market.
For the millions of people too young to remember the bear's last visit to Wall Street - from 1980 through the end of August 1982 - this is a whole new world. Bear markets are characterized by pain - and not only for those who raise money and invest on Wall Street. A prolonged bear market darkens the national outlook. People spend less and invest more cautiously, altering how much money is available for corporate expansion, what kinds of companies can prosper, how many new jobs are created and which are eliminated. ''This is not a Wall Street phenomenon,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It is an economic phenomenon.'' Of course, the bear market is already changing the daily business of Wall Street, shrinking revenues and putting new and sometimes unfamiliar demands on a brokerage industry that has been pulling in its belt since the 1987 crash.
For the millions of Americans who have a stake in the stock market through their profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans and other retirement savings accounts, the first jolt of bear-market pain will come a few months from now, when they get the final tally of their portfolios' performance this year.
''For many of those people, this will be the first time in nine years that they will have lost money,'' said Michael F. Wilcox, a principal with the Wall Street firm of Morgan Stanley & Company. While the Dow took a negative dip in 1984, most broader market barometers like the Standard & Poor's Composite Index were positive that year.
Not that the last three years on Wall Street have been placid. The frenzied declines of Oct. 19, 1987, and Oct. 13, 1989, prompted widespread concern about the stability and strength of America's markets, and led to a host of legal and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing the volatility that produced such precipitous drops.
But the value of America's stock market at the end of each of those years was greater than it had been when the year opened, and those who had invested broadly in the market without panicking had prospered.
This time, barring a remarkable rebound, people who invested in the stock market will have less money on New Year's Eve 1990 than they had last January.
When that fact hits home, it may intensify the stampede of selling, Mr. Wilcox warned. While many professional investors see a bear market as a vast bargain basement where good stocks can be bought cheaply, he said, ''It is far more likely that most people will say: 'Hey, I got burned on stocks. I'm not going to do that again.' The odds are, they will sell just when they ought to buy.''
And when a bear market is accompanied by faltering economic health and international turmoil, as it is now, investors are even more likely to shun stocks, opting for the safety of Treasury bills or gold, deepening the downward spiral.
Changes in investor preference can have far-reaching effects. For one, they alter the value of the stock that public companies use to reward top executives and compensate their rank and file, giving the rare company that is favored on Wall Street in a bear market an edge in attracting and holding good management. The low stock prices of companies that are out of favor may make them vulnerable to a takeover and they may have more difficulty raising money for expansion and acquisitions.
In a bull market, the companies at risk are typically the weakest and worst managed; in a bear market, the rules of Darwin are suspended and almost any company can become easy prey because of its depressed stock price.
Consumers, too, tend to behave differently in a recession-based bear market like this one. ''Simply put,' Mr. Levy said, ''the stock market decline reduces household financial wealth, which has a negative impact on consumers' propensity to spend.''
Of course, some sophisticated investors make money by selling stock in a declining market. They do so by employing a strategy known as short-selling. Short-sellers borrow shares of stock and sell them, betting that the price of the stock will decline before they have to buy new shares to replace the borrowed ones. The difference between the original selling price and the reduced price of the replacement shares is the short-seller's profit.
But selling goes against the grain of Wall Street, said Jack Sullivan, a money manager at Van Kasper & Company in San Francisco who frequently uses short sales as part of his strategy. ''Most of the investment community is structured to buy stocks, not to sell them,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''That's why pension funds exist and mutual funds exist and bank trust departments exist - to buy stock.''
Like most individual investors, big institutional investors - pension funds and insurance companies, for instance - are often inexperienced short-sellers either because their rules do not permit it or because the long bull market has given them little reason to use the strategy.
While Mr. Sullivan thinks that more institutional investors will embrace the technique, he said, ''Right now, the institutional deck is stacked in favor of buying stocks, not selling them.''
This lack of experience is likely to mean that the earning power of the nation's endowment funds, pension funds and other pools of communal capital will suffer during a long bear market, meaning that those who rely on that capital - from pensioners to universities - will have less available money.
In any case, because of the risks inherent in short-selling, where losses can rise to stunning levels with any unanticipated gain in stock prices, it is unsuitable for all but the most sophisticated investors, market specialists say, reinforcing the notion that the stock market - despite its historic track record of producing inflation-beating wealth for patient individuals - is a game for the experts.
When a rising stock price is no longer a sure bet, sophisticated investors typically focus on classic measures of corporate health and value. They want to know that the size and terms of a company's debt are manageable, and that enough money is available to pay interest. They look for companies whose stocks are modestly priced, compared with their earnings, whose dividend is generous and reliable, and whose credit is good.
Companies that do well by such measures tend to be older, well-established concerns, rather than ambitious start-ups.
In bear markets, investors also have greater demands for information, which has become scarcer in recent years because of the widespread reductions in the number of Wall Street research analysts.
Those Wall Street analysts who remain employed must now adapt to bear-market pressures. That means they can no longer simply recommend good stocks but must also identify stocks to sell - a move they have traditionally been reluctant to make. Corporate executives have been known to jerk their investment banking business away from a brokerage house whose analysts are unenthusiastic about its shares.
Already, all across Wall Street, executives are beginning to talk of the need to do ''more hand-holding'' in the months ahead. ''In these times,'' one portfolio manager said carefully, ''even a well-structured, defensive portfolio has a more worried and concerned owner.'' Are young retail brokers, caught in their first bear market, up to this new task? One enterprising investment consulting firm, the Selbst Group of White Plains, sees room for improvement. It has recently trumpeted the introduction of a ''kinder, gentler sales methodology'' for brokers. Its training regimen instructs brokers to toss out the ''old hard-sell concepts'' and shows them ''how to become empathetic listeners.''
Just as economists bicker over the definition of a recession, not everyone on Wall Street is convinced that the events of the last two months qualify as a genuine bear market. Mr. Sullivan of Van Kasper thinks such quibbles are silly. ''I hardly think the label matters,'' he said. ''If people don't spend, if companies don't commit to capital expenditures, if banks don't lend and if the sickening sense begins to take hold that debt is nobody's friend anymore - it doesn't matter what you call it, it's a problem.''
And it is a problem that will last until the last glimmer of optimism has been quenched, warns Mr. Wilcox at Morgan Stanley. ''The end of the bear market comes when people are at their most pessimistic,'' he said. ''That's when things can start to get better.''

HEADLINE: Deposit Fund Condition Is Worsening

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The condition of the fund that insures deposits at banks appeared to be worsening, as regulators today revised their estimates of its losses for the year by 50 percent, to more than $3 billion.
In a report on the Bank Insurance Fund's midyear performance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said the fund had already experienced losses of $1.8 billion for the first six months of the year from 103 bank failures. For the last few weeks, the agency had been estimating that the total annual decline in the insurance fund would be about $2 billion.
 
Economic Trends Reflected
But today L. William Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., said the estimates were revised to reflect the softening of real estate markets in many areas of the country and the growing problems in the loan portfolios at a number of large institutions. 
In a pointed example of the financial strains in the industry, especially in the Northeast, the Bank of Boston Corporation, the largest banking company in New England, today announced it was trimming its work force and lowering its dividend. Its action came just a week after the Chase Manhattan Corporation took similar steps. [Page D6.] Regulators were quick to point out today in discussing the bank insurance fund that while it was reaching a precariously low level and could be wiped out by the collapse of one or a few large institutions, the situation did not pose an immediate crisis. As of June 30, the fund totaled $11.4 billion, down from $13.2 billion at the beginning of the year.
''I don't think it's a question of crisis and panic,'' Mr. Seidman said in an impromptu discussion with reporters in a hallway outside where he had just presented the report to a House Banking subcommittee. ''It's a sign of increased stress.''
Only seven months ago, Mr. Seidman told Congress that the fund would probably break even this year. $1.25 Per $100 Considered Safe If the F.D.I.C. forecast for the rest of the year is borne out, the ratio of insurance to bank deposits, already at its lowest level in the fund's 57-year-history, at about 70 cents to every $100 in deposits, will fall to about 50 cents to $100 of deposits by December. The lowest level considered safe by regulators is $1.25 per $100 in deposits.
The report was issued this morning as the F.D.I.C. board approved a proposal submitted last month to raise the premiums that banks are assessed for the insurance fund to the maximum amount permitted under the law. The board's action means that in January, premiums will rise by 30 percent over a previously scheduled increase, to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits.
The premiums are now at 12 cents for every $100 in deposits and had originally been scheduled to rise to 15 cents. Last year, banks paid 8.3 cents for every $100 in deposits. $1.2 Billion Drop by December Based on an examination of the 1,034 ''problem banks'' that are among the most likely candidates to fail, the agency estimated that the insurance fund will decline by at least another $1.2 billion by Dec. 31. It has posted losses since 1987, when it was at $18.3 billion.
With declining earnings at many of the nation's leading banks, analysts and industry officials expect that the premium increases will be passed on to bank customers. Depositors will probably see a drop in interest paid on their accounts, while borrowers will likely see an increase in interest and other charges to help the banks pay for the higher premium.
Mr. Seidman said that while some of the difference would be passed on to customers, all of it probably would not. The F.D.I.C. estimated that if it was all eventually paid by bank customers, the annual return on a $10,000 deposit would decline by $4.50.
 
Higher Premiums Expected
There is also a strong view in Washington that the latest estimates, combined with Congressional action that is expected soon to eliminate the limits that prevent further increases, could result in yet another rise in the premiums soon. A measure removing the caps has already passed the House, and similar proposals are in the Senate and have been suggested by the Bush Administration.
''This will be bad news to bankers, but they must begin to put this in their contingency plans,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, the executive director of the Independent Bankers Association, a trade group of smaller institutions.
Mr. Seidman said that once the limits on premiums were lifted, the agency would review the effect of a further increase in bank premiums on the solvency of institutions.

Oil Shock's Blow To Rich and Poor

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THIS year's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have been dominated by worries about the crisis in the Persian Gulf, the soaring price of oil and its threat to the world economy.
''Unless quickly resolved,'' said Barber B. Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, the gulf crisis ''will have a serious effect on the world's poor and on developing countries.''
More than two million foreign workers were in Iraq and Kuwait when the crisis broke; with the exodus of about half a million workers, foreign remittances to developing countries have fallen, together with their exports. And their import bills have soared because of rising oil prices. To cover emergency needs, Mr. Conable said, the World Bank would ''mobilize additional resources'' and ''coordinate closely with the I.M.F. and others.'' 
Without waiting for World Bank or I.M.F. emergency actions, the United States hastened to raise additional aid for the ''front-line states,'' which it defined as Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.
There are many other countries hit by the oil shock and the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq and conquered Kuwait. The United States, after getting commitments of about $20 billion to support the front-line states and its own military operations, insists that the other needy countries also be helped. During the annual meetings here, President Bush set up a steering committee of 17 donor countries to decide how emergency aid should be distributed.
There will surely not be enough to go around. The East European countries, struggling to make the transition from Communism to market economies, are pleading for help, but are unlikely to get it from the I.M.F. or World Bank - and they can scarcely look to Moscow anymore.
Some I.M.F. and World Bank officials say the United States initiative will ''act as a brake'' on contributions to developing countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philippines. But American officials insist they are not forgetting those hard-hit countries. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady urged the World Bank to make immediate grants and loans to many of them and called on the I.M.F. to disburse money more quickly from its Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility.
Unlike what happened during the oil shocks of the 1970's, this time the private commercial banks, many of which are in deep trouble, short of capital, with weak loan portfolios, are not going to do much of the ''recycling of petrodollars'' from rich oil exporters to poor oil importers - which brought on the world debt crisis.
Yet it is unlikely that governments will come up with enough money to cover the hundreds of billions of dollars in transfers from oil-importing to oil-exporting countries, if the price of oil should stay close to its present price of nearly $40 a barrel or climbs still higher. Even the richest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, heavily increasing its aid and putting up a lot more money for weapons, has begun to complain of a ''negative cash flow.''
It is not just the poor who are in trouble. The skyrocketing oil price has intensified worries in the industrial world about both inflation and recession. But except for the United States, all the other industrial countries insist that inflation should be the main target.
Secretary Brady, while soft-pedaling the Treasury's criticism of the Federal Reserve for being too tight, said that both inflation and recession must be opposed. The communique of the Group of Seven industrial countries called for a ''stability oriented'' monetary policy, a euphemism for an anti-inflationary policy that the United States Treasury could regard as a term covering both an anti-inflationary and anti-recessionary policy (or, as a member of Congress once put it, against inflation, against deflation, for flation).
But the common view of the central bankers is that monetary policy cannot be used to fight inflation and recession simultaneously. The best that can be done, they say, is to aim for a reasonable growth rate of ''nominal'' gross national product, allowing the market to determine the split of nominal G.N.P. between real output and inflation. Characteristically, Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German central bank, said the Bundesbank would not relax its strict anti-inflationary stance, even to ease unification with East Germany.
If Alan Greenspan is looking for international reinforcement for continuing the Fed's cautious anti-inflationary policy, he certainly got it from this meeting of the I.M.F. and World Bank. But the Treasury is not giving up its position that lower interest rates are essential for staving off a more serious recession, reducing the Federal deficit and avoiding a possible catastrophe to financial institutions. And given the softness of the economy, it hopes to bring rates down without increasing inflation. Thus, in the midst of the gulf crisis, the quiet war between the Fed and the Treasury continues.

HEADLINE: Temporary Davis Bid For UAL

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The long and tumultuous struggle for control of UAL Inc. took a new and surprising turn today when Marvin Davis, the Los Angeles-based billionaire, said he would buy the airline temporarily, then turn it over in two years to the employee group that is attempting a buyout of the carrier.
In a letter to Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler Corporation executive who is leading the employee buyout effort, Mr. Davis said his idea was to provide the employees with, in effect, two years' worth of breathing room during which time they could line up financing for their own $201-a-share, $4 billion offer for the airline. UAL's board has already accepted that offer, but Wall Street has doubted the employee group's ability to line up financing for the bid.
At the end of the two-year period, Mr. Davis wrote, the employees would have the right to buy back UAL from Mr. Davis at a price that would allow him to earn an adequate return on his investment. 
''Basically, Davis sees an opportunity not only to make money for himself but to facilitate the employees' efforts,'' one person familiar with the situation said late today.
Other than to say that he and his partners would bring $750 million in equity to the deal, Mr. Davis failed to disclose the price he would pay to acquire UAL, making it unclear whether the board would even be amenable to a Davis offer. But any offer from Mr. Davis would probably at least have to match the employees' offer of $201 a share.
The Davis proposal, which follows his $275-a-share bid for the airline proposed slightly more than a year ago, could send UAL's stock soaring. Wall Street's skepticism about the ability of the employees to finance their bid has caused UAL's stock to sag in recent weeks. UAL's stock closed down today at $90.625, off $1.375, in Big Board trading.
Indeed, because the UAL board had given the employee group only until Oct. 9 to obtain financing, the consensus in the investment community was that a takeover of the airline was virtually impossible at this point.
But the Davis offer today changes the calculus of the situation entirely. To use his words, Mr. Davis is proposing to ''bridge the acquisition of United for its labor and employee groups for a period of two years.''
James Fingeroth, Mr. Davis's spokesman at Kekst & Company, the New York-based public relations firm, had no further comment. Peter Rosenthal, the public-relations man for the employee buyout group, also had no comment other than to say that the employee group had received the Davis letter and was reviewing it.
But in his letter, which was sent to the press, Mr. Davis did provide some details of his plan. Specifically, he said that if his plan had the employees' support he would commence negotiations immediately with the UAL board with an eye toward acquiring the company at a price that is prudent ''in the present environment.''
According to people close to the situation, Mr. Davis was referring to the sluggish economy and to the higher fuel costs that all airlines have been forced to pay of late. It thus appeared that Mr. Davis would try to persuade the UAL board to accept an offer lower than $201 a share. That offer was made well before the price of oil began to rise.
Mr. Davis said that if his proposal could be consummated, the employees would be given an immediate 20 percent ownership in UAL in exchange for labor concessions of equal worth. They would also be given minority representation on the new UAL board proportionate to their 20 percent interest in the company.
UAL has been consumed by takeover activity, both real and rumored, since 1987. It first received an offer from the pilots' union, which was followed by Mr. Davis's first offer. Since then, thecompany has received two offers from broader employee groups, including the one now pending.

HEADLINE: Bush's Move on Stockpile Brings Some Dissent Overseas

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The world's leading industrial nations will hold a crucial meeting on Friday to consider an American proposal that strategic oil reserves be prepared for immediate use. But a group of oil-consuming countries, led by West Germany and Japan, are opposed to the American initiative, arguing that reserve stocks should be tapped only in an extreme case, like the outbreak of war.
The meeting, under the auspices of the 21-member International Energy Agency, based in Paris, may well be one of the most important gatherings since the little-known organization was conceived in 1973 to shield Western economies from oil-price shocks. 
The debate will involve the best ways to use the estimated 1.7 billion barrels of oil held as reserves by governments and oil companies in the agency's member nations. The United States has given an early signal of the course it favors, announcing on Wednesday that it would sell five million barrels from its strategic reserves.
 
Trying to Influence the Market
''What we want to do is give a signal to world oil markets,'' a senior American energy official said.
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, however, said in Washington today that tapping the reserve was merely a test of the system, not an attempt to rein in prices.
Still, President Bush's decision to tap the reserve was seen here as a strong signal that the United States wants similar actions from other nations. But West Germany's Economics Minister, Helmut Haussman, said today that his country was not in favor of such a move, arguing that there is no world oil shortage and that ''it is wrong to think it is possible to keep prices artificially low through state measures.''
West Germany and Japan are the two other countries that have enormous oil stockpiles, and the United States' action has put both nations under pressure to come up with alternative strateegies. The United States, Germany and Japan hold nearly a billion barrels in government reserves, and oil companies in the three nations hold several hundred million more.
''Western governments never had the option of recourse to strategic stocks because the reserves did not exist during previous crises,'' said Simon Blakey, a former official of the agency who is an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.
Friday's meeting here will be attended by senior energy officials from all 21 members. Even though the headquarters are here, France is not a member of the agency but it has now applied to join, strengthening the consuming nations' hopes of presenting a solid front in the crisis.
 
Output Below Expectations
The meeting comes amid increasing evidence that crucial OPEC oil exporters, like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates, have not been able to raise production fast enough or high enough to make up fully for the shortfall from Kuwait and Iraq, estimated at more than four million barrels a day.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not been able to produce more than an additional 2.5 million barrels a day but world oil markets expected their combined extra output to be about three million barrels a day, Arab oil industry executives said today. Venezuela has increased output by 500,000 barrels a day.
Some analysts suggested that by dipping into its reserves, the United States was also telling its allies that it foresees serious shortages in the coming months because of the strong likelihood of war with Iraq and the rising cold-weather demand for heating oil.

HEADLINE: Bank of Boston Is Planning To Cut Jobs and Dividend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston Corporation announced cuts in its stock dividend and work force yesterday in the face of a deteriorating economy and a loss of $200 million to $250 million in its present quarter.
The announcement by the largest banking company in New England was a reminder that the nearly two-year-old slide in the regional economy and real estate markets continued unabated, causing loan defaults and heavy losses at banks. With bank profits falling, and in many cases turning into losses, bank stock prices fell sharply yesterday as many analysts became more concerned that banks will cut their stock dividends. 
''Banks are being buffeted from every side, with weak real estate markets, tough regulators, and an economic cycle that is turning down,'' said John J. Mason, an analyst at the Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation, a brokerage in Charlotte, N.C.
Last week, the Chase Manhattan Corporation announced a cut in its dividend and a third-quarter loss of $625 million resulting from bad real estate loans and costs of cutting its payroll by 5,000 workers.
 
Bank Issues Fare Poorly
Bank stocks were among the worst hit in yesterday's decline, with many companies falling by 5 percent or more while the Dow Jones industrial average fell only about 1.3 percent.
Among the New York City banks that analysts said were candidates for dividend cuts, Citicorp fell 75 cents, to $13.75, the Chemical Banking Corporation fell 87.5 cents, to $14.125, and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation fell $1, to $20.25. Chase's stock fell 12.5 cents, to $11.
By reducing its quarterly stock dividend to 10 cents a share from 31 cents, the Bank of Boston will save $43 million a year. The company expects another $100 million in savings annually by cutting 1,500 of its 18,000 workers through a voluntary retirement plan for employees with 10 years or more of experience.
The Bank of Boston said the third-quarter loss of $200 million to $250 million will be caused by the setting aside of $150 million to $200 million in loan-loss reserves and a $35 million drop in the value of real estate the company owned because of bad loans.
The voluntary retirement program will result in a one-time charge of $50 million, and another $40 million charge results from the company's inability to use foreign tax credits.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Soar in Late Rally

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late rally sent prices of Treasury bonds soaring yesterday after a further flight from stocks had lifted prices of the shorter maturities earlier in the session.
The late rally, which ignored soaring oil prices and a rising flow of negative developments in the banking industry, was attributed to reports from Washington that Administration and Congressional leaders were expected to announce this weekend an agreement on a plan to cut the budget deficit.
If the reports prove true, dealers said, it could clear the way for the Federal Reserve to cause interest rates to decline - either directly or, more likely, indirectly.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, were being offered at 97 8/32, up 1 2/32 on the day, while the yield plunged to 9.01 percent, from 9.12 the day before and unchanged from Friday. 
Dealers attributed much of the earlier demand for long-term Treasury issues, which had raised prices as much as 11/32, to a further erosion of prices of bank holding company bonds and stocks and, worse, the lack of liquidity in the market for the debt issues of many parents of leading banks.
''The bids for bank debt issues have dried up to the point where the market has become illiquid,'' said Thomas P. Quigley, senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''As a result, many quotes are more nominal than a reflection of normal two-way trading.''
Nominal or not, Mr. Quigley noted that what bids there were tended to shave a further 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the prices of typical 10-year debt issues of such bank holding companies as Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Chemical, Bank of America and others.
''To make matters worse,'' Mr. Quigley continued, ''we are seeing sellers emerge when prices fall, not buyers, which is normally the case with the debt issues of such top names. And the illiquidity in this market is now spreading to many other financial paper markets.''
William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, noted that ''the reports about a budget agreement was what the fixed-income debt market needed, especially at a time when the significance of $40 oil and the troubles of the commercial banking industry are starting to sink in.''
 
Long-Term Treasury Debt
The long-term Treasury debt market had been under pressure since Aug. 2, when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices climbing and threated to unleash another round of inflation, the bane of the fixed-income market. Since Aug. 2, the yield on the long bonds had risen to 9.01 percent from 8.55 percent.
Meanwhile, prices of the shorter Treasury maturities continued to benefit from the flight of capital from the battered stock market as well as the old habit of many investment portfolio managers of window dressing their quarterly reports with large amounts of cash or other highly liquid instruments.
Largely as a result of these two factors, the discount rate on Treasury 90-day bills tumbled a further nine basis points, to 7.21 percent; six-month bills plunged 14 basis points, to 7.21 percent, while the demand for one-year bills caused the rate to drop 11 basis points.
Among other short-term issues that would most immediately benefit from a cut in interest rates, the yield on the new 8 1/8 percent two-year Treasury notes dropped to 8.02 percent in trading on a when-issued basis, from 8.14 percent the day before. The two-year notes were auctioned Tuesday at an average yield of 8.18 percent.
The yield on the 8.5 percent four-year notes auctioned on Wednesday, at an average yield of 8.53 percent, traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.38 percent.
Also closely monitored is the yield on the Treasury's long notes, the 8.75's of August 2000, because they are considered to compete with the 10-year bonds ''long bonds'' of Japan and West Germany. The late rally sent the long notes up 19/32, to 99 8/ 32, while its yield fell to 8.86 percent from 8.97 percent the day before.
The yield on Japan's 10-year bonds, their longest maturity, slipped to 8.69 percent from 8.72 percent as a flight from their weakened stock market also caused a flight to quality. The yield on West Germany's 10-year long bonds remained unchanged at 9.11 percent.
Once again the Fed injected overnight reserves into the banking system, partly to accommodate the end of quarter demand for cash from domestic portfolio managers as well as some Japanese banks. Today marks the end of Japan's fiscal half-year, and Japanese portfolio managers, who have sustained heavy losses in their stock market, also wanted to window-dress their half-year accounts with cash.

Offering by Massachusetts Has Maximum Yield of 8%

 BODY:
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, whose fiscal stability is under siege from a weakening economy, various legal challenges and a tax-cut proposal to be voted on in November, came to market yesterday with a $1.3 billion offering of fixed- and variable-rate securities through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to clear the state's accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion.
The sale involves four series of bonds, three of which are secured by letters of credit. 
The $1.025 billion series A portion includes serial bonds priced to yield from 7.25 percent for an issue due in 1992 to 7.95 percent in 1996. There are also term bonds due in 1997 priced to yield 8 percent, and zero-coupon bonds, which pay no interest but if held to maturity in 1997 yield 8 percent.
The series A bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and they are secured by a portion of the state's personal income tax revenue that is deposited monthly in a special trust fund and would be insulated from any effects of passage of the tax-cut proposal that the group Citizens for Limited Taxation put on the November ballot.
Underwriters said the series B, C, and D bonds were being issued as commercial-paper-type instruments, with yields ranging from 6.15 percent to 6.75 percent, and maturities running from October 1990 to July 1991.
The variable-rate issues backed by letters of credit are rated accordingly. About $125 million of bonds secured by a letter from National Westminster Bank and short-term ratings of Aaa/VMIG-1 by Moody's and AA+/A-1+ by S.&P. The $100 million of bonds backed by a letter from Union Bank of Switzerland's New York branch are rated Aaa/ VMIG-1 by Moody's and AAA/A-1+ by S.& P. The remaining $50 million in bonds is secured by a letter from Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. and is rated Aa-3/VMIG-1 by Moody's and A+/A-1+ by S.&P.

Gold Joins the Price Slide Of Other Precious Metals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices reversed a three-day trend and fell yesterday, despite modest gains in crude oil prices, as speculators seemed to put aside fears over the Middle East crisis.
Bullion settled $1.90 to $2.20 an ounce lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in September down $1.60, to $405 an ounce.
Silver and platinum, meanwhile, extended their losses of the week, which has pushed the metals to their lowest levels in years. Reports of weak economic activity in the United States depressed silver and platinum because they are widely used as industrial material. 
Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $10.70 to $11.60 an ounce lower, with October at $437.30 a ounce. Silver fell 3 cents to 2.7 cents an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, with October at $4.771 an ounce.
 
Shift in Strategy
Gold's downturn yesterday could signal that speculators are getting over fears of war in the Middle East and are concentrating more on inflation and a possible recession, where they would be more inclined to hoard their money, analysts said. They said the war fears might have led to gold's rise earlier in the week despite the drop in silver and platinum, which gold usually follows.
''Gold has been trading on the emotion of the market and has always been an emotional safe haven for people in times of distress,'' said Nina Lipton, vice president of Platinum Guild International in New York. ''I think the market is acting on impressions, not reality.''
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat, soybean and corn futures had an unremarkable day of trading.
Wheat futures prices extended Wednesday's gains after the Agriculture Department confirmed reports that it had offered to sell subsidized flour to the Soviet Union, Morocco and other West African countries.
Soybean futures prices followed wheat's lead after the Agriculture Department also reported the Soviet Union might be interested in buying soybean meal, said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York.
Corn futures prices were mostly lower in thin, quiet trading after morning weather reports predicted near-ideal harvest weather over the next week. Good weather holds prices lower because is decreases the fear of shortages.
The Agriculture Department's grain stocks report was also a factor in the thin trading, some analysts said. But Mr. Spilka said after the report's release at the close of trading that it should have little effect on today's market.
''In the past, the numbers have been all over the map,'' he said. ''I wouldn't place great emphasis on the report having much influence.''
The numbers represent the Government's estimate on the stockpile of grains as of Sept. 1.
Meat futures rebounded after three days of losses amid optimism that a Federal budget agreement could be reached by Monday.

HEADLINE: Tax Compromises Open Way To Pact in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
White House officials agreed in private budget negotiations tonight to a higher income tax on wealthy Americans in return for a lower capital gains tax, officials from both parties said.
The concession was an important breakthrough and could pave the way for a deficit-reduction agreement over the weekend.
''The issues now boils down to numbers and not to principles, and with numbers you can often split the difference,'' a Democrat said.
Until now, the White House has adamantly refused to allow tax rates to be raised, a vestige of President Bush's campaign pledge of no new taxes.
 
Work on Monday
Democrats have refused to allow a tax break for capital gains, which would mostly benefit the wealthy, unless it was accompanied by an offsetting higher tax on upper-income taxpayers. 
If no law is passed by Monday appropriating money for the new fiscal year, most Government activities will be shut down for lack of financing. Congress is prepared to approve a stopgap law, but President Bush has said he would veto it without a budget agreement. The budget negotiators adjourned just before midnight. Richard G. Darman, the budget director, instructed Government agencies tonight to have Federal workers come to work as usual Monday morning, the first day of the fiscal year, but he said most would have to be sent home if no appropriations law had been passed or passage did not seem to be imminent.
 
Exhorting the Troops
Republicans offered several different proposals today involving a tax rate on the wealthy slightly higher than the current 28 percent. Each of the offers was met with a Democratic counteroffer.
Earlier today, backbench lawmakers in both parties said Congress might reject a deficit-reduction deal that would cut Social Security and raise taxes.
Democratic and Republican leaders in the House, trying to stem defections, called their troops into separate party caucuses this morning to try to convince them that a budget deal as a whole would be palatable, even if individual elements were distasteful.
More than half the Republican congressmen have signed a pledge that they will vote against any measure that raises taxes, as every budget deal under consideration does.
 
'No Pleasure in This Package'
Dozens of members of both parties have sworn on the campaign stump that they would not reduce Social Security benefits. And many Democrats have said that as a matter of principle, they could not vote for any measure that cut the capital gains tax.
It was difficult to judge today whether a revolt was gathering against the party leaders or whether the strong talk was no more than the posturing that often precedes a difficult vote.
Whatever the case, this comment from Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, was typical: ''Who wants to vote for Medicare cuts? Who wants to vote for Social Security cuts? Who wants to vote for a gasoline tax? I'm frustrated with the leadership, and what I've heard them saying doesn't reflect my views.''
After the Democratic representatives met, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said he had told them: ''You've got to understand there is no pleasure in this package. But you've got to look at the positive side of getting it done.''
Representative Mel Levine of California was one of many Democrats who was skeptical. ''I hope I'll be able to vote for it,'' he said after listening to Mr. Gephardt's presentation. ''But given what I've heard, I'm not sure I can. I think a lot of people feel that way.''
Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona said his Republican colleagues went into their meeting this morning ''loaded for bear.''
 
Soothing White House Talk
But John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, spoke to the Republicans and managed to soothe them somewhat.
Afterward, Representative Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the Republican Caucus, said, ''I'm not suggesting at all that at this point a majority of Republicans would be willing to vote for a package, but they are very positively wanting to look and make a judgment.''
The chief economic policy makers from the White House and the top Congressional leaders, who have been meeting until midnight or later all week, were trying to resolve the final two sticking points: how to cut Social Security and what to do about capital gains taxes and offsetting taxes on the wealthy.
Little word seeped out of their backroom meeting. But it seemed clear that if an agreement can be reached, Social Security recipients would be affected. Either a higher portion of the benefits of those with moderate incomes and above will be taxed, as Democrats prefer, or cost-of-living increases for all recipients will be delayed, as Republicans want.
Both sides had kept the Social Security issue off stage until this week. But once it became public, intense lobbying from groups of elderly voters began.
One group, Families United for Senior Action, offered today to put reporters and lawmakers in touch with individual residents of their hometowns who would suffer if their benefits were reduced.
The capital gains question was also still in the air. Tonight, staff assistants said, the White House moved closer to the Democratic view that a capital gains tax break would have to be offset by a higher income tax on the wealthy.
Earlier this week, Republicans suggested that instead of lowering the capital gains tax rate, as they initially proposed, that capital gains be taxed in a way that would exclude the portion of profit attributable to inflation, in a process called indexing.
 
Tax Study Shakes Democrats
Some Democrats saw a possible compromise in the new proposal, but many have become more wary as the days have passed. They were shaken by a new staff calculation that showed indexing to be much more costly to the Government than the original Bush proposal after six or seven years.
Capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments.
A study produced today by Citizens for Tax Justice, a union-sponsored research organization, showed that 50 percent of the benefits from capital gains indexing would go to taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 and that 71 percent would go to those with incomes above $100,000.
That is only slightly different from the effects of the original Bush plan. The study was based on figures compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.
At the same time, the American Council on Capital Formation, a business lobby, was working against indexing and in favor of a capital gains tax cut.
Mark Bloomfield, executive director of the organization, said indexing might help investors who play the stock market but would do little to encourage risky ventures in small businesses.
 
Sunday Session Is Planned
Congress recessed this afternoon for Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday that began at sundown, and will reconvene for an unusual Sunday session.
In their overall plan, the negotiators are seeking to cut the deficit by $50 billion in the next fiscal year and $500 billion over five years.
Before Monday, when the new fiscal year begins, Congress must pass and President Bush must sign legislation continuing appropriations for all Government departments and agencies, in order to keep the Government running normally.
Such legislation is generally routine when, as is usually the case, the regular appropriations bills have not been enacted at the start of the fiscal year.
But this year, Congress wants to attach a provision extending for three weeks the deadline for automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. President Bush has pledged to veto a continuing appropriations resolution if it contains the budget law extension.
Without such a resolution, the Government would have no money to spend Monday. What that means is not certain. The Government has never been without funds for more than a few hours.
 
Dispute Over Authority
Relying on a 1981 ruling by Benjamin Civiletti, President Jimmy Carter's Attorney General, the White House has asserted that the President has the authority to maintain essential Government services.
Congressional lawyers say the President has the authority to maintain guards to prevent looting of Government facilities and to instruct air traffic controllers to allow the planes already in the air to land but can do little more under the Constitution.
The White House has not said how extensive it believes its authority is.
Beyond capital gains and Social Security, the budget negotiators have agreed in a number of areas.
Gasoline taxes would be raised by 8 cents a gallon to 17 cents. A smaller tax would be placed on other forms of fuel.
Insurance premiums paid by the elderly for doctors' bills under Medicare would be raised by nearly $6 a month above the current $28.60. The annual Medicare deductible would be increased to $150 from $75.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
SACKING OF KUWAIT IS PRESSURING U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
President Bush's national security adviser said today that the ''systematic destruction'' of Kuwait under Iraqi occupation was shortening the time that the United States can wait for economic sanctions to drive President Saddam Hussein's army out of the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
But the official, Brent Scowcroft, stopped short of an explicit warning of American military action.
After a long White House meeting and lunch in which the ousted Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Ahmed al-Ahmed al-Sabah, warned Mr. Bush that his country was threatened with destruction, Mr. Scowcroft refused to say how long Mr. Bush would wait before concluding that sanctions against Iraq have failed.
 
An 'Ambitious Dictator'
But ''there is no question that what is happening inside Kuwait affects the timetable'' for that decision, he said. Mr. Scowcroft asserted that the plundering of Kuwait by Iraqi troops made it conceivable that the United States would seek another United Nations Security Council resolution, possibly including an explicit mention of military force.
Mr. Scowcroft spoke as a Congressman disclosed American intelligence reports saying that Iraq has developed biological weapons that could deliver significant quantities of the deadly agents to the battlefield by early next year. [Page 4.] Mr. Scowcroft said the United States would consider it an act of aggression if Iraq carried out a threat to cut off food to foreigners in Kuwait and Iraq on Monday. But he would not say how the United States might respond. 
The President offered a harsh condemnation of Iraq after his meeting with the Emir, calling President Saddam Hussein a ''ruthless and ambitious dictator.''
 
'Off the Face of the Map'
In a statement that he read on the White House South Lawn with the Emir at his side, Mr. Bush said: ''Iraqi aggression has ransacked and pillaged a once peaceful and secure country, its population assaulted, incarcerated, intimidated and even murdered. Iraq's leaders are trying to wipe an internationally recognized sovereign state, a member of the Arab League and the United Nations, off the face of the map.''
Mr. Bush's remarks and Mr. Scowcroft's subsequent comments were intended to send another strong signal to President Hussein after a week of international condemnation of Iraq at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today concluded a week of meetings in New York with other foreign ministers. The talks left an impression of increasing concern that only a military solution would force Mr. Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
 
Baker Sees Arab Support
After meeting today with the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Kuwait and some of its Persian Gulf neighbors, Mr. Baker said: ''I do think there are a number of countries that make it quite clear we should not foreclose options. I think there are more countries that are willing now to express that view.''
Administration officials said the Tunisian Foreign Minister, Ismail Khalil, who visited President Hussein in Baghdad on Sunday, told Mr. Baker that the Iraqi leader apparently still believes that the international coalition boycotting Iraqi commerce will eventually erode and that he can hold on to Kuwait by stalling for time.
Kuwaiti officials said before the Emir's meeting with Mr. Bush that the exiled monarch would impress on the President that the Kuwaitis do not believe they can wait for sanctions to take hold on Iraq's economy. They said they would argue that, as one official put it, ''military action is the only way.''
Mr. Scowcroft said the Emir did not specifically urge Mr. Bush to attack Iraq. But he said, ''You could subliminally read between the lines if you wish.''
Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he believed that the Administration is ''looking more and more favorably on the war option'' to force Iraqi troops out of occupied Kuwait.
But Mr. Scowcroft said, ''I think we need to at least come to sincere judgment as to whether or not there is a peaceful way to resolve this.''
The Senate began debating a resolution today that offers strong support for Mr. Bush's actions in the gulf, but stops short of giving a blanket endorsement for unprovoked military strikes against Iraq. A vote on the resolution is expected on Monday, when the House is expected to take action on a similar measure.
The Senate resolution said, ''The Congress supports continued action by the President in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with United States constitutional and statutory processes, including authorization and appropriations of funds by the Congress, to deter Iraqi aggression and to protect American lives and vital interests in the region.''
The resolution reflects the difficulty for lawmakers, who endorse the President's action so far and believe it is in their political interest to show support but want to be careful to withhold advance approval of actions.
The resolution ''does not constitute authority for the President to initiate unprovoked attacks against Iraq,'' said Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, After the meeting today, the Emir offered effusive praise of Mr. Bush in a formal statement at the White House.
Speaking through an interpreter, he said, ''Your principled, courageous and decisive position in the face of the Iraqi aggression on Kuwait is a true expression of the unabated faith and commitment of the American people to the humanitarian morals on which and for which the United States of America was founded.''
Mr. Scowcroft said the Emir ''described in some detail some of the atrocities being committed by Arabs against Arabs as well as the pillaging and systematic destruction'' in Kuwait.
Given the urgency that the Emir assigned to the situation, Mr. Scowcroft was asked whether the United States could afford to wait for the United Nations sanctions to strangle Iraq's economy. He replied: ''There is no question that what's happening inside Kuwait affects the timetable. There's no question about that.''
But he also said: ''The sanctions have not been in place very long. I believe it is in everyone's interest to see whether or not there is a peaceful resolution of this.''
Mr. Scowcroft said there was no specific plan for a new Security Council resolution, but added, ''This whole element of what the Iraqis are doing inside Kuwait to a whole people could conceivably be the subject of another U.N. action.''
 
U.S. GENERAL PLAYS DOWN THREAT
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 (Reuters) - The commander of American forces in the gulf said today that President Saddam Hussein was using more aggressive remarks to intimidate his adversaries, and he discounted any threat of an early Iraqi attack.
''I don't think he's attempting to trigger war,'' Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf said in a satellite interview from Saudi Arabia on the PBS television program ''MacNeil Lehrer News Hour.''
Referring to Mr. Hussein's threat to attack Israel and Arab oilfields, the General said: ''I think what he's trying to do is turn up the level of rhetoric to get everybody a little bit more concerned about the threat of war. But I think that even Saddam Hussein would have to admit today that that would be an act of national suicide.''

HEADLINE: Doctor Fees Found Higher in U.S. Than in Canada

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Doctors in the United States charge more than twice as much as doctors in Canada for the same work, a study says, adding that this helps explain why this country's health care costs are dramatically higher than Canada's.
The study found that despite the larger fees charged by American doctors, they earn only about one-third more than Canadians. The reason is that Canadian doctors are busier and make up for their lower fees by seeing more patients, the study says. 
Unlike the United States, Canada provides complete, fully paid health coverage for all its citizens. One of every seven people in the United States has no health insurance, and even those with coverage typically have to pay at least part of the bill. Despite these differences, the study found that health care costs 20 percent more per person in the United States than in Canada.
 
Object of the Study
In the study, reported Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, Victor R. Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University, sought the reasons for the differences in the cost of medical care in the two countries.
Over all, physician fees in the United States are 2.4 times those in Canada. Other factors besides doctors' earnings contribute to the lower cost of medical care in Canada.
If physician fees in the United States were cut in half and lowered to the Canadian level, total health care expenditures would be reduced by about 10 percent, Mr. Fuchs said.
Health care now accounts for about 11.5 percent of the gross national product in the United States; in Canada it is about 9 percent. If American spending could be held to the Canadian percentage, more than $100 billion a year would be saved.
Mr. Fuchs's calculations converted Canadian figures into United States dollars. The study was based on 1985 data; American physicians' pay continues to climb sharply.
These were among the findings:
* Doctors provided fewer services per person in the United States than in Canada.
* American fees for surgery and high-technology services like X-rays and anesthesia were more than three times those in Canada.
* On a per capita basis, Canada had more doctors but fewer specialists than the United States.
* In 1985 net income for office-based doctors was $112,199 in the United States and $73,607 in Canada.
* American doctors spend twice as much as Canadians for rent and other office expenses and generally have more attractive offices.
Billing costs are also higher in the United States because Canadian doctors have to deal with only one insurer, the Government of Canada. Canadian fees are uniform for each service within provinces, and are set through negotiations between doctors and the Government.
Mr. Fuchs said he doubted whether the Canadian system could be administered in the United States. ''There is reason to question whether the quality of our civil services is up to the quality of the Canadian civil services,'' he said. ''There is also reason to question whether the organization and degree of discipline in the profession is as strong as in Canada. We are very much individualists, and that includes physicians.''

Plug In To Moscow

BYLINE: Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Assorted hints have come from Moscow that the Soviets are willing to supply intelligence about Iraq. This could be of critical importance. Long and intimate involvement with the Iraqi military and police establishments, from the top well on down, gave Moscow information unavailable anywhere else.
It is a reflection of the astonishing, still quite incomplete shift in Soviet-American relations that Washington has reacted coolly. There are some valid reasons for caution. 
For one thing, there has been an energetic K.G.B. campaign for nearly a year now to prettify a deservedly ugly image at home and abroad. ''They want to convince us that not even the K.G.B. is still our enemy, but they are still very busy in the U.S.,'' a retired C.I.A. official said.
It isn't clear if the hints are just public relations, or more serious than such on-the-record statements might suggest. Last week Vladimir Kryuchkov, the K.G.B. chairman, received an Associated Press delegation and said, ''I am convinced that we could really tell each other [the C.I.A.] something valuable.''
Now, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of the Soviet General Staff, tells American newsmen that he is giving details about Soviet-made weapons used by the Iraqis to the U.S. Embassy, but admits that the C.I.A. already knows most of it. Neither he nor Mr. Kryuchkov indicated if there were any terms for the proffered help, but they complained that Washington hasn't signaled much interest.
Washington's view is that there is still a long way to go before the U.S. is ready to exchange secrets, as it does with allies. But it is ready to receive what is provided, preferably through America's Moscow Embassy rather than in leaky Washington.
A distinction needs to be made between military and political intelligence. The former isn't hard to get from observation and regional sources and its use is only in case of war. But political intelligence could be decisive in preventing war, which requires real change in Baghdad.
Talk about negotiating with Saddam Hussein is an illusion. His threats to fight ''to the last drop of [his people's] blood'' and that he will destroy the whole region show how much he cares about his country. If he were French his motto would be Louis XV's ''after me, the deluge.''
Nor should the U.S. wish to devastate Iraq. Its benighted people are victims, not the perpetrators of the crisis. Apart from humane common sense, it would be geopolitical stupidity, similar to the mistake of indulging Mr. Hussein after the Iran-Iraq war.
The main objective, to prevent any tyrant from controlling over half the world's oil, remains valid and there would be no improvement if Iran or Syria succeeded because Mr. Hussein is made to fall. Outsiders cannot heal what ails the Arab states, but they can avoid creating new monsters with lopsided support.
The consequences of war are incalculable. One way to avoid it is to back off, a victory Mr. Hussein would be sure to exploit. A surprising article in the London newspaper The Independent, linked to the anniversary of World War II's Battle of Britain, showed where that reasoning leads.
Terry Coleman, the writer, went through the archives of British diplomacy from 1940 and condemns Winston Churchill for refusing to probe Hitler's secret peace offers. He cites a message through the British Embassy in Stockholm saying ''The Fuhrer feels responsible for the future of the white race'' and would be willing to settle for ''two economic units - continental Europe, which is Germany's, and the British Empire and America.'' That would have brought a hellish peace - for a while.
The other way to avoid war is to get rid of Mr. Hussein. It is what the embargo is really about, and he knows it. Talk of finding him an ''escape hatch'' or ''saving face'' because his demands are limited is the kind of talk Mr. Coleman thinks Churchill should have entertained in 1940. This time the world has organized against aggression, and its determination should inspire Iraqis.
That is where the Soviets come in. Mr. Hussein has foiled many coup attempts, with brutal aftermaths, but the incentive to try again is much greater now and growing. Moscow knows a lot about who is who in the entourage, what might be possible. It has its own good reasons for wanting the crisis to end without a fight.
Washington should encourage the Soviets to pass along useful information, test what they are willing to provide, and assure that confidence will be repected. There is too much to lose without trying it. Mr. Hussein didn't give us time to get used to the idea of such cooperation, but it's vital.

HEADLINE: Small Business in Peril From Street Peddlers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York City's 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District has been revitalizing our neighborhood for six years. A persistent constraint on our efforts is the proliferation of street peddlers, most of them unlicensed, who line our commercial corridor daily. These peddlers represent a serious economic threat to small business here and throughout the city. They sell the same wares as merchants who pay rentals of upward of $75 a square foot. These peddlers pay no license fees, no taxes and do not contribute to any positive aspects of city life.
They leave mounds of debris and garbage on the street in front of shops, and sanitation enforcement agents give summonses to the storekeepers for this garbage, further adding to their economic burden. Historically, small business has been the city's largest employer.
There is antipeddling legislation on the books, and stronger bills are being proposed by City Councilmember Carol Greitzer. But enforcement is the key. Peddling as a crime has a very low priority with the Police Department. The question is, Who will we drive out of the city first, the illegal peddlers or the legitimate small-business people?

HEADLINE: Helping Older Women Enter the Job Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The women who raised families in midcentury America deserved better than the economic difficulties faced by older displaced homemakers such as Doris Gibson (''For Elderly Just Hanging On, An Oasis of Jobs Is Shrinking,'' front page, Sept. 1). But she represents a growing population of women forced onto the job market in older years after having worked only in the home. My organization reported last June that the number of displaced homemakers in the United States rose by nearly 12 percent in the 1980's to 15.6 million in 1989. And 22 million married women who are not employed could lose their primary means of support by divorce, or their spouse's disability or death.
There are some favorable signs. With a shrinking supply of young people entering the work force, employers will have to turn to mature workers to fill their rolls. The qualities of mature workers - enthusiasm, longevity on the job, responsibility -will recommend more and more re-entry women to employers.
But, to qualify for the jobs of the 1990's and the next century, displaced homemakers will need training. Congress has before it a displaced homemakers training and economic self-sufficiency bill, which would provide grants to states for education, training, job search and placement, and related services to help displaced homemakers obtain marketable job skills and secure paid employment. Congress can help tomorrow's economy and tomorrow's older displaced homemakers. We hope it doesn't dismiss the Doris Gibsons as too old, unimportant and poor to influence their votes.

America's Last Robot?

 BODY:
Cincinnati Milacron, the last major American maker of heavy robots, is selling its business to a Swiss company. That will leave most of the U.S. robot market in the hands of foreigners. Does it matter that yet another high-tech, American-grown industry is now dominated by foreigners, mostly Japan? 
Conventional wisdom says no: industrial robots have proved less promising than hoped. But the wider point is that yet again Japan has targeted an industry it thinks has an important future, and driven out most major U.S. competitors.
Just as semiconductor chips are the key to all electronics industries, from computers to telecommunications, robots and machine tools are critical to manufacturing industries. Each of these bedrock technologies - robots, machine tools and semiconductors - has been targeted by Japan so successfully that many U.S. companies are under severe pressure.
Japan's formula is not well understood in America. Prevailing economic wisdom, to cite the President's 1990 Economic Report, holds that ''excessive government involvement in the economy leads to unsound decisions . . . slows growth and costs jobs.'' That is indeed Washington's sorry experience in a range of ill-fated projects, from the breeder reactor to synfuels. But it's a fallible leap of logic to suppose that if Washington messes up, Tokyo must inevitably fail too. Tokyo's brand of industrial policy, perfected over six decades, differs from Washington's as much in methods as in results.
Its key ingredient is abundant capital. Tokyo's powerful bureaucrats compel their fellow citizens to save. Those sky-high land prices in Tokyo - the Emperor's palace grounds are worth more than all Florida - are no accident. Japanese must save like fury to be able to afford a house. These savings are then available as cheap capital for industry. Last year Japan, whose economy is half the size, spent an astonishing $549 billion on capital investment, exceeding the $513 billion spent by the U.S.
Unlike their Western counterparts, Tokyo's officials do not try to second-guess the market but let the market define winning industries. When they decided to build up a computer industry, they induced their telecommunications companies to compete vigorously against each other behind protective walls. Tokyo then subsidized research and barred I.B.M. from selling competing products.
After years of failure, these efforts struck technical gold in 1980. By 1992, Japan's share of the world computer market will reach 42 percent, and the near-monopoly once enjoyed by the U.S. will have shrunk to 32 percent.
Against such methods, even the most efficient and innovative American companies are hard pressed to compete. Their Japanese counterparts can sell freely in the U.S. while their domestic market is protected by Tokyo. Many belong to company groups, or keiretsu, whose member bank is ultimately supported by the Bank of Japan. Freed from the fear of bankruptcy, a Japanese company can take a longer-term view than its U.S. competitor.
Moreover, as Japan dominates one manufacturing industry after another, it builds up synergistic strengths. Its chip makers have a vast captive market in Japan's domestic consumer electronics industry; America's chip makers have none.
Washington won't respond because it believes government should not favor one industry over another, and because the U.S. economy is in any case a fertile creator of new industries. But if Japan can consistently dominate industries it deems promising, Americans will be pushed into less desirable ones. Tokyo believes it is far more profitable to produce robots than radishes or rutabagas. The result of this policy, if present trends continue, is that America may soon make its last robot.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Bush Sure-Footed on Trail of Money

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 27

 BODY:
He hits the road, sometimes he presses the flesh, but President Bush doesn't really campaign, not in the classic sense. Not like Ronald Reagan or Hubert H. Humphrey or Lyndon B. Johnson.
What he does is raise money - relentlessly, efficiently, rapidly.
He did some Presidential business, of course, as he bustled around the Middle West this week, from Ohio to Illinois to Minnesota to Ohio to Michigan, two long days of politics. 
 
Presidential Business
He announced the sale of five million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Wednesday night in the Chicago suburbs, hailed the Senate Judiciary Committee's endorsement of Judge David H. Souter for the Supreme Court on Thursday in Cleveland and made earnest pitches everywhere for his policy in the Persian Gulf.
Nor did he wholly neglect his role as the cheerleader of the Republican Party. At lunch in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday, he momentarily shed his patrician restraint and his bipartisan approach. Accusing the Democrats of holding up a budget settlement, promising to ''carry that message to every state in the Union,'' he sounded all hot and bothered, as scrappy as a Republican Harry S. Truman.
In the Chicago suburbs on Wednesday night, speaking for Representative Lynn Martin, the Republican senatorial candidate in Illinois this fall, the President actually tried to make some partisan hay out of the gulf crisis.
''She knows you can't stand up to tyranny and despotism while recklessly slashing military levels,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that Ms. Martin's Democratic opponent, Senator Paul Simon, ''called for bombing Iraqi pipelines on the one hand, and on the other hand, cut defense spending by 50 percent.''
But Mr. Bush finds that kind of thing hard to sustain. He felt compelled to add, ''The two or three top Democratic leaders have tried pretty hard.'' And at every stop, he praised the opposition for its support of his foreign policy, repeatedly citing the maxim of the old Midwestern internationalist Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan: ''Politics stops at the water's edge.''
 
A Familial Touch
In truth, George Bush the national leader and George Bush the party point man took a back seat this week to George Bush the rich uncle, visiting his relatives here and there, spreading the wealth, radiating bonhomie.
Mr. Bush had a homey allusion for everyone: mention of his naval air training in the Twin Cities, of his father's childhood in Columbus, Ohio. In Detroit he made ritual mention of Isaiah Thomas and the champion Detroit Pistons basketball team.
At a luncheon in Cleveland, he spoke of John Kinton, a former star athlete in high school there who now runs a military tent kitchen in Saudi Arabia; in Chicago, the anecdote was about Lorraine Kuryla, a 63-year-old grandmother who volunteered for active duty with an Air Force Reserve unit there.
Candidates, officeholders, party officials, political operatives all get their full measure of praise and applause in the Bush formula. But there is no attempt to transfer his popularity, no appeal to voters to elect this candidate or that because he is a Bush backer, no attempt to frame issues.
The real goal of these travels is dollars. Mr. Bush appeared at five fund-raising meals, held a number of private fund-raising meetings and made no old-fashioned campaign speeches at all where he could appeal to the unconverted. #17 States on Agenda Since taking office 20 months ago, the President has worked the Republican faithful, raising more than $73 million for candidates and state parties. He plans to visit at least 17 states in 10 days of political travel next month, and he will campaign nonstop in the first five days of November.
In less than two hours in Minneapolis on Thursday, Mr. Bush managed to include three meetings that raised close to $1.5 million. He talked for 20 minutes with 29 rich Minnesotans who each gave $25,000 or more to state campaigns for the pleasure of the President's company; he spent 15 more minutes with 100 or so contributors who each gave $2,000, and spoke to about 1,000 people who paid $500 a plate for breakfast.
The figures in Ohio, which formed the focus of this week's travels, are even more breathtaking. In four visits to that pivotal state - to Columbus in February, Cincinnati in April, Akron on Wednesday and Cleveland on Thursday - the President has raised more than $3 million. Joe Rice, the political editor of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, said the Republican nominee for governor, George Voinovich, will have almost $4 million in the bank going into the final month of the campaign, enough for a closing television blitz of a scope that seems beyond the reach of his Democratic rival, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. Partly because of his fund-raising advantage, which is largely the work of the President, Mr. Voinovich is now the solid favorite in Ohio.
The technique won't work everywhere, of course; here in Michigan, for example, Representative Bill Schuette, the Republican nominee who hopes to oust Senator Carl Levin, has raised a lot of money but trails badly in the polls. Still, Mr. Bush's aides think it would be a mistake to push harder and try to make the elections a referendum on the President and his policies.
 
'Doesn't Rub Off'
''The Reagan and Carter years showed that Presidential popularity just doesn't rub off or define issues any more,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. ''Reagan would go out on the stump, draw huge throngs and convert no one at all.''
Indeed, Mr. Reagan's appeals to ''win one for the Gipper'' did not prevent his party from losing 26 House seats in the 1982 midterm elections or from losing eight Senate seats and control of that body four years later. In 1978, Jimmy Carter appealed for Democratic votes to help him fight inflation, and his party still lost three seats in the Senate and 11 in the House.
Another point mentioned by the Bush strategists is Mr. Bush's desire to let local candidates define the issues in a way that has local appeal.
''He wants Lynn Martin in the Senate,'' said one strategist. ''She's a Republican, he likes her, she's a strong nominee. But she has one of the most contrary voting records in Congress, she's against the President on abortion and half a dozen other issues and he can hardly go out to Chicago and say, 'Vote for Lynn Martin because you back me and she's like me.' ''
The G.O.P. planners say polls support their arguments. A survey in July, paid for by the National Republican Campaign Committee, asked whether campaign appearances by Mr. Bush for local Congressional candidates would cause them to change their voting plans. Fully 77 percent said not.
So the President raises the money to put the local hopefuls' message on the air, hoping that will help to accomplish his purpose.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
As Gulf Crisis Solidifies the World Order, Cuba Feels Left Out

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The exuberance of Soviet and American officials about the new world order being established after the cold war is not universally embraced at the United Nations.
The Cubans, the lone dissenters in the 15-member Security Council's vote last Tuesday to impose an air embargo against Iraq, watch warily as the vaunted new world order plunges them into economic crisis and diplomatic isolation.
The decisions by the Soviet Union to slash aid to Cuba - in particularly the huge shipments of oil - and to work with the United States to solve regional conflicts have left the Cubans as one of the last standard bearers in the ideological war against what they see as United States imperialism.
As many United Nations members, including the Soviets, edge closer to the tacit acceptance of force to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis, the Cubans are faced with the specter of the United States, a country they have frequently condemned, assuming the mantle of the world's policeman. 
''The U.S. is acting as if they have become the only superpower, the dominant force in the world,'' said Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, Cuba's chief delegate to the United Nations. ''They are not only doing this unilaterally as a power, but they are using the Security Council for this purpose. This is a very serious development for the entire world.''
 
Scent of a Cigar
Western diplomats, however, see Cuba as a country that is politically ossified and out of touch with the world.
''Cuba is the only country not being pulled into the center now,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Five years ago Cuba and other radical states like Vietnam, Yemen and Algeria, pulled the non-aligned nations to the left. Today nearly everyone, with the exception of Cuba, has moved into the mainstream.''
The new order, adulated by nearly every visiting dignitary to the United Nations this week, is nothing but a headache to the Cubans.
''This so-called new order has not yet benefited the third world,'' Mr. Alarcon said, the acrid scent of a cigar wafting up from between his fingers. ''On the contrary there are many reasons to be afraid that in the way some people conceive this new order we will suffer more.''
The Cubans, while admitting that diplomatic affairs have become more ''complex'' since the end of the cold war, also contend that they will maintain their rigidity against the United States.
 
Use of Force Opposed
''There is a perception that somehow Cuba will not be able to weather the changes that have been taking place in the world,'' said Rene J. Mujica, a member of the Cuban Mission, ''that Cuba will have to adapt and ultimately become pliant to the U.S. This will not be the case.''
The Cubans say they condemn the occupation and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, along with the taking of hostages and the violations by Iraqi troops of diplomatic missions in Kuwait.
But they say they will never sanction the use of force by the multinational presence in the gulf.
''The resolutions the Council has passed in which we have reservations or objections are those resolutions that deal with U.N. actions to counter Iraq's illegal invasion, occupation and annexation of Kuwait,'' Mr. Mujica said. ''The resolutions in the Council that deal with matters of principle have our full support.''
The Cubans said the language of the eight resolutions condemning the invasion have paved the way for armed intervention by the United States, an intervention they believe would be in violation of the United Nations Charter.
''The Security Council, in accordance with the charter, is authorized to decide when to use military force, but in a very specific manner,'' Mr. Alarcon said. ''This is a very fundamental question of prinicple that goes far beyond this crisis. The Council, in our view, has violated the U.N. Charter. It is extremely dangerous for any member state, particularly for a small state, to have this as a precedent.''
 
'Gave the Green Light'
The Cubans argue that any military action sanctioned by the United Nations can be organized only under United Nations auspices.
''The Council simply gave the green light to the United States and others to do what they were doing already,'' Mr. Alarcon said.
The Cubans, who have been the object of a United States embargo for nearly three decades, say they are especially sensitive to any resolutions that would keep food and medicine from entering Iraq, although food and medicines will be allowed into Iraq and Kuwait under international supervision.
''We cannot accept that economic sanctions can include depriving innocent civilians of their normal food stuffs or medical supplies,'' he said. ''We are perhaps the only country in the world that has been living for almost 30 years under an embargo that has also deprived my people of food and medicines.''
The Cubans also argue that the call for sanctions against any country that violates the embargo is too stringent.
''The resolution threatens specific measures against states that may be, through their nationals or their territory, violating the embargo,'' Mr. Alarcon said. ''I think that this is going very, very, very far.''

HEADLINE: Congress Resists El Salvador's Chief on Aid Cuts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador impressed several members of Congress during his four-day lobbying visit to Washington this week, but he did not succeed in altering Congressional sentiment on cutting military aid to his country.
A dozen Senators considered undecided on a bill that would withhold 50 percent of the $82.5 million in military aid requested by the Bush Administration have not shifted one way or the other because of President Cristiani's visit, Senate aides said.
The House has already passed a similar measure, which would only restore aid if the guerrillas refused to take part in peace talks or waged an offensive that endangered the Government's survival.
This year's Congressional debate over aid to El Salvador is the most heated since the early 1980's, principally because of the killing of six Jesuit priests, reportedly by an army squad, in November. Congressional staff reports have documented evidence that officers of the Salvadoran Army have blocked an investigation to protect themselves from prosecution, despite the fact that four officers and four privates have been arrested. 
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ''I think Cristiani is engaging and persuasive. His sincerity is no longer in question, but I would be amazed if there aren't cuts.''
Mr. Cristiani's visit was further complicated by a stern breakfast meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle on Thursday, in which Mr. Quayle expressed his concern that San Salvador is still moving too slowly on human rights. Mr. Quayle has taken a personal interest in a massacre of 10 peasants in September 1988 in which eight of the nine militarymen originally arrested in the case have been released.
''Vice President Quayle told President Cristiani that Congress would look at this very carefully,'' a White House aide said. ''He said unless there was progress on the human-rights cases, it would be more and more harmful with Congress.''
Mr. Cristiani met with more than 70 members of Congress to assure them that he was committed to prosecute the Jesuit case and to improving his country's human-rights record. He urged that if Congress did withhold aid, it tie any cuts to the requirment that the guerrillas agree to a cease-fire first.
 
Bill Calling for Aid Cuts
''President Cristiani makes a good impression with his integrity,'' said Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. ''But whether or not he has enough credibility to temper some Congressional conditions on military aid is yet to be seen.''
Long a backer of military aid to El Salvador, Senator DeConcini said he was leaning in favor of the Dodd-Leahy bill cutting aid, which the Senate Appropriations Committee is to consider next week.
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he was undecided on the Dodd-Leahy bill before the Cristiani visit, and he remained undecided because of his concern for several human-rights cases and the lack of judicial revisions.
''I'm listening to President Cristiani,'' he said. ''But I'm more interested in what's happening there. We need to apply the most pressure to bring peace and democracy to that country.'' $4.5 Billion Since 1979 ''I think the President's visit was helpful to his cause,'' said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. ''Whether it was helpful enough I do not know.'' Mr. Chafee said he was leaning against the Dodd-Leahy bill before Mr. Cristiani's visit, and he remained undecided.
The United States has sent El Salvador more than $4.5 billion in economic and military aid, as well hundreds of military advisers, since the civil war began in 1979. The United States counterinsurgency program in El Salvador has been the largest since the Vietnam War. More than 75,000 people have died in the fighting.
A senior State Department official who deals with El Salvador policy said he thought Mr. Cristiani's visit was positive because ''he got his message across and heard Congress' concern on the Jesuit case.''

HEADLINE: Japan and North Korea Set Talks on Ties

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
After 45 years of hostility, Japan and North Korea agreed today to open talks to establish diplomatic relations ''as soon as possible.'' The Japanese, in return, promised financial compensation for their occupation of the Korean peninsula in the early decades of this century.
The move, which came at the end of an unofficial five-day visit to Pyongyang by a delegation of senior Japanese politicians, was the strongest indication yet that North Korea may be trying to end decades of isolation and hostility toward the West to help boost its lagging economy.
Until today, the most dramatic glimmer of a post-cold-war dawning in northeast Asia appeared in the talks in Seoul this month between the Prime Ministers of North Korea and South Korea, the first such high-level contacts since the end of the Korean War. 
In those negotiations, the two sides failed to resolve any of their longstanding differences, but agreed to meet again in Pyongyang next month. The North Koreans, clearly needing economic help, have asked South Korea for an economic package that Seoul is now considering as part of the negotiations.
 
A Last Flash Point
The Korean peninsula, bristling with weapons and more than 1.5 million Korean soldiers and about 45,000 American troops, remains perhaps the last major flash point left over from the era of East-West confrontation that followed World War II. In 1950 the North Koreans mounted an invasion of South Korea that led to the creation of a United Nations command headed by the United States that battled the North Koreans and the Chinese Communists to a standstill in three years of fighting.
Japanese businessmen say they are eager to get involved in the possible reconstruction of North Korea, but caution that they would be unwilling to do so if state economic controls were retained.
Diplomats warned that it could take years to iron out the differences between North Korea and its Western-directed neighbors, not least because the Pyongyang Government continues to demand reunification of the peninsula on its own terms, dismissing South Korea as a colony of the United States. The Japanese officials also emphasized that they were aware of South Korean sensitivities and would not establish relations with North Korea before South Korea did.
Western diplomats remain uncertain whether to trust a country that earlier this decade was accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks against South Korean diplomats and officials, and is generally seen as trying to destabilize or overthrow the Seoul Government.
 
Talks Between Parties
The meetings in Pyongyang were not conducted on a government-to-government basis. Rather, they were between the leading political parties of both countries. Any negotiations in the future will have to involve professional diplomats in Japan, who may not yield ground to Pyongyang very easily.
The Pyongyang talks did have the support of the political leadership of both countries, however, and they concluded with an eight-point statement declaring that normalizing relations ''would contribute to peace and prosperity of a new Asia and the world.''
Included in the statement was a pledge from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan to make a formal apology to North Korea, similar to one issued to South Korea this year, for Japan's 35-year occupation of the Korean peninsula that ended with its defeat in World War II.
The statement in Pyongyang from both sides said Japan ''should fully and officially apologize'' for ''the enormous misfortunes and miseries imposed upon the Korean people'' before, during and after World War II.
 
North Korea Needs Money
There was no indication of how much money Japan would pledge in the form of reparations or compensation. But diplomats noted that Japan paid South Korea $500 million in loans and grants in 1965, when ties with Seoul were normalized, the equivalent of several billion dollars today.
North Korea is widely thought to be sorely in need of money. Western analysts say its economy has lagged at a growth rate of about 3 percent a year in the last decade, compared with 9 percent a year for South Korea, and that it is overwhelmed by debts, military expenditures and a lack of hard currency.
In addition, diplomats say North Korea has begun feeling abandoned by its longtime patrons, the Soviet Union and China, both of which have steadily improved their ties with South Korea. Moscow even appears on the verge of establishing diplomatic ties with Seoul.
In the meetings this week in Pyongyang, Kim Il Sung, the aging leader of North Korea, met several times with the Japanese delegation, driving home the point that it was time for the establishment of good relations with Japan.
 
Promise to Free Two Japanese
Japanese officials said the most impressive immediate gesture of good will from North Korea came from Mr. Kim in the form of a promise to free two Japanese seamen seized on espionage charges in 1983. Tokyo has made the release of the men a prerequisite for improving ties with Pyongyang.
On the Japanese side, the delegation was led by Shin Kanemaru, a former Deputy Prime Minister who is a powerful backroom politician and patronage dispenser in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. He is widely regarded as the most important political patron of Prime Minister Kaifu. North Korea reportedly invited him to head the delegation.
The meeting in Pyongyang has been in the works for weeks, but its unusually productive results seemed to take some diplomats by surprise. There was no immediate comment from the United States, but Washington has recently supported efforts to try to end the isolation of Pyongyang.
 
Informal U.S. Contacts
Last year, for instance, Washington authorized the beginning of informal diplomatic contacts with North Korea, and there have been about a dozen meetings in Beijing. North Korean performers, athletes and scholars have also been permitted to visit the United States for the first time.
American officials say that in response, North Korea made a gesture of good will in May by returning the remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War, and that it has indicated that it would be willing to have outside inspections of its two nuclear reactors.
South Korea appeared to be taken aback by the development today and to have mixed feelings. President Roh Tae Woo's Government expressed the hope that North Korea might be persuaded to moderate some of its attitudes.
On the other, South Korean diplomats said they were nervous that Japan might move too hastily, undercutting Seoul's strategy for improving ties with Seoul by building slowly on cultural, economic and family contacts.
South Korea is worried that in a worldwide demand for compromise on the Korean peninsula, Seoul might get pressed into accepting part of the North Korean demands for the expulsion of American troops, a ban on American nuclear weapons and freeing of left-wing South Korean dissidents.
Apparently recognizing South Korea's concerns, Prime Minister Kaifu sought to reassure Seoul this week by reiterating that it remained an important friend and that he planned to visit South Korea in the coming year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Traded Up as Hedge Against a Weekend Crisis

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained against all major currencies except its Canadian counterpart in unusually slow United States trading yesterday.
The dollar traded within a narrow band on domestic and foreign markets. And the typically light volume that ordinarily occurs on Fridays was curtailed even further by the approaching end of the month, the calendar year quarter and the half of Japan's fiscal year. All three occur tomorrow. 
The start of the Jewish Yom Kippur observance, which began at sundown yesterday, also lightened liquidity because some dealers left work early.
 
Considered Save Haven
What buying there was in the dollar reflected traders' hedging against a possible intensification of the Middle East conflict over the weekend. The dollar is traditionally considered a safe investment haven at times of international turmoil.
Financial markets regarded the latest United States economic reading merely as confirmation of what has been widely known for some time. The index of leading indicators tumbled 1.2 percent in August, its steepest fall in three years, but the report had virtually no lasting impact on the dollar.
The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, where another selloff on the stock market chipped away confidence in the country's currency.
The dollar rose 0.45 yen, to a closing 137.95 yen, in the Japanese capital. Later in London, it was quoted at 138.15 yen and at 138.50 yen late in New York, up from 137.98 yen late Thursday.
 
British Pound Rises
The British pound rose in London and traded at $1.8735 late in the session, compared with $1.8690 late Thursday. But the pound lost ground in New York activity and was quoted late in the day at $1.8760, compared with $1.8780 late Thursday.
Other dollar rates late in New York, compared with Thursday's late quotes, included: 1.5670 German marks, up from 1.5610; 2.29735 Swiss francs, up from 1.2925; 5.2455 French francs, up from 5.2250; 1,173.25 Italian lire, up from 1,169.25, and 1.15425 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15495.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for October delivery settled at $402.50 a troy ounce, down $2.50 from Thursday's close. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late gold bid of $403 an ounce, $2 lower than Thursday's 4 P.M. bid.
In London, gold fell to a late bid of $404.75 a troy ounce from $405.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $406.25 from $406 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.10 to close at $403.39 an ounce.
Silver prices fell. On the Comex in New York, silver bullion for October delivery settled at $4.761 a troy ounce compared with the Thursday settlement price of $4.771. The metal fell in London to a late bid of $4.79 a troy ounce from Thursday's $4.80.

HEADLINE: Prices of Securities Rise on Budget Hopes

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities continued to advance yesterday, largely on the belief that the Bush Administration and the Congress will hammer out a budget agreement this weekend.
While an accord is not expected to remedy the nation's economic problems, market analysts said it would remove some of the uncertainty that has perplexed investment portfolio managers.
 
Drop in Paper Narrows
Government securities dealers said a moderate recovery in bank stock prices and a slowing of the cost of oil also improved the mood of investors in long-term fixed-income securities. The rates on short-term Treasury paper posted smaller declines than the day before, reflecting the slowing of the flight of capital from the stock market and other investments. 
''The sharpest drop in the Government's August index of leading economic indicators in more than three years was expected and only gave the bond market a brief positive jolt early in the day,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.
In late dealings, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, were being offered at 97 3/32, up by 27/32 on the day, as its yield dropped to 8.93 percent, from 9.01 percent the day before and from 9.12 percent a week ago.
 
Window Dressing Takes Hold
With the shorter Treasury maturities favored by investment managers seeking to window dress their quarterly statements with large amounts of cash or the equivalent, Mr. Ricchiuto said, ''We wouldn't be surprised if the rates on short paper come down early next week and stay down until the September unemployment figures are released early Friday morning.''
As it was, the demand for window-dressing cash on the last day of the quarter prompted volatile moves in the Federal funds rate, which banks and other financial institutions charge each other for temporary loans. The rate opened at 8 3/8 percent, sank as low as 6 percent and then closed at the opening level. As expected, the Federal Reserve did not intervene to influence the funds rate, as it had done in recent days.
Whether for cosmetics or safety, the continued demand for short-term Treasury bills caused a further drop in discount rates. The rate on the 90-day bills fell by 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.13 percent. A week ago, the rate on the 90-day bills was 7.37 percent. The rate on the six-month bills fell by 4 basis points, to 7.16 percent, and the one-year bills lost 3 basis points, at 7.17 percent.
 
Shorter Issues Up
Among the shorter Treasury coupon issues, the new 8 1/8 percent notes of 1992 rose by 2/32, to 100 8/32, as its yield fell to 7.98 percent, from 8.02 percent the day before. The new 8.5 percent notes of 1994 gained 5/32, to 100 17/32, as its yield declined to 8.34 percent, from 8.38 percent.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8.75 percent issue due in August 2000, climbed by 14/32, to 99 23/32.

Underwriting Fees Decline Sharply

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The squeeze on Wall Street profits grew tighter in the last quarter, as fees for underwritings of securities fell by more than half, to their lowest levels in six years, and corporate America began to pull back from raising money in the capital markets.
The bad news for the third quarter ended yesterday was reflected in most types of securities issued. Corporations issued a total of $72.6 billion, down from an anemic $73 billion issued in the third quarter of last year, according to the Securities Data Company. 
The poor showing for the quarter did not drive the underwriting results for the year to date below those for the period last year. Securities Data reported that $238.09 billion has been raised by corporations so far in 1990, compared with $217.18 billion in the first nine months of 1989.
Investment bankers said that the bad results in the third quarter were caused largely by the world events that have thrown the financial markets into turmoil.
''This quarter the new-issue market clearly has been dominated by the events in the Persian Gulf, the increased prospects for a recession and, more recently, problems in the banking system,'' said Mark A. Seigel, a managing director with Morgan Stanley & Company.
 
Industrial Companies Active
Wall Street analysts also said that most issuers were large industrial companies. ''The industrials were the bulk of the issuance,'' said Edson Mitchell, managing director at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''The financial issuers were not active.''
In some ways, the appetite among the industrial companies for debt issuance reflected the difficulties of the ''junk bond'' market, which virtually collapsed over the year, underwriters said. With hostile takeover bids financed by junk bonds becoming more a memory than a threat, the investor interest has focused again on investment-grade debt, they said.
Reflecting that change, the demand for private borrowing through the bond market climbed slightly in the third quarter. According to Securities Data, $68.55 billion in debt was issued during the quarter, up from $63.36 billion in the period last year.
But corporations have been much less able to issue debt that is not secured by assets. Only $19.76 billion in unsecured debt was issued in the third quarter, compared with $27.81 billion a year earlier.
That drop has been made up in part by mortgage and asset-backed debt. Such securities were the strongest element of the debt market in the third quarter, with $46.95 billion being issued, compared with $33.64 billion in the period last year.
 
New Stock Issues Drop
The issuance of common stock, which had been growing popular throughout the year, also plunged sharply in the third quarter. Only $3.3 billion in stock was issued in the period, compared with $6.1 billion a year earlier.
Indeed, the difficulties in the financial markets have slowed the trickle of initial public offerings to a near standstill. In the quarter, only $1.55 billion was raised by companies going to the capital markets for the first time, compared with $3.76 billion a year ago.
The difficulty in underwritings has increased the competition among investment banks, helping to drive down fees. The disclosed fees in the third quarter were less than half those a year earlier, with firms getting only $339 million from underwritings, down from $785.6 million.
For the first nine months, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ranked as the leading underwriter of domestic issues, with $37.5 billion in securities, or 15.8 percent of the total market. It was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Company, with $32.08 billion, or 13.5 percent of the market.

Midway Air Is Cutting Staff

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
In another sign of hard times in the nation's airline industry, Midway Airlines Inc. said today that it was cutting its staff by 10 percent, putting about 500 people out of work.
''These actions are necessitated by escalating fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis,'' Midway's chairman. 
David Hinson. said in a statement.
Midway, based in Chicago, has already begun cutting staff and said some under-used routes would also be canceled to increase lagging profits.
All flights to Savannah, Ga., will be suspended as of Nov. 1, and Midway will also withdraw from service eight of its aircraft that are the least fuel efficient.
Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the cost of jet fuel has risen sharply. Most domestic airlines are also struggling with slow ticket sales because of a softening economy.
Midway employs about 5,700 people. About 500 administrative and other staff from across the country will be laid off, a spokeswoman, Sandra Allen, said. She said Midway expects to complete the layoffs within 30 days, but she declined to say how much money the carrier expects to save with the cuts.
 
Midway's hubs are Chicago'
Midway Airport and Philadelphia International.
Midway's stock rose 50 cents today, to $5.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Chase Reduces Staff 10% at Unit

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, which last week announced a significant retrenchment, said it had reduced the staff in its North America Corporate Finance unit by 238, or nearly 10 percent. This was the initial step in Chase's plan to slash 5,000 jobs because of a downturn in the banking business. Last week, Chase said it would take a charge of $1 billion in the third quarter and halve its quarterly dividend to 30 cents.
The company said the largest portion of the reduction in the Corporate Finance department was in operations and support personnel. Chase said the cutback had taken place in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta and Toronto.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Down by 2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The prices that farmers receive for raw products declined by 2 percent from August to September, but the overall commodity index was still 3.5 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.
Lower prices were reported for corn, hogs, potatoes and cattle. They more than offset increases for apples, broilers and eggs, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report. 
Milk prices were at a record high for September, but cattle prices were down slightly from the all-time record levels of August. Hog prices were down sharply from August.
''The 25-cents-per-bushel drop in the corn price from August to September was the largest month-to-month decrease since a 28-cent decline during the same two months in 1986,'' the report said.
Wheat prices fell by 10 cents a bushel in September, after a 28-cent decline in August, 29 cents in July and 32 cents in June. At $2.48 a bushel, wheat prices at the farm were down by $1.24 from a year ago.
Most prices are mid-September averages that will be revised next month. The latest report, for example, showed that August prices declined by seven-tenths of a percent, instead of the 1.3 percent drop indicated a month ago.
Consumer food prices, meanwhile, are going up by 5 percent to 7 percent this year, department economists say, compared with 5.8 percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
A recent forecast this week put 1990 net cash income of farmers at a record of $59 billion to $63 billion, up about a tenth from last year. The previous high was $57.2 billion in 1988.
Based on the preliminary figures, the September price index for all crops was down by 2.4 percent from August and was 2.4 percent below a year earlier. Wheat and feed grains were down from August, while soybeans were unchanged.

Ways to Trim Tax Liabilities

BYLINE: Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Savvy taxpayers will use the last three months of the year to pare their tax liabilities, while strengthening their personal finances. And there are a number of ways to do this, regardless of uncertainty over what Congress may do on the tax front.
''Do what makes economic sense, and don't try to second-guess Congress,'' said John L. Norman Jr., national director of taxation in the Washington office of Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm. There are too many conflicting pressures to predict Washington's direction, he added, citing budget talks, Middle Eastern events and the fear of anti-incumbent feelings, which he said leave ''everyone searching for ways to protect themselves.'' 
Joel S. Isaacson, a partner in Weber Lipshie & Company in New York, offered several pointers that make economic sense. ''This is the time of year when everyone gets forms from companies'' asking them to make choices on cafeteria plans -flexible spending plans that allow pretax money to be used for needs like child care or health care -401(k) tax-deferred retirement plans and other benefits, he said.
By taking some compensation through these company sponsored benefits, rather than as taxable salary, an employee can save money on taxes as well as provide money for important needs. One client is putting $5,000 into a flexible spending plan for child care and will save $2,000 in taxes, Mr. Isaacson noted. Using after-tax dollars and claiming a tax credit for child care was worth only $480 to him.
Self-employed people can make tax-deferred retirement savings through a Keogh plan, he said, but such plans must be set up by the end of the year.
Mr. Isaacson advised taxpayers to ''project income for 1990'' to avoid an I.R.S. underpayment penalty on one hand or paying too much in taxes on the other, which amounts to giving the Government an interest-free loan.
Taxpayers are expected to pay an amount equal to 100 percent of last year's taxes or 90 percent of this year's, through withholdings, quarterly estimated taxes or a combination. People who find they will not meet either standard can avoid the penalty if they can increase withholdings sufficiently in the fourth quarter.
But given the current state of the market, many people may find that they have overpaid in taxes. Those who find they have overpaid by making estimated payments equal to 100 percent of last year's taxes can cut their fourth-quarter payment, due on Jan. 15.
The current state of the market also provides a strong incentive to consider whether to sell holdings, regardless of how Congress responds to the Administration's call for lowering taxes on capital gains or indexing them to inflation.
''Sit down and check what has been realized to date,'' Mr. Isaacson said. ''If there are large gains, people may want to take unrealized losses in their portfolios.''
Often when people have big winners in their portfolios they are reluctant to sell because of the taxes that will be due. Now, with the market's tumble since Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, they may also have a number of losers, so it might be appropriate to sell both the big winners and the losers, he said.
The decision should be based primarily on an assessment of the stocks, but the important point from a tax perspective is that there is no limit to the amount of capital losses that can be taken against capital gains, but only $3,000 worth of losses can be used to reduce ordinary income. Any excess must be carried forward to future years.
One thing to remember, Mr. Isaacson said, is that mutual funds may generate capital gains distributions, so people with both stocks and funds may want to telephone the funds and find out what their prospects are.
For people who are reluctant to take a capital gain now, just in case Congress reinstates some sort of preferential treatment later, Elliott Eiss, a tax lawyer and senior editor with the J. K. Lasser Institute, said, ''Get your records in shape, so you're in position to make a decision once Congress acts.'' Even if there is agreement on a tax bill, he noted, there could be last-minute changes.
Another important planning point is the alternative minimum tax. Mr. Isaacson recommended that taxpayers make a preliminary calculation to see whether they would be liable.
For those who are not liable, appreciated securities are one way to make a nice contribution to a favorite charity, take a deduction at market value and escape any capital gains tax. Another way to increase deductions is to pay as much state and local tax as possible before the end of the year. But both of these deductions are what are known as A.M.T. preference items, so taxpayers need to know where they stand before acting.
Traditional tax advice is: accelerate deductions, defer income. Mr. Isaacson said that probably holds true for people in the 33 percent marginal bracket, but perhaps not for those in the 28 percent bracket. They may be due for a rate rise next year.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators In Big Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The Government index designed to predict turns in the economy dropped 1.2 percent in August, the biggest fall since just after the 1987 stock market crash, the Commerce Department reported today.
While the decline in the measure, the Commerce Department's composite index of leading indicators, was not significantly worse than generally expected, most analysts took it as further evidence that the economy was veering into recession or might already be there.
''Beginning in the fourth quarter, the real gross national product will fall,'' said Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 
Some Not Convinced
But a sizable minority still found reason to contend that a downturn can be avoided, a position that seemed to be supported by a calculation of the National Bureau of Economic Research that the chance of general recession beginning before February was just 3 percent, the same probability it found in July. 
In addition, The Conference Board reported this week that consumer confidence, which plunged in August, remained unchanged in September and that consumer expectations rebounded slightly. Consumer psychology is considered a crucial indicator, since the consumer accounts for two-thirds of the economy, or $3.6 trillion of the $5.4 trillion a year G.N.P.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he remained skeptical about a recession, although he said the economy was doing no better than moving ''sideways'' now and would probably continue to show no growth for the balance of the year. 7 of 11 Components Drop Seven of the 11 components of the leading indicators index contributed to the August decline, with the biggest factors being a drop in consumer expectations and stock prices, both related to the Persian Gulf crisis.
The other negatives were declines in contracts and orders for plant and equipment and in manufacturers' unfilled orders, a rise in initial claims for state unemployment insurance, a drop in building permits and a decline in the M-2 money supply.
Four components made positive contributions but two of them, analysts said, should not be regarded as favorable developments. A rise in the length of the workweek may be showing that employers are working existing employees longer to avoid hiring new workers at an uncertain time, and a rise in sensitive materials prices mainly reflected the surge in oil.
The other two items that moved up were vendor performance - suppliers making slower deliveries, presumably because of better business - and manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. Failed at Task? The 1.2 percent drop for August followed virtually unchanged readings for July and June, prompting comments that if the economy has already entered a recession, the leading index failed to perform its task of forecasting such economic shifts several months in advance.
The index is regarded as having become quite unreliable over the last decade and some economists believe that efforts to improve it, by adding such new elements as the University of Michigan's survey of consumer expectations, have helped little.
The Commerce Department also reported today that its indexes of coincident and lagging indicators declined five-tenths of 1 percent and three-tenths of 1 percent, respectively. This was the first time since August 1982, in the late stages of the most recent recession, that all three of these indexes fell in the same month.
An alternative predictor, the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging one, fell modestly in August.
A private index constructed by Safian Investment Research fell 2.11 percent in August, the biggest monthly decline since October 1981, when it fell 2.95 percent, but one not as broad as other sharp monthly declines in recent years. Eight of the 23 components rose.
 
Yet Another Index Down
Still another predictor, an index compiled by David B. Bostian Jr. of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, fell to minus 92 from minus 81 last month. A reading of minus 50, reached a year ago, signals recession within six months.
Geoffrey H. Moore, who, as director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University Business School, is perhaps the nation's leading authority on business cycles, told a meeting of business economists here this week that the predictive factors show a mixed pattern and that it was ''very difficult'' to say whether the expansion that began in November 1982 was an end, But if it is, it probably ended in June, he said.
Prof. James H. Stock, an economist for the National Bureau of Economic Research, offered a somewhat optimistic forecast, telling the group that there was less indication of a credit crunch than before the 1973 and 1979 recessions, that the decline in housing had been gradual and not precipitous, that stock prices were an unreliable predictor and that the retail price of gasoline would have to reach $2 a gallon to be as expensive in real terms as it was in 1980.
William C. Melton, chief economist for I.D.S. Financial Services in Minneapolis, said he expected some sort of mild recession but added that so far, for whatever reasons, ''the consumer is hanging in there.''

HEADLINE: Oil Problem Termed 'Manageable'

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency said today that while the global oil-supply situation ''is not comfortable,'' it is ''manageable'' enough that there is no need to call on the agency's 21 members to tap their strategic petroleum reserves. But the agency did say its members should be ready to draw on reserves quickly in an emergency.
On Wednesday the United States announced the sale of five million barrels from its strategic reserves, in what was widely seen as a signal that other nations should follow suit.
While the United States had clearly hoped the agency would adopt more vigorous measures today, it became obvious that most members did not plan to dip into their reserves. Still, American representatives here said they were pleased that other members had committed themselves to be ready to act quickly if the need arose. 
 
'Adequately Supplied'
Attributing the sharp rise in oil prices to market speculation, the agency said at the end of a one-day meeting here, ''Eight weeks after Iraq's invasion, world oil markets remain adequately supplied and no product shortfalls have been experienced by I.E.A. countries.''.
After rising sharply on Thursday, oil prices held steady in New York trading today, with crude for November delivery dipping 3 cents a barrel, to $39.51. [Page 33.] The communique from the agency, which represents all industrial democracies, was agreed to by all its members. It also warned that with the world's oil supply system stretched to its limits, any further supply disturbances might well bring about an emergency meeting that would immediately authorize the use of the strategic reserves.
''We will act if necessary but not before,'' said Ulrich Englemann, chairman of the agency's governing board and director general for energy in the West German Ministry of Economics. ''The timing of such an action is crucial.''
John Easton, the United States representative at today's meeting, said: ''We wanted everyone to be prepared to act quickly, and they have said they would. We've cleared the underbush, because we know the system is tight and there is no more flexibility.'' Mr. Easton is Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the Energy Department.
 
Oil Company Action Urged
Today's communique also said that oil companies should speed releases of oil from their stockpiles to ease the strain on prices.
Various delegates conceded that the fast, steady rise in prices was not likely to encourage many oil companies to unload stocks as long as they thought they could sell them later at higher prices. But they said they hoped the companies would at least refrain from stocking more oil.
''For the time being prices are driven not by fundamentals of the market but by traders' speculation on expected developments in the gulf crisis,'' said Helga Steeg, the agency's executive director.
Asked if the agency would leave the reserves untouched even if prices went above the current $40 a barrel, Mrs. Steeg said: ''It is not that the I.E.A. does not see the burden of higher prices on us and others, but the question is: What can be done about it here? We are not a financial agency. We are concerned with energy demand and supply.''
Together the 21 members have about 1.7 billion barrels of oil in government storage or in oil company stockpiles.
The group said that if any shortfall in supplies occurs at this point it will convene an urgent emergency meeting where representatives will come supplied with ''necessary ministerial authority'' to take binding decisions.
It called on oil companies to ''draw on their commercial stocks and to exercise discretion in purchases in order to reduce uncertainty and volatility'' in world oil markets.

Quiet Moves at Bank Talks: A Reshaping of East Europe

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The Middle East crisis dominated the speeches and news conferences at the annual meeting this week of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But away from the newsmakers, in hotel rooms outfitted with conference tables, Eastern Europe's emerging free market economies were quietly being shaped.
The Eastern Europeans themselves might still be arguing about the pace of transition from central planning to free markets. But for the I.M.F. and the World Bank, the issue is settled: It should be done quickly, with the promise of loans as pressure to speed up the process. 
''If someone comes to us and says, 'We want to do it gradually,' we go a long way to talk them out of a gradual approach,'' said Eugenio F. Lari, the World Bank's European chief.
Last fall, when Eastern Europe threw off Communism en masse, he wasn't so sure of himself. ''We had a fleeting temptation to sit back and see how the transition worked, and then make loans,'' he said. ''But that would have made us irrelevant.''
The Poles and the Hungarians have been big borrowers this year, although the Hungarians have had misgivings about the quick-transition strategy. Their worry was that unemployment, say, would become unbearably high if all price ceilings were removed overnight or state companies were sold too rapidly. But the Hungarians are coming around, Mr. Lari said. ''As of the moment, none of our members are talking gradualism.''
Czechoslovakia, a new World Bank-I.M.F. member, is the next most likely big borrower, and Mr. Lari, greeting visitors in shirt-sleeves and suspenders, got into loan talk with Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovak Finance Minister, like him an enthusiast of go-fast transition.
World Bank loans are particularly important for the transition process because they finance projects that help make free markets work: importing machinery, for example, for newly private factories, or financing unemployment insurance.
The I.M.F. has a different sort of leverage: more than $1 billion in loans outstanding in Eastern Europe to provide badly needed hard currency to pay foreign debts and bills.
 
Rival Soviet Delegations
 For the Soviet Union, the issue also was transition economics. The Gorbachev Government, up for I.M.F.-World Bank membership, sent five officials - and found themselves upstaged by a rival Soviet delegation.
The Gorbachev people presented themselves as quiet agnostics on the transition issue, since the Soviet Parliament has not yet decided whether the transition should be a slow process, as Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov advocates, or a speedy one, in accord with the ''500 Day Plan'' of Stanislav S. Shatalin. The 12 unofficial delegates came to sell the Shatalin plan.
George Soros, a Wall Street financier, paid the air fares and hotel expenses of the Shatalin group. And the delegates - six helped to write the 600-page plan - had sessions with anyone whose good opinion of the Shatalin ideas might carry weight with the Soviet Parliament.
The roster included prominent American economists and Congressmen, European central bank chieftains and corporate executives. An Izvestia reporter traveled with the members of the team and sent back dispatches on their salesmanship.
''We seek understanding, and if there is understanding, there will be support,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the 37-year-old Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Republic, a leader of the group. English translations of the 600-page plan were also passed out.
Mr. Yavlinsky's English was weak, and when he got stuck during an interview, Mr. Soros pitched in with the Shatalin plan's virtues and intricacies. Mr. Soros grew up in Hungary, made a fortune on Wall Street in the 1980's and now supports foundations he established in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to promote rapid transition to free markets.
 
Rising Cost of Loans
 With considerable fanfare, I.M.F. officials promised more loans to help offset the cost of higher oil prices. But not much was said about their rising cost for the borrower - usually a poor underdeveloped nation.
The I.M.F. has roughly $10 billion outstanding in short-term credits carrying an interest rate of 9.7 percent a year. The average floating rate in recent years has been 7.5 percent.
The problem is, the I.M.F. is essentially a glorified credit union, and too many of its borrowers today are behind on repayment. What the institution has traditionally done is raise the money it lends at, say, 7.5 percent by borrowing, largely from member nations, at 6.5 percent, and pocketing the percentage point difference to cover administrative expenses.
Now, however, nine borrowing nations are $4 billion in arrears on repayment, depriving the I.M.F. of interest income to cover costs. The temporary solution has been to increase the interest rate spread, partly at the borrower's expense -just when interest rates around the world are rising anyway.
Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, suggested this week that the major lenders - the United States, West Germany, Japan and other industrial nations - provide special subsidies for third world borrowers, or some other relief.
''There was not a lot of sympathy for his suggestions among the major nations,'' said Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, an I.M.F. senior adviser.

The Economy
 Legislation to regulate the cable TV industry was set back when objections forced supporters of the bill to withdraw it from consideration on the Senate floor. The action was a big blow to consumer groups and aspiring rivals of the cable industry, who had been counting on the measure to help limit price increases for cable service and to foster increased competition. [Page 1.] The Government index designed to predict turns in the economy dropped 1.2 percent in August, the biggest fall since just after the 1987 stock crash, the Commerce Department reported. [31.] The prices that farmers receive for raw products declined by 2 percent from August to September, but the overall commodity index was still 3.5 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said. [32.] Fees for underwritings of securities fell by more than half in the last quarter, to their lowest levels in six years. [33.] White House officials agreed in budget negotiations to a higher income tax on wealthy Americans in return for a lower capital gains tax, officials from both parties said. [1.] The special counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee has recommended that the panel clear two senators under investigation for their links to the savings debacle, Congressional officials said. [1.] 
 
 
 
Companies
 Stephen Lane resigned as president of Emerson Radio, saying it was an effort to spare the company further adverse publicity over his financial affairs. [31.] Whitman announced a long-awaited revamping but surprised analysts by including the spinoff of its profitable food division, Pet Inc., its biggest unit. [33.]
 
International
 The global oil-supply situation ''is not comfortable,'' but it is ''manageable'' enough, the International Energy Agency said, adding that there is no need to call on the agency's 21 members to tap their strategic petroleum reserves. [31.] The meeting of the World Bank and the I.M.F. was dominated by the Mideast crisis, but away from the newsmakers, in hotel rooms outfitted with conference tables, Eastern Europe's emerging free market economies were quietly being shaped. [31.]
 
 
 
Markets
 In September, prices of ''junk bonds'' plunged further, to new lows, after the record-setting decline of junk issues in August. [31.] Mutual fund companies are seeing a flight to safety and quality, fund managers said. [31.] Crude oil prices closed little changed after dropping sharply in the early afternoon and then staging a late rally. Oil for November delivery dipped 3 cents a barrel, to $39.51. [33.] Stocks posted a solid gain after plunging early in the day, fed by a broad selloff in Tokyo and unfounded war rumors. The Dow added 25, to 2,452.48. [34.] Prices of Treasury securities continued to advance, largely on the belief that the Bush Administration and Congress will hammer out a budget agreement this weekend. [34.] The dollar gained against all major currencies except its Canadian counterpart in unusually slow trading. [40.] Soybean futures prices fell and grains were mixed in a day of thin, quiet trading. [40.]
 
 
 
Today's Columns
 Savvy taxpayers will use the last three months of the year to pare their tax liabilities, while strengthening their personal finances. There are a number of ways to do this. Your Money.

HEADLINE: An Odd Sort Of Underdog

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 28

 BODY:
From the beginning, Pierre A. Rinfret's blustery and combative persona was well suited to his underdog campaign strategy against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. As an underfinanced and unknown challenger, Mr. Rinfret knew he would need the ''free media'' to bolster his name recognition, and a little outrageousness goes a long way in winning headlines.
Theoretically, the hyperbolic, theatrical style that Mr. Rinfret mastered as an economic consultant could have been used to tap public discontent over taxes and crime.
But during the last two weeks, when Mr. Rinfret has railed not at Mr. Cuomo but at the party that chose him, the Republican candidate has turned the conventional notion of anti-establishment politics on its head. 
 
Different Brand of Rebellion
Mr. Rinfret reversed his position on one campaign issue today, agreeing to two televised debates with Mr. Cuomo and two other candidates for governor. [Page 27.] Political strategists are increasingly convinced that unlike the uprising staged by John R. Silber, another angry outsider who won last week's Democratic gubernatorial primary in Massachusetts, Mr. Rinfret's brand of rebellion cannot succeed.
While Mr. Silber aimed his assault at a discredited political establishment, Mr. Rinfret has focused his attacks on obscure issues that have little resonance with the electorate.
''In a campaign, where you pick your targets carefully, you certainly don't make Mario Cuomo No. 3 on your hit parade behind the press and the Republicans,'' said Robert D. Squier, a consultant for Mr. Silber.
As if to symbolize the last two weeks of his campaign, Mr. Rinfret held a typically argumentative news conference here today. He began by leading reporters through a series of charts documenting New York's economic decline and crime explosion, each bearing the slogan: ''Blame Mario Cuomo.'' But when reporters began asking questions, Mr. Rinfret eagerly ignored his own message and instead revisited his bizarre political demonology, in which a handful of Republican state senators have supplanted Mr. Cuomo.
In the parlance of modern politics, obscuring your own theme is called stepping on your story. It has become a habit for Mr. Rinfret almost since he was nominated, whether when apologizing for attacking Mr. Cuomo's children or proposing to arm 100,000 vigilantes to combat crime.
The pattern continued today. At a business convention in Niagara Falls, he criticized two Republican Presidents - Ronald Reagan for running up large budget deficits and Gerald R. Ford for being unable ''to step off a curb and chew gum at the same time.''
 
Inside Baseball
In his Albany news conference, Mr. Rinfret devoted much of his time to regaling reporters with war stories about his ''battle'' with State Senator Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan, who recruited Mr. Rinfret, and State Senator Guy J. Velella of the Bronx, the chairman of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee.
Unlike the targets of Mr. Silber's campaign, Francis X. Bellotti and the Democratic establishment that he represents, Mr. Goodman and Mr. Velella are hardly household names. And Mr. Rinfret's feud with them over political and financial support is strictly inside baseball, not a debate over visceral issues that affect most New Yorkers.
But that has not deterred Mr. Rinfret. Today he began a comic description of his financial solicitations of the senators, asserting at one point that Mr. Goodman was ''as tight with money as anybody in this world.''
 
Denies a Deliberate Strategy
He said Mr. Goodman, who has at least $1 million in two political accounts, slipped him an envelope during one meeting. ''We opened it up and we almost fainted,'' Mr. Rinfret said mockingly. ''It was enormous, mind boggling, took us by surprise. It was $2,000.''
Mr. Rinfret also declined to shed any new light on his apparent misunderstanding with J. Patrick Barrett, the state's Republican Party chairman. Mr. Rinfret said on Thursday that Mr. Barrett ''hasn't been a leader'' and had offered to resign, a contention that Mr. Barrett denied.
Mr. Rinfret said today that his attacks on his fellow Republicans had not been a deliberate strategy based on the Silber model. And in an interview on Thursday he said that the significance of Mr. Silber's victory as evidence of the country's anti-incumbent mood did not dawn on him until this week.
Rather, he said, he was legitimately angry that he had accepted a Republican Party draft that no one else would take and then could not win support from the party's leaders for his budget proposals or his financial needs.
''It was not a Machiavellian strategy,'' he said today. ''It was simply a case of how do we turn our people on.''
Yet Mr. Rinfret believes that the strategy has been effective. He spoke today of being greeted by cheering crowds and of money that he said is again flowing across his transom. And he clearly relishes being on the attack, even if he might be missing the target.
''I think I've been taking a couple of so-called professionals to the cleaners pretty good lately,'' he said. ''You may disagree with my tactics, but you've got to admit I'm beginning to get my way the way I want it.''
 
Voters' Negative Feelings
The internecine Republican warfare, which has been splashed across front pages, clearly has improved Mr. Rinfret's name recognition. But it almost certainly has also increased voters' negative feelings about him, which even his own polls have shown to be twice as high as his favorable ratings.
Shortly before Mr. Silber's election, polls showed that he had disapproval ratings above 40 percent, a political barrier usually considered too high to hurdle. But Douglas E. Schoen, the New York City pollster hired by Mr. Silber, said Mr. Silber was able to overcome his deficiencies by convincing voters he would be a vehicle for change.
''He had a rationale for his candidacy,'' Mr. Schoen said. ''Pierre Rinfret doesn't represent anything except bombastic rhetoric.''
But Mr. Rinfret clearly thinks he has discovered a successful formula, even if the establishment that he opposes includes his political creators.
''People have come to detest, absolutely detest, politicians,'' he said today. ''They don't want to touch them, they don't want to deal with them. They don't want to believe anything they have to say.''

HEADLINE: BUSH DROPS FIGHT FOR A LOWER TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The White House today dropped its insistence on a tax break for capital gains, opening the way for a compromise with Congress on reducing the Federal budget deficit.
Word of the shift came from people with direct knowledge of the budget talks. With their deadline close at hand, Congressional leaders and White House officials met into the night to lock up the final elements of a deal that would cut the deficit by $50 billion in the new fiscal year and $500 billion over the next five years.
Among the measures in the package are a higher gasoline tax and deep spending cuts in Medicare and other domestic programs. Congress has scheduled an unusual Sunday session so that action can be taken before the fiscal year begins on Monday. 
The capital gains concession is bound to be seen as a political defeat for President Bush, but officials for both parties said the White House preferred no capital gains break to a higher income tax on the wealthy, which Democrats had insisted on as a tradeoff. With the President yielding on capital gains, Democrats were ready to drop their call for higher income taxes on the rich. As of this afternoon, it appeared the final deal would not change tax rates.
 
Recalling Campaign Pledge
The capital gains issue had deadlocked the talks for months. President Bush maintained that lower rates or some other favorable treatment be given for capital gains, which are profits on the sale of investments. He said that was essential to promoting savings and investment and to stimulate the flagging economy. Democrats argued that better treatment for capital gains would be a windfall for the wealthy.
On Friday, Administration officials agreed in negotiations to accept higher tax rates. But in the end, a Republican said, Mr. Bush determined that higher rates would violate the ''no new taxes'' pledge that was the staple of his election campaign.
As for the capital gains break, another Republican official said, ''We just couldn't get it.''
As a concession to the Administration, Democrats agreed today to new tax breaks for science laboratories, investments in small businesses and businesses formed in poor neighborhoods. These steps will allow Republicans to assert that the budget deal is ''growth oriented.''
The loss of the capital gains feature is bound to disappoint Congressional Republicans, even though they felt less strongly about it than did Mr. Bush.
 
Where Spending Will Drop
Even before this step was taken, some Republicans were threatening to vote against any deal that contained higher taxes. The measure under consideration would raise the gasoline tax by 8 cents a gallon to 17 cents, impose a tax on other kinds of fuel and apply higher taxes to alcoholic beverages and some luxury items.
Other deficit-reduction measures tentatively agreed to by the negotiators include an increase in insurance premiums paid by the elderly for doctors' care under Medicare, an increase in the deductible for treatment paid for by Medicare, a five-year limit on all domestic spending to the amount needed to keep pace with inflation and a reduction in military spending.
The purpose is to lower the deficit in the $1.3 trillion Federal budget from the current $250 billion to a level in the low double digits.
The Administration officials and lawmakers have been racing the clock to reach a compromise before across-the-board spending reductions required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law go into effect automatically on Monday, the beginning of the new fiscal year.
President Bush has promised to veto any measure that extends the deadline unless the outline of an accord is drawn.
 
Devastating Effects Feared
Without new appropriations, the Government would be forced to close down Monday except for a few essential employees like prison guards.
Government workers have been ordered to report to work as usual Monday morning but have been told they will be sent home if the politicians remain deadlocked.
Even if Congress approves an accord in its Sunday session, it is likely to be in the form of a continuing resolution meant to keep the Government functioning on a temporary basis. Lawmakers say it would take days and possibly weeks to enact the tax and spending bills to implement an accord.
The budget law requires that the deficit be reduced to $64 billion in the new fiscal year. Economists and politicians agree that the steps needed to reach a target that low would be devastating to the economy. So part of the deal will be to revise the annual deficit levels over the next five years.
The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, canceled plans to join President Bush in New York tonight for a reception for a United Nations conference on children.
 
Social Security Discussed
The White House said the President was prepared to return to Washington immediately if he were needed to ratify a budget agreement.
While the top White House officials and Congressional leaders met in the office of Speaker Thomas S. Foley on the second floor of the Capitol, other officials and lawmakers met elsewhere over the other main area of dispute, Social Security.
Both sides have tentatively agreed that Social Security beneficiaries should bear some of the cost of deficit reduction, but they have disagreed over how.
Democrats want to tax a higher portion of the benefits of retirees with moderate and high incomes. Republicans want to delay cost-of-living increases for all Social Security recipients.
 
A Different Perspective
Favorable tax treatment of capital gains has always been more important to President Bush than to Republican leaders in Congress.
Senator Dole and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, had suggested that the White House back off its position on the issue. So had Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the top Republican on the Budget Committee.
But the President and his chief negotiators, Mr. Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, held fast. Mr. Bush had campaigned for a lower capital gains tax as well as for no tax increases.
Apparently, the White House decided that the capital gains pledge was expendable, while opposing higher tax rates was the last vestige of the President's promise not to raise taxes.
Until 1986, capital gains were taxed at a lower rate than other income. Republicans cite studies showing that a reduction in the capital gains tax is an incentive for investment and entrepreneurship.
The monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986 was based on a compact between the two parties. The top overall tax rate to 28 percent from 50 percent. In return, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as wages and salaries.
 
Preparing for Worst
While lawmakers and Administration officials were working in the Capitol, the managers of Federal departments and agencies were trying to determine what to do if the political deadlock could not be broken. They face at least two alternative circumstances, agency officials said, and they have no way to predict which will occur.
One is that the Government is left entirely without a budget when the fiscal year begins Monday, if Congress fails to pass one or President Bush rejects it. In the other, Congress would pass a temporary budget at the last minute, but with a deficit so big that it would trigger steep automatic spending cuts throughout nearly every agency of government.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND VIETNAM REPORT PROGRESS ON RESTORING TIES

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
In their highest-level discussions in more than a decade, the United States and Vietnam took what appeared to be a significant step toward the resumption of diplomatic relations yesterday.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, talked for 30 minutes at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in what a senior State Department official said was ''an exceptional meeting.''
The official said the meeting was ''a step in the direction'' of normalization of relations, but that it technically ''did not constitute the commencement of normalization discussions.''
 
Travel Restrictions Waived
The United States has not had normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam since North Vietnam's defeat of the United States-supported South Vietnamese Government in 1975. In the late 1970's, President Carter sent Leonard Woodcock, the head of the United Auto Workers Union, to Hanoi to discuss the renewal of relations, but the effort ended when Vietnam invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978. Since then talks between Washington and Hanoi have been conducted by middle-level officials. 
At the meeting yesterday, Mr. Baker waived the travel restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats to allow the Foreign Minister to travel to Washington to meet with Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is the President's special envoy to Hanoi on humanitarian issues. Two Stumbling Blocks The Administration wants the Vietnamese to cooperate more fully on solving the issue of 2,300 servicemen who were listed as missing in the war in Indochina or who failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps. About 70 percent of those men are missing in Vietnam, with the remainder missing in Laos and Cambodia.
That and the Cambodian issue are the two main stumbling blocks to the normalization of relations. The Bush Administration has tied renewed relations to verification of a complete removal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia.
At his meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Thach promised that Vietnam would withdraw all its troops and advisers from Cambodia and work to solve the conflict.
In a communique after the meeting, the Vietnamese said the two countries agreed ''to take concrete steps that are conducive to the normalization of relations between the two countries.''
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said, ''The Secretary urged the Vice Premier to accelerate Vietnam's unilateral efforts to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue, thereby pre-positioning both countries for improved relations once a Cambodian settlement is achieved.''
The Vietnamese, who said that Mr. Thach would travel to Washington in two weeks after meetings with other world leaders in New York, praised the outcome of the meeting.
''Both sides reiterated their support for an early agreement on Cambodia in the Paris International Conference,'' the Vietnamese statement said. ''The two sides also agreed to accelerate the resolution of humanitarian issues of mutual concern, including the M.I.A. and the humanitarian needs of Vietnam.''
 
Prisoner Issue Stressed
The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia, then under the control of the Khmer Rouge, in 1978 and installed the Hun Sen Government. Vietnam announced the withdrawal of its troops last September, but there have been reports that some units and advisers remain to assist the Hun Sen Government in its war against the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla movement.
The Secretary and Foreign Minister began by discussing prisoners of war and the missing in action, State Department officials said.
''The Secretary emphasized his and the President's personal commitment to the fullest possible accounting,'' a senior official said.
''The pace and scope of normalization will be directly effected by progress on this issue,'' the official said. ''To emphasize the priority that the President and the Secretary give to this issue, the Secretary said he was prepared to make an exception to our travel restrictions that normally keep Vietnamese officials within 25 miles of New York City.''
The waiver would allow the Foreign Minister to hold a one-day meeting with General Vessey and Ann Mills Griffith of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.
The Foreign Minister has also received an invitation to meet with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 
U.S. Stand Reiterated
The second part of the discussion centered on a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia.
''The Secretary reiterated our standing position that normalization of relations with Vietnam could take place only in the context of a political settlement in Cambodia, again with the pace and scope of normalization affected by the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue,'' the senior State Department official said.
The official said progress had been made in the last few weeks on the Cambodian problem.
''Vietnam has played a constructive role in these developments,'' he said. ''Much more remains to be done as we move first to an agreement that would be signed at a Paris conference and beyond that to full implementation of that agreement.''
Mr. Baker told Mr. Thach that he saw a satisfactory conclusion to the Paris conference on Cambodia as an important step toward the establishment of diplomatic relations, State Department officials said.
''The Vietnamese have heard this before, but I think it was important for them to hear it from the Secretary,'' the senior official said.
 
The Next Step to Peace
Vietnam's recent decision to cooperate with the United States in resolving the conflict in Cambodia was a major factor that led to the warming of relations, American officials said.
They said the next step in the peace process there would be final agreement on the composition of a Supreme National Council.
The issue ''hanging up final action'' has been the number of people who should be on the council and who should head it, the senior official said. ''That subject was discussed,'' he added.
Mr. Thach briefly raised the issue of the United States economic embargo against Vietnam, State Department officials said.

HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN;
World's Leaders Gather at U.N. for Summit Meeting on Children

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
More than 70 world leaders will meet here on Sunday to adopt an ambitious set of goals to improve life for poor children throughout the world.
The first World Summit for Children, the largest gathering ever of heads of state at the United Nations, is to approve a declaration committing their countries to reducing the number of infant deaths in the world by a third by the year 2000. They also plan to halve the number of women who die in childbirth and guarantee that children everywhere will have access to clean water and basic education by the end of the century.
 
Long List of Goals
The leaders, including President Bush and Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and Margaret Thatcher of Britain, will pledge to achieve a long list of health and education goals that also include reducing malnutrition, raising the average weight of newborn infants, eradicating polio and making prenatal care and family planning advice available to all.
The pledges, which were accepted by participating Governments after weeks of intense negotiations, are described as one of the most ambitious attempts ever made by the international community to address children's needs. Participants are hailing the declaration as a powerful illustration of the growing conviction that improving health and education is one of the keys to reducing third world poverty. 
In the view of many economists and development experts, much of the aid spent on large industrial development projects in the third world has been wasted. The new approach favors making people healthy and giving them the skills to create their own wealth.
The unusual number of ranking leaders and their spouses and retinues in New York for the meeting caused caused headaches for planners and a surge of diplomatic and social activity at the city's hotels and restaurants. [Articles, pages 14 and 17.] The meeting's leaders will also urge all countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted last year by the United Nations General Assembly after a decade of discussion. Although 109 countries have signed the convention and more than 40 have introduced legislation in their parliaments to ratify it, the United States has done neither. American conservatives have criticized the Convention because it does not condemn abortion and it opposes the executions of people under 18 years of age.
It is unclear whether any of the leaders attending the conference on Sunday will be able to pledge new money toward the costs of meeting the child health goals. The United Nations Children's Fund, which conceived the idea of the summit meeting and played a central role in organizing it, said aid-giving community must channel an additional $4 billion to $6 billion a year to developing countries for the rest of the decade to meet the targets.
Developing and industrial countries wishing to achieve these goals will also need to increase their own domestic spending on child care and educational projects by $14 billion to $16 billion a year during the decade, Unicef says.
Also Implicit in the meeting's timing, at the end of the cold war era, is an understanding that governments will give children the first call on any peace dividends they collect from reduced military spending in a more orderly world. In the third world alone, military spending is now running at more than $200 billion a year.
 
Forces Come Together
''Two separate forces are coming together at the summit. The realization we can save millions of children's lives through underutilized, low-cost technologies,'' James P. Grant, the executive director of Unicef said in a recent interview. '' and the end of the cold war, which should liberate billions of dollars wasted on armaments.''
Organizing so vast a meeting of world leaders as the session on Sunday has meant severe headaches for the New York City authorities and for United Nations officials. For weeks now they have been struggling with the daunting task of preventing enormous traffic snarls as 71 motorcades converge on the United Nations headquarters and protecting this unprecedented gathering of political leaders against possible terrorist attack.
Because of the throngs of diplomats involved, some leaders will leave their hotels as early as 6 A.M. to make it to the United Nations in time for the start of the proceedings at 9:30, officials say.
 
Sensitive to Criticism
The meeting cost $5 million to organize, all of it paid for by individual national donations. The participants are sensitive to the possibility that the elaborate meeting will be criticized as an expensive and unneccessary public-relations exercise by politicians hungry for the favorable publicity they expect to gain from endorsing a series of child-care goals.
But in a recent interview, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, a co-chairman of the meeting, strongly defended the gathering's usefulness as a means of strengthening the participating governments' commitment to these goals and making sure they live up to their commitments in practice.
''The summit has the potential to put children's issues on the top of the international agenda in the same way the Stockholm World Environment Conference of 1972 put environmental problems so firmly on that agenda,'' he said.
''Summits do what nothing else can do: put leaders face to face with each other and raise public awareness of the issue,'' the Canadian Prime Minister added. ''There is nothing like for galvanizing a bureaucracy.''
The idea of a children's summit meeting was proposed by Unicef in September 1988 and won the support of United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Mr. Grant of Unicef said. The plan was then quickly endorsed by Sweden, Zimbabwe and Canada.
 
Unicef's Earlier Success
What gave Unicef the confidence to propose that the world set new health and educational goals for children. in the 1990's was its success in persuading governments to meet the earlier health goals it set for them in the 1980's together with other interested United Nations agencies.
Unicef's aim in the last decade was to raise the percentage of children in the world who are fully immunized against a number of serious but preventable diseases from 15 percent in 1980 to 80 percent by this year. In fact, Immunization coverage is estimated at around 73 percent today, only slightly short of the target.
''We realized we could get enough support from governments to achieve these goals,'' says Richard Jolly, Unicef's deputy executive director for programs and a noted British delevopment expert.
Another factor encouraging the agency to seek governments' backing for new child health targets was the availability of many relatively inexpensive and simple cures for some of the most lethal children's diseases, and particularly oral hydration techniques for dealing with diarrhea, Dr. Jolly says.
The cost of achieving such goals will not be prohibitive if donor countries put more emphasis on primary health and education care projects by restructuring their aid budgets.
Total world aid to the developing world is currently running at around $50 billion a year and is expected to increase by $1 billion a year, or 2 percent annually, over the next decade.
Of this total only about 3 percent currently goes to primary health, education and sanitation projects. But Unicef calculates that earmarking all of the annual 2 percent annual increment for such projects would double the amount of assistance going to these sectors.

HEADLINE: Hofstra Coach Is Slain on Sidewalk

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
An assistant football coach at Hofstra University was shot to death early yesterday outside a restaurant near the school by a man in what appeared to be a bungled robbery attempt, the police said.
The coach, Harry Healy, 25 years old, was sitting with four friends eating on a curb outside a fast-food restaurant not far from Hofstra's campus in Hempstead, L.I., when the shooting took place about 3:50 A.M., said a spokesman for the Nassau County Police, Officer Andrew DeSimone.
A Nassau County Police Detective, Sgt. Daniel Severin said, ''it appears it was a robbery attempt gone bad.'' 
Mr. Healy had been employed by Hofstra as one of the assistant coaches of the Flying Dutchmen football team at the school since August, said a university spokesman, Michael DeLuise.
Mr. Healy had received a degree in economics from the University of Connecticut in 1987 and was taking graduate courses in economics at Hofstra, but ''wanted to coach football,'' said Mr. DeLuise. ''This was a dream for him.
 
Football Game Dedicated
Later, after word of his death had swept the campus, the football team's game against the University of Buffalo Bisons at Hofstra yesterday afternoon, which Hofstra won 44-0, was dedicated to Mr. Healy's memory.
''The team had chapel service before the game,'' said Jim Sheehan, the director of sports information. ''It was very emotional, to say the least.''
Mr. Healy and four friends had gone to the restaurant, Arby's, at Fulton Street and Duncan Road, for a late-night snack after leaving a popular college hangout, McHebe's Depot, a bar on Fulton Street, shortly before closing time. They ordered food at the walk-up window, the officer said.
As they sat on a curb eating, two men walked up to the group, the officer said. ''There was some brief conversation,'' said Sergeant Severin. ''Exactly what was said - 'Get up, get down, don't move' - we're not 100 percent sure.''
The gunman shot the young man from a distance of about eight feet in ''a deliberate shot,'' Sergeant Severin said, but why he picked out Mr. Healy was unclear.
None of the other students was injured and the two men fled on foot.
Mr. Healy was taken to the Nassau County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 4:21 A.M., said Officer DeSimone.
No gun was recovered and there were no immediate suspects.

HEADLINE: Youth Program's Mixed Day: $100,000 Won, $250,000 Lost

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
A Cambridge, Mass., youth training program hailed as a model for the nation got a dose of good news and a jolt of bad news on the same day last week.
Hours before the program accepted a $100,000 prize from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University, it learned it had lost $250,000 as a result of the budget cuts in Massachusetts.
The program, Work Force Unemployment Prevention, provides counseling, tutoring and jobs in local businesses to teen-agers in the low-income housing projects of the Cambridge Housing Authority. 
It was one of only 10 state- or city-financed programs selected from 1,552 contestants in a national competition by the Ford Foundation and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The prizes, the Innovations awards, were created in 1985 to recognize state or local government activities that address social and economic issues. Winners are selected by a committee headed by former Gov. William G. Milliken of Michigan.
 
'We're Going to Fight'
The Cambridge program was part of a $310 million budget cut announced last week by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a package that included money for adult literacy education and English courses for immigrants. The program had been threatened with elimination in January, but was spared after a campaign led by teen-agers and parents.
At the awards ceremony in New York on Wednesday, Steven J. Swanger, the program's founder, said: ''We're going to fight to be reinstated and get our supporters to write letters. There are thousands of families in Cambridge who know what this program has accomplished.''
Work Force will continue to operate for now and has just registered a new group of 125 teen-agers, Mr. Swanger said. Officials of the Ford Foundation said the awards were not to be used for operating costs, but rather to help educate and train others interested in copying the program.
 
New York to Alaska
Another award winner was Export, a program of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that is the nation's first publicly supported trading company created to help small businesses compete in world markets.
Among the other winners were an Alaska program, Inupiat Ilitqusiat, that seeks to protect the traditional Eskimo culture and curb the high rate of alcoholism and suicide; and a program in Ramsey County, Minn., that for the first time uses automated teller machines to dispense public assistance benefits.
The other winners were Specialized Treatment and Rehabilitation Services for Sexually Abused Boys, of Merced County, Calif.; the Landfill Reclamation Project in Collier County, Fla.; the Farm Family Assistance Program of Iowa; Project Deliver, an obstetrical care program in Montgomery County, Md.; Medical Care for Children, in Fairfax County, Va., and the recycling program in Seattle.

HEADLINE: Old Angers Still Fresh As Indians Meet Lujan

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Sept. 28

 BODY:
At one of the largest gatherings of American Indian tribal leaders in recent years, the meeting itself became the most contentious issue, with some Indians raising the oldest charge of all against the Federal Government: trickery.
Nearly 700 tribal leaders gathered here on Friday at the invitation of Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to join in consultations about a planned reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
But as Mr. Lujan and other officials described their plans, many tribal leaders seethed with resentment at being presented with what one called ''a done deal.''
At one point, Wayne Ducheneaux, a Cheyenne River Sioux with a dramatic handlebar mustache, stood up to demand a halt to the entire proceeding, which he said was ignoring the views of the Indians. 
''You say you want consultation with the Indian tribes, but I don't think you truly want it,'' said Mr. Ducheneaux, who is president of the National Congress of American Indians, a major intertribal group.
The main subject of the meeting was the creation of a separate bureau in the Department of the Interior to administer education on Indian reservations, and a resulting realignment of responsibilities within the department's Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A broader context for the discussions was the Federal Government's stated policy to move toward greater autonomy for the more than 500 tribes in this country. A banner in the ballroom of the Four Seasons Hotel read, ''Expanding self-determination: Tribal-Federal partnership.''
For the last century and a half, life on the reservations has been dominated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which today oversees schools, law enforcement, courts, social services, forests and fisheries, electric power systems, banks and construction projects. The reservations remain among the most poverty-stricken areas in the country, with unemployment as high as 70 percent.
But at the meeting here, questions of reorganization and self-determination sometimes became lost in the issue of consultation, which seemed to resonate for many with the ancient hurts of their relations with Washington.
''Consultation is one of the code words in a relationship that sums up a set of problems that is hard to define,'' said Sam Deloria, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe who is an expert on Indian affairs at the University of New Mexico Law School.
''The sense of being aggrieved is part of the nature of the relationship, and it manifests itself in complaints about consultation,'' he said.
 
Complaints Are 100 Years Old
Officials from Washington also brought with them long memories of the difficulties of the relationship. ''These complaints go back 100 years,'' said one.
Responding to Mr. Ducheneaux's comments, Eddie F. Brown, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, told the leaders, ''I commit to you today that I will be working with area directors and that I will personally be out at major hearings around the country.''
But speaking to a small group of reporters, he said: ''You will never at any time have all of the 500 tribes happy. You will never have maybe 50 percent of the tribes happy.''
Given the history of the relationship, he said: ''The tribes are wary. Is this all part of an agenda for something else, for chopping the budget?''
Although Mr. Lujan repeatedly affirmed his commitment to maintaining the Federal Government's trust responsibilities toward the Indians, the tribal leaders received few details on how the reorganization would affect budgets and funds.
''This is like giving the Indian tribes a Christmas tree'' said Wendell Chino, chairman of the Mescalero Apache tribe. ''It looks very nice, but there are no presents under the tree for the Indian tribes.''
Indeed, there was some poignance to the scene as a series of tribal participants, accepting the invitation for consultation, rose to offer their thoughts on the creation of a Bureau of Indian Education. Just a little while earlier, Mr. Lujan and Mr. Brown had told reporters that plans for the new bureau were complete and were already being presented to Congress.
Ernie Lovato, the chairman of the Santo Domingo tribe, who also heads a group of 10 Pueblo tribes in New Mexico, spoke of the Government's ''one-sided consultations.''
''We are not some little guys any more,'' he told the gathering. ''We've gone through the mill; we've been to the Justice Department, to Congress. We know what we're talking about.'' Tribal leaders have complained for years that a paternalistic bureaucracy holds them back from developing initiative and responsibility, while failing to meet their needs. Thomas Sansonetti, the Interior Department's solicitor, said President Bush wants to develop ''government-to-government'' dealings between the tribes and Washington.
Federal officials estimate that more than $3 billion is spent annually on Indian affairs, most of it going for the more than 330,000 Indians living on 260 reservations. A total of 1.37 million Indians were counted in the 1980 census.
Self-determination, which has been on Washington's agenda for 20 years, would mean a difficult shift that would involve not only complicated bureaucratic readjustments but a maturing of tribal leadership. ''The majority of tribes are not capable of self-governance at this time,'' said Leaford Bearskin, chief of the Wyandotte tribe in Oklahoma.
On Monday, the Quinault Indian Nation of Taholah, Wash., becomes fully independent, one of seven tribes in a project to test self-governance.
''The hardest thing was to convince our own people that we could do it,'' said Joseph De La Cruz, the tribe's chairman. ''Now we don't have all the bureaucrats to go through, all the hoops and the red tape.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
P.L.O. Embarks on Biggest Gamble in Many Years by Moving Closer to Iraq

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 28

 BODY:
As the Persian Gulf crisis drives ever-deeper schisms through Arab ranks, the Palestine Liberation Organization and its chairman, Yasir Arafat, have embarked on a political gamble with stakes as high as any the organization has faced in many years of crisis.
Driven by the pro-Iraqi sentiments in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and among the Palestinian majority in Jordan, Mr. Arafat has deepened already intimate ties with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, condemning the United States military buildup in the region and promoting a settlement that would reward Iraq for its invasion with territorial and economic concessions by Kuwait.
In the process, diplomats, Palestinian officials and other specialists said, Mr. Arafat has moved to secure a constituency on the streets but has lost, probably for a long time, the support of the so-called moderate Arab states, which, a year ago, took his case to Washington, sponsored his avowed peace campaign and represented his only means of bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on Israel.
 
Speaking for Palestinians
His calculation, his supporters say, is that whatever the outcome of the gulf crisis, the Palestinian issue will re-emerge high on the regional agenda and someone will have to speak for the Palestinians, and that he will survive to fulfill that role. 
But the sense of betrayal among the so-called moderate Arabs after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and the opprobrium Mr. Arafat's close ties to President Hussein have generated in the West, are such that many diplomats, officials and commentators in the region argue that Mr. Arafat is courting hazards as extreme as any in a career marked by a conspicuous ability to invite, then survive disaster.
''No one can totally exclude the possibility that Arafat will re-emerge as someone who has to be taken into account,'' said a Western European diplomat here. ''But he has made it that much more difficult, because he has given the Israelis and others the ammunition to say what they have always said: that he is not a reliable interlocutor.''
 
Nurtured Anti-Americanism
The origins of Mr. Arafat's close ties to Baghdad predate the newest crisis in the Persian Gulf by many months and lie in a tangle of issues that undermined the P.L.O.'s alliance with Egypt and nurtured the profound anti-Americanism around the figure of Saddam Hussein.
In the welter of passions since the invasion, the whole focus of the Arab world has shifted, forcing Arab states to take sides not on the easy issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, or even directly on the invasion of Kuwait itself, but on the personality of Saddam Hussein as a champion of Arab rights against the foreign military intrusion.
''Objectivity has become a curse,'' said Assad Abdul Rahman, a prominent P.L.O. analyst and professor of political science in Amman, Jordan. ''If you don't say, 'Long live Saddam,' you are totally blamed by the Iraqis and you will suffer. If you don't say yes to Jaber and the American military interference, then again you are treated badly by the other side.'' Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah is the Emir of Kuwait.
 
Stage Set for Conflict
Yet, since the beginning of the year, diplomats and officials argue, events have set the stage for conflict pitting a Baghdad-led coalition of Palestinians, Jordanians and others against the United States and its Arab allies.
The alarms first came from Jordan, whose leaders expressed concern about the prospect of huge Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel, and sought out Iraq's strength as a counterweight to what King Hussein perceived as an Israeli threat.
At the same time, United States diplomatic efforts to set up a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Cairo seemed to slow, even as some Palestinians began to accuse Mr. Arafat of making concessions to the Israelis and Americans while getting nothing in return.
Then, possibly sensing a mood of frustration and worry in the Arab world, President Hussein announced on April 1 that if attacked, he would burn half of Israel with chemical weapons.
 
Sources of Baghdad's Strength
''It contributed to his image as the only guy who has built a credible military force to bring the Israelis to the negotiating table,'' Mr. Abdul Rahman said in a telephone interview from Amman. ''When he stood up to the Americans, that was another source of strength.''
''He represented the only hope for the Palestinian Arab,'' he said, adding that with his attacks on the oil-rich skeikdoms of the gulf, where ruling families wield immense power and wealth. ''Saddam managed to market himself as the Robin Hood who was going to redistribute Arab wealth.''
In May, Mr. Arafat toured the Arab world, drumming up support for an Arab summit meeting in Baghdad on May 28 that produced attacks on Egyptian diplomacy and effectively shifted the center of gravity from Cairo toward the more bellicose Baghdad. An abortive Palestinian terrorist attack on Israeli beaches, staged just as the summit was drawing to a close, finalized the breach between the more radicalized Arabs and the United States. In June, citing the beach assault, Washington severed the dialogue it started with the P.L.O. in December 1988, after Mr. Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.
 
'That Was the Climax'
''That was the climax,'' said Mr. Abdul Rahman, a member of the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council, who is not formally aligned with any of the P.L.O.'s factions.
From the West's point of view, and in the view of the so-called moderate Arabs led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the invasion of Kuwait is the burning issue of the day. But for Baghdad's allies, the issue is the American buildup in response to the invasion.
''People are not thinking about Kuwait,'' Mr. Abdul Rahman said. ''They say the most important thing is the American invasion of Saudi Arabia and the gulf. Palestinians are saying they will not allow the Americans to destroy the only hope for the Arabs to bring the Israelis to the negotiating table, that is, Saddam Hussein.''
But the invasion also put the the P.L.O. in the difficult position of supporting an action it has long condemned. For decades in the conflict with Israel, the P.L.O. had declared the inadmissiblity of forceful territorial acquisition as an argument against Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights.
 
Attempt to Mediate
P.L.O. officials argue that the organization never endorsed the occupation of Kuwait - even though it refused to support an Arab League resolution condemning it - and has sought instead to mediate the dispute so as to persuade Iraq to withdraw, a role the United States and moderate Arabs reject.
''The P.L.O.'s position is simple,'' Nabil Shaath, a leading Cairo-based adviser to Mr. Arafat said. ''If we can help in ending the occupation of Kuwait, then we can move on to ending the occupation of Palestine.''
The P.L.O. position offers concessions to the Iraqi leader. Without offering Iraq incentives, P.L.O. officials argued, it will not leave Kuwait without a fight.
 
Support Is Closed Off
But the concessions are opposed by the West and the bloc of moderate Arabs, and in breaking with the moderate Arabs, Mr. Arafat has closed off powerful channels of diplomatic and financial support.
Shortly after the invasion, the rulers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates refused him permission to enter their countries. Saudi Arabia has reduced its once substantial aid to his movement. Egypt, whose leader, Hosni Mubarak, has called Saddam Hussein a traitor, has placed restrictions on the entry of Palestinians into the country. Kuwaiti officials say that if they get their country back, there will be no leniency towards those among the 350,000 Palestinians in Kuwait deemed to have helped the invaders in any way. And many Western nations, including the United States, no longer wish to acknowledge Mr. Arafat.
''The whole issue is, who will speak for the Palestinians?'' said a senior Western diplomat. ''At one time, we were getting pretty close to the P.L.O. in disguise at the negotiating table. Now, that is not going to work.'' Offending the Americans An Arab diplomat put it somewhat differently: ''The more Arafat offends the Americans, the less chance he has of getting them to deliver. And he's offended them a lot.''
Many Egyptians, too, have been incensed by the P.L.O.'s shift away from Cairo. ''Egyptians by and large trusted Arafat,'' said Ismail Sabry Abdullah, a left-wing politician and former Cabinet minister. ''Now Egyptians blame him. They don't understand his attitude.'' ''Egypt will never abandon its position of principles on the Palestinian issue,'' he said in an interview. ''But there's a problem of public opinion. That is something very precious. Once diminished, it's hard to correct.''
That assessment seemed reflected the other day in the Government-owned daily newspaper Al Akhbar, which printed a cartoon showing Mr. Arafat embracing a Kuwaiti while holding a dagger to his back. The cartoon illustrated a lengthy article castigating P.L.O. members as duplicitous cowards who had exploited, or turned against, every Arab country that gave them refuge. Such hostility elsewhere in the Arab world leaves the P.L.O. leader with few options for the time being but to stand close to Baghdad.
While some Egyptian newspaper commentators have taken to speaking of Mr. Arafat's imminent demise, there are other arguments. In 1982, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon forced Mr. Arafat out of Beirut. In 1983, Syrian-backed forces drove him out of Tripoli, his last toe-hold in a country bordering Israel. In 1987, at an Arab summit, his cause was all but forgotten as Arab states focused on Iraq's war with Iran. On each of those occasions, his demise was forecast, too.
This time, ''he did not maneuver with his usual skill,'' a West European envoy said. ''But alliances in this part of the world tend to form and re-form, and that could provide other opprtunities for him.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Kuwaitis Say U.S. Doubts Embargo Will Get Iraq Out

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Senior Kuwaiti officials say they believe the Bush Administration has concluded that it can no longer rely on the embargo of Iraq to force the Iraqi army out of the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
The officials, who insisted that they not be identified, said that neither President Bush nor Kuwait's Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, specifically mentioned using military force in their two-hour meeting and lunch at the White House on Friday.
''But there was a consensus among us that waiting for the embargo to work would mean the death of Kuwait and that there were few, if any, other options available short of military action,'' one of the officials said.
In interviews, other diplomats, American legislators and a senior Administration official did not dispute the Kuwaitis' impression that the Administration was re-evaluating the embargo. But rather than describe the change as a policy shift, they said the White House was turning up the pressure a notch to make sure that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has gotten the message. 
 
Bleak U.S. Prognosis
The most public expression of the Administration's tougher mood, they said, was the statement by Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, on Friday after the meeting with the Emir that the ''systematic destruction'' of Kuwait was shortening the time that the United States could wait for economic sanctions to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
But for at least a week, the Administration has been giving a bleak prognosis in private discussions with Congressional leaders and diplomats. For example, President Bush told a bipartisan meeting of Congressional leaders a week ago Friday that the destruction taking place on the ground in Kuwait, among other factors, would make it difficult to adhere to the Administration's stated goal of squeezing and ultimately forcing Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait through the sanctions, according to participants at the White House meeting.
Similar sentiments were expressed in the meetings with the Kuwaitis on Friday at the White House. After those sessions, the Bush Administration decided to make public Kuwait's concern and Washington's private impression that there might be nothing left to save in Kuwait if it waited for the sanctions to achieve their stated goal.
''What the Emir's visit has done,'' said Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, ''was enabled the Administration to go public with their private conclusion that there would be no Kuwait left to save if the original timetable - six to eight months - were permitted to play itself out.''
 
U.S. Troops Could Lose Edge
The concern expressed by Kuwaiti officials reinforced other doubts within the Administration, Congressional and Administration officials said. Those include a concern that American military forces, which are expected to be fully deployed within a month, would ''lose their edge'' as time passes, an official said.
A second factor is concern that the United States would be reluctant to engage in military action during Ramadan, Islam's holy month beginning in mid-March, or during the Haj pilgrimage next summer, periods when the effects of the embargo are likely to be widely felt in Iraq.
A third reason is the Administration's concern about intelligence estimates indicating that Iraq might be ready to deploy biological weapons by early next year.
The Administration has not yet officially abandoned its policy of waiting for the embargo to press Iraq into withdrawal. And it has stopped short of an explicit warning of American military action. While it has not explained what other steps in addition to the embargo it is contemplating, Mr. Scowcroft said after the meeting with the Emir that the plundering of Kuwait might prompt the United States to seek another United Nations Security Council resolution, possibly including an explicit mention of military force.
 
Optimistic Kuwaiti Delegation
''In our meeting, President Bush expressed his determination to liberate Kuwait - one way or another,'' said a senior member of the Kuwaiti delegation who insisted on not being identified.
The mood of the 27-member Kuwaiti delegation in New York was optimistic after the standing ovation given to the Emir at the United Nations on Thursday and his visit to Washington on Friday.
''The support was overwhelming,'' said Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's Finance Minister. ''We received a total commitment for the liberation of Kuwait.'' He declined to state whether total meant that President Bush had signaled his determination to use military force. But other delegates said there had been an implicit acknowledgment by American and Kuwaiti officials that the use of force seemed ever more likely.
A senior Administration official who insisted on not being identified said the only differences that emerged during the sessions concerned what he called the timing of stronger measures.
 
U.S. 'Must Be Ready'
''The Kuwaitis would like to have used force yesterday, today or tomorrow,'' the official said. ''But President Bush has other factors that must be taken into consideration - political factors.''
A senior Kuwaiti official said that after Friday's discussions in Washington, ''even differences of timing'' were less consequential than before. ''We know that the Americans must be ready - politically, militarily,'' he said.
Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, Kuwait's Ambassador to the United States, seemed eager to avoid the impression that Kuwait was pushing Washington to use military force. He repeatedly stressed that the Emir had not specifically recommended military action in his meetings with President Bush, senior National Security Council officials, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
''We did urge the Administration to push for the visit of an independent entity - be it the Red Cross or Red Crescent, or even reporters or correspondents - to Kuwait so that the devastation on the ground can be documented,'' he said in an interview Friday.
 
Kuwaiti Base Offer Denied
''The point of these meetings was really to highlight the plight of the people inside Kuwait,'' the Ambassador said. ''That has been our main concern.''
He said that no new commitments had been made and no new groups formed to monitor the situation. ''We've simply agreed to keep in daily and constant touch,'' he said.
Kuwait's Minister of Planning, Sulaiman A. Mutawa, dismissed previously published reports that Kuwait had offered the United States a permanent base in the country when and if the Iraqis were forced out.
''There was never any discussion between us of such an arrangement,'' he said. ''It shouldn't be ruled out and it shouldn't be ruled in. But talk of such arrangements and of other steps that relate to our commitment to democracy are putting the cart before the horse.''
 
'A Bloody Wasteland'
''In the meantime, I'm watching my country die,'' he said. ''The flower that was in bloom is being trampled into a bloody wasteland. The longer it goes on, the less there is of Kuwait.''

Soviets Hint at a Role In U.N. Military Action

 BODY:
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has indicated that if the United Nations Security Council authorizes a military force to act in the Persian Gulf crisis, Soviet troops might take part.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr. Shevardnadze had suggested that if the economic embargo against Iraq failed, Moscow might support a military operation sanctioned by the United Nations. His new remarks appear to be a slight elaboration on that, but they stopped short of promising Soviet troops for such a force.
The remarks, from a taping of the ''Meet the Press'' televison program to be aired today, were made available yesterday without comment by White House officials who were in New York with President Bush.
In the interview, Mr. Shevardnadze was asked, ''If it comes to a military action of some kind, will Soviet troops be participating with the U.N. forces?''
He replied: ''Well, this will all depend on the decision to be taken by the Security Council. We are a permanent member of the Security Council, and we will comply with any decision, with any resolution of the security council.
''This is our position of principle. And that would include anything regarding the involvement of the Soviet troops under flag, under the auspices, of the United Nations,'' he said.

U.S. Explores New Strategies to Limit Weapons of Mass Destruction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Iraq's emergence as a regional superpower, bristling with missiles and chemical arms and close to producing nuclear ones, is prodding the Bush Administration to consider new strategies to stem the worldwide spread of mass-destruction weapons, according to Government officials.
Those strategies, known as fallback positions to some, spring from the growing conviction that some of the basic technologies needed to wage highly destructive wars, like the ability to build ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, have become too widespread to control easily.
Administration officials said the Persian Gulf crisis had led experts to press to achieve two new aims: to keep developing nations from acquiring technologies that could make their existing weapons even more lethal, and to dissuade their leaders from using the advanced arms, such as chemical weapons, that they already have.
''It's no longer enough to try to curb proliferation,'' a senior State Department official said in a recent interview, ''because in a number of cases proliferation has already occurred.'' 
 
Iraq's Strength Cited
While that idea is not novel, the gulf crisis has brought it home to policy makers with new force, officials said. Besides its ballistic missiles, chemical and possibly biological weapons and an active nuclear-bomb program, Iraq has amassed an armed force that experts say is the technological equal of NATO countries such as Italy, a nation with three times Iraq's population and 30 times its gross domestic product.
A chief concern is that technologies with military applications are moving into everyday use faster than the ability of Western nations to control their export. For example, computers used for such diverse purposes as regulating printing presses and reconciling checking accounts can be used to operate missile-launching sites, and guidance systems in commercial aircraft can be modified to guide ballistic missiles.
''The issue isn't really that these people have Scuds,'' said W. Seth Carus, a proliferation expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, referring to a crude short-range ballistic missile that the Soviet Union has sold to Iraq and about 20 other developing nations. ''The issue is that they know how to make Scuds. That means they no longer have to rely on Western technology.''
The Central Intelligence Agency has predicted that 20 developing nations will produce their own missiles within a decade. Already, Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and South Africa produce or are close to producing their own missiles. Most also have nuclear weapons or advanced nuclear programs.
 
Nuclear Arms for Iraq
Many private experts and Israeli scientists believe Iraq will be able to produce a crude nuclear weapon in three to five years.
The missiles now in third-world inventories are too inaccurate to threaten specific enemy targets, arms experts say, and for now few such nations are believed able to launch a chemical or nuclear warhead with confidence that it will detonate on impact.
Nevertheless, experts in the transfer of military technology at the Central Intelligence Agency have begun an extensive assessment of the technical and scientific abilities of developing nations, an official said.
The Bush Administration has begun to dust off cold war arms-control policies, such as confidence-building agreements between hostile nuclear powers, for use in trouble spots.
''We need to focus more on what we can do, once weapons of mass destruction have proliferated, to build in fire bricks against their use,'' a senior official said. ''We need to talk more to the Soviets about it, and we need to talk to the Western Europeans about it.''
 
New Alliance Suggested
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d suggested one cold war tack last August when he raised the prospect of a new military security alliance, along the lines of NATO, that would counterbalance Iraq. The Soviet Union proposed another in February 1989, when it called for a military threat-reduction center in the Middle East to detect and defuse potential conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Some, even within the Administration, question the depth of this newfound devotion to third-world arms control. Those doubts were underscored this month, when the White House approved the export of parts for a new three-stage missile that Brazil is developing, despite compelling evidence that Brazil has shared missile and nuclear technology with Iraq.
Others say the idea that East-West arms control tactics will work in the Middle East is absurd.
 
Mideast Wars 'Endemic'
''There are slight differences between the cold war and the Middle East,'' Mr. Carus said. ''In the worst of the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union talked to each other. There are a number of countries in this region that don't even talk to each other covertly.''
''And despite our tensions, the U.S. and the Soviets never fought a war,'' he said. ''In the Middle East, wars are endemic.''
Yet the United States has already tried nuclear diplomacy in at least one trouble spot. In March, after intelligence officials warned that India and Pakistan were approaching war over the border state of Kashmir, Robert M. Gates, the deputy national security adviser, flew to both countries on a peace mission.
An Administration official said that Mr. Gates conveyed American worries that the two nations were drifting ''ineluctably toward war, worst-casing each other's intentions,'' without real awareness of the potentially catastrophic consequences.
Mr. Gates suggested that the two sides consider steps long used by the United States and the Soviet Union, including allowing observers at military exercises and creating zones where troop maneuvers are banned, to lessen each side's mistrust of the other. Pakistan and India have since conducted talks on confidence-building measures.
Western nations have cooperated to limit the export of missile technologies since 1987. The Soviet Union pledged to join that effort in February, potentially plugging a large hole in the technology embargo, officials said.
But Administration officials said the effort to curb the trade in weapons technology and components has become increasingly difficult at a time when the West has lowered its own standards for exporting many technologies that have both civilian and military uses.
Cocom, the alliance of American and European nations that regulates the export of technologies to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, decided in June to drop many barriers to the sale of such dual-use items to emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
That allows American and European firms to sell mid-range computers, aircraft guidance systems, oscilloscopes and other high-technology goods to former Warsaw Pact nations at will, even though such goods can also be used to design, test and navigate missiles and other weapons. Other, more sensitive items can now be approved for export subject to controls on their destinations and uses.
''No one is under the illusion that the Eastern Europeans are going to be able to protect everything they get,'' said one Government expert in technology theft, who declined to be named, referring to losses to smuggling.
''You're going to see a situation where Eastern European intelligence agents who have worked for Qaddafi, Hussein or whoever, including the Soviets, are looking for new work,'' the Government expert said in a recent interview. ''And as new trade opportunities pop up there, the diversion opportunities are going to be great.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Behind Iraqi's Oratory, Cautious Game Is Seen

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In the city's hotels, officials of President Saddam Hussein's Information Ministry have set out, in several foreign languages, an imposing array of speeches and statements that Mr. Hussein has made since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The themes running through many of them are that Kuwait's annexation is ''eternal and irreversible'' and that Iraq is ready to fight and prevail in a war against the United States.
Prompted by those statements, and a variety of indications from Kuwait that Mr. Hussein is consolidating his hold, the Bush Administration has tightened military, economic and political pressures on Baghdad and hinted that the crisis may ultimately have to be resolved by war. At the United States Embassy here, diplomats make little secret of their conviction that nothing will budge Mr. Hussein from Kuwait but his military defeat, unless Mr. Hussein unexpectedly loses his position of absolute power. 
 
Steps to Limit Risks
Elsewhere in Baghdad, there are people who are not yet convinced that Mr. Hussein is as implacably committed to his course as he has sounded in his diatribes.
Some oblique hints from senior Iraqi officials have suggested to Western diplomats that Mr. Hussein may have realized that neither Iraq nor his leadership have much chance of winning a war against the United States. Further, the diplomats say, there are signs that Mr. Hussein is taking steps to limit the risks of sliding into a war by accident or by a provocation that would give Washington a reason to strike.
Those who take this view suffer from the same disadvantage as those who believe that Mr. Hussein cannot be dissuaded from a course that will plunge the region into conflict: None of them have talked with the Iraqi leader directly, at least not since Aug. 2, and they thus rely on their reading of Mr. Hussein's character and record. The Iraqi leader operates in tight secrecy and nobody in the capital in recent days has been able to say whether the President is even in Baghdad, much less to avow that they are privy to his thinking. Decision Not Yet Made? Still, the view among the diplomats, who include several Western ambassadors, is that Mr. Hussein has probably not yet made a final decision on what to do about Kuwait, and that much depends on matters that may take weeks or months to become clear.
Among the factors are the impact of the United Nations embargo on Iraq's military effectiveness. The sanctions have cut off badly needed spare military parts. Along with this, there is the possibility of popular discontent over mounting food shortages. Perhaps most important, there is the question of whether the common front mounted against Iraq by the United States and the Soviet Union, along with Western Europe and several important Arab allies, can be maintained.
Attempting to drive wedges into this alliance is likely to be a major preoccupation of Mr. Hussein in the weeks ahead, the diplomats said.
When the diplomats speak of moves by Mr. Hussein that suggest a concern not to provoke a war, they cite several things. One was the Foreign Ministry's rapid backing away from a diplomatic note delivered to Western embassies last weekend in which the ministry appeared to be threatening diplomats with execution by hanging if they persisted in giving sanctuary to Western men who have been declared hostages by Mr. Hussein. About 200 men are staying at the American, British and other missions or in diplomatic homes.
 
Note Withdrawn After Calls
After calls to the Foreign Ministry by Joseph C. Wilson 4th, the American charge d'affaires here, asking whether the ministry intended to hang him, the diplomatic note was withdrawn.
Other recent incidents tend to support a belief that Mr. Hussein might be playing a cautious game behind his oratory. First, there was Baghdad's instruction to the captains of Iraqi ships to comply with orders to submit to inspection by United States naval vessels in the Persian Gulf. The order was given before the United Nations gave its backing to such actions, and was designed, diplomats say, to avoid the risk of a confrontation.
This week, the Information Ministry took steps to ease tensions created when Mr. Hussein implied last Sunday that Iraq might strike first if its population of 18 million people is ''strangled'' by the embargo. Officials drew reporters' attention to an official Iraqi translation of the statement by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council in which the key paragraph in the speech included a phrase not present in Western translations.
 
First-Strike Phrase Omitted
As translated from Arabic by The Associated Press, whose version was widely used by Western newspapers, the statement did not include the qualifying phrase that appeared to make an Iraqi strike contingent on there being ''some who are directing a bloody strike at the Iraqis'' first. The official Iraqi version read: ''If we feel that the people of Iraq are being strangled and that there are some who are directing a bloody strike at the Iraqis, we will strangle all those who are the cause of such a state of affairs.''
The diplomats cautioned that they were far from persuaded by such moves that Mr. Hussein was preparing to relent over Kuwait, only that he was intent for now on avoiding war.
''Saddam is his own worst enemy,'' an envoy said. ''He heads one of the least pleasant regimes in the world, he's offended every single Western sensibility, and he compounds it all by issuing statements that talk about Iraq being ready for war.''
But the diplomat added, ''Nonetheless, I've come around to thinking that the leadership here is fully conscious of what might take place if war were to occur, and what this would mean personally for Saddam.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Nicaragua to Forgive Legal Claim

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 26

 BODY:
With hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid hanging in the balance, the Bush Administration has begun exerting sharp new pressure on President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to abandon a judgment of as much as $17 billion that Nicaragua won against the United States at the International Court of Justice during the contra war.
Diplomats and Nicaraguan officials say the Administration has given high priority to resolving the court case, which was filed by the leftist Sandinista Government after C.I.A. operatives helped mine Nicaraguan harbors in early 1984. The United States has refused to recognize the court's jurisdiction in the matter, and said it would not pay or negotiate the award.
But the American pressure runs counter to a strong nationalist sentiment among Nicaraguans of all political backgrounds who believe the court decision was an important international victory. That feeling has been fueled by Sandinista leaders, who have portrayed the case as a crucial ''trial by fire'' of Mrs. Chamorro's ability to stand up to the United States. 
''It is a national interest that the United States pay for the damage it caused,'' declared Augusto Zamora Rodriguez, who argued Nicaragua's case as legal director of the Foreign Ministry under the Sandinista Government. ''To say that we must give up that right is to make apologies for violence and to applaud the intervention of the strong against the weak.''
 
Breach of International Law
The court case was first filed by the Sandinista Government in April 1984 after clear evidence emerged of American participation in the rebels' mining of the port of Corinto on Nicaragua's Pacific coast. On June 27, 1986, the court ruled that the United States had breached international law by supporting the contras, and ordered it to pay reparations. Although the amount was not specified, Nicaraguan legal experts say the total has reached as much as $17 billion with interest.
The Reagan Administration and, now, the Bush Administration, have ignored the court's ruling. But Bush Administration officials are said to be anxious to resolve the issue while its leverage over the economically strapped Chamorro Government is still at its height.
Diplomats and Nicaraguan officials here say that the Bush Administration has informed Mrs. Chamorro that future United States aid to Nicaragua will depend on her willingness to abandon the claim.
''The United States wants the matter dropped. That's it, no discussion,'' said one foreign diplomat in Managua.
That message was delivered most clearly earlier this month, when Mrs. Chamorro's chief of staff, Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, visited the State Department for meetings in which the court case was at the top of his agenda.
Mr. Lacayo, who has resisted intense American pressure on issues such as Mrs. Chamorro's decision to permit Sandinista officers to retain key military posts, returned to Managua in a chastened mood.
''We are analyzing the suitability of establishing a commercial treaty between Nicaragua and the United States,'' Mr. Lacayo said at a news conference upon his return to Managua, ''and within that framework, people in the United States Administration and Congress will find the I.C.J. suit difficult to understand. ''We must decide,'' he added, ''whether we should insist on receiving an indemnity that the United States says it will never pay, or accept the friendship of a nation and people that want to look to the future.''
 
New Action Required
Mr. Lacayo reiterated the Government's position that all foreign policy decisions lie entirely within the authority of the executive branch. But in anticipation of such a move, the Sandinista Government rushed through a special law in its last days of office obliging all future governments to press forward with the claim.
That law could be invalidated through new action by the National Assembly, in which Mrs. Chamorro's coalition holds a majority of seats.

HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN;
Bush Is in New York for the U.N. Conference and a Flurry of Gulf Diplomacy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Blending humanitarian concerns with military ones, President Bush arrived in New York yesterday to attend an international summit meeting on children and to engage in three days of aerobic diplomacy designed to send President Saddam Hussein of Iraq a signal that the world's patience is running out.
With a diplomatic schedule that rivals the breakneck pace of his golf game, Mr. Bush began a series of meetings with five heads of state at the Waldorf-Astoria only 25 minutes after touching down at the downtown Manhattan heliport at 3:20 P.M.
In sessions lasting from half an hour to 45 minutes, the President was scheduled to meet President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss of Lebanon, President Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan.
He had more than 15 other meetings set up this weekend around his attendance at the World Summit for Children at the United Nations today, and his delivery of two speeches on Monday to the United Nations General Assembly and the ministerial meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation group that plans a summit meeting in Paris in November. 
 
'All the World Is United'
''The President's bilaterals with leaders are designed to express gratitude for the efforts of countries that have helped us with the Persian Gulf and to send a signal to Saddam Hussein that all the world is united and talking from the same script on the issue of Iraqi agression,'' a top White House official said.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, called the weekend ''a welcome opportunity to consult with his colleagues from around the world at really a sort of unprecedented, or at least a dramatic period in world affairs.''
At a White House briefing on Friday, Mr. Scowcroft implied that the ''systematic destruction'' of Kuwait under Iraqi occupation was bringing the United States and its allies closer to military action.
Mr. Scowcroft said ''there is no question that what is happening inside Kuwait affects the timetable'' for the decision to use military force.
He said Mr. Bush, hearing reports of babies being removed from incubators and critically ill patients from life-support systems, was considering returning to the United Nations to seek tougher sanctions, possibly including an explicit mention of military force, against President Hussein.
 
Leaders From 70 Countries
The Iraqi President was not among the kings, presidents and prime ministers from some 70 countries, from Albania to Zimbabwe, scheduled to attend the ceremonies at the United Nations this weekend. The children's event, described by the United Nations as the largest gathering of world leaders in history, is sponsored by the Unicef.
The only three leaders attending children's summit meeting from the Middle East are President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Ahmed al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who met with Mr. Bush at the White House on Friday, and the Lebanese Prime Minister.
At the children's summit meeting on Sunday, Mr. Bush is to endorse a United Nations plan of action that sets many goals for maternal and child health that the United States itself has had problems meeting. He is also to give a speech outlining what he feels are the positive steps the United States has taken in the education and medical care of children.
''There can be no task nobler than giving every child a better future,'' says the declaration that Mr. Bush and other leaders will sign. Administration officials have said the plan calls for reducing infant mortality and poverty among children while increasing access to family planning services and prenatal care for pregnant women.
 
Pledge of Universal Education
In another ambitious promise, the leaders also are to pledge to provide an education for at least 80 percent of all school-age children in the world by the year 2000.
In his address to the opening of the General Assembly on Monday, the first major meeting of the new post-cold-war era, Mr. Bush is expected to discuss the dramatic revival of the United Nations as a mechanism for world security. The President, who served as the chief American delegate to the United Nations for two years in the early 1970's, credits his time there with giving him an interest in foreign affairs and a taste for personal diplomacy.
In his speech to the delegates and heads of state and government, he is expected to discuss how the world has changed and suggest ways that the United Nations can live up the standards that it set for itself at its founding at the end of World War II.
When Mr. Bush addresses the ministerial meeting of the 35-nation security conference later that day, he is expected to suggest that the grouping serve as another vehicle for the economic and political change in Europe.
 
New European Security Sought
The conference is seeking wide-ranging agreement on the shape of the new security structure that Europe wants to establish this year to preserve peace and respect for human rights in the post-cold-war era.
There are also 23 nations in the security conference who are involved in the negotiations on a treaty reducing conventional forces in Europe. The United States and the Soviet Union hope that the treaty can be signed at the Paris summit meeting, but there are still serious problems in working out the treaty, and the Administration has warned that Mr. Bush would cancel his trip to the Paris meeting if the treaty is not ready.
The President is scheduled to meet with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, on Monday afternoon. He will urge Mr. Shevardnadze to redouble his efforts to make sure that the conventional forces treaty comes together, Administration officials said, and he will send his warm regards to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is struggling at home with an economic morass.
Mr. Bush is also scheduled to meet with the leaders of several Latin American countries that he is planning to visit this winter, including Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina.
 
Thanks for Japan's Leader
Mr. Bush did not plan to attend a banquet last night for the children's summit meeting, and instead scheduled a meeting with Prime Minister Kaifu of Japan to thank him for Japan's financial assistance in the Persian Gulf effort.

HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN: Reporter's Notebook;
A Protocol Nightmare: Silencing World Leaders

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The biggest problem at the World Summit for Children, quite naturally, came from the adults. ''What do you do,'' an official asked, ''when you have 71 world leaders at the same conference and they all expect time to speak?''
The official, who had helped synchronize the speaking schedule for the summit meeting on Sunday, could not suppress a shudder. ''We lost months of sleep over it,''he said. 
There were many protocol nightmares in arranging the largest summit meeting in history. They ranged from motorcade gridlock, and the shape and size of the conference table (a huge squared-off horseshoe) to who would to sit next to Queen Noor of Jordan at dinner tonight. (None, it turned out, as the Queen was a surprise guest at the dinner for spouses at the World Trade Center.) But no dilemma proved as vexing as the silencing of presidents and kings.
''A head of state is saying to another head of state, in effect, 'Shut up.' '' Yves Fortier, the Canadian representative at the United Nations, was explaining the delicate situation that his Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, a co-chairman of the summit, would face as he presided over the morning session. Mr. Mulroney would have to enforce time limits of five minutes, or in most cases four and three minutes.
The United Nations is a body where members are accustomed to limitless oratory. Fidel Castro alone, when there in 1960, spoke for several hours.
If Mulroney lost the nerve to interrupt, Mr. Fortier said he himself would not. ''I will personally steer The Prime Minister's arm on the gavel,'' the diplomat said, noting rather gleefully that stopwatches would monitor each speaker and a red light would flash at any errant grandstanders.
All world leaders are equal, but some are more equal than others. The pecking order, hashed out in months of discussions among the six host countries that initiated the summit, was ingenious, if ruthless. Some leaders, like Presidents Bush and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, were awarded five-minute introductions. Others, like Prime Minister Michel Rocard of France and President Dawda Kairaba Jawara of Gambia, were alloted four-minute ''commentaries.'' Most, including the leaders of Liechtenstein, Suriname and Papua New Guinea, had to content themselves with three-minute interjections during the discussion period.
''We had to discriminate,'' a conference official said helplessly. ''You have to give Bush five minutes, and then you look at other world regions, and figure out who you have to have.''
In Latin America, Brazil was the obvious choice (five minutes); in southern Africa it was Zimbabwe (four minutes.) There was no hesitation between El Salvador and Nicaragua: ''President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,'' he said, ''is a woman.''
The official allowed that the decision process proved nasty, brutish and long. ''We were pestered to death,'' he said. ''Diplomats pleading, 'if my man doesn't speak, I'll lose my job.' ''
Constant schedule changes and infinite breaches of United Nations etiquette wrought by summit organizers proved too much for the highly dignified chief of protocol, Aly Teymour. ''The summit is a disaster,'' he said wearily 24 hours before the conference was to open. ''Too many admirals sink a ship.''
 
Bush's Empty Chair
 Summit organizers were thrown into a last-minute swivet when they realized that President Bush, whom they had expected at the first working session of the summit, planned to leave immediately after the opening ceremony in the General Assembly Hall and return to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for private meetings.
The organizers suddenly saw themselves with a gapingly empty seat at the conference table. They were not mollified by a suggestion that another Cabinet officer sit in for Mr. Bush.
''It is not courteous to make heads of state dialogue with cabinet officers,'' one Unicef official said tartly.
Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada, one of the co-chairmen of the summit meeting, met privately with Mr. Bush at the Waldorf late yesterday afernoon to try to persuade him to change his plans.
 
Eager Young Reporters
 There are 3,000 journalists accredited to cover a summit meeting so unprecedented that it will be listed in next year's Guinness Book of Records. There are also more than 60 ''youth journalists,'' many of whom swarmed across the United Nations basement this afternoon, doing television stand-ups with officials wreathed in unctuous smiles.
The four scoop-hungry young reporters from the English weekly children's newspaper Early Times lived up to the reputation of British journalists around the world. ''We went to the riot, it was really good,'' Stan Bright, 13 years old, of Devon, said. The four children spotted a scuffle between anti-Communist Albanian protesters and Albanian Government supporters on Friday and made a beeline for the action.
Dominic Fox, 15, of Kent, red-haired, freckled, and with the angelic look of an English school boy just back from Narnia, climbed onto a railing to take pictures before being pulled off by policemen.
''There were men trying to throw police barricades at each other,'' He said happily, ''I got a really good shot.''
They spent this morning preparing to interview - ''grill'' is what they called it - President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil.
''I'm going to ask him about the street children who are being killed by police task forces in Brazil,'' Mr. Fox announced.
''I'm going to ask him about what happened to Chico Mendes, and the Government cover-up,'' said Mr. Bright, referring to an environmental activist in the Amazon who was assassinated. ''He'll probably have a heart attack,'' he predicted proudly.
Mr. Fox smiled sweetly. ''That's an even better story.''
 
No Word From Hussein
 Saddam Hussein of Iraq never sent an R.S.V.P. to the summit meeting's sponsors, perhaps because he knew already that he would be busy elsewhere in the Gulf. After the invasion of Kuwait, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia canceled. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan and sent their wives instead. (In official summit parlance, they are known as First Spouses).
Iraq, however, seemed to want a voice at the summit. ''Iraq will be taking part in the World Summit for Children even though they would not let our Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, to come in his plane,'' said Ahmad Sais, a member of the Iraqi mission. The boycott prohibits landing rights for Iraqi aircraft in the United States.
Iraq's delegate to the United Nations said he would attend the summit, but organizers were quick to point out that his was ''the lowliest level of representation.'' Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari has observer status, which means, according to one official, ''He can't even get into the conference room.''

HEADLINE: CONGRESS MAY CUT AFGHAN REBEL AID

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Congress is moving to cut and place conditions on Bush Administration requests for continued covert military aid to the Afghan rebels.
Reversing a decade of loyal support, the House and Senate Intelligence committees have voted in recent weeks to cut spending for the rebels next year by at least a third. The committees authorize the programs of intelligence agencies.
The Bush Administration has proposed giving the rebels about $300 million in covert aid for 1991, about what it requested and received this year, and opposes any Congressional restrictions or conditions on it. 
A growing weariness with the war is setting in now that Soviet troops are no longer involved, with a new bipartisan coalition forming to change course. The movement away from the Afghan rebels is in part a response to persistent reports of their involvement in heroin trafficking and arms dealing to rebels in Jammu and Kashmir state in India. It is also a result of the guerrillas' seeming unwillingness to support efforts to negotiate a settlement.
 
Aid to Others Questioned
But the shift is also part of broader Congressional skepticism over covert aid to guerrilla movements around the world, including those in Angola and Cambodia.
''There are increasing doubts about United States policy that is made and executed entirely in secret,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, a leading member of the House Foreign Affairs committee.
Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York, who was a supporter of the rebels before the Soviets withdrew their military forces early last year, said: ''There's a growing uneasiness about the policy, There's a feeling on the part of many members that we already achieved the bulk of our objectives in Afghanistan.''
Although the Soviet Union has withdrawn its 115,000 troops, fighting between the Government of President Najibullah and the various guerrilla factions, some of whom are Islamic fundamentalist, has continued sporadically. While the Soviet Union and the United States have discussed possible political solutions to the conflict, there is little evidence that the factions are any closer to an agreement.
 
A Change in Attitude
Over the last decade, liberals and conservatives joined to grant tens of millions of dollars more than the estimated $3 billion requested by the Reagan and Bush Administrations for military aid to the rebels.
But in a vote this month, Mr. Solarz helped lead the battle in the House Intelligence Committee to withhold half of the proposed covert aid for a second consideration early next year. In July, the Senate Intelligence Committee cut about a third of the $300 million program, the largest current American covert military program.
A Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee who continues to support the guerrillas said he thought it inevitable that Congress would link aid this year with a rebel agreement to take part in democratic elections and unify their leadership.
The covert program is in further trouble in the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, which is charged with appropriating aid to the Afghan rebels. Subcommittee supporters and opponents appear to be deadlocked, with the chairman, Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, pushing strongly for a serious cut.
 
'We're Very Unhappy'
''We're just not happy with the mujahedeen,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''We're very unhappy with what we hear about drugs coming back and forth. And they don't seem to have a coordinated effort to win the war, from the intelligence I read.''
The Bush Administration has yet to lobby hard to sustain current aid levels, leading many in Congress to wonder how much the White House remains committed to the program. The conservative wing of the Republican Party, as well as top officials in the National Security Council and Defense Department, have registered their continuing support for the rebels. But there is evidence that the State Department is far less enthusiastic.
''As Islamic fundamentalists, the mujahedeen don't always share our values,'' said a senior State Department official, who spoke on condition he remain anonymous.
The Administration has concentrated on negotiating an arrangement with the Soviet Union under which an interim government would supervise elections. The future role of the Afghan President, Najibullah, in the transitional government is the stumbling block in the discussions.
 
Installed by Moscow
The United States has said that Mr. Najibullah may run as a presidential candidate in future elections, but his grip over the army, security forces and intelligence apparatus must be severed during the campaign. Moscow has officially supported Mr. Najibullah's position that he share power with leaders of various factions during the interim period leading to elections.
The Soviet Union has withdrawn 115,000 troops from Afghanistan, but continues to prop up the Kabul regime with 500 advisers and $5 billion in annual economic and military aid.
Such large levels of Soviet support have stiffened the resolve of those in Congress who want to continue the covert program. ''It is vital for the United States not to pull the rug out from under people who have conducted a valiant defense of their sovereignty,'' said Representative Charles Wilson, Democrat of Texas.

Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
The lowly cent has taken quite a beating in the past few years. Some merchants and others are calling for the end of the least valuable coin. Even Congress has been asked to look into the possibility of minting a new dollar coin and to stop minting the cent. 
Even though a Government Accounting Office report has backed the need for a dollar coin and supported continuation of minting cents, the fray goes on.
One organization, Americans for Common Cents, has commissioned an economic study that points out a few problems that may arise if the cent is eliminated. The most pressing is rounding.
With the nickle being the lowest denomination coin, prices will be rounded to the nearest 5-cent increment. If prices were randomly assigned, then the rounding would sometimes be to the higher figure and sometimes to the lower.
Some suggest that pricing will generally benefit the seller. If that turns out to be the case then a possible 5-cent penalty per transaction becomes a regressive tax. Such penalties fall more heavily on the poorest customers who must bear a fixed cost per transaction.
For example, an item that might normally be priced at $1.07 would be rounded to the lower increment, $1.05. If the seller leaves the price at $1.07, he incurs a two-cent penalty every time he sells the item.
By raising the price to $1.08, the seller is gaining a 2-cent windfall when the rounding takes the price to $1.10. The seller has the choice of losing two cents or gaining three on a one-cent change in price.
Buying two or more of the same article changes things, but the seller may have already raised his price by one cent and that profit will offset any rounding down.
If the amounts involved - a cent here and there - seem small, remember that many volume businesses operate with profits of only three percent per item. If the cent is abolished, we'll have to begin saying, ''A nickle for your thoughts.'' And that's clearly inflationary. Silver Facts The silver of Central and South America facilitated world trade to the point where a global economy became possible. Spanish milled dollars became the currency of choice throughout the Americas and in Europe and Asia.
Our own dollar was based originally on the Mexican dollar and its eight divisions, reales.
Early Americans carved the Mexican dollar into pieces, or bits, for small change. Those eight divisions became the ''two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar'' of ditty. Chinese merchants preferred the Mexican dollars above all other coins until the mid-19th century.
The Spanish Institute is presenting an exhibition of Mexican numismatics from the collections of the Banco de Mexico and the Mexican Mint. The collection of silver and gold pieces will illustrate the history of those first coins to come out of the New World. It is open through Nov. 8 Monday through Saturday from 11 A.M. until 6 P.M. The institute is at 684 Park Avenue at 68th Street. There is no admission charge.

Operatic Winds Blowing Every Which Way

BYLINE: By Donal Henahan

 BODY:
Never, in the history of any art form, does all creative activity appear to be heading in the same direction at once. That easy truism is vividly illustrated by the confused state of operatic staging and design today. It is as if two warriors were mounted on the same horse facing in opposite directions, both waving swords and crying ''Charge!'' The horse goes its own way, following some mysterious urge known only to its genes. Opera survives, somehow.
It did seem, to cease beating a dead metaphor, that a remarkable and possibly unbridgeable difference existed in approach and intent between two noteworthy opera productions that have already surfaced in this young season: Robert Wilson's modishly eccentric staging of Gluck's ''Alceste'' by Chicago's Lyric Opera and the no less unconventional but more stimulating production of Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron'' by the New York City Opera. 
The fundamental artistic difference between the two staging concepts might not be immediately apparent. Both productions, after all, originated in the anything-goes atmosphere of contemporary Germany (''Alceste'' in Stuttgart, ''Moses'' in Cologne). Both are pictorially imaginative, fiercely untraditional and, if the term still means anything, ''advanced.'' It was, however, Schoenberg's famously intractable 12-tone work, which is less an opera than a philosophical and theological exploration in the form of an oratorio, that more truly justified importation. It emerged as not only the more serious work - no surprise - but against all expectations as the more theatrically arresting and dramatically absorbing one.
In his design and direction of ''Alceste,'' Mr. Wilson seemed determined not to allude in any recognizable way to the clear intentions of this 18th-century work. His geometrically obsessed stage pictures and perversely comical choreography of hand gestures and body postures seldom related to Gluck's musical drama and never to the philosophy behind it. ''Alceste'' is not the most easily digestible score, in spite of its many happy moments, so perhaps one should have been grateful that Mr. Wilson made the time pass so painlessly. But is visual diversion, which Mr. Wilson surely does provide, why we persist in going to the opera?
''Alceste'' is not just any opera, after all, but the one whose influence on Wagner, in theory if not always in practice, was great. It is the work for which Gluck wrote his famous preface calling for a return to ''simplicity, truth and naturalness'' as an antidote to what he felt were the abuses visited on opera by the distractingly florid vocalism of the Italians. He wanted to restrict music to ''its true office of serving poetry by means of expression and by following the situations of the story, without interrupting the action or stifling it with superfluous ornaments.''
Now, truth in art is not a subject wise people blithely address, but simplicity and naturalness are more easily recognized. Mr. Wilson's ''Alceste'' certainly did not concern itself with either. Opacity and cleverness, rather, seemed the esthetic aims - hardly what Gluck of all people could have had in mind. One of Mr. Wilson's central staging devices summed up his tendency to obscure: throughout the performance boxes and rectangles of various sizes and colors dangled over the singers or rotated slowly across the stage, their Orphic meaning, if any, the director's secret. Perhaps the point was merely ironic: to poke fun of old Gluck's pretensions to simplicity and naturalness of expression and plot. Opera directors don't like to tell stories anymore.
In any event, the effect was no doubt what Mr. Wilson hoped for: opera and staging moving along in parallel, if not divergent, paths. That concept is, if you like, legitimate in its place, though hardly new or shocking. Followers of modern dance will recognize it as the method employed a generation ago by John Cage and Merce Cunningham in many celebrated joint creations. Choreographer and composer made no attempt to coordinate movements and chance-generated sounds: the two activities went on - were meant to go on - in separate compartments. This, however, was at least potentially a liberating concept agreed upon by two contemporary artists, not as in ''Alceste'' the ruthless imposition of a 20th-century concept on a fragile 223-year-old work.
For a better example of what today's directors and designers ought to be up to, turn to ''Moses und Aron,'' a forbidding, unfinished work that never was produced in the composer's lifetime and has achieved the status of legend in 20th-century music. Hans Neugebauer's starkly simple and economical staging is unmistakably of this century but never gives the impression of existing for itself alone. Instead, with the invaluable help of Cori Ellison's English supertitles (the singing is in German), every theatrical device advances and elucidates the intricate philosophical debate between the title characters, and by extension Schoenberg's moral struggle with himself. The development of the opera's argument appears to be the main point, not anyone's career track. (If that is an illusion, it is a welcome one in opera production.) The predominantly beige sets and costumes, designed by Achim Freyer and lighted by Hans Toelstede, though pure 20th century in look and technology, brilliantly evoke the baking sun and sands of biblical Egypt. The use of sodium steam lamps and scrims creates a marvelously hazy atmosphere that intensifies the feeling of historical distance. A black scrim over most of the orchestra pit further enhances the hypnotic power. The two opposing characters, the prophet and the politician, are real but aptly impersonal, too. To depict them more distinctly might clarify their personalities but risk losing sight of the fact that they are two sides of one coin.
More than visually arresting stage pictures are achieved, however: the effect is to allow Schoenberg's dialectical drama to hold the attention on equal terms, if not better, with the operatic action - which includes a highly stylized orgy and a sacrificial ceremony in which four naked maidens have their throats cut by four males. Not the least of the production's wonders is that during these appeals to the senses, the conscientious operagoer may find it possible to keep in mind the spiritual import of it all. ''Moses und Aron,'' 12-tone rows and all, lives and breathes in this production.

HEADLINE: Beneath Faded Glamour, a Real Maestro

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
The public image and historical memory of the conductor Leopold Stokowski are bound up inexorably with the Walt Disney film ''Fantasia.'' He and the music he conducts are impressed all over that 1941 classic, even though Disney's heirs misguidedly re-recorded the soundtrack digitally a few years ago.
The image Stokowski projected, on screen and in life, was a complex one; historians of American music are still sorting it out. Was he a mere sonic sensualist, bereft of the intellectual gravity we expect from great musicians? Was he, even, something of a charlatan, if not in his music then in his partly self-invented persona? (He was always vague, at best, about his ancestry and his age.) Or was he a noble champion of the new, both musical and technological? The answer would seem to be, all of the above. 
During his lifetime (he died in 1977 at the age of 95), it was easy for critics to complain, and complain they did, often vociferously.In ''Fantasia,'' intended to make the classics comprehensible to John Q. Public, Stokowski appears as the great popularizer, grand and refined yet willing to reach out to the little man (or little mouse, in the case of Mickey). He out-Lennied Leonard Bernstein two decades before Mr. Bernstein imprinted himself on the American consciousness through television. Those who disliked the notion of pirouetting hippopotamuses and cutesy fawns cluttering up the landscape of classical music already had cause for complaint.
Stokowski's image was all his own, and sometimes it seemed to swallow up the music he performed. Even in an age when reorchestrations and instrumental touch-ups were more common than they are in our purist time, he offended scholars with his excesses, especially in his grandiose orchestral inflations of Bach's organ music. In his pursuit of sonic sumptuousness, Stokowski perfected what has since been called ''the Philadelphia sound'' during his more than 25 years as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra.
Personally, Stokowski projected an aura of silky sensuality, playing up a spurious exotic ancestry. (He was in fact English, of Polish and Russian descent, and immigrated to the United States in his early 20's.) In 1929, he abandoned the use of a baton, his elegant fingers tracing sonic curves in the air, his hands and face and wavy white-silver hair highlighted by special lighting designed to glamorize him and, it sometimes seemed, him alone.
None of which was lost on the burgeoning American record business and the drumbeaters of Broadway and Hollywood. Stokowski began recording with his Philadelphians as early as 1917, and from the first he was marketed as much as or more than the music he was ostensibly serving. Joseph Horowitz, in his book ''Understanding Toscanini,'' chose that maestro as a symbol for the penchant of American capitalism to turn great music into hucksterism, to exploit and distort the classics for a buck. Stokowski, with his snake-oil charms and unashamed self-promotion, might have been a better example, except that his self-advancement was so naked that attacks against it lost all critical point.
The trouble with these complaints against Stokowski's role in American musical life is not that they are false but that they are incomplete. The problem, in coming to a fair assessment of the Stokowski legacy, is how to reconcile forward-looking aspects of his musical personality that seem so at odds with his undeniable egomania and love of sensual surface. And one must try to understand the context in which his excesses can be better understood.
He was a remarkable champion of contemporary music, for instance. True, he lived in a time when new classical music could still be perceived as romantic or exciting or fashionable. Nonetheless, few conductors of his day managed to match his record of advancing the careers of composers both famous and obscure and of leading the world or American premieres of so many scores that have since entered the repertory or the history books.
In 1971, six years before his death, someone determined that Stokowski had conducted over 2,000 first performances in the course of 7,000 concerts. He led a number of Rachmaninoff world premieres, including the Third Symphony, the Fourth Piano Concerto and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Music by Varese, Cowell, Griffes and Antheil was high on his list. His American premieres involved even more prestigious music: Stravinksy's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Mahler's Eighth Symphony, Berg's ''Wozzeck'' and many Schoenberg scores, including ''Gurrelieder.''
The other major impact of Stokowski on classical music was an offshoot of his quest for sonic richness. He was a pioneer in exploiting the latest recording technology and acoustical research, including the use of stereo sound for ''Fantasia'' - a full 15 years before that technique was universally adopted in commercial recording. Compared, say, to the poor sound RCA inflicted on the technologically indifferent Toscanini, the sound of Stokowski's recordings was always state-of-the-art. From the electrical recording system in the mid-1920's to the long-playing disk in the late 40's to quadraphonic sound in the early 70's to the dawn of digital, Stokowski eagerly explored the latest wrinkles in a rapidly evolving technology.
Coupled with that was his involvement with orchestral deployment (endless experiments with seating plans) and playing techniques (letting violinists bow individually to minimize the sonic seams caused when all of them followed the concertmaster's lead, shifting from up-bow to down-bow en masse). He was an inveterate orchestra-founder, from the All-American Youth Orchestra (young people's ensembles were a special concern) to the American Symphony, which lasts to this day. And this doesn't count his extramusical enthusiasms - the signs of a true polymath - for Asian art, medical advances, farming and more.
All well and good, but what kind of musician was he? The answer is, a romantically willful one, on the order of Willem Mengelberg. In a modernist century that has prized brisk, ''objective'' rigidity, Stokowski's interpretive license has slipped from fashion.
The principal intellectually respectable alternative to modernism was Germanic mysticism in the manner of Wilhelm Furtwangler. Stokowski, in his Anglo-Russo/all-American way, anticipated the non-Germans who proliferated on the world's podiums after 1945. He lacked, in image and actuality, the gravity and authority of the central European tradition to buttress his eccentricities. And since his recordings epitomized the latest technology, and recording technology tends to date, his disks haven't held up as sonic spectaculars.
But the man remained a historically crucial, and in the end musically admirable, exemplar of a style of performer-creativity that our modern musical world could well use more of. Whatever else it represented, Stokowski's music-making breathed vitality and personal conviction. The re-release of ''Fantasia,'' a now sonically vivid reminder of his considerable conductorial gifts, will only affirm that memory.

HEADLINE: Why the Cutting Edge Has Lost Its Bite

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Imagine Edouard Manet, that founding figure of modernism, accompanied perhaps by Antonin Artaud, the creator of the post-Surrealist Theater of Cruelty, magically together in the United States and wandering through what is sometimes called the cultural ''cutting edge,'' the present-day avant-garde. What would they find?
If they went to the East Village in Manhattan, they would see artists living economically precarious bohemian lives so as to be able to paint. At the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the eighth annual Next Wave Festival will open on Tuesday, they would see that ''cutting edge'' theater, still affected by Artaud's experiments in primitiveness and non-narrative, was alive and well. At the Franklin Furnace in lower Manhattan they might have caught ''We Always Keep Our Victims Ready,'' the militantly feminist performance art piece by Karen Finley that has drawn the wrath of conservative and religious groups, just as - improbable as the comparison may seem - Manet's ''Olympia'' outraged the conventionalists of his era.
What the French tourists might first believe, in short, is that the avant-garde still exists, that there is an art that is self-consciously outside the traditional, rebelling against received ideas, roiling the social calm. Artaud once wrote that the theater should turn actors and spectators alike into ''victims burnt at the stake signaling through the flames.'' He might believe that the tradition of an anarchic, defiant art continues. 
But the Monsieurs Manet and Artaud would see, with some puzzlement, that cultural rebels, even bohemians living in walk-ups on Avenue B, receive money from sources ranging from the Ford Foundation to the National Endowment for the Arts. This might astound the visiting avant-garde progenitors, who never expected the establishment they defied and mocked to foot the bill or to give its approval at mainstream sites, such as Lincoln Center (where Ms. Finley recently performed in the Serious Fun Festival). That fact alone might make them ask: Is there an avant-garde at all these days?
The answer is probably yes. But it is very different from the one that formed in the mid-19th century and endured until about the mid-20th century. It is an avant-garde that no longer repudiates the idea of official support or approval but instead demands it in the form of government grants - with all the moral questions that posture raises. It is an avant-garde existing in a far more open environment, in which art's very ability to shock has been swamped by a great sea of tepid tolerance. Finally, it is an avant-garde that is absorbed into the mainstream almost as soon as it appears. It is so susceptible to commercial exploitation that the most daring ideas of one day are on the department store shelves the next. The United States, after all, is a country where Chairman Mao was turned into a fashion statement, where Andrew Dice Clay was an X-rated nightclub comedian one minute and a host on ''Saturday Night Live'' the next.
''There is always something that functions as the leading edge,'' says Christopher Hunt, the director of the Summerfare Festival in Purchase, N.Y., where vanguard productions were staged for a decade ending last year. He likens members of the avant-garde to ''invisible scouts in enemy territory,'' and adds, ''The important work is done by the scouts out ahead, but we don't even know who they are and certainly can't identify them until much later.'' The one thing, he says, ''that the avant-garde suffers from is light. The moment there is too much of it, the avant-garde no longer exists.''
Mr. Hunt cites the operas of Peter Sellars, the plays of Peter Brook, the music of Pierre Boulez and John Cage as examples of a recent avant-garde that, in time-honored fashion, has been embraced by a large, establishment audience. Among the avant-gardists whose work has emerged from the realm of experiment and become well known are the choreographer Pina Bausch, the theater director Robert Wilson, the composer Arvo Part.
And yet, the avant-garde has in at least one important respect been turned on its head. It originated, with the Impressionists in France and the Secessionists in Austria, as a movement in utter opposition to any official governance of the arts, to any political approval. It is now, by contrast, not a movement but a tendency toward experimentation that frequently depends for its survival on support from the public that, in its art, it vilifies. The controversy surrounding the National Endowment, still unresolved, thus reflects how much the self-conception of the members of the avant-garde has altered. And it raises a dilemma.
Is it intellectually consistent for creative artists to take the money of the establishment - indeed to complain of ''censorship'' if Government grants are withheld - and still maintain their identity as rebels, anarchists, enemies of convention? Does government money alter an artist's moral status?
One view is that, after all, artists need to live. Manet and Artaud may not have benefited from a National Endowment for the Arts, but they received money, at least indirectly, from what Mr. Hunt likes to call ''the filthy profits of capitalism.'' The important consideration here is the value of the work, not the source of the artist's livelihood.
Philippe Arnoult, the artistic director of the Baltimore Theater Project, likens government subsidies to the arts to support for the ''research and development arm'' of the culture. It is help that is necessary, he says, particularly in these days when a bohemian life style in the East Village has become far more expensive, relatively speaking, than bohemianism was in Paris in the 1920's. Some argue for a loyal-opposition status for the avant-garde creator.
''The artists today are saying, 'I'm proud of being an American; I pay my taxes; I'm a loyal citizen, and I have a right to be supported as a member of my culture,' '' said Martha Wilson, the director of Franklin Furnace, the avant-garde performance space that until recently received National Endowment grants for every one of its 15 years of existence.
Asked to describe the essential characteristics of the more controversial Franklin Furnace performers, Ms. Wilson said, ''They use nudity, religious imagery, bodily fluids, and references to sex and violence - all the stuff that's supposed to be wrong'' and that flouts what Ms. Wilson called the community standards established by ''guys in three-piece suits.'' If the community that has the standards supports the artists who flout those standards, doesn't that mean that the artists' vision of the community as repressive and intolerant is wrong?
Paradoxically, those who think that there should be an avant-garde may owe a debt of gratitude to the likes of Senator Jesse Helms and Donald E. Wildmon of the American Family Association, who have led the assault on the National Endowment for, in their view, subsidizing pornography and blasphemy. The idea that some art could send people into paroxysms of repressive rage has a strangely atavistic ring, coming after a long period when there seemed to be no outrage expressed at all. The Endowment's detractors have helped restore to artists their role as provocateurs.
Despite this, there are critics who refuse to take a bit of controversy as a general resuscitation of the avant-garde. Some critics maintain, particularly about the artists and performers whose names became familiar in the National Endowment debate, that political radicalism and an exaggerated premium on novelty have replaced artistic brilliance as the criteria by which the avant-garde defines itself.
The Impressionists and Surrealists, for example, began with an esthetic and a political vision that they wanted to develop in their art. The Surrealists introduced into a school of painting the idea of the Freudian unconscious, the interpretation of dreams, a new version of reality. The now-famous photograph by Andres Serrano of a crucifix immersed in urine is an act of taboo-breaking defiance, but perhaps not much of an artistic development. In short, the fact that Mr. Helms and others have unintentionally restored to art its capacity to shock does not mean that the avant-garde has come back from the dead.
''The N.E.A. debate,'' said the cultural historian Roger Shattuck, ''has restored the scandal without restoring the avant-garde.''
Mr. Shattuck, a Boston University professor who has written several books on avant-garde figures of the past, argues that the avant-garde of yesterday produced enduring work because it found a balance between a mastery of the traditional forms and techniques and the capacity to innovate.
Now, he believes, those considered to be avant-garde only innovate for innovation's sake, or shock for the sake of shocking, and are not good enough to endure. Robert Mapplethorpe, for example, whose homoerotic photographs have been at the center of the National Endowment controversy from the beginning, is a rather conventional photographer, in Mr. Shattuck's view, one whose work would not represent an artistic breakthrough were it not for its sometimes shocking subject matter.
''Every institution is calling for something original today,'' Mr. Shattuck said. ''And when originality is the only quality being looked for, there's a great temptation to go out and do something that's political or obscene, and that substitutes for originality in some way. But there's only so much originality lying around.'' There is, of course, still the noncontroversial cutting edge, or at least, the place where, as Mr. Hunt put it, the avant-garde gets absorbed into the establishment, often leaving some of its more experimental, anarchic features behind.
Next week, and for the four weeks after that, the new and the innovative will be on display at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. Audiences will find lots of bright innovation. They will also find confirmation that a kind of experimental, daring, generally anti-establishment art coexists comfortably with the kind of sponsorship that has changed the identity of the avant-garde.
The opening event, for example, Martha Clarke's ''Endangered Species,'' is a work that, in the words of the program notes, ''explores the bond between man, animals and nature, employing a cast that includes actors, dancers and animals.''
Through such earlier works as ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' and ''Miracolo d'Amore,'' Ms. Clarke has become well-established as one of the leading experimentalists in American theater, and ''Endangered Species'' seems consistent with her reputation. The performance, again in the words of the program notes, does away with ''traditional linear text.'' Instead, Ms. Clarke ''constructs dreamy tableaux, juxtaposing excerpts from Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' with scenes of dominance and oppression, sex and death, loss and regret.''
Is it avant-garde? Ms. Clarke, discussing the subject the other day, makes no such claim. For one thing, she said, she does not see herself as part of a movement.
''I just go from project to project, looking for new ways to challenge myself and to understand myself,'' she said. She acknowledged that she has never been able to raise money from the usual commercial producers. Her support comes from from foundations and the National Endowment. Philip Morris, the tobacco company, is the major financial benefactor of the entire Next Wave Festival, the same Philip Morris that supports the senatorial candidacy of Jesse Helms.
Harvey Lichtenstein, the director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the guiding spirit behind the Next Wave Festival, points out that state support of non-avant-garde art, long the custom in Europe, is a recent development in this country. The National Endowment itself is only about a quarter of a century old.
''A lot of the art that resulted from government subsidies is pretty establishment,'' Mr. Lichtenstein said, referring to the many grants that go to the major institutions. ''But a lot of it throws mud in the face of the establishment. It deals with the issues of the day, such as gay rights and women's rights.''
Indeed, contemporary issues are certainly the stuff of avant-garde treatment, and, not surprisingly, there seems little question these days that the most avant of the avant-garde is the art centering around homosexual, feminist, sexual or anti-religious themes. In a society that has steadily broken most of its once unbreakable taboos, the few remaining are powerful. That may be one reason why today's version of the avant-garde seems more devoted than the avant-garde of the past to an angry defiance, a breaking of taboos simply because they are there.
Mapplethorpe's controversial photographs, such as the one that shows a man urinating in the mouth of another, are explicitly homoerotic. The performance artist Annie Sprinkle would arouse no storms of protest if she simply talked, as she sometimes does, about her sexuality. It is inviting the audience to examine her vagina through a gynecological instrument - a gesture that has been explained as an attempt to demystify female sexuality - that helped put her on the Endowment hit list.
And yet the few artists who have become well known as a result of the National Endowment disputes do not really signify a flourishing of an avant-garde that Manet might recognize. A photograph of a man urinating in the mouth of another may be a political or a moral statement, but it is hard to conceive of it primarily as an artistic one. And in the America of the late 20th century, it is not even so daring. It appealed to an already existing constituency. Mapplethorpe, who died last year, may have risked his National Endowment grant, but he did not risk his career as a photographer. His photographs are selling briskly at the elite auction houses.
Mr. Shattuck, in a passage in his book ''The Banquet Years,'' an account of the careers of four avant-garde figures in France a century ago, suggests why in the United States the avant-garde is almost a contradiction in terms.
The avant-garde, he writes, could flourish in France because of the conservatism of French society, its susceptibility to outrage. The United States, by contrast, has almost always been so relatively open, so commercially adaptable, that the most shocking product of yesterday will end up for sale tomorrow. The market for the new smothers the shock quality of the avant-garde, virtually precluding the possibility that a genuine avant-garde can exist.
In the past, the avant-garde struggled to nurture the new in the face of a conservatism deeply skeptical about anything daringly different or unconventional. But now, although many Americans hold deeply conservative values, there is also an insatiable thirst for the new. The unconventional is highly prized. Yesterday's taboo-breaking creation is today's fad, written up in People magazine and Vanity Fair, invited onto ''Saturday Night Live,'' optioned by Hollywood.
''The appetite for the new is rabid in this country, and it takes a kind of discipline from the artist not to sell out to that, because it's very seductive,'' Ms. Clarke said. ''Everything is seized and kind of siliconed immediately.''
''We live with a kind of duplicity today because everything is so open,'' she said. ''We don't have to fight the kind of fight of the pioneers, like Isadora Duncan when she came back from Russia. Because everything goes, there are no walls to push over anymore.''

HEADLINE: Climate Change and Coal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Astonishingly, the recent story on improved prospects for the coal industry (''Will Coal, the Plentiful Old Standby, Pick Up Speed?'' Aug. 26) fails to mention global climate change, arguably the single most important roadblock in coal's future.
Many scientists now believe that changes in the Earth's atmosphere caused by increased emissions of heat-trapping ''greenhouse gases'' from human activities will alter the climate over the next century, with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences. The most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, which contains more carbon than either oil or natural gas.
Utilities in the United States already depend on coal for more than half of all the electric power they produce. Thanks to that dependence, the United States leads the world in emissions of carbon dioxide, and the utility sector leads the United States economy, producing nearly 1.9 billion tons yearly, which is more than seven tons for every American.
We have failed to take action to protect our energy security by finding alternatives to oil over the past decade. As a result, we find ourselves today contemplating war over oil in the Middle East.
If we ignore global climate change and increase our dependence on coal as an energy source, we may soon arrive at a similar policy dead end, in which we are forced to undergo severe economic disruption in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Don't Knock the Soviet Manager

BYLINE: By ELISE WALTON; Elise Walton is director of the Delta Consulting Group in New York.

 BODY:
Until recently, Americans have had little chance to watch Soviet managers at work in their own environment while interacting with colleagues. I was afforded this opportunity during a joint research project under the direction of Prof. Paul Lawrence of the Harvard Business School and Igor Faminsky of the Soviet Institute for External Economic Affairs. Four of us - two Americans and two Russians - spent four months visiting manufacturing plants in the United States and the Soviet Union. We interviewed people on production floors and in senior management positions. We attended plant management meetings and planning sessions. From all of this emerged an image quite different from the prevailing stereotype.
The Soviet manager in action demonstrates plenty of the nerve and verve that we expect of American line managers. The Sovietmanagers make split-second decisions in production crises, deal decisively with difficult people issues and energize their work force through commitment and vision. In almost every case they exhibited great pride in their ability to make things happen in the face of daunting, if not overwhelming, odds. 
Alexander Sergeovich Gorian, plant manager of a large engine manufacturing plant in Moscow, is a good example. Arriving at the plant about 7:15 A.M., he checks the night shift's production and then tours the plant for an hour. Although some 2,000 people work for him, he knows many by name. As he moves through the shop he answers questions, jokes, and alerts the managers and workers to upcoming issues. At 9 o'clock, all shop managers and staff heads attend Mr. Gorian's staff meeting.
Mr. Gorian opens the meeting with a review of yesterday's production and with each manager's reports. The head of personnel discusses which workers will be leaving to help the agricultural collectives with the upcoming harvest. The Communist Party representative discusses which section has performed best in the ''socialist competition.'' Far from apathetic and passive, Mr. Gorian's style is direct, confrontational and humorous - a blend of charisma and autocracy. He demands accountability. Why have the shop foremen allowed their areas to become so messy? He chides one shop head for his treatment of a worker. Soviet managers must post open office hours, and workers can complain to them during these mandatory hours. The various exchanges are vigorous and candid.
In this plant, as in organizations everywhere, shop managers are quick to blame upstream suppliers for problems and failures. Mr. Gorian says, ''It's not important whose fault it is. What is important is that there is a manager and he is here to solve the problem. A way out must be found, not just who is right and who is wrong. It is for managers to solve their specific problem and not to hide behind some general problem that they can do nothing about.''
Mr. Gorian's day will end about 8 P.M. If there is a company event - if the soccer team has a game, for example - he attends, but returns to the plant before going home for the night. For his efforts, he recieves a salary of 350 rubles a month, plus a year-end bonus of as much as 20 percent of his salary based on the productivity of the factory. A typical assembly worker makes about 210 rubles a month.
There are a lot of similarities between Soviet and American plant managers. In both countries managers complain that the annual plan figures, ''rolling down from the top,'' are changed too frequently during the year. They admit to taking action before receiving the formally required approvals, because the bureaucracy is too slow to handle some crises. They also admit to passing misleading financial information up the hierarchy. A manager restricted by executive fiat from increasing the size of his plant, but having valuable machine tools to house, soon has a new warehouse which has not been revealed to headquarters. Human nature prevails across borders.
The American practice is to hand out reams of printed information in which many of the meaningful numbers had been omitted so they won't end up in the hands of the competition. In the Soviet Union, in part because paper shortages are not unheard of, but also because copy machines must be supervised by a state employee who tracks who copied what, we relied more on the spoken word. With persistence, we found the Soviets open and helpful. Although we got less paper than an American company would provide, we often received more information.
The good news is that there are plenty of bright, energetic line managers in the Soviet Union - managers who expect to be held accountable, who provide innovative solutions to problems and who will apparently thrive in a market economy.
However, they may not have the best connections. American companies preparing to do business in the Soviet Union will have to learn to distinguish the politically well-connected bureaucrat from the less political, highly motivated, results-oriented manager. These line managers have been burdened by state administrative orders across a spectrum of activities. Once they are freed from centralized decision making and political interference, they have the potential to perform well and make a difference.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Stubbing a Toe on Primerica

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The markets are clearly of two minds about the Primerica Corporation, the financial conglomerate that owns Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, the Commercial Credit Company and the A. L. Williams insurance operation.
The stock market, to judge by the drubbing the company's shares have taken in the past two months, thinks that Primerica is a poor bet, in part because of emerging problems at the A. L. Williams unit. The bond market's opinion, expressed last week when Commercial Credit sold $100 million in three-year notes, is that Commercial Credit - the bedrock on which Primerica is built - is only slightly less creditworthy than Uncle Sam himself. The odds are, the bond market goofed. The corporate bond market typically classifies borrowers by how much more they pay to borrow than the United States Treasury pays. The gap is measured in basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Thus, traders speak of a bond as being priced to yield, say, 150 basis points over Treasuries - that is, 1.5 percentage points more than the Treasury bond yield for the same maturity. Of course, if the borrower offers some sort of collateral, its borrowing costs are likely to be closer to the Treasury rates than if it does not. 
Last Monday, the day the Commercial Credit notes were priced, Norwest Bank sold an issue of three-year secured notes, carrying a glittering triple-A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Norwest's interest rate was 75 basis points over Treasury's.
Commercial Credit has a single-A rating from Standard & Poor's. As for collateral, it offered nothing but its good name.
So how did Commercial Credit fare? Remarkably well. The company paid just 78 basis points over three-year Treasury notes. In other words, the bond market was willing to lend money to Commercial Credit, despite a lower rating and the lack of collateral, for only three basis points more in interest than it was getting from a secured, triple-A borrower like Norwest.
Firoz Tarapore, assistant treasurer of both Primerica and Commercial Credit, said the company was the beneficiary of ''fortunate timing,'' selling the notes early in the week, before unrest in the Middle East caused spreads in the bond market to widen. As for the rate, he deemed it to be ''right in with the pack'' of similar issues.
Myron Picoult, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, may not be an expert on corporate bond spreads but he has made a thorough study of Primerica for his stock-market clients. On the question of whether one should invest in the company these days, his advice is succinct: don't.
''The stock has clearly broken down, and investor confidence has been shaken,'' he said. ''We would continue to avoid the stock and believe that there is still some downside risk.''
One thing that worries Mr. Picoult is the unfolding drama at Williams, which Primerica purchased in 1988 from its controversial founder and self-styled ''coach,'' Art Williams. For years, Mr. Williams's aggressive selling style has made him a hero to his 190,000 agents and a thorn in the flesh of his industry rivals. After the Primerica buyout, he stayed on as a sales consultant and de facto leader of the insurance operation, which produces almost a quarter of Primerica's profits.
On July 20, Mr. Williams stunned his followers by tearfully announcing that he was taking a leave of absence to deal with a Federal grand jury investigation in Florida. The probe, according to the company, focuses on allegations of unspecified ''bad practices'' by a Williams marketing unit; others involved in the case say prosecutors are examining whether Mr. Williams or his associates played a role in fraudulently undermining a rival's business.
Primerica's fans among Wall Street analysts say the A. L. Williams issue is an ''aberration'' and ''an irrelevancy.'' But Mr. Picoult points out that Primerica's promising plan to use Mr. Williams's aggressive disciples to sell the products and services of other subsidiaries, including Commercial Credit, could be derailed by the current turmoil.
Moreover, he said, ''one wonders whether the United States Attorney's investigation could lead to review of the A. L. Williams operation in other jurisdictions by various state insurance departments, given past complaints about the company.''
Commercial Credit's own market niche is hardly worry-free these days. Of its $4.7 billion portfolio of loans, about 45 percent is secured by real estate - not as much of a comfort as it was before real estate prices started to soften.
Another 45 percent of its portfolio consists of unsecured loans to consumers. And how's that business? Andrew Silver, a senior analyst and economist at Moody's Investors Service, warned in a report last week that the borrowing binge of the 1980's has seriously eroded the consumer's creditworthiness.
It is possible, though unlikely, that both the stock market and the bond market are correct about Primerica - that Commercial Credit can somehow remain a rock-solid borrower throughout the pending business slump, while its parent company nevertheless confirms the stock market's worst fears. It is also possible that the stock market is wrongly punishing Primerica for the A. L. Williams affair, and that the bond market was right to ascribe so little risk to those Commercial Credit notes.
But, possibilities aside, it is certain that Commercial Credit is in the business of lending money to real estate buyers and consumers. It is equally certain that the nation's real estate sector is ailing and it is becoming harder for consumers to pay their debts.
All of which suggests a final possibility: That when bond market investors take a closer look at how little they are being paid to lend money to the Commercial Credit unit of Primerica, a lot of them will wish they had listened to the stock market.

HEADLINE: Television's Independents: Working on a Slippery Slope

BYLINE: By NEAL KOCH; Neal Koch is a senior editor of Channels magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Critics and viewers have embraced NBC's new Monday night situation comedy, ''Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' about a streetwise teen-age rap artist from Philadelphia transplanted to a wealthy section of Los Angeles. But the show is notable for another reason as well - one that is giving the shakes to independent television producers, and might give pause to viewers, too.
''Fresh Prince'' is one of the latest examples of how independent producers are getting squeezed out as suppliers of prime-time series programming to the major networks: The show is not only aired by NBC, but also produced by the network. It is one reason that independents command only about 14 percent of the prime-time schedule this fall on ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, down from about 57 percent two years ago.
''The little guys are getting hammered,'' said Michael Mellon, vice president of media strategy for Buena Vista Television, a division of the Walt Disney Company. 
There is no shortage of reasons for the decline of the independents - producers who do not rely on major studios, networks or large diversified media companies for financing. The networks have stepped up in-house production, in part to cut costs. At the same time, Hollywood's rapidly consolidating major studios have been using their growing clout to grab more and more prime-time slots. The nine ''majors'' account for about 70 percent of the fall lineup.
The studios have also been bidding up the price of key talent, the writer-producers, making it harder for new competitors to break in. And broad changes in industry economics have made it difficult for veteran independents to survive on their own.
Industry executives say the situation is likely to get worse for the independents. ''Within the next five years or so,'' predicts Scott Siegler, president of Columbia Pictures Television, ''the bulk of the programming will be provided by four or five major studios.''
Critics warn that this trend could lead to a loss of innovation in an industry built by maverick entrepreneurs. Viewers could lose out, they argue, if the diversity of voices broadcast over the airwaves diminishes.
''Because there are fewer and increasingly similar corporate entities that supply programs, the range of shows that will get on the networks will be increasingly narrow,'' said Charles Slocum, director of industry analysis for the Writers Guild of America, West.
Throughout the history of television programming, said David Marc, visiting professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communications, ''independents made important changes.'' Breakthrough series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Hill Street Blues'' were the work of independents, for example. ''Who is going to take the risks now if the quality-control boys are going to be able to nix projects?'' Professor Marc asked.
But studio and network executives maintain that their growing power makes little difference in a world exploding with new viewing choices - cable, satellite-delivered channels and videocassette recorders.
As powerful as they have become, their influence is exaggerated by critics, the executives also contend. In entertainment television, they say, writer-producers are so highly valued that some have their choice of studios and networks with which to work. Some are powerful enough to secure large measures of creative freedom. For instance, two of the biggest hits distributed by Disney, ''Golden Girls'' and ''Empty Nest,'' come from a boutique outfit, Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions, whose contracts have kept Disney from exercising creative control over those shows. And, the executives say, two of the most popular series on television these days, ''Roseanne'' and ''The Cosby Show,'' are made by an independent producer, the Carsey-Werner Company.
''I don't think creativity has suffered,'' said Leslie Moonves, executive vice president of Lorimar Television, formerly the largest independent and now part of Time Warner Inc.
But the critics reply by pointing out that the new cable and satellite channels tend to be owned by the same media giants that already own the big studios and broadcast networks. With some notable exceptions, the critics say, these new outlets have not brought diversity to programming so much as a resting place for old movies and reruns of situation comedies.
As for writer-producers, they may indeed be highly sought after, the critics acknowledge. But, they argue, industry economics still leave few writers with much choice other than to decide which of the major studios or networks they prefer to have bankroll their projects. For example, Steven Bochco (''Hill Street Blues'') and James L. Brooks (''The Simpsons''), by all signs the two most coveted writer-producers, have chosen to tie themselves to studios and networks.
Perhaps the last time independents found themselves so overshadowed was in the mid-to-late 1950's as the major studios made their first big move into television. With their superior financial resources, the studios bid up production costs, in the process forcing out or buying up smaller suppliers like Jack Webb and Desilu, said Thomas Schatz, professor of film and television at the University of Texas at Austin.
But the balance of power shifted following the quiz show scandals of the late 50's. With the backing of the Federal Communications Commission, the networks took greater control of their programming.
As a result, in the 60's, some independents, like Danny Thomas, grew quite powerful. But life still wasn't perfect. The networks hamstrung their outside suppliers by demanding equity interests in shows, as well as the right to syndicate the series, in return for putting them on the air. The F.C.C. stepped in again, this time issuing rules restricting the networks' ability to own the programming they aired, and barring the networks from sharing in profits from the sale of reruns to local stations. In addition, the Justice Department obtained consent decrees restricting network in-house production.
With that, independents entered their golden age in the 70's. Norman Lear (''All in the Family''), Grant Tinker (''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'') and Lee Rich (''The Waltons''), among others, became leading program suppliers, in the process dramatically expanding the acceptable limits of program content.
But that prosperity began to fade in the 80's. Rather than making a profit on each episode they produced, independents began losing money as the networks decided not to underwrite their program suppliers' full costs of production, let alone pay them a profit. The networks were feeling pinched as growth in advertising revenue slowed with the decline in audience share precipitated by new competitors - more independent TV stations, cable and VCR's.
As all this was happening, production costs skyrocketed. This hit independents particularly hard, compounded by a contraction in the syndication market.
Caught between these pressures, many independent producers merged, sold themselves or closed up shop. Most that survived signed on with major studios or networks willing to pick up their deficits.
''Only the biggest majors can afford the float until you get a hit,'' says Valerie Cavanaugh, executive vice president of Gracie Films, the production company of James L. Brooks, now associated with Columbia.
Now, few new independents are emerging, presumably because the financial barriers to entry are so high. ''And the hurdles are getting higher every day,'' says Perry Simon, executive vice president of prime-time programs at NBC.
The surviving independents are also finding it increasingly hard to get their shows on the air because there are fewer and fewer available time slots. Privately, industry executives say the shrinking shelf space for independents is partly because of the majors' use of their growing concentration of power to secure as much of that space as possible. The most powerful form of pressure available to the studios is a threat to move a hit show to another network or to take future projects elsewhere.
The dickering usually occurs over the size of production fees the network will pay, whether a marginally performing show will be renewed and which time slot a show will receive.
The majors ''have a certain ability to deal that I don't,'' says Richard Reisberg, president of Reeves Entertainment, now an American unit of the British-based Thames Television Company and producer of ''Doctor, Doctor,'' on CBS. Added one former network executive, ''When a guy can get a leg up and put a foot on a network guy's throat, he does it.''
To be sure, a studio's influence should not be overstated. A network has little incentive to buy a show that won't draw viewers. But it is just as clear that in a close call, a studio is more likely to get the benefit of the doubt than an independent.
And now independents are increasingly losing out to the networks' own production units. In-house production not only saves the networks money, but also gives them a shot at creating their own hit series. That has become more important as the F.C.C. has begun to review whether to relax or even eliminate the rules that bar the networks from syndicating programs. (The limits imposed by the consent decrees on the networks' ability to produce their own shows began to wane in the late 80's and are set to expire in November.) ''The small production companies are in a lot of trouble today,'' said Allan Burns, the independent producer best known for co-creating ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''Lou Grant.'' ''It's a shame. It eliminates the competition.''
 
THE INSUPERABLE NETWORKS
Given the increasing concentration of clout in television program production, are there specific shows that have clearly lost out to programs from more successful producers capable of pressuring the networks?
''It's unprovable,'' says one network programming executive, ''but undeniable.''
Such proof is hard to muster in any creative business requiring endless subjective judgments. But one recent example clearly raises the issue even though it pits one independent against another and a major studio is not involved.
''FM,'' a sophisticated comedy from struggling independent MTM Enterprises and producers Allan Burns and Burt Metcalfe, was tried out in several time periods last season by NBC. The sitcom received generally favorable reviews, and it beat the competition each of the three times it followed ''Cheers'' at 9:30 P.M. on Thursdays, one of the most desired prime-time slots.
More mixed were the reviews of ''Grand,'' an ensemble comedy from the Carsey-Werner Company, producer of ''Roseanne'' and ''The Cosby Show'' and one of the few independents left with real clout. ''Grand's'' ratings for its first three times following ''Cheers'' rivaled those of ''FM'' in that slot. But overall, ''Grand'' lost slightly more of the ''Cheers'' audience share than ''FM'' did. A dropoff in share points - the percentage of all TV sets in use watching a particular program - is a key measure networks use to evaluate shows.
Nonetheless, ''FM'' was dropped from this fall's lineup while ''Grand'' was included.
Mr. Burns, the ''FM'' producer, says NBC told him he would lose out to ''Grand'' because the network had promised the slot following ''Cheers'' to Carsey-Werner as part of a deal to hold on to ''The Cosby Show.'' Privately, many executives say they also believe the ''Grand'' deal was part of the price for ''Cosby.'' Carsey-Werner executives declined to comment.
Mr. Burns said NBC then told him it would not be able to find any slot for ''FM'' because of promises it had made to producers with more clout who wanted to get new shows on the air.
One recent arrival is ''Wings,'' from Paramount Pictures and some of the former producers of Paramount's ''Cheers,'' perhaps NBC's most important show after ''Cosby.'' A second new series, ''Down Home,'' is also from Paramount and the production company of ''Cheers'' star Ted Danson, whose contract was recently renewed. ''Down Home'' is expected to bow in January.
Asked about ''Down Home,'' ''Wings'' and ''Grand,'' Perry Simon, NBC's executive vice president for prime-time programs, said, ''None of those shows are on the air solely because of the producer relationship.''
But did NBC's desire to keep ''Cosby'' and ''Cheers'' play at least a substantial role? Mr. Simon declined to say.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Corporate Donations Under Attack

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS; Deborah L. Jacobs is a Brooklyn-based writer.

 BODY:
From Philip Morris to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, some of America's biggest companies are being attacked by special-interest groups for donating money to causes the critics simply don't like. As a result, companies are growing more frightened of controversy and are reassessing their donations, turning philanthropy into a image-boosting tool instead.
''Corporate giving has become more bottom-line oriented and related to the selling of the product,'' said Pablo Eisenberg, president of the Center for Community Change, a nonprofit public policy group in Washington. Although companies have always had their own agenda for charitable donations, experts say they are now so squeezed for profits, and blasted by critics, that they are less willing to give without getting something in return. And a treacherous economy ''diminishes a company's willingness'' to risk controversy, said Kenneth Albrecht, president of the National Charities Information Bureau, a nonprofit watchdog group in New York. 
The desire to avoid controversy is everywhere in corporate America. ''We stay as far away from controversial issues as we possibly can,'' said Donald W. Larson, president of the 3M Foundation and director of community affairs for the 3M Company in St. Paul, Minn.
''If we get involved in a controversial issue we're going to be in trouble with 50 percent of the people who are important to us.''
Abortion is one of the toughest issues facing corporate foundations. The Dayton Hudson Corporation, for example, decided to withdraw its funding of Planned Parenthood in August, under pressure from the Christian Action Council, an anti-abortion group. But seven weeks later, after more than 200 customers who supported abortion rights cut up their charge cards in protest, it reversed that decision.
A company spokeswoman, Ann Barkkelew, said the protests did not have ''any bottom-line impact,'' but the company agreed to resume its $18,000 grant only after being assured the money would not be used to advocate abortion, she said.
The A.T.& T. Foundation, another target of the Christian Action Council, withdrew its support from Planned Parenthood in March. That decision prompted several dozen protesters to picket the company's annual meeting in April, but did not persuade the foundation to change its position, said Burke Stinson, an A.T.& T. spokesman. He said Planned Parenthood is ''a player in the divisive abortion issue,'' and A.T.& T. did not want to be associated with it.
Companies are also finding that less direct support can cause trouble too. Arco Foundation officials had no record of a contribution to Planned Parenthood when they received a scathing letter recently from a group attacking Arco for its support of the organization. Eugene R. Wilson, the foundation's president, eventually traced the complaint: as part of its $16 million annual budget for philanthropy, Arco had helped finance a community symphony in the Southwest, which in turn had sent a brass ensemble to perform at a local Planned Parenthood benefit.
But the complaints come from all fronts. Arco's matching grant program for charitable donations, for example, came under fire recently from some employees for making donations to abortion-rights groups, and from others for gifts to anti-abortion groups.
Not surprisingly, Planned Parenthood finds this all distressing. ''The boardroom influence of small extremist groups is a danger to corporate philanthropy,'' said Peter Wilderotter, vice president of resources.
Abortion, however, is not the only issue that prompts complaints. Earlier this year, Arco was attacked by conservative groups that opposed its increased support of low-income housing, arguing that the company was interfering with free enterprise.
And the Philip Morris Companies' pledge of $200,000 to a repository for the papers of Senator Jesse Helms last spring spurred protest from a New York group, Act-Up, or the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. The conservative North Carolina Senator, a staunch supporter of the tobacco lobby, has long offended gay-rights activists. So after the grant was announced last spring, Act-Up called for a boycott - now under way - of Marlboro cigarettes and Miller Beer, both owned by Philip Morris. The company, however, has refused to change its plans. ''Our main business is to tend to our business,'' said Posie DiSesa, manager for media relations at Philip Morris ''We're not a public policy organization.''
To stay on the safe side, more and more companies are linking their charitable giving to a clearly articulated corporate purpose. In recent years, for example, Fannie Mae has concentrated its charitable efforts on issues related to housing and homelessness. ''That's what we do and we know a lot about it,'' said David Maxwell, the company's chairman and chief executive.
The Aetna Foundation focuses on services to youth, civil justice reform and urban neighborhood revitalization, said Sanford Cloud Jr., vice president of corporate public involvement at the company. ''When society is healthy and prosperous our own company's chances of success are enhanced,'' he said. ''We can sell products to receptive markets and find people to fill jobs.''

HEADLINE: All About/Corporate Jets;
The Ultimate Status Symbol Still Sells

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
People who sell corporate jets can talk a transcontinental streak about the security, convenience and flexibility their products afford. What they don't need to say is that these particular corporate assets are 600 mile-per-hour odes to success - faster than airliners, with interiors that make first class seem like steerage.
With a recession looming, more companies might decide to save their money for debt payments or other essentials. A recent drop in fuel sales for corporate aviation suggests that companies are already using their jets less. ''If companies aren't spending on plants and equipment, they aren't spending on airplanes,'' said Angelo Fiataruolo, president of Premier Aircraft, a jet-brokerage firm in Westport, Conn.
After a surge of sales in the 1970's, especially to prosperous oil companies, the corporate jet business nose-dived, as cost-conscious companies turned to used models. The industry rebounded in the late 1980's; manufacturers sold 263 new jets last year, compared with 182 in 1987. And American companies using private jets increased from 2,862 in 1986 to 3,032 last year. This year, sales of new jets are stable, but used plane sales are down. 
American jet makers have held foreign companies to about half of worldwide sales. Canadair Aerospace Group, British Aerospace P.L.C., and Electronique Serge Dassault, a French company, are among the major competitors. Attracted by a weak dollar, more foreign companies - in Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico - are buying American jets. Japan and West Germany have until recently bought very few. Both nations have prompt, reliable, often luxurious trains.
 
Winning Formulas
In Pricing, Fly Either High or Low
 If a company wants to succeed in the private-jet business, it should try to be either the cheapest or the most expensive. Cessna, once best known for its small, propeller-driven planes, now makes almost all its money from one jet, the Citation. Cessna controls 62 percent of the worldwide market for light and medium business jets, with a backlog of 70 jets ordered that will keep the assembly line humming through 1992. Cessna's jets are considered relatively inexpensive by the industry's standards, with prices ranging from $2.5 million to $7 million. Profits at Cessna, a division of the defense giant General Dynamics, rose in the first half of the year to $39.1 million, up from $13.6 million for the same period last year.
Gulfstream sells far fewer jets but is successful nonetheless. Allen E. Paulson, Gulfstream's former owner, joined with Forstman Little & Company this year to buy Gulfstream back from the Chrysler Corporation for $825 million.
The Gulfstream G-IV sells for about $25 million and costs $2,500 per hour to fly. Some buyers have installed beds, showers and sculpture collections. The plane can carry 19 people from Atlanta to Paris, nonstop, more than 50 miles per hour faster than the airlines. Gulfstream delivered 41 last year, down from 49 the year before. Sales are surprisingly steady during economic declines. ''If you have $25 million to buy a G-IV, you have it whether there is a recession or not,'' said Alan Staats, president of Flight Level Design, an advertising agency specializing in aviation.
Jet operating costs that usually exceed $1,000 an hour seem a small worry compared to the initial cost. Higher fuel prices that have left the airlines reeling have scarcely been noticed by companies that fly business jets. ''If you can afford to buy and fly a jet aircraft, you don't worry that much about fuel costs,'' Mr. Humphrey said. Few, if any, corporate jet makers are on fuel efficiency drives.
 
That Snazzy Image
It Draws Buyers, but It May Attract Taxes
Let nobody within earshot of Dean Humphrey call corporate jets luxuries. ''We're lumped with fur coats and jewelry and yachts,'' said Mr. Humphrey, a Cessna spokesman. ''Nothing could be further from the truth.''
Mr. Humphrey and others in his industry might have a hard time getting Congress to see the point. A pending bill would add a 10-percent ''luxury tax'' to the purchase of a new corporate jet. Jonathan How, president of the National Business Aircraft Association, opposes the bill, but said that during the 1980's, ''There were a few unhappy examples of abuse.'' Far from showing off their fleets, most companies wish they could apply Stealth technology to make the jets invisible to shareholders. Few corporate jets boast company logos.
Some major airports that want to reserve runway space for the airlines are discouraging corporate aviation. To steer small planes away from Boston's Logan Airport, the state's Port Authority hit them with large landing fees that, under court challenge, were recently dropped.
Business-jet merchants respond to criticism by saying that, for many executives, their planes are indispensable. First, for security, to keep executives far from terrorists and industrial spies. On a private jet, ''executives can go through financial statements without being overheard,'' said John House, spokesman for Falcon Jet, a subsidiary of Dassault. ''You can't do that in the first-class section of Pan Am or British Airways.'' For security, some corporations prohibit top executives from flying the airlines overseas.
Next, sellers of jets rhapsodize about the ability to zip straight to destinations without circuitous routing that airline hub-and-spoke systems entail. On the airlines, ''you can't get from point A to B without going through C, D and sometimes E,'' said Henry Ogrodzinski, spokesman for the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. And because private jets can land at thousands of small airports, they enable executives to reach cities the airlines do not serve. ''Business is reaching farther out off the beaten path,'' said Baron Thomas, a jet broker in Dallas. ''The airplane is the only way to get there.''
Mr. Paulson, with a sales pitch for every season, argues that deliveries of private jets should increase when the economy slows because companies have to chase more customers and clients. ''When business is bad, you need the aircraft all the more,'' he said.
 
Learjet's Fall
A Resurgence Under New Owner?
The sales updraft has not raised all jets. The Learjet Corporation has proven that a renowned brand name, long synonomous with its product, is no guarantee of eternal success. In 1962, the company introduced what became the industry's best-selling jet, the Lear 23, and the company's animated chairman, Bill Lear, emerged as a celebrity. Yet in the last five years, Learjet has been bought and sold three times, with most of the buyers financial holding companies more interested in writing off losses on their taxes than in building airplanes.
The company developed few new models, and its sales plummeted from 134 planes in 1981 to 16 in 1987. Earlier this year, the company was bought by Bombardier Inc., a Canadian company that makes snowmobiles and industrial equipment and that owns Canadair, for $75 million. The new owners pledge to turn Learjet around. In fact, the company recently introduced a new, aerodynamically improved model, the Lear 31, to help recoup some of the company's status.
 
A DELUXE JETFROM RUSSIA
Aeronautics inspires strange alliances. Sukhoi, a Soviet company best known for the Su-27, a supersonic fighter used in Afghanistan, has teamed up with Gulfstream Aerospace to build the world's first supersonic business jet.
The project - the first joint aviation venture between the Soviets and the United States - still faces many obstacles beyond the mating of capitalist entrepreneurship and socialist planning. At $50 million, the plane would cost about twice as much as Gulfstream's G-IV, now the world's most expensive business jet. And the new plane might seldom fly at top speed; to avoid sonic booms, civilian planes are prohibited from flying faster than the speed of sound over the United States.
Allen Paulson, the chairman of Gulfstream, said the plane's design can muffle the sonic boom. He is confident of finding customers. Skeptics once questioned whether anybody would shell out $25 million for a private jet, he said.
Gulfstream envisions a plane that could carry 15 to 20 passengers and fly at Mach 2, or about 1,500 miles per hour, slightly faster than the Anglo-French Concorde, the only other civilian supersonic plane in the air. The Soviets would handle the bulk of the design work and the $1 billion development cost. Gulfstream plans to provide the cockpit electronics and marketing.
The venture began last spring, when Mr. Paulson met for several hours with Mikhail P. Simonov, chief of Sukhoi, at the Paris Air Show. By the next morning they had signed a memorandum of understanding. Rolls-Royce P.L.C., the British engine manufacturer, has joined Soviet Lyulka Design Bureau to build the plane's engine.
After several meetings, Soviet and American engineers produced a mock- up of the plane that was displayed at the Farnborough air show in Britain earlier this month. A first flight is planned for 1994.

Good Health in a Bad Market

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Celebration and chaos drove the stock market in the third quarter as the Dow Jones industrial average flirted with 3,000 in July only to nosedive after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Stock funds followed suit, with the average fund losing 15.5 percent for the quarter ended Sept. 27, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc..
The obvious winners were gold funds (up 4.2 percent). Utilities funds gave their usual defensive play during the market turmoil and were down 6.34 percent. Natural resources held steady, down only .16 percent. All the other stock funds succumbed to the blood bath, but health and biotechnology funds (down 11.9 percent) had less of a drop than the others. In a market like this, they're one of the hottest sectors. 
As a group, the nine health and biotechnology funds held up because of strong sales and excellent prospects, fund managers say. ''People are excited about the group so they didn't sell out,'' said Michael S. Gordon, who manages the $185 million Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund.
The weakening dollar helped the group because overseas divisions of American health and biotech companies generated hefty foreign earnings in the quarter. And many companies' earnings are tied more closely to new products than to the overall health of the economy, which protected the group from the worst of the market rout.
All of this makes the health and biotech funds a good place for investors to park their money in a bear market. But shop carefully. Many stocks sell at a premium now. The group's prospects are strong over the long term, too. Health care is one of the largest sectors in the American economy, and spending is rising as a percentage of gross national product. The reasons: a growing elderly population, big jumps in research and development spending, and the coming to market of many new products financed by venture capital in the 1980's.
Among the products coming on stream is Neupogen, which stimulates white blood cells to fight infection. Its manufacturer, Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., hopes it will be approved from the Food and Drug Administration in the next six months. The drug should double Amgen's earnings in the current fiscal year, said Mr. Gordon. Amgen is one of his favorite companies.
Activase, a new drug that dissolves blood clots in heart attack victims, is driving the earnings of another one of Mr. Gordon's favorites, Genentech Inc., in South San Francisco. The company recently sold a controlling interest to Hoffman LaRoche.
One stock selling inexpensively now is C.R. Bard Inc., a Murray Hill N.J.-based medical supply manufacturer whose coronary angioplasty line was recently recalled. Its stock plummeted as a result and is now an excellent buy, said Andrew S. Offit, who manages Fidelity's $305 million Select Health Care Fund. He said the recalled line represented only 15 to 20 percent of Bard's business and earnings should jump 40 percent in 1991.
One of the hot industries of the 1990's will be discount mail-order pharmaceuticals, according to John J. Kaweske, manager of the $91 million Financial Health Science Strategic Portfolio, in Denver. His favorite stock is Albuquerque-based Diagnostik Inc., which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month. Mail-order drugs sell for 15 to 20 percent less than they would at the local pharmacy, so Diagnostik should benefit from greater emphasis on cost-containment and should grow at 35 to 40 percent annually over the next four or five years, Mr. Kaweske said.
Animal health care is a favorite category of Edward P. Owens, who manages the $125 million Vanguard Specialized Portfolios - Healthcare. He likes the Northbrook, Ill.-based Imcera Group, a recently repositioned chemical company that is now a large international animal health care company and a major player in diagnostic pharmaceuticals for people. He said its Optiray, which makes blood opaque and thus clarifies X-ray pictures, should help Imcera grow 30 percent annually for the next three or four years.
He also likes Beckman Instruments, of Fullerton, Calif., which makes medical instruments. It was spun off from SmithKline about two years ago and virtually ignored in the marketplace because of flat earnings. But Mr. Owens expects earnings to pick up because of its Syncron line of clinical diagnostic instruments, and then to grow by 15 to 20 percent for five years.
Cheryl N. Alexander, manager of the $330 million Putnam Health Sciences Trust, likes Schering-Plough, of Madison, N.J., whichmakes Intron, a form of alpha-interferon approved for use by cancer patients.
 
FLIGHT FROM 'JUNK BONDS' PICKS UP
The flight from ''junk bond'' mutual funds seems to be picking up steam again. After several months' respite, in August money began flowing out of the nearly 100 funds. The funds lost $994 million last month, according to figures released last week by the Investment Company Institute. So far this year junk-bond defaults have jumped past the $10 billion mark, with no signs of slowing. In August, junk-bond prices suffered the worst one-month decline on record, a sharp contrast to the price rally that began in May and continued through July.
In September, junk-bond funds ''had net outflows of cash and suffered more than other categories of bond funds,'' said Michael Hines, a vice president at Fidelity Investments in Boston.CAROLE GOULD

Shopping for British Stock Bargains

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
To many investors, Paul Walton may sound like a crazy optimist when he gives his opinion on British stocks. ''We're saying buy, buy and buy some more,'' said the equities strategist at James Capel & Company, the brokerage.
Mr. Walton is not living in never-never land. He knows about all the grim news on the British economy in recent weeks. 
Inflation hit 10.6 percent. Unemployment, although only 5.8 percent, is rising. The manufacturing sector is entering a recession, according to a survey of members of the Confederation of British Industry. And John Major, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has vowed not to cut the nation's base interest rate of 15 percent until it is clear that the battle against inflation is being won.
These developments - coupled with soaring oil prices and fears of a scandal at a former high-flying British company, Polly Peck International P.L.C. - caused The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British stocks to plunge to 1,990.2 on Friday, a low for the year. That was 19.2 percent below its record high of 2,463.7 on Jan. 3.
While not necessarily as enthusiastic about British stocks as Mr. Walton, strategists at other large securities firms also say investors should be making selective purchases. Barring a catastrophe, they say, Britain's economy has just about bottomed out.
Many analysts believe that inflation is at or near its peak and that the Government will begin to cut interest rates late this year or in early 1991. Peter Sullivan, European investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd., noted that in the recessions of the mid-1970's and early 80's, the London stock market jumped 12 percent in the month interest rates began to fall.
Institutional investors, who have been building their cash position over the last year or so, will soon start putting that money into stocks in anticipation of rates falling, Mr. Walton predicts. He expects the market to rise 15 percent in the fourth quarter and the FT-SE 100 to end the year at about 2,300.
Analysts say British stocks are a bargain by several measures. The price-earnings multiple of the FT-SE 100, now about 10.3, is below the 10.6 multiple that followed the 1987 market crash. The dividend yield for the FT-SE all-share index of 678 stocks is 5.9 percent, an eight-year high. And the ratio of bond to stock yields has fallen below 2, which is historically low.
''The bottom line is that on all valuation yardsticks, the U.K. market is now cheap,'' said Paul Turnbull, an economist at Smith New Court Securities P.L.C. He thinks the Japanese and West German stocks are relatively expensive and American stocks are in the middle. Although the FT-SE 100 index could fall as low as 1,850 in coming months, he said, ''the time to be buying is now.''
Because of the London market's current level and because Britain, thanks to its North Sea oil, is a small net oil exporter, even bearish analysts say the London market would fare better than other major markets if the Middle East crisis drags on or worsens. Still, that's small consolation for British companies that must pay more for energy.
British stocks are especially attractive for Americans, some analysts add. They note that the dollar is widely expected to weaken over the next 6 to 12 months, which would mean that British stocks bought now will be worth that much more in dollars later.
As a hedge against the Middle East crisis and the world oil situation worsening, Merrill Lynch recommends that shares of oil companies - especially those dominated by exploration and production - account for 20 percent of a British stock portfolio. Mr. Sullivan declined to cite stocks, but likely candidates are Enterprise, London & Scottish Marine Oil and British Petroleum.
The remaining 80 percent of the portfolio, he said, should be interest-rate-sensitive shares - like those of companies in construction or with relatively high debts - that will rebound when rates drop.
Richard A. Kersley, equities strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd., is becoming more pessimistic that interest rates will be cut this year and recommends caution about buying stocks. But he says there are some investors should consider.
He favors companies with resilient earnings like General Electric of Britain; Wellcome, the drug company; Reckitt & Colman, a food, household products and drug company, and Tesco, a food retailer.
Smith New Court's pick of recession-resistant stocks that would benefit from falling interest rates include Kingfisher, a diversified retailer; Land Securities and British Land, real estate companies; Barclays, the financial services concern, and Blue Circle, a building-materials company.
Mr. Walton of James Capel recommends 10 stocks whose high yields, he reasons, will attract buyers, causing their prices to rise: British Steel; Barclays; United Newspapers; Sedgwick Group, an insurance brokerage; BET, a services company; Sears, the British retailer; Imperial Chemical; Lloyds Bank; General Action, an insurer, and B.A.T., the tobacco and insurance concern.

THE ECONOMY
 
Traders Unfazed by Sale of Oil in Strategic Reserve
 
He produced a trickle and then threatened a flood. Oil traders were immensely unimpressed. President Bush announced on Wednesday evening that the nation would sell five million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a rebuke to speculators who had pushed oil prices too high. ''I'm prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to insure that America stays strong at home,'' he said. On Thursday morning, traders hesitated. For a few minutes, they sent oil down. Then they shrugged and dismissed the President's threats. ''OPEC exports about 22 to 24 million barrels a day, and he's releasing about five million,'' said Brian Tagler, a crude-oil trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton. He added that the heavy, high-sulfur crude in the reserve can be difficult to refine, and that the condition of pipes and pumps is questionable. As oil prices climbed higher than before the President spoke, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins urged the sale of three times as much oil. The Administration is not trying to force prices down , he said, but is just testing the system. 
 
Crude Prices Shoot Up Fast
 
Fears of winter shortages and war in the gulf caused oil prices to rise last week to the highest levels in a decade. A barrel of crude closed on Friday at $39.51, up $4.08 for the week. ''Oil has definitely gone higher, faster than most people expected,'' said Paul D. Mlotok, an energy analyst at Morgan Stanley.
 
The Economy Heads South
 
When even the White House admits the possibility of a recession, the nation must be in for hard times. The gross national product grew just four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, according to a Commerce Department estimate last week that brought on the Administration's gloom. Then came reports that personal income and spending for August both failed to keep up with inflation. Most economists predict that in the fourth quarter spending will evaporate and the economy will shrink. As Stephen S. Roach, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley, put it, ''The consumer is heading south.''
 
Liberation and Regulation
 
L. William Seidman's latest project is no less than the rebuilding of the rickety banking industry. Mr. Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, asked Congress on Tuesday to repeal laws that keep banks from diversifying into new businesses and regions. He wants to continue regulating commercial banks while letting them pursue more investment banking and interstate expansion. He would also like to let other industries buy banks. ''We can only hold the fort if we do substantial restructuring of the industry,'' Mr. Seidman said. The next day, the Bush Administration suggested restricting bank deposit insurance, since the insurance fund is rapidly dwindling. On Thursday, the F.D.I.C. doubled its estimate for the year's losses, to more than $3 billion - suggesting that the Seidman rebuilding crews had better work overtime.
 
Medicine for Detroit
 
Before the decade is over, electric cars may be a California reality - and a Detroit migraine. The state with the nation's toughest air-quality rules approved even stricter ones Friday to create cleaner fuels and vehicles, including electric cars. Auto makers carp that the technology does not exist to achieve the reduction - of 50 to 84 percent - in California's automobile pollution that the new rules require by 2003. But some economists say the forced improvements will make Detroit more competitive with Japan - if the sticker price of progressive transport is right.
 
Bond Game Moves Abroad
 
More Americans are playing the bond market abroad. Investments in foreign bonds of about $10.3 billion in this year's first half surpassed the total for any full year, according to Salomon Brothers. Bond experts point to a weakening dollar and to Japanese and German interest rates that have approached those in the United States - though American inflation has been more rapid. Nicholas Sargen, Salomon's director of research, says long-term investors like pension funds are looking overseas, too. ''The diversification argument has begun to influence them,'' he said. ''They realize the U.S. economy is not closed.''
 
COMPANIES
 
Real Estate Goes to the Dogs
 
Maybe the slowdown in real estate has become more severe than everyone thought: Several prominent architects have turned to designing doghouses. At the Cooper-Hewitt Museum on Fifth Avenue in New York, 24 houses - dog palaces, some - decorate the back lawn. There are the Trojan Dog - dog-shaped, with ramp and canine frieze; the Lap Dog Pool House, boasting sun deck and circular pool; the Bauwauhaus, incorporating a Marcel Breuer table turned upside down; and the Lassie Come Home, crafted from a television console. Each designer got $1,000 from the museum, and, from the looks of things, many shot way over budget, as architects sometimes will.
 
 Wall Street Applauds Matsushita
 
In a lackluster fall season, with investors staying away, the New York Stock Exchange finally has a hit - MCA Inc., which rose $19.50 a share to $54 on Tuesday on word that Matsushita Electric is a prospective buyer. Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics company, is said to be offering as much as $7.5 billion, or more than $85 a share. An expensive ticket, but good for admission to the American entertainment market. Matsushita would take a seat next to its archrival, Sony, which bought Columbia Pictures for $5 billion last year. Can MCA's Universal Pictures, Universal Television and Motown Records still deliver the entertainment that Matsushita craves? Universal has brought out all-time hits like ''E.T.'', ''Jaws,'' ''Back to the Future'' and ''The Sting.'' But most of the company's greatest films are old properties that stopped filling theaters years ago.
 
In Brief
 
Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood delayed the sentencing of Michael R. Milken from tomorrow and may hold a hearing on crimes the Government has alleged but that the ''junk bond'' financier denies.
 
Wall Street's underwriting fees during the third quarter fell to their lowest level in six years.They fell to $339 million, from $785.6 million in the comparable period last year.
 
Neil Bush acknowledged last week that he stood to gain from dealings between his business partners and the defunct Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, where he was a director. Mr. Bush, charged with conflicts of interest by the Office of Thrift Supervision, said at a public hearing that he did no wrong.
 
Marvin Davis has offered to buy UAL Inc., then give employees two years to raise financing to buy it from him.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Soviet Power and Potatoes
 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has won the power to set wages and prices, shape the budget, enforce law and order, devise a compromise between two rival economic plans - and, he hopes, motivate more workers to dig potatoes. The Soviet Parliament voted on Monday to give him emergency authority for 18 months. Although progress toward free markets seems to require looser controls, Mr. Gorbachev wants more power to rescue the Soviet economy. He might need all the power he can muster merely to keep potatoes on Soviet plates.
 
 Pressure on Brazil
 
 President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil says he respects American calls for lower trade barriers and protection of the rain forests, but bank debts are another matter. Brazil, the largest debtor in the third world, begins talks next month on the $57 billion it owes to foreign private banks. On a visit to New York last week, Mr. Collor was unyielding. ''We do not feel it is a logical stance to make demands that will keep Brazil from growing and which will keep Brazil from paying in the future,'' he said. Asked whether Brazil would make any payments to the banks this year, he said: ''That is an answer they are eager to hear.''

 BODY:
Philip H. Geier Jr. has become a kind of corporate psychiatrist treating a case of schizophrenia at the Interpublic Group of Companies, the largest and oldest advertising conglomerate in the United States. And at least for the present the treatment seems to be working beautifully.
Interpublic, which Mr. Geier leads as chairman and chief executive, had until recently owned two international advertising networks. One, McCann-Erickson Worldwide, was pulling the corporation in one direction, and the other, Lintas Worldwide, in another.
Mr. Geier's solution: Invite a third patient into the mix. He announced 10 days ago that Interpublic would acquire all of the Lowe Group of Britain, a collection of feisty agencies that may pull it in a bit wackier, more creative direction. (See story on page 6.) For all its internal contradictions, Interpublic is making the rest of the industry look a bit sickly. Saatchi & Saatchi, the British company that used to be the world's largest advertising conglomerate, is struggling under the crush of debt. The WPP Group P.L.C. - another British ad company, which is now the world's largest largest after having seized the American giants J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy Group in 1987 and 1989 - is seeing its share price plummet. 
But Interpublic, the company that put tigers in our tanks for Exxon and told women how to be ''Cover Girl Clean,'' just grows and grows. Its net income increased last year by 17 percent and its earnings per share grew by 15 percent, while domestic advertising expenditures rose only 5.8 percent, the smallest increase in two decades. In the process, Interpublic's agencies added half a billion dollars in net new business, increasing their worldwide billings to more than $9 billion.
''It's the best-run of the large advertising networks,'' said James Dougherty, a communications analyst with County Natwest Securities. ''In fact, it's kind of surprising to me they've been able to do as well as they have, given the environment.''
 
Struggling for Redefinition
Yet despite its extraordinary growth, Interpublic is not without its problems. It is, in fact, struggling to redefine itself, apparently caught between advertising's past and what many think should be its future. McCann, whose clients range from the populist (Coca-Cola) to the elitist (Brooks Brothers) seems convinced that advertising agencies will profit primarily by dispensing television commercials and print ads. Lintas, which turned stodgy old Chevrolet into the pulsating ''heartbeat of America,'' sees its future in the New Advertising. This is the theory that customers can no longer be drawn to products and services merely by TV and print ads, but that a complex combination sales promotion, public relations, package design and direct marketing are required.
Interpublic is also fighting a reputation as the least creative of the world's advertising empires. Acquiring the Lowe Group, renowned in Britain for its work for Heineken beer, may help counteract that. But the company still must battle a legacy of caution that experts say could stall its upward trend.
Supervising this divided realm is Mr. Geier, an arrogant, blustery 55-year-old who bristles when people question his agencies' creativity and thinks nothing of making screaming 7:30 A.M. telephone calls to ad executives whose public comments have offended him. But for a man who takes nothing lightly, Mr. Geier appears untroubled about his empire's contradictions.
''I think we've got the best of both worlds going for us,'' he said. ''We've got one agency doing it one way and another agency doing it the other. We'll learn in this process.''
Most advertising agencies proudly line their walls with ads. Not Interpublic. The halls of its headquarters on the 44th floor of the Time and Life Building in Manhattan are lined with a museum's cache of modern art.
Phil Geier, a former executive on the Coca-Cola account who has been Interpublic's chairman since 1979, strutted proudly past the Cindy Sherman photograph and the Bruce Nauman neon sculpture before settling on a couch in his conference room, near a mural painted by Sol LeWitt, and explained the presence of the art. ''People told me it looked like a bank up here, so we invested in leading edge contemporary artists. We're not a bank,'' he said. ''We're in the advertising business.''
Mr. Geier laughed. The irony was intended. Because, to the advertising world, Interpublic is a bank, a money machine fueled in large part by a series of intelligent acquisitions.
As an undergraduate at Colgate University, Mr. Geier earned the nickname Deals when he bought out competing fraternity food concessionaires to assemble a profitable monopoly.
But for all his bluster and cockiness Mr. Geier also shows himself to be fairly pliable.
Whereas once he denigrated the idea of the New Advertising, now he muses thoughtfully about it: ''You've got to operate with your clients' way of doing business and slowly get it to change. Where an agency can be most helpful, I think, is it can be a catalyst. It can put together a total communications plan and use some of its own resources and some outside resources.''
 
A Clash of Styles
 Mr. Geier's two agencies, McCann and Lintas, share several multinational clients, among them General Motors and Coca-Cola, but their different corporate styles are otherwise clearly personified in the the men who run them.
McCann's chief executive, Robert L. James, a 54-year-old former fraternity brother of Mr. Geier's at Colgate, is a short, pugnacious type man whose office is decorated with nautical artifacts, a testament to his passion for sailboat racing. His own description of McCann fits him, too: ''a street-smart, aggressive, no-holds-barred scrambler.'' In contrast, he terms Lintas ''reserved, cool.''
Mr. Weithas, chief executive of Lintas, agrees. ''Our culture is a more European culture,'' said the tailored, formal 60 year old, ''where McCann's is more. . . .'' He paused. ''American.''
Perhaps because of its relative gentility, but more likely because of plain bad luck, Lintas has suffered a streak of high-profile account losses in recent years. Last year, it lost the Noxell Corporation, for which it had created the ''Cover Girl Clean'' makeup campaign, after a 43-year relationship. The agency's crime: Its largest client is Unilever, archcompetitor to Procter & Gamble, which had acquired Noxell. And earlier this year, Eastern Airlines fired the agency - which had served the troubled carrier through its bankruptcy proceedings - because Eastern's court-appointed administrator was friendly with executives at Ogilvy & Mather.
Jim Dougherty, the County Natwest analyst, attributes Interpublic's success despite its problems to its vast web of agencies.
McCann has 8,000 people in 71 countries, and Lintas, 6,000 in 48 countries. This network contributes fully two-thirds of the company's revenues and has insulated it from the general slowdown the American economy.
An Area of Vulnerability
 Alan J. Gottesman, a communications analyst at Paine Webber Inc., says credit must also go to the company's genius at controlling costs for such items as real estate and personnel. Interpublic handles all its mergers and acquisitions itself, for example, saving an estimated $15 million in investment banking fees for the more than 80 acquisitions it has made since 1982, according to Eugene P. Beard, the company's chief financial officer.
''They've gone along for the past couple of years with no really significant bad events,'' said Dougherty. ''That's lulled us into a sense of security that nothing bad can happen. But it can.'' Indeed, it can. Creativity, for example, has been an area of vulnerability. Interpublic's two giant advertising networks rarely figure in discussions about the industry's most creative agencies.
Neither McCann nor Lintas was named among the best agencies in last year's survey of 207 advertising executives by Advertising Age, the trade magazine. Ogilvy and J. Walter Thompson, two other multinational agencies serving equally large clients, finished among the top six.
McCann is widely perceived as one of Madison Avenue's least creative large agencies.
''In the 70's and early 80's, McCann's image was as the only creative big shop around,'' said Penny Hawkey, a former creative executive. ''That's no longer true.''
Many assign responsibility for McCann's image problems to the revolving door on the company's office of creative director in New York, where eight people have come and gone in the last decade. Executives cite the difficulty creative people have working with Bob James, McCann's chairman, and John Dooner, head of its North American operations. Without affection, Mrs. Hawkey calls the two men ''very powerful suits''- ad lingo for executives who lack appreciation for creativity.
But most say the creative problems stem from what they call ''the system'' - a kind of all-powerful, transcendent bureaucracy. The problem, say executives, is that Interpublic is structured to serve massive clients like Unilever and General Motors, who use it primarily for its vast network of offices and people. That bureaucracy, critics claim, is stifling. ''You cannot be a creatively driven agency on a growth pattern within the I.P.G. system, where the system is more important than anything else,'' said a former executive.
Nor has there been much impetus to change. As one current executive said, ''To big-bucks clients, advertising is a commodity. Advertising is filling in a need in the business marketing process. When a Coke moves around the world, it wants control over its image. How much does creativity really matter?''
 
The Cycle of Mediocrity
 But it does matter - especially to top writers and art directors who won't go to an agency with a reputation for lackluster creativity. That creates a cycle of mediocrity that can hinder an agency's efforts to recruit top creative people.
In an unusual breaching of the wall that separates his agencies, Mr. Geier - who professes a hands-off attitude toward his agencies' management but, by most accounts, is intimately involved with them - personally drew Sean K. Fitzpatrick from Lintas's Detroit office, where he led the ''heartbeat of America'' campaign for Chevrolet, to become McCann's top creative officer.
A bearded bear of a man, Fitzpatrick, who is 49, may be exactly what McCann needs. An outspoken former Hollywood screenwriter, he loves advertising awards shows - ceremonies that can be critically important in boosting a creative department's morale and reputation, but events from which McCann has been noticeably absent for many years.
''I looked around when I got here and it was like 13th-century Japan, with all these warlords in separate fiefdoms fighting each other,'' Fitzpatrick said with characteristic candor. ''I found sloppiness. I found a lot of commercials were coming through that weren't timed to 30 seconds. I found you couldn't find how many ads were being done in the place at any given moment. I don't think anybody listened to the creative director at all.''
The general consensus is that Fitzpatrick has made a difference. Some of McCann's work has even begun to show up in awards shows again. But it clearly still has a ways go.
Although Interpublic is the model for modern advertising companies, its brush with bankruptcy in the mid-1960's left a legacy that afflicts it to this day. The near-bankruptcy ''is the reason we didn't go pell-mell into ancillary services,'' said Bob James of McCann-Erickson. ''We learned 25 years ago that you can't run it if you don't know it. We have been chastened and prudent since.''
 
Diverse Services
 But companies like Young & Rubicam and WPP and, increasingly, their clients, are acting from the belief that information about products and services is communicated in many ways, not just through television commercials and print ads. ''We believe market share gains will be rooted in agencies' abilities to serve their clients across a range of marketing services,'' wrote Laurie Goldberger, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, in a widely distributed report last year.
But at Interpublic it's clear that Mr. Geier has not resolved all the in-house conflict over the issue. In 1988, 95 percent of Interpublic's revenues still came from mainstream advertising. By contrast, only 49 percent of the revenues of the WPP Group derived from mainstream advertising; the rest came from public relations, market research, direct marketing, events marketing and the like.
And at McCann, executives vehemently affirm that the status quo will remain intact. His anger rising, James called the New Advertising ''smoke.''
Some clients agree with the criticism of Interpublic. The Sony Corporation of America gradually took more than $20 million in billings away from McCann and gave the accounts to smaller agencies because of McCann's inability to mount effective, coordinated communications campaigns, said Jeffrey S. Brooks, Sony's vice president of advertising.
But by and large, McCann has not thus far been hurt by its resistance to New Advertising. Already this year, it has won more than $200 million in new business in the United States, including the $70 million advertising account for Tri-Star Pictures - paradoxically, a subsidiary of Sony. And Interpublic's largest clients, like General Motors, say they are satisfied.
In Europe, Interpublic has quietly developed capabilities that lie outside the realm of mainstream advertising. And in the United States, through the Lintas network, Interpublic, is pushing ahead with myriad disciplines and integrated marketing. In the spring, to the advertising industry's surprise, Lintas's approach paid off. The Sara Lee Corporation consolidated $100 million worth of marketing spending at the Interpublic unit - $45 million of it in direct marketing - expressly because of Lintas's New Advertising expertise.
Such fiesty contrarianism may be the true hallmark of Interpublic's style. Demean the competition, denigrate their strategies, but if study proves they might be onto something, quietly move in their direction. That has been Interpublic's approach to the New Advertising, a higher creative profile and the acquisition of a third international agency network, and it seems to be working.
''Everybody gave me a lot of heat in the mid-80's for not making big deals,'' Phil Geier last week, basking in the afterglow of the Lowe Group acquisition. ''But we're in it for the long term, not the short term. We have some standards.''
 
A ZEST FOR THE DEAL
Deals Geier is still living up to his nickname, his associates say, constantly exploiting others' weaknesses for Interpublic's gain.
When Martin Sorrell of the WPP Group made his run on Ogilvy last year, Phil Geier thought nothing of publicly pronouncing the British acquisitor a ''predator'' - and then turning around to make his own offer.
His single-mindedness is legendary inside Interpublic's agencies. William V. Weithas, who heads the Lintas network, recalls that his wife would have to force Mr. Geier to exchange even minimal social niceties when he called their home to talk business.
The collapse of the British advertising market has provided opportunities for Mr. Geier and his surprisingly lean holding-company staff. The Lowe Group, for example, found itself unable to realize its vision of becoming an international advertising empire, unable to raise enough money for acquisitions. Mr. Geier was waiting in the wings. Earlier this month he made a successful stock and cash offer to buy the 65 percent of Lowe that Interpublic did not already own.
Deals Geier's deal has been applauded by industry analysts. Adding Lowe will increase Interpublic's networth by $1.4 billion, leave it with about a $235 million debt - only a quarter of Saatchi & Saatchi's - and enhance its creative reputation.
 
AN EMPIRE LINKED BY AN 'ECONOMIC UMBILICAL CORD'
McCANN-ERICKSON, the foundation upon which the Interpublic Group of Companies was built, was founded in 1902 by Harrison King McCann, a former advertising manager for Standard Oil of New Jersey, to be a house agency for Standard Oil. For decades, when J. Walter Thompson was bravely establishing outposts around the world to prospect for clients, McCann was growing carefully and methodically , following its multinational clients as they expanded.
But by 1960, McCann's leader, a Yale-educated Oklahoman named Marion Harper Jr., had a better idea. Harper, who died last year, understood that impediments to growth were conflicts of interest that prevent it from accepting business from competing companies. Harper's vision was to assemble a group of ostensibly independent agencies under the umbrella of a benign financial holding company. Connected only by an economic umbilical cord, they would be free to compete with each other, the way General Motors's Buick and Oldsmobile divisions did.
Harper's notion was ridiculed - wisecrackers said it was appropriate that the first office of his holding company, Interpublic, was located in the same building as Mad magazine - but he persevered, acquiring a series of venerable, sometimes competing agencies. The only thing that stood in Harper's way was his own profligacy. ''Marion was a pioneer,'' recalled Carl Spielvogel, for many years a Harper protege at Interpublic and now the chairman of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising conglomerate. ''Unfortunately, he got involved in unrelated acquisitions that caused the company to teeter on the brink of bankruptcy - an airline, a fashion information company, some research companies, even a dude ranch on Long Island.''
In 1965, desperately in need of $5 million to keep Interpublic afloat, its board of directors acceded to a demand from its banks that it unseat Harper. A year later, the board took the company public to gain access to much-needed capital.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Will Landlords Desert Their Buildings Again?

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
For much of the 1970's, landlords abandoned thousands of apartment buildings each year in New York City's poorest neighborhoods, producing a real-estate and social disaster of major proportions. More than 200,000 apartments were lost,and the burned-out shells that marred huge swaths of the South Bronx, Harlem and central Brooklyn became potent symbols of urban despair.
There is growing concern today among landlords, bankers and city officials that some of the same conditions that led to the wave of abandonment may be coalescing again.
The downturn in the city's real estate market has diminished the value of rental apartment buildings, finding renters has become a bit harder and the chances to convert to co-ops have faded, and many owners who overfinanced their buildings in the giddy 1980's are having trouble keeping up with their mortgages. Foreclosures are rising. Operating costs have soared in the last two years, owners say, particularly sewer and water bills and property taxes. Now the price of oil has skyrocketed too. 
''This is very reminiscent of the 1970's,'' said Michael D. Lappin, the president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit company created by more than two dozen New York banks to lend money for housing renovation in poor neighborhoods.
The number of buildings actually abandoned, which shrank to a trickle in the 1980's, has not increased much this year, city officials say. But warning signs are abundant.
The number of buildings seized by the city because the owners fell behind on their tax payments did increase, from 804 last year to 1,409 so far this year. Such seizures begin the process under which the city takes over tax-delinquent properties. Owners then get several chances to reclaim their buildings by paying the back taxes and interest, so it is too soon to know how many will ultimately abandon their buildings.
Some buildings that had been profitable for years have begun to run deficits, landlord representatives and building owners say. R. Bonnie Haber, the president of the RBH Management Corporation, manages a six-story building with working-class and middle-class tenants in Jackson Heights, Queens. The building has long been profitable, and showed a net income of $20,000 in 1988, Ms. Haber said. She estimates that it will show a $60,000 loss this year.
Water and sewer bills are up $8,840, or 38 percent, this year, compared to 1988, Ms. Haber said. Real estate taxes increased $26,932, or 31 percent. Repair and maintenance costs went up $26,000, or 32 percent, she said. Salaries, heating oil and other expenses also shot up.
Rents increased too, under guidelines for rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. The total increase for 1988-1990 was $60,000, or 14 percent. It could have been higher, but for the changes in New York's economy. Vacant apartments now take longer to rent, Ms. Haber said, and sometimes even the legally authorized rents are not attainable. A two-bedroom apartment that could be rented for a maximum of $856 a month was rented, after it remained vacant for three months, for $800, she said.
''The only reason people are holding on right now is that they have other properties which are doing better, and they can cover the cost,'' she said. ''They are hoping things will turn around.''
But profit and loss is only one factor in whether a building will be abandoned. The owner's sense of the building's potential for resale or co-op conversion, confidence in the neighborhood, a boom in the city's economy or in the incomes of the building's tenants can favorably dispose a landlord toward a building that is temporarily losing money.
Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an owners group, said increased costs could threaten many buildings. He cited a city study of income and expense statements that large landlords are required to file as part of the tax-assessment process. Forty-six of the 500 buildings studied reported operating expenses greater than income. And those did not include mortgage costs.
''You could easily see abandonment reaching the proportions of the mid-70's in another year or two, unless something dramatic changes,'' Mr. Margulies said. Tenant representatives agreed that a surge was possible, but they disputed both the causes and the suggested remedies.
Michael McKee, executive director of the Community Training and Resource Center, a nonprofit group that trains tenant organizers, said the unaudited statements filed by landlords were unreliable.
Owners say the filings are just like income-tax returns and carry penalities for lying.
Mr. McKee also said operating costs have not increased significantly, and blamed owners' problems on inflated mortgages they obtained in the 1980's. ''Banks were willing to underwrite absurd packages,'' he said. ''But times have changed, and now there is this big whine and moan.''
A landlord unable to keep up on a mortgage ''should eat it,'' Mr. McKee said. An abandoned building ''can be an opportunity, where government is concerned.''
Owners and real-estate executives argued that the city could not afford to run all the buildings it would take over for taxes. Because two-thirds of New York's poor live in private housing, the city should help owners keep their properties, they said.
Mr. Margulies said the city should consider raising the lowest rents on regulated apartments, so more rent for $400 to $500 a month.
Mr. Lappin called for more subsidies for owners who improve their buildings.
''There is always this pitting of owner and tenant,'' he said. ''But if you look at it, they are really in the same boat, aren't they? There are real economic issues here and they are difficult issues. There are no great winners when this thing goes down the tubes.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Troubles of South Asia Take Over on Campus

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
Struggling to exist on meager budgets while fighting perennial battles to stay open through bouts of political turmoil and violence, the universities of South Asia are in trouble.
In grimy, cheerless lecture halls and bare-bones science labs across the region - in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal - underpaid professors face hundreds of thousands of students who know that graduation will bring only a long, soul-destroying search for a job, any job, to match their qualifications.
To add to the unhappy atmosphere, weapons are proliferating on many campuses, often at the service of political parties or ethnic factions that use students as private armies. Dormitories, student unions and other organizations have become sharply politicized. Gun battles erupt. Bombs are thrown. Precious equipment gets destroyed. Young lives are jeopardized. Students who can afford it want to go abroad - particularly to the United States - for the luxury of an uninterrupted higher education. Many never return. In South Asia in 1990, this is not a simple story of young rebels confronting despotic governments. All of the region's countries have democratic institutions, however flawed or misused. Because the roots of campus malaise are varied, solutions are especially hard to find. 
There are exceptions, often in unlikely places. At the vortex of Afghan intrigue in Pakistan, Peshawar University functions productively. Many campuses in India are peaceful, even if as deprived as Jawaharlal Nehru University, a leading center for the social sciences where a political scientist said he could not afford to subscribe to basic scholarly journals.
This is, above all, a region of high illiteracy, overpopulation and extreme poverty, where the development of human resources is crucial to social and economic growth. This makes the stagnation and deterioration of universities especially worrisome for educators and the public.
When young people began to set themselves on fire here last week to protest the extension of a sweeping affirmative action program designed to help more disadvantaged Indians, teachers and political commentators saw in the action a cry of despair among the barely privileged, now fearful of losing what little they have. The Government's reaction was one familiar to South Asia: Close the campuses first, and talk to the students later. Delhi University has been ordered shut until Oct. 15.
Student politicking and campus unrest, now and then exploding into violence, are not unknown in more prosperous and developed countries, including the United States.
In South Asia, however, the concern is that the politicization of universities is more pervasive and permanent. The process began years ago, often with independence movements.
Today in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, and Sind, the surrounding province, students have sophisticated arsenals. In the last few years, surplus weapons from Afghanistan have been spilling into neighborhoods and campuses along with narcotics, which also come across the Afghan border.
Ethnicity has also been a major factor in campus warfare, as illustrated by Altaf Hussain, leader of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a new Pakistani party that says it speaks for the Muslim families who migrated here from India at partition in 1947. He said in an interview that he began to think in ethnic terms as a student nearly 20 years ago, when he found himself isolated on a campus where Pathans, Baluchis, Punjabis and Sindhis all had exclusive political organizations. His movement now has its own armed student wing.
 
 Shutting Classrooms
In Sri Lanka, university campuses were closed for most of last year because they had become recruiting centers for the People's Liberation Front, a radical organization drawn from the majority Sinhalese community. The group opposes both autonomy for the Tamil minority and the presence of Indian peace-keeping troops. The front also appeals to students from the lower middle class, who feel socially and intellectually intimidated by the country's sizable educated elite. Education Minister Lalith Athulathmudali said in an interview that the experience of 1989 could cause the Government to abandon the concept of residential campuses in favor of a system in which students live at home until graduate school. ''The tension between the haves and have nots is just too great,'' he said. ''By postgraduate level, we can smooth this out.''
In Bangladesh, political parties have used students for street demonstrations since independence in 1971. So powerful are the campus political groups, now almost all in opposition to President H. M. Ershad, that the President's party recently dissolved its own fledgling campus group, which was constantly under attack. All six universities have armed student groups, and they have become adept at blockading streets or closing shopping areas with threats of violence on issues that have nothing to do with education.
In Nepal last winter, when protests against the ban on political parties began, the country's premier university, Tribhuvan, was closed after a raid by armed policemen in search of student and faculty radicals.
''Nepal's higher education is in a tailspin,'' an article in Himal, a journal of Himalayan studies, said in 1988, adding a pithy description of the situation that could apply across the region: ''The teachers are underpaid and untrained, the facilities are deplorable, the students unmotivated, and the administration drifts aimlessly, like a ship without a rudder.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Reunification II: This Time, No Hobnail Boots

BYLINE: By JOSEOH JOFFE; Josef Joffe, on leave from the Suddeutsche Zeitung, is the Visiting Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security Affairs at Harvard.

 BODY:
In 1871, Germany was unified, and a few years later, The Times of London editorialized darkly: ''We feel that an enormous power for good or evil has risen up somewhat suddenly in the midst of us, and we watch with interested attention for signs of its character and intention.''
On Wednesday, the world will watch ''Reunification II'' - and as anxiously as 120 years ago. Will the sequel be a repeat performance, starring a restless giant who has become too big for his turf? Will Germany '90 move from strength to arrogance, again bringing grief to Europe and the rest of the world?
The Bismarck-to-Hitler analogy is tempting but misleading. Just compare the opening scenes. In 1871, Germany was unified by ''blood and iron'' - in a war of aggression launched against France. Today, Germans and French are no longer archenemies but the best of friends. On Wednesday, the loudest sounds to be heard in Berlin will be the whistling of fireworks, not the rumble of artillery. Reunification will be a thoroughly peaceful affair. 
Not only is the overture different this time; the stage, script and actors have also changed beyond recognition. Take the lead player. In the Bismarckian Reich, democracy was shouldered aside by a Prussian-dominated state that unleashed an economic revolution while chaining down liberty and dissent. The Kaiser's message to the rising middle classes was: Go ahead and enrich yourselves, but leave the driving to us.
In the Weimar Republic, born in defeat and disgrace after World War I, democracy never had a chance. Yes, there was a parliamentary regime, but it was ground down in a two-pronged attack by Communists and Nazis who flourished because millions were caught in the maw of the Great Depression. And in 1933, when Hitler came to power, democracy was simply torn to shreds.
After 1945 democracy could at last sink its roots into fertile soil, and in many ways the postwar political miracle in Germany even dwarfed its vaunted economic twin. This time, thanks to generous American help, democracy was not associated with economic misery and humiliation. Instead of reparations, there was Marshall Plan aid; instead of towering tariffs, there was free trade; instead of encirclement, there was NATO and the European Community, extending to the Germans a shelter and a role.
At last, then, German democracy was off to a good start, and today the Cassandras of 1945 have fallen silent. The parties of the extreme right and left have all but vanished, leaving in place a sluggishly centrist regime that is almost boring in its normalcy. The democratic system has weathered every political crisis: neo-Nazis and terrorists, insubordinate generals and rebellious students, large-scale unemployment and mass protests.
In many respects, the political system looks like America writ small. Federalism works, and so does the separation of powers. Compared with the ''republican monarchy'' that is France, the Federal Republic is a political free-for-all. Nor is there an Official Secrets Act that so hampers the freedom of the press in Britain. State secrets in Bonn last about as long as in Washington - until tomorrow's edition.
The point is not that today's Germans are ''good'' whereas their grandfathers were thoroughbred authoritarians. The point is that after World War II the stage changed. Flawed as it was in the past, the drama of German history at last could unfold before a benign backdrop. Consider the ugly brew of paranoia and chauvinism that had poisoned the body politic before. The Bismarck Reich, a late arrival in the great power club, was bound to threaten all of its neighbors - and in turn to be threatened by them. The Weimar Republic was a pariah among nations and a target of endless distrust - a perfect breeding ground for the enemies of peace and democracy. It was ''us against them'' and ''Deutschland Uber Alles.''
Reunified Germany, by contrast, will be embedded in a larger community, surrounded by friends and not by resentful neighbors. The Federal Republic grew up in security, provided courtesy of the United States, and this cut down the business opportunities of the Pied Pipers. Try as they may, right-wing parties, hawking their message of hate, have never established a foothold in the Federal Parliament.
But, so the skeptics will demur, that wonderful edifice is collapsing before our own eyes. With the Soviet surrender in the Cold War, the Atlantic alliance is fading and the Americans are going home. Won't Germany, finally unshackled from its postwar fetters, again be tempted by sheer strength and the heady lure of aggrandizement?
True, waning dependence equals less deference. Absent the Soviet threat, Bonn-Berlin might be less hesitant to convert economic muscle into political clout. But to argue that Reunification II will turn into a remake of the 1871 original is to ignore how much the script itself has changed.
The rivalry of nations in the democratic-industrial world has moved from the battlefield into the economic arena, and it promises to stay there as long as the marvelous economic community Europeans have built persists. Nobody expects the Germans to invade Alsace again; now they pay for the pleasure of owning the choice plots there, just as the Japanese are buying, not bombing, Pearl Harbor.
Power in Europe (as opposed to Saddam Hussein's neighborhood) is measured not by conquest but by capital surpluses. Not booty and glory define the stakes, but questions such as: ''Who determines currency parities?'' It so happens that the Bundesbank calls the shots, which understandably grates hard on the French. But worlds separate this contest from the game played out with German jackboots in Paris 50 years ago. The battle lines are drawn in the balance-of-payments ledgers, and the accounts are settled with dollars and Deutsche marks, not blood and iron. The rivalry is about joint welfare, not this or that province; both sides lose or win together. (American victims of Sony resent cheap VCRs made in Japan, but who would go to war over the privilege of buying worse-quality goods at higher prices?) Still, might not Bonn-Berlin hanker after nuclear weapons and push for revision of its eastern borders? What for? The new, more civilized and civilianized game of nations offers the largest payoffs to nations such as Germany and Japan. The game has devalued the military chips, delivering power and prestige to those who can back up their bets with investments and loans. Why, then, should they forego their advantage by changing the rules? In the attempt, they would certainly revive the hostile coalitions that proved their undoing in 1945. Also, well-settled democracies are more sensible about such risks than were the Hohenzollerns and Hitlerites.
On Wednesday, Bonn Inc. will take over bankrupt Prusso-Marx, a k a East Germany. But the remake of 1871 will not be shot with a cast of latter-day Erich von Stroheims. The soundtrack will not be ''Deutschland Uber Alles,'' but Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' Europe's unofficial anthem. Walking alone in the distant past, Germans easily fell for the mesmerizing music of the Pied Pipers. But in the meantime Europe has changed, and so has Germany. Hamburg and Rome, Munich and Marseilles have been listening to the same tune for a long time; adding Dresden and Leipzig should not ruin that score.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Australia Wants Asia to Come A-Waltzing

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: BRISBANE, Australia

 BODY:
For years, this outpost of Europe behaved like a standoffish neighbor to the Asian community it lived in. Instead of cultivating ties with the community, it relied on its own natural wealth and its political, economic and cultural links to Europe.
But now, fearful that it will lose European markets after the European Community is fully established in 1992 and aware that its Asian neighbors' economies are flourishing, Australia is accepting, even embracing, its geographic location, hoping to share in the regional growth.
''In the sense of being a true part of the growth in this region, developing ourselves in the rapid pace of Southeast Asia, we're a sort of hanger-on-er, rather than a full participant in the growth,'' said Paul W. McCarthy, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 
In the two years since Prime Minister Bob Hawke traveled to Seoul and announced a drive for closer economic cooperation within the Pacific region, Australians have been shaking the hands of more Asian officials, business executives and tourists than ever before. There are more Hong Kong Chinese immigrants mingling in Australian society, and in the last three years Australia has run trade surpluses with Japan, which now accounts for more than one-fifth of Australia's total trade.
Japanese investment, which exceeded $26 billion in the end of the 1989 fiscal year, has been the fastest growing source of foreign investment in the country. Britain and the United States, however, still have higher levels of investment.
Yet many Australians say more needs to be done, especially economically, to integrate their island with Asia. Trade with Southeast Asia, for instance, has grown only slightly in the last three years.
While Australians still crave American imports, Japanese businesses have become such a dominant influence in trade that 4 of the top 10 largest Australian exporters are Japanese companies. After Broken Hill Property Group, Australia's largest industrial corporation, the No. 2 exporter is Mitsui & Company (Australia) Ltd. Most of the exports are commodities, such as wood chips, ore and coal, and many of them go straight to Japan, which receives more than twice the value of exports of Australia's second-largest market, the United States. For Australia to become a larger force in Asia, many economists and business executives say, the country must restructure its own economy.
 
Plyboard, Not Chips
''Instead of sending wood chips, we should be sending plyboard, and where they take paper pulp, we should send paper,'' said Paul A. Everingham, a corporate lawyer.
He said one concern is the Australian view of Asia. ''One of our problems is that Australians think of Asia in terms of Japan and China, and they think of the other countries as places they can go to for holidays.''
Japan and China have been the focus of Australia's ties to Asia. In a dramatic turnaround from the White Australia policy, which essentially shut out Asian immigrants until the early 1970's, Mr. Hawke this June granted 19,000 Chinese students the right to stay for four years in Australia. And Australian businesses have called on China for years.
Japan, on the other hand, sends not migrants but money. Japanese companies operate throughout Australian financial and trading circles, and more and more Japanese honeymooners are coming to Australia to eat steak and play golf. In Brisbane and the nearby sunny Gold Coast, Japanese corporations have purchased nearly a dozen resort hotels to cater to large Japanese tour groups. In 1989, nearly 350,000 Japanese tourists came to Australia, buying large blocks of seats on the planes and paying for spaces on the golf courses.
The area has always been a Shangri-la for Australian retirees, but now some Australians are finding that the Japanese presence involves a price: some Australians are priced out of the market as purchases by Japanese companies push up property values.
While some Australians fear or criticize the influx of foreign capital, others are calling for measures to develop the export of services in which Australia is strong, such as education, health and advanced technology. These may be areas of opportunity for trade with neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia.
 
A Joint Venture
In Adelaide, Japanese and Australian business executives and politicians are planning together the construction of a high-tech metropolis, where tiny villages would be linked to a modern network of communications, a research university, a science and industrial park and other commercial facilities that would attract investors.
But the move toward Asia has been bumpy, because Australia still values its historic ties to Europe. More students are studying Japanese, but many Australians still aspire to attend Oxford. More trade delegations are going to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, but the country remains part of the Commonwealth and Australians still celebrate the Queen's birthday.
''No doubt we have to come to grips with becoming a part of Asia,'' said William J. Shields, executive director of Macquarie Bank Ltd. ''But it's dangerous to see us as an Asian country. Culturally we have other links.''
Some Australian companies find it difficult to break into Asian markets, and many do not speak the languages or know the local customs. Moreover, most of the economies are still viewed as developing ones, compared with Australia's rather mature economy, where per capita gross domestic product was $17,100 in the last fiscal year. Australia is trying to develop its manufacturing base and looks upon certain Asian countries as stronger competitors, with their cheap labor.
''A lot of people claim that Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan are catching up to us'' in output, said Saul Eslake, chief economist at McIntosh Hamson Hoare Govett Ltd., an investment firm in Melbourne. ''And there's a lot of angst about all that.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Budget Battle Spatters Politicians

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the Federal budget deficit threatens to choke the economy, the most powerful men in Government, meeting week after week, hour after hour, have found it far easier to bash each other for inaction than to find common ground.
Faced with a widespread shutdown of Government offices and activities in the absence of a budget agreement, Congress has scheduled sessions for today to revise the deadlines of the Federal budget-balancing law to avoid automatic multi-billion dollar program cuts on Monday. After a compromise between White House and Congressional negotiators late Friday night, it appeared the way was open for a deal that would keep the Government functioning.
But in an atmosphere of growing disgust at debacles such as the savings and loan collapse and the ethical missteps on Capitol Hill, the budget quagmire is for many Americans the most telling evidence yet that the nation's leaders are sacrificing the public interest for their own. 
''The mood is almost 100 percent 'the hell with them all,' '' said Larry King, the national radio and television call-in host. ''I don't remember any time quite like this. Out of 300 calls in the last two weeks, 130 have been on Congress and the deficit. I haven't gotten one call that George Bush is correct and Congress is wrong, or that Congress is correct and George Bush is wrong. There's a 'damn both thy houses' attitude.''
Some politicians are equally harsh, among them Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana. ''The most serious consequence of the budget deficit may be that we've lost our credibility,'' said Mr. Hamilton, one of the most respected House Democrats. ''No party, no leader, no member is going to come out of this looking very good. We're letting the country down.''
Much of the country would seem to agree. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 59 percent of those surveyed said they did not believe that President Bush and Congressional leaders were making a serious effort to reduce the deficit. Only about half that number said Mr. Bush and Congress were really making a serious effort.
In follow-up interviews last week, poll respondents said they were fed up like never before. ''They're just fighting each other on the news,'' said Merry Snyder, a 57-year-old care worker for the developmentally disabled in Arlington, Washington. ''They're not putting the American people first. They're putting themselves first. They're not thinking about us at all.'' Wanda Johnston, an 84-year-old retired real estate broker in Phoenix, said that Congress and the White House don't seem ''even interested in trying'' to remedy the deficit. ''They are simply sitting there like two dogs fighting over a bone.''
That's the way it seemed last week. Mr. Bush started the latest round of recriminations as he traveled to high-roller Republican fund-raising gatherings in the Middle West warning that if automatic spending cuts take effect Monday, ''the Democratic Congress knows that it will be held accountable.''
The Democratic Congress was furious. Brandishing a milk carton on the House floor, Representative Bob Wise, a West Virginia Democrat, mocked the President for staying out of Washington at a crucial time in the talks. He said: ''There is a face that is soon going to be appearing on the grocery shelves if he does not get back to Washington pretty soon. Come home, President Bush. Call a toll-free number. We will pick you up. Get to the summit where you belong!''
It was not supposed to happen this way. To harness the massive Reagan-era deficits, Congress in 1985 passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, which called for steady reductions in red ink. Each year since then, Congress and the White House negotiated, only to wind up with a compromise that put off tough decisions for yet another year through budgetary tricks like revising the deficit reduction targets.
This year, with the economy appearing on the brink of recession, the stakes were even higher. But both sides remained adamant in their opposition over one issue in particular, Mr. Bush's proposal to lower the capital gains tax. It was an issue more of symbol than substance - many economists say it would have only a minor impact on the deficit -but it was anathema to Democrats, who note that it benefits mainly the wealthy, and unwaveringly demanded by Mr. Bush, perhaps to ease the pain of his broken pledge of no new taxes. In a compromise late Friday night, the Democrats yielded on capital gains and the White House agreed to a higher income tax for wealthy Americans.
No matter what the final package is, the deficit is not about to disappear. There are no quick fixes in the world of budget making. Senator Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican and an author of the deficit-reduction law, suggests that the American system of Government is the core problem.
''I really wonder whether we have reached a stage in our history where the three branches of Government are really working any more,'' he said. ''It's getting to be a formula for gridlock with no accountability, with the American people not knowing whether to blame the President, the Republicans, the Democrats or just everybody.''
Of course, if the backroom budget talks result in a breakthrough, it probably won't take long for the warring factions to close ranks: Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders will no doubt gather under bright television lights at the White House to congratulate each other, proclaiming that they have saved the country from what some commentators call ''Beltway Armageddon.''
For a while, at least, praise will substitute for the back-biting. But it is unlikely to be genuine. As Representative Jim Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, put it in a tongue-lashing he delivered from the House floor last week:
''I would suggest to my colleagues that many Republicans and good conservative Democrats are sick and tired of being cast and forced into the role of playing the clown. It is time that this circus closed and left town.''

HEADLINE: Where to Find Aerodynamic Inspiration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''New Plane Wing Design Greatly Cuts Drag to Save Fuel'' (Science Times, Sept. 11) reports that the performance of airplane wings has been improved by incorporating small holes to draw off air where the wings are subject to turbulence.
This surprising recipe reminds me of a story that Vladimir Engelhardt, the leading Soviet biochemist, told our biochemical delegation to the Soviet Union in 1960. Today's news reports of Soviet economic problems may give the story added interest. 
It seems that a newly designed plane lost its right wing in its first test flight. In a test of a second prototype of the same design, the left wing broke off at the same position. The manager of the factory consulted the wisest, oldest plane designer in the Soviet Union, who pondered the problem and advised drilling small holes through both wings, at 10-centimeter intervals, along the line of cleavage. The plane then flew successfully. When asked how he knew that the holes would balance the forces and strengthen rather than weaken the wings, the consultant explained that some problems are too complex to solve by direct analysis and hence must be approached by analogy. He built on the analogy that Soviet toilet paper never tears along the line of perforations.

HEADLINE: If Only the Retired Were Healthy and Wealthy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''No Special Favors on Medicare'' (editorial, Sept. 15), you show your unswerving antipathy against the middle-income retired on Social Security and Medicare. You state that if Part B Medicare premiums of the middle- and high-income retired are increased to eliminate Government costs, the saving would be ''$70 billion over five years.'' Actually, Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, finds that increases of only $40 billion over five years are all that is necessary to eliminate the Government subsidy (front page, Sept. 12). Annually, the saving would be $8 billion. 
It is time to end the manipulative practice of showing budget savings in totals for multiple years (five) while showing the taxpayer's costs of increased taxes (or premiums) in monthly amounts. What should be shown is annual budget saving versus increased annual taxes or premiums. You should not fall prey to this self-serving trick of mixing time frames.
The middle-income retired on Medicare are angry when budget negotiators seek to cut taxes on the very rich by capital gains reductions for stock market killings while hurting the middle-income elderly retired on fixed incomes. Why go after the middle-income retired while refusing to increase the taxes of the very rich?
It isn't fair to change the rules of Medicare after the retired have entered the Medicare system. It may be feasible and desirable for the middle-income retired to drop out of Part B and pay as they go much more cheaply for private coverage of physicians' bills. But the Government would have to subsidize the costs of the low-income retired by itself.
What is overlooked is that inflation, over five years, reduces the fixed incomes of the middle-income retired by 25 percent to 50 percent to low-income levels. What is also overlooked is that the middle-income retired have to pay enormous additional insurance premiums for nursing-home coverage or try to save funds for such expenses, about $40,000 a year and increasing continually. People who are employed often receive increases in salary and bonuses to cover higher taxes and inflation. The retired over 65 do not get similar increases from their savings income, but do have the sword of Damocles of infirmity, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, which may cost $40,000 a year for nursing home care. It hardly seems appropriate to repeat simplistic arguments that presuppose the middle-income and well-to-do elderly retired are and will be rolling in money and good health for the rest of their few remaining years.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
New Federal Law Encourages Fire Safety in Hotels

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
The fire safety of American hotels is taking a big step forward. This month brought the enactment of a law that will eventually require that 90 percent of civilians traveling on Federal Government business in the United States and its territories stay in hotels with sprinklers and smoke alarms if the Government is to pay the hotel bill. While the law does not mandate the installation of sprinklers, Federal employees are estimated to be worth $1.6 billion a year to the hotel industry, a big incentive.
If enough ordinary travelers learn about the law, the greater purpose of its sponsors will be realized: Americans will stop assuming that all hotels have sprinklers and begin asking travel agents, tour operators and sales people about sprinklers in hotels as well as smoke alarms in rooms. Although the law does not deal with foreign hotels, if the same questions are raised about overseas accommodations, there may be a long-term impact.
A 90-member Smithsonian tour was due at the Heliopolis Sheraton in Cairo just after 17 people died in a fire there in March, and the people who made the arrangements said that the sprinkler question had not been asked. The group was switched to the Ramses Hilton. 
Research for this column has established that operators booking large groups seldom ask the question, not because they are careless, but because they wrongly assume that hotels have sprinkler systems as a matter of course. The best estimates are that half of the 44,300 American hotels and motels have sprinkler systems, and that a third of their total of three million rooms have smoke detectors or sprinklers. Some of the remaining two-thirds will probably not be affected since lodging places of three stories or less are exempted on the premise - which some experts dispute - that in the event of fire lower floors are safer than those higher up.
The law took three years to get through Congress, but it was finally approved in both houses on a voice vote: ''How can you be against the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act?'' the Holiday Inn lobbyist asked after it was all over. It will take six years for the law to become fully implemented.
A leading sponsor of the bill, Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert of Utica, N.Y., a Republican, believes that in the interim the law will improve safety through education of travelers. Calling the bill a landmark, he said it was probably the first time that the Federal Government ''has taken direct action to protect the public at large from the danger of fire.''
Here are the provisions of the law. Within two years, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and other specified places must submit to the Government lists of their privately owned hotels and motels that meet fire safety standards, which include sprinklers and smoke detectors in guest rooms. Two months later, the Federal Government is to compile a master list for periodic revision. Subsequently, the Federal Travel Directory, which is used to make travel arrangements for Government employees, would only include those accommodations that qualify, and per-diem expense allowances would be granted only for stays at qualifying hotels.
A year and two months after the master list appears, federally financed meetings or conferences would be restricted to qualifying hotels unless the head of the agency making the arrangements granted a waiver. Announcements of meetings would have to specify that the hotel or hotels involved met the rules.
Four years from now, each Federal agency would have to insure that 65 percent of its employees' nights on the road were spent in qualifying motels. In five years, the percentage would be 75 percent and in six years, 90 percent. Older Buildings Targeted As provisions of the law are phased in, the impact will be almost entirely on older properties, because in most areas of the United States contractors are already required by law to include sprinklers when they build motels and hotels, but only Puerto Rico and five states - Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Nevada - have laws requiring all hotels to have sprinklers in guest rooms.
Choice Hotels, formerly Quality International, now bills itself as the world's largest franchise hotel company; it comprises Comfort Inns, Quality Inns, Clarion Hotels, Sleep Inns, Econo Lodges, Rodeway and Friendship Inns. Gerald Petitt, the president, testified against the sprinkler bill in the Senate but said that the law as adopted, excluding buildings of three stories or lower, was acceptable. He said that his company would soon develop a policy on what to do about older hostelries in its chains that would be affected by the law.
Holiday Inns, which also supports the law as it was revised but fought it on the basis of cost while it was pending before Congress, estimates that 200 of its 1,500 inns - franchised or owned - would have to be modified to meet the sprinkler law, at a cost of $70 million to $80 million. In its original form, the bill exempted only buildings of one and two stories, and according to the lobbyist for the chain, Michael E. Grisso, that would have meant retrofitting 560 Holiday Inns at a cost of $170 million.
There is another set of numbers, however - insurance premiums - and they may change the minds of chains or individual motels that decide that retrofitting is not worth the expense because they do not get enough Federal business. Raymond C. Ellis Jr., director of risk management and operations for the American Hotel and Motel Association, said one chain was saving $2 million a year on fire insurance by adding sprinkler systems to just two hotels, albeit big ones. Conversely, he said, insurers are already refusing to provide coverage for some hotels they consider unsafe.
''I wouldn't be surprised if by 1996, insurers will be saying, 'No sprinklers, no insurance,' '' Mr. Ellis said.
Mr. Ellis said that the industry was pleased with its progress in fire safety. There were 35 deaths in fires in United States hotels and motels in 1989, with a total of 6,500 fires reported, including small fires in wastebaskets, and the like. From 1983 to 1988, the total number of nonfirefighter deaths in United States hotels and motels was 350, including the 97 deaths in the DuPont Plaza in San Juan, P.R., in 1986. Part of the reduction in 1989 may have come from the decrease in smokers; Mr. Ellis said that 21 percent of motel fires were still linked to smoking.
For comparison, 800 people died in fires in apartments in 1989, according to Mr. Ellis, and fire killed 4,000 people in one- and two-family homes. Aiming for Total Sprinklering Sheraton Hotels, which established a program for all 450 or so Sheratons worldwide to have sprinklers in the guest rooms by last June 30, did not entirely make its deadline but is continuing on course, according to John Veelenturf, vice president, director of fire, life safety and environmental health. He said that only a small group of cleanup problems remained in the 58 corporately owned properties in the United States and that perhaps 75 of the 300 franchised domestic properties were still in the process of meeting the requirements.
Overseas, he said, the situation was the same with the corporate properties, but the franchised establishments were lagging more. The work in some of the hotels in the Middle East was stalled in some cases, Kuwait, for instance, and Eastern Europe was not so far along as Western Europe.
Mr. Veelenturf said that the corporation had not changed its goals and expected that 95 percent of its hotels in 68 countries would meet the target by the end of the year.
Asked about the Federal fire safety law, Mr. Veelenturf said that Sheraton was installing sprinklers even in properties with only three floors because he believed safety should extend to the ground, but ''that's not a position everyone agrees with.''

U.S. TouristsShun RussiaAs Crime Rises Put off by reports of street crime and ethnic violence, the number of Americans visiting the Soviet Union has plummeted this year, Soviet tourism officials and American tour operators say.
Vladimir A. Malinin, the director of Intourist, the Soviet state-run travel company, said that 40 percent of its bookings this year had been canceled. He estimated that 100,000 American tourists would visit this year, compared with the 180,000 that Intourist handled in 1989.
American companies specializing in travel to the Soviet Union cite crime and ethnic violence as reasons for their slow business. 
''There's no question that there has been an increase in crime,'' said Sydney Reiner, president of Cosmos Travel. ''But it has been exaggerated. And as far as I know, American tourists are not affected by the shortage of bread.''
Mr. Malinin, speaking at a recent news conference in New York, also said the Soviet Government had begun allowing individual republics to develop their own tourism programs.
Local authorities will have the right to regulate travel companies in their own regions, although a joint national council will oversee local regulators.
How quickly the increased competition would bring prices down was not immediately clear.
''The more decentralization that takes place, the more prices will come down,'' said Jay Schaffer of Anniversary Tours, another American tour operator.
 
Opera Gala
A gala concert celebrating the 40th anniversary of the debut of the French opera singer Regine Crespin will be held at the old Paris Opera house, the Palais Garnier, on Oct. 8. Eighteen opera stars will take part. Tickets, from $600 to $60, are available from the Association Pour le Rayonnement de l'Opera de Paris, 8 Rue Scribe, 75009 Paris; telephone 42.66.59.79. Gala tickets, at $600 and $400, are available from American Friends of the Paris Opera and Ballet, 972 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021; 212-439-1400.
 
How Travelers Rate Hotels
Satisfaction does not have to cost a fortune, at least when it comes to hotels, according to a survey published in the September issue of Consumer Reports magazine. In a poll of more than 100,000 readers, economy hotels, on average, rated a higher overall level of guest satisfaction than all of the moderately priced hotels and scored as well asmany higher-priced hotels.
The survey divided hotels into four categories based on price - economy, moderate, high priced and luxury - and rated them on everything from cleanliness and the quality of food to staff performance and bed comfort.
The highest marks were received in the luxury category, with Four Seasons achieving an overall satisfaction rating of 92 percent, followed by Embassy Suites with 85 percent and Inter-Continental with 83 percent. Other leaders were Residence Inn (86 percent, high-priced), Best Western (76 percent, moderate) and Hampton Inn (85 percent, economy). Poor food quality, defective climate control and the lack of helpfulness and efficiency of the staff headed the list of complaints. At the pricier hotels, almost 1 in 10 complained about excessive phone charges, while 20 percent reported some problem with checking out.
 
Jaws Clenched At Universal
It's safe to go back in the water again, but the closing of the Jaws ride at Universal Studios theme park in Orlando has disappointed visitors and riled park officials.
The ride, based on the movie in which a giant shark stalks unsuspecting boaters and swimmers, is expected to remain closed for redesigning until 1991. The park has filed a lawsuit against the ride's designer, but Universal Studios officials declined to discuss specifics of the case.
The problem with the fleet of 24-foot-long mechanical Great White Sharks that make up the ride is one of several to hit attractions at the $363 million high-tech amusement park since it opened June 7.
This summer difficulties with two other rides, Kongfrontation (in which a lifelike King Kong terrorizes riders on an aerial tram) and Earthquake, prompted park officials to issue a voucher to visitors that can be redeemed for a free admission once all the rides become fully operational. But with the park's 14 other major rides and shows functioning normally, and Kongfrontation and Earthquake now operating with the ''utmost of consistency,'' park officials expect to discontinue the free pass policy soon.
 
San Francisco Hotel Break
Holiday and business visitors looking for hotel bargains in San Francisco may wish to consult San Francisco Reservations, a three-year-old central hotel reservation service. Working with 90 percent of the hotels in the city, the company says it is able to pass on discounts of from 5 to 50 percent because of the volume of customers the service supplies.
Travelers can call the number for vacationers (800-677-1550) or business clients (800-333-8996) and tell the agent the location, price range and style of accommodations sought. The agent will try to provide a selection of at least three hotels that most closely meet these specifications.
Business travelers can receive preferred corporate rates that represent a savings of over 35 percent at some of the city's most elegant hotels, including the Four Seasons Clift, the Campton Palace and the Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental. Vacationers may be able to take advantage of reduced rates in the smaller ''boutique'' hotels that are springing uparound the city.
 
NEW BEATLES SHOW IN LIVERPOOL
The rise to fame of the Beatles is brought to life in a new exhibition, ''The Beatles Story,'' in Liverpool, the hometown of the four musicians and where the group first performed. The exhibition is housed at the re stored Albert Dock, already home to the Tate Gallery Liverpool, with its changing displays of modern art, and the Liverpool Maritime Museum.
The exhibit offers re-creations of the Cavern Club, in Liverpool, where the group performed 292 times; the Star Club in Hamburg; the record shop owned by the group's manager, Brian Epstein, and Abbey Road Studios in London.
Visitors can be taken back to the psychedelic era by boarding a yellow submarine with fish swimming past the portholes, before finding out about the breakup of the group and their solo careers. Visitors are invited to challenge the Beatlebrain computer, whose questions get progressively tougher. The exhibit is open daily. Admission is about $5.50 and $4 for children.
For fans still hungry for more information about Liverpool's most famous sons, there is a daily Magical History Tour from the tourist information center on Clayton Square. The two-hour tour, which costs $7.50, passes the hospital where John Lennon was born; the first place in which Ringo Starr played drums (also a hospital); the ornate Philharmonic public house, one of the Beatles haunts, and the Liverpool Institute, which Paul McCartney and George Harrison attended.
The tour also goes to one of John Lennon's favorite places, Strawberry Fields, a home for orphan children; and Penny Lane, with its bank and other places mentioned in the song of the same name. The Penny Lane Wine Bar has become a popular meeting place among local musicians, students and Beatle people.

HEADLINE: California Showdown

BYLINE: BY Robin Toner; Robin Toner is a national political correspondent for The New York Times based in Washington.

 BODY:
It is 110 degrees in Sacramento on this August afternoon, and probably hotter here on the runway of a local airport, and probably hotter still in the long-sleeved black dress that Dianne Feinstein is wearing as she paces the tarmac near her chartered plane.
The Democratic candidate for Governor of California is waiting for one last member of her entourage before her plane can take off for a fund-raising event in the hills just southwest of here. He is late. Feinstein is not a happy candidate. Her staff gives her wide berth as she stalks the tarmac, the three-inch heels of her spectator pumps crunching into the asphalt. Her husband, Richard C. Blum, tries to jolly her up. ''Cheer up,'' he says. ''I'm so hot I could die,'' she replies. She seems preoccupied, tired.
In the last three days she has denounced offshore oil drilling on the beach in Santa Barbara, questioned the Supreme Court nomination of David Souter in Los Angeles, pledged her commitment to organized labor in Ventura and asked for money almost everywhere. She needs campaign money, badly. She needs to be seen, everywhere. She needs to escalate the increasingly brutal television war against her opponent, Senator Pete Wilson. She needs to be careful not to make a mistake. 
This is her moment in history, if she can rise to it. If she wins the governorship of California this November, the 57-year-old Feinstein will, indeed, become the ''most powerful woman in politics in America,'' as one man introduced her the other day. As Mayor of San Francisco for nine years, as one of the contenders for the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1984, she is already known as one of American politics' breakthrough women.
Now, in a year when many analysts were predicting that gender politics could be more powerful than ever, when Supreme Court decisions have reopened the struggle over abortion rights and, in some ways, feminized American politics, Feinstein is riding a new wave. When she talks of legalized abortion as a fundamental civil right, the women in her audiences respond with hard, disgusted little nods. ''That's right,'' they say. ''That's right.''
When she faltered early in the race for the Democratic nomination against Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp, her support among women helped pick her up. ''It gives me a resiliency and an adrenaline and a commitment that I'm even surprised at myself for having,'' she says. Even some of the feminists who found fault with her record as Mayor of San Francisco - and there were many - have swallowed hard and climbed on board.
Feinstein's critics portray her as just another politician, an opportunist trying to catch the prevailing winds of history. ''I find any number of women, including Democratic women, who say they're insulted by an appeal that says, 'I'm a woman, you're a woman, vote for me,' '' says Pete Wilson.
Already, by summer's end, she had lost some of the glamour, some of the glory of the days last spring when she crisscrossed the state with her joyous appeal to ''make history.'' Today the polls show that the race is dead even and that Feinstein's negative ratings have jumped significantly.
There are costs to being a breakthrough woman. ''The first anything in a situation is put through a whole host of litmus tests,'' Feinstein says. ''And you have a feeling, once you get there, that your back is always against the wall and people are coming at you.'' Her smooth and confident manner slips at moments like that, as it does sometimes toward the end of news conferences, when the questioning goes on a little too long and she suddenly turns skittish, defensive.
''There's always, I feel, this testing of me, this testing, testing, testing,'' she says later.
Indeed, everyone in politics is watching this race. For the two national parties, it may mean nothing less than control of the House of Representatives through the year 2000. After the 1991 redistricting, California will have a Congressional delegation of as many as 52 - by far the largest of any state - and the party that controls the governorship will have enormous influence over the makeup of that delegation.
All that aside, California is simply the biggest game around in a non-Presidential year, with 11 percent of the nation's population and the tendency of political movements, like cultural ones, to travel West to East - from tax rebellions to Reaganism to the resurgence of environmentalism. As the 1990's begin, public-opinion polls show the electorate is stirring, anxious, discontented, and the voting here in November will give the first intimations of this inchoate mood. Will Feinstein be able to capture it, to embody the yearning for change?
Coming off their third straight Presidential defeat, Democrats around the country are longing for new stars and new messages, and they see Feinstein as a comer. They gush over her telegenic presence. After watching their party devastated in the 1988 Presidential campaign over the issue of crime, some Democrats take a dirty little pleasure in her full-throated support of the death penalty. ''Tough and caring'' is her slogan, one that confronts the doubts about both women and Democrats, the doubts that show up in survey after survey: Are they tough enough to lead?
Some analysts, including Mervin Field, a veteran California poll taker, were suggesting earlier this year that the zeitgeist of the 1990's would benefit female candidates. Voters tend to associate women with certain qualities, like honesty and compassion, and certain issues, such as education and the environment, which were high on the voters' agenda for much of this year. But, with the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the effects of rising oil prices on an already strained economy, the political landscape has changed dramatically. This bodes ill for the so-called women's advantage, Field says. Moreover, for all the national hype about Feinstein, Democrats in California worry. Pete Wilson began the general election campaign with $3.9 million in the bank; Feinstein had $645,000. Wilson is solidly based in Southern California, a rich lode of votes and money; Feinstein is of the less populous North. Wilson is on his fourth statewide campaign; this is Feinstein's first outside the nurturing hills of her native San Francisco. ''Whatever you say about Pete Wilson, he's a shrewd player at this level,'' says one Democratic consultant in California. ''Dianne, we just don't know yet.''
The woman on the tarmac in Sacramento, pacing and brooding, is at the center of all of this. She has a warm manner, a bawdy laugh and an intensely intimate gaze for a politician, but at moments like this on the campaign trail she seems aloof and alone. She says she is fatalistic about politics and about life. She shrinks from any talk of ambition. But she knows the stakes, knows the moment in time on which she stands, knows how politics can open a door and just as quickly close it.
She stepped up to the moment in late November of 1978. Her husband of 16 years, Bertram Feinstein, had died of cancer in April, and Feinstein herself, having twice run for Mayor and twice been defeated, feeling burned out and ready for a change, had decided to finish up her term on the Board of Supervisors and leave politics. On Nov. 27, 1978, she told a group of reporters of her decision in the press room of City Hall. Later that morning, Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were shot and killed. She heard the shots, raced into Milk's office just down the hall, reached for a pulse and felt only a bullet hole.
Feinstein, then president of the board, assumed the Mayor's job. The image, played over and over again in her campaign commercials this year, is almost mythic: the dark-haired woman, tall and still and strong in the center of chaos and grief, announcing the deaths, taking over, restoring order.
Can she seize the moment in 1990? She must play to the strengths that voters associate with women and ease their fears of the weaknesses. She must wage a tactically masterful campaign but try to seem more than a politician. She is riding those treacherous currents where politics and culture and what men and women think about themselves - and each other - all merge in unknowable ways.
Many Californians never expected her to get this far. She had moved quickly when Gov. George Deukmejian, the Republican incumbent, announced in January 1989 that he would not run again. But after taking an early lead in the polls over Attorney General Van de Kamp, she quickly began to fade.
By that summer, there was a buzz in political circles: Did Feinstein have the stomach for the race? Was she willing to leave the comforts of San Francisco to do the organizing and fund raising that were necessary?
Feinstein says, with a trace of bitterness, that she was ailing for much of early 1989 because of a chronic problem with fibroid tumors. She decided to have a long-delayed hysterectomy in July, which took her off the political circuit for weeks. Then, in August 1989, her campaign suffered a humiliating - some thought mortal - blow.
Clinton Reilly, her longtime consultant, quit, faxing a press release to newspapers around the state, announcing that Feinstein ''has been unwilling to commit to a schedule, an organization and a budget capable of electing her Governor.'' Feinstein says they had been quarreling for some time over the terms of Reilly's contract and over questions of control. She says she was looking for some way to end the relationship.
''Hell hath no fury like a man fired by a woman,'' Feinstein says with a small smile. Still, it was Reilly who did the firing on the front pages of newspapers around the state that August.
Reilly says he and Feinstein had a number of fundamental disagreements. ''I believed during the early stages of her campaign that she wasn't truly committed to running, but she certainly proved she was,'' Reilly said. ''The proof was in the pudding and I doff my hat to her.''
After Reilly's departure, the Feinstein campaign continued to drift. By November, she was 18 points down in the polls and widely expected to withdraw. ''We were really nowhere,'' recalls her husband, Richard Blum, a wealthy investment banker she married in 1980. ''We were not only the gang that couldn't shoot straight, we couldn't get our gun out of the holster. So I finally said, 'Do you want to run for Governor or do you want to go to Hawaii?' ''
She dug in. Equally important, she and her husband began pumping $3 million of their own money into the race. Bill Carrick, a South Carolinian seasoned by many campaigns, signed on as campaign manager, and with his partner, Hank Morris, headed to San Francisco to gather material for her first television commercial. Morris started yelling with excitement when he saw the old videotape of Feinstein taking charge after the assassinations. That footage would open the television commercial nicknamed ''the Grabber,'' the commercial that reinserted the Feinstein mystique into the consciousness of Californians, sent her soaring in the polls, and helped secure her the nomination last June.
 
Feinstein would not be the first woman to govern a state, of course; that was Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming, elected to replace her dead husband in 1924. Eight other women have served as governors, five of them elected in their own right. The governorship has been one of the most difficult offices for women to break into. Many political analysts say people can accept women in legislative positions, associated with the skills of conciliation and compromise, far easier than as chief executives.
Still, the 1990 campaign has produced a significant field of female gubernatorial candidates, a reflection of the steady, step-by-step progress made by women in politics over the last 20 years. Besides Feinstein, women hold major-party nominations in Alaska, Nebraska (where Gov. Kay Orr is seeking re-election), Oregon, Kansas, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and Texas.
They are, in a way, inventing themselves, creating a tradition - an image of the female chief executive in a political culture that is still inherently male. ''We're now on our third generation of male politicians who want to be Kennedyesque - take off your coat, sling it over your shoulder, walk on the beach,'' says Ann Lewis, a longtime Democratic strategist. ''There is no comparable identity for women. We are our own role models.''
''That's the hard part,'' Feinstein says. ''I made a real effort to meet Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Corazon Aquino - just to touch, just to sense, just to have a feeling of them.''
The Feinstein appeal is built on the premise that this candidate is different - in gender, style, philosophy. A woman urging voters to make history. A politician assailing the political establishment in Sacramento. (Even while relying on the support of Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., a formidable power broker.) A Democrat who talks with equal gusto about the need for early childhood education and the need to execute people. A forceful woman in pastel Ultrasuede in a field of middle-aged white men in dark suits.
The day after the primary, Pete Wilson, a man repeatedly described by reporters as colorless, recognized the charisma gap and announced that in the months to come he would be ''just as charismatic as hell.''
Many politicians work a room with antiseptic handshakes and guarded eyes. Feinstein strides in, nearly six feet tall in the high heels she usually wears, beaming, leaning into people and locking eyes. A young advance man at her elbow ushers up one grinning handshaker after another. The advance man also holds the purse. ''It's kind of like training to carry the suitcase for the President,'' says Jonas Hanelin, holding a delicate gray suede number.
Feinstein is expert at creating an aura of intimacy, of emotional connection; with a reporter, she gushes out the details of her personal life as if for the first time, though clearly she has gushed out these details many times before, with the same, fresh, I-shouldn't-be-telling-you-this air.
She is an almost defiantly feminine dresser - big bows, big scarves, bright colors, jewelry. ''People always have a comment to make and it used to really bother me,'' she says. ''Your skirts are too short, your skirts are too long. Do this with your hair, do that with your hair. Your lipsticks are too dark, you shouldn't wear lipstick. ''Comments you'd never make to a man about his bald spot,'' she adds. ''No one would ever go up to a man and say, 'You should have a hair transplant.' ''
Sensitive to the criticism that her primary campaign was long on style and short on substance, she often packs her basic stump speech with a checklist of positions - the need for better toxic waste disposal in California, the dropout rate for 10th graders, the intricacies of water policy. But she adds an emotional charge with the issues of abortion and crime.
Feinstein is midway through a speech to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor one night when she begins to recite the career of Robert Alton Harris, awaiting execution for the murder of two San Diego teen-agers. ''He blew their brains out,'' she says. ''And then he ate their hamburgers.'' The audience is in her thrall, awash in disgust and indignation, by the time she closes with a pledge: ''I feel it down to my boots: If I do nothing else, I'm going to make this a safe state.''
It is the kind of visceral message that Republicans perfected in the 1980's, different because it comes in a woman's voice, but not softened. It is the voice of a powerful and avenging mother, come to discipline, punish, restore order. The nickname within her campaign for two of the commercials where she speaks head-on to the camera is ''Church Lady I and II.''
She delivers this message almost everywhere she goes, recalling the days before drive-by killings and serial murders in California, asking a 1990's version of the old question posed by Ronald Reagan: ''Is there anyone here who feels safer in your home, in your workplace, cashing a check at a Versa-teller, than you did 10 years ago?'' The audience invariably murmurs ''no.''
Wilson is working the same political turf, a reflection of how close the two are on the hot-button issues. ''We are sick of excuses; we will not accept them,'' the Republican declared on Labor Day. ''We cannot have a California, in which we call ourselves a civilized state, where women fear the night.''
The crime issue is just part of the general frustration in California with highways that are too crowded, air and water too polluted, communities too developed, a dream that somehow went awry. ''People want to kill people because they don't want them out on the street again,'' says Pat Caddell, the longtime Democratic poll taker who has relocated to Los Angeles. ''It frustrates people beyond belief, this sense that we cannot be protected.''
Feinstein, who opposed the death penalty for years, says she changed her mind because she came to believe it was a deterrent. ''I believe you do everything you can in society to provide the carrot, the other options, and at the same time, there has to be the penalty,'' she says. ''If you play, you pay. And by your acts, you also can forfeit your life.''
Some of her critics describe her as ''pro-death,'' since she campaigns so hard for abortion rights and the death penalty. Some Democrats see Feinstein as the embodiment of a new centrism, a way of rebuilding their electoral coalition and driving cracks into the Republicans' ranks (although Pete Wilson is also a supporter of abortion rights and the death penalty). Her strategists see her place on the political spectrum as a sure path to votes. ''The only Democrat for Governor for the death penalty,'' proudly declared one of her ads during the primary. Feinstein's campaign manager, Bill Carrick, asserts: ''Pro-choice, pro-death penalty is where the voters are - as opposed to where the elites are.''
In some ways, Feinstein is a richer, more complicated figure than most career politicians. Her life defies the tidy biographies of those bright young men; it is an almost operatic mixture of tragedy and privilege, love and death.
Much of it seemed golden. Dianne Goldman came of age in Presidio Terrace, an affluent enclave of San Francisco, the eldest of three daughters of a respected physician. She had a doting uncle in the garment business, a man with a passion for politics who regularly took her to meetings of the city's Board of Supervisors. ''Her uncle Morrie would always talk about Dianne as mayor,'' recalls Morris Bernstein, president of San Francisco's Airports Commission and a longtime friend of the family. She was pretty and bright. Her father wanted her to be a doctor, but accepted the inevitable when she went off to Stanford, got a D in genetics and an A-plus in American political thought.
But there were darker currents. Her mother suffered from a chronic brain syndrome that was never diagnosed until the invention of the CAT scan, long after the children were grown. ''She was prone to great bouts of hostility, irrationality, that sometimes manifested themselves in really undeserved punishments for us,'' Feinstein says. The night before Feinstein was to take her S.A.T.'s, her mother kicked her out of the house; she had to sleep in the car.
Feinstein's mother was Russian Orthodox, her father Jewish, and she was raised in both traditions, going to Jewish services while attending high school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart. As a teen-ager, the only Jewish girl at her school, she briefly flirted with the idea of converting to Catholicism. ''My father said you are what you are and you can never change that,'' she says.
Not long after college, Feinstein married a young lawyer, Jack Berman, who is today a San Francisco Superior Court judge. They had a daughter, Katherine, but the marriage ended after three years, and Feinstein set about raising her child and pursuing her career in politics and government. She remarried, to a man named Bert Feinstein, 19 years her senior. She also ran for the Board of Supervisors and succeeded on her first try.
Feinstein is sitting in the Washington Square Bar & Grill, a San Francisco landmark, rattling off the story of her life with practiced ease until a reporter asks her about her second husband. ''Bert was - well - the sun, the moon and the stars,'' she says. She smiles brightly, then suddenly struggles for composure, loses the battle and wipes away tears.
''Let's stop one minute, alright?'' she says. ''Now you know why I don't like to do personal stuff.''
Feinstein has the psyche of a mayor - the obsession with detail, the proprietary attitude toward streets and vistas and public works. The city is full of stories about her hands-on approach: the way she habitually monitored the police radio and kept watch on the streets.
Appearances count. She made staff members start wearing suits and ties again after the laid-back administration of George Moscone. She still chides her husband, who has a long interest in the culture of the Himalayas, about the faded Tibetan prayer flags that hang off the patio of his office near the TransAmerica building; she worries that they look bad from the street, he says. Her husband compares her to a Tibetan goddess of mercy who has eight arms at work in the world; her critics might quarrel with the mercy part but not with the number of arms.
She led San Francisco during a time of extraordinary turmoil. The 1970's were the era of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Zebra killings, Jim Jones's People's Temple. The era exploded, in a way, with the mass suicides and killings in Jonestown, Guyana, followed nine days later by the assassinations of Moscone and Milk. Feinstein took over as Mayor of a city in shock, declaring: ''I feel a very great need to heal and bind.'' She was widely given high marks for doing it.
Feinstein was clearly haunted at first by the way she had gained a job denied her twice by the voters. She says she gained new confidence after winning her first mayoral election in 1979 and surviving a recall in 1983. She was never able to sit in the chair where Moscone had been killed, ''which, for some reason, I also couldn't take out of the office, either.''
She had her share of critics as Mayor. Many faulted her for being too pro-business, too lenient with the developers who created what has been called the ''Manhattanization'' of the city. She clashed with the city's powerful gay community, vetoing a domestic partners bills that would have extended to live-in lovers the health-insurance benefits available to the spouses of city employees. Her early drive to close the bathhouses because of the AIDS epidemic earned her considerable criticism at the time, although she now cites her administrations's approach to the disease as a model.
She also antagonized some feminists, notably by vetoing an early comparable-worth measure, which was billed as correcting pay inequities for many of the city's female and minority employees. She contends frostily that it was a flawed piece of legislation that would not have achieved its intended purpose. One sign of her less-than-perfect relations with the organized feminist community could be seen in the primary, when the California chapter of the National Organization for Women was unable to reach a consensus and make an endorsement. Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, campaigned hard for Van de Kamp as ''the best feminist in the race.''
''Her record as Mayor was mixed,'' says Linda Joplin, state coordinator for NOW, which has since endorsed Feinstein in the general election. Joplin discusses Feinstein's earlier record with considerable diplomacy. ''She has come to a better understanding of some of the issues since the time she was Mayor.''
In the current campaign, the greatest vulnerability in Feinstein's record may be her handling of the city budget. She prides herself on fiscal responsibility, saying she balanced budgets and improved services during an era of extraordinary constraints because of Proposition 13, which forced down property taxes. But when Mayor Art Agnos took over in 1988, he announced he was facing a projected $172 million deficit, and he faulted Feinstein's fiscal management for helping to create it. Feinstein said that the shortfall resulted from unexpected revenue drops and cost increases and that she would have resolved it had she been in office.
The Wilson campaign clearly sees rich opportunity in the deficit issue, a chance to portray Feinstein as just another tax-and-spend Democrat who should not be trusted at the helm of a state government already buffeted by budgetary problems. ''She not only left Art Agnos with the legacy of a $172 million deficit,'' Wilson says, ''but she did it after instituting new taxes and increasing old ones.''
This fits into a broader strategic imperative: To win, analysts in both parties say, Wilson must make Feinstein look like just another politician, and just another Democratic politician to boot.
It is mid-August, midway through a month of withering crossfire between Feinstein and Wilson. Wilson runs television commercials assailing Feinstein's promise to appoint women and members of minority groups in proportion to their share of the population - just another liberal quota, the ads say. She fires back, attacking Wilson for accepting more contributions from the savings and loan industry than any other Senator.
Wilson counters with a spot that accuses her of hypocrisy, charging that she and her husband ''own'' a savings and loan that received a healthy Federal bailout. She fumes that her husband owns less than 1 percent of the institution and that she owns none of it.
The polls show the race is neck and neck, and the negatives for both candidates are climbing. Feinstein keeps a note in her office from Ann Richards, the Democratic nominee for Governor in Texas, advising her not to watch television or read the newspapers in the heat of the campaign.
The Wilson camp is closely watching her reactions. ''You get a sense of a very defensive person who can be prone to make mistakes,'' says Don Sipple, Wilson's media consultant. ''There is this whole pattern of reacting, and from our standpoint, that ain't all bad.''
There should be no shortage of issues for debate in the Governor's race, many political observers say. California has serious budget problems, is struggling with the fallout from rapid growth and a growing strain on its environment and schools. But both candidates are trying to hug the center. The remarkably personal tone of the campaign thus far reflects the absence of great ideological differences between the two. Indeed, they often seem to be arguing over degree: Who is more supportive of abortion rights? Who is more committed to the death penalty? Who has a stronger record on the environment?
Feinstein needs to hold the traditional Democratic base, to come up with strong showings in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County. She also needs to reach out to the more conservative voters of the Central Valley, a heavily agricultural area where she could be hurt by her support for the ''Big Green'' environmental initiative, which restricts the use of pesticides. (Wilson opposes the initiative, saying its creation of an independent environment czar would undercut the power of the governor.) And she needs to hold down the expected big margins for Wilson in such Republican strongholds as Orange and San Diego Counties.
After Feinstein won by a commanding 11 points in the primary, John Van de Kamp, who had considerable support among party regulars, as well as organized labor, moved quickly to embrace her candidacy and unite the party. Her longtime friendship with the powerful Assembly Speaker, Willie Brown, who is from San Francisco, is another key alliance for her, and there is already some speculation about how much influence Brown will wield in a Feinstein administration. But Feinstein is still considered something of an outsider in state political circles. ''She's not one of my favorite people, but I have great respect for her,'' said one powerful California Democrat. Said another: ''She can be very demanding and fairly dogmatic.''
All of this has been overshadowed, however, in the fierce thrust and parry of the campaign so far, the whip-saw exchange of charge and countercharge. As the questions and controversies mount over the finances of her husband, Richard Blum, Feinstein shows the strain. She holds a news conference in Los Angeles to accept the endorsement of the California Association of Highway Patrolmen; almost all of the questions are about savings and loans and whether her husband shouldn't provide more information on his holdings, or even put them in a blind trust.
''I am very proud of my husband,'' she says, a very hard edge in her voice. She grows increasingly testy as the news conference continues. Her aides watch nervously, wincing as she once again mistakes the female reporter from The San Francisco Chronicle for the female reporter from The Los Angeles Times. Later, in the car, Feinstein seems angry and rattled. ''Technically, no woman married to an investment banker then could ever be in public life,'' she says. ''This is all his business. I have nothing to do with it. It's his - and it was before we were married. A woman marries a man as she finds him.''
The husband issue is one of the givens for female candidates in the post-Ferraro era; it gains a particular edge in the Feinstein race because she and her husband have loaned so much of their own money into her campaign. (The two of them reported income of $7.4 million last year.) ''It would be totally unimportant except for the fact that he's put $3 million into her campaign in the primary,'' says Wilson.
Sitting in his office in San Francisco's financial district one afternoon, Blum says: ''I'd love to debate Pete Wilson, I'd love to have him, one on one, going through these charges. Clearly there's a strategy here that's really basically pretty sexist. It's sort of implicit that somehow the woman can't be doing all this by herself.''
Blum, who married Feinstein when she was already Mayor, when she was widowed and he was divorced, is passionately devoted to her career. By the end of August, after considerable resistance, he would release his firm's client list, which the Wilson campaign had been demanding. The scrutiny of Blum's finances only grows through September. In 1984, when Feinstein was under consideration for the Vice Presidential slot, Blum went through an extensive review of his records with Walter Mondale's investigators, and he still bristles at the rumors that there was something in his finances that might have cost her the place on the ticket - rumors that Mondale says are totally unfounded.
On this day, Blum was trying hard to be philosphical, sitting there in his office decorated with a huge oil painting of the Tibetan Wheel of Life. But there was a distinctly non-Zen-like feeling in the room. ''I'm kind of going through the triathlon of politics,'' he said. ''No. 1, we get to see on a regular basis everything she's ever done and I've ever done distorted in the newspapers. No. 2, we get to share 17 years of our tax returns on an intimate basis with 30 million people. And three, I get to pay to watch all this happen.''
He started to laugh, ''You gotta say, why are they doing this?''
Maybe part of it is this: There is no headier moment in politics than when a candidate transcends his or her foibles, failings and ego needs and comes to stand for something larger. It happened in the summer of 1983, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson was first floating the idea of a run for the Presidency, and traveled the black churches of the Mississippi Delta preaching a politics of possibilities. It happened in the summer of 1984, when Geraldine Ferraro first took the stage of the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. And it happens, sometimes, when Dianne Feinstein connects with her audience.
There are women - like Dorene Gee, a preschool teacher in Salinas, and Bernice Boyd, a military retiree in Seaside - who look at Feinstein and see a reflection of their own struggles, their own lives. The connection brings an element of magic to Feinstein's candidacy, but also an element of risk: the possibility of disillusionment. Is she really big enough, good enough, for the moment? Is she really different?
If she wins the governorship, ''the day after the election she'll be on the front page of every newspaper and every magazine, and she is automatically considered at that point part of the Democratic ticket'' in 1992, asserted one California Democratic politician. If she loses, there would be other political options open to her; she is, after all, only 57. But whether another moment will come that could catapult her so far, so fast, is probably unlikely.
In the meantime, in the vaporous realm of public attitudes and beliefs, she is helping to invent something new: This is what a powerful woman running for Governor of the biggest state in the union looks like. This is how she talks. This is how she wants to be perceived: tough and caring. In a campaign carefully scripted by consultants, that was a phrase that was written by the candidate herself.

COMING OF AGE

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
Last year, it was the new kid on the block. This year, the International Antique Dealers Show is seen as the first indicator of the direction that the art market will take. Although only in its second year, the show has fast eclipsed all the other American antiques events with its seriousness and its outstanding quality of offerings.
Indeed, when the doors to the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 67th Street open for a round of preview parties this Friday night, some of the world's finest antiques will be on view. And some of the most expensive. For the average consumer, this is not a place to bargain-hunt; rather, it should be seen as a museum, a place to look and learn and meet some of the leading antiques experts. 
''It's a show designed for serious collectors,'' says Stephen Burton, who runs Young & Stephens, the London-based specialists in antique jewelry. ''Everything here is of the highest quality.'' Most dealers spend months scouring private collections and auction houses around the world looking for exemplary objects.
''It's crucial that we offer collectors surprises, objects that haven't been on the market for years,'' says Khalil Rizk, a co-owner of the New York-based Chinese Porcelain Company. And like at the European antiques shows, the objects are vetted for authenticity by a committee composed of curators, scholars and dealers.
The result is a collection of the top dealers' most prized possessions. Rizk, for example, will be showing a pair of Chinese export porcelain soup tureens in the form of geese. ''They would be the crowning glory of any major export porcelain collection,'' he says. ''You can't find anything better.'' Axel Vervoordt, a dealer from Antwerp, Belgium, will transform his booth into a collector's den to display an amazing mixture of objects. ''There will be all kinds of things from rare silver to unusual furniture, and even an early 16th-century statue,'' says Vervoordt.
Often these dealers spin quite elaborate tales about their objects. Vervoordt will be featuring a pair of rare porphyry vases that he says he believes were made for the Duke of Nemours and intended for the Palace of Versailles. A George IV silver gilt presentation cup and cover, made by Robert Hennell in London in 1824, will be prominently displayed by ADC Heritage, which has galleries in New York City and London. An inscription on the cover reads: ''Presented to the Highland Society of London by Colonel James Hamilton, of the Order of Liberators of Venezuela, One of the Vice Presidents of the Society, to Commemorate . . . his return to his Native Country after an absence of Seven Years . . .''. ''It's one of those extraordinary decorative objects,'' says Francis Raeymaekers, the gallery's owner. ''I would love it to end up in a museum.''
Ariane Dandois, the owner of a Parisian gallery that bears her name, is showing a German mahogany desk dated 1795. ''I bought the desk in London,'' says Dandois. ''Often I find the best pieces out of their country of origin. The owners of the grand houses, say, in England or France, which had the most beautiful furniture and objects, brought back things from all over the world. And they've been kept in the same family for hundreds of years.''
Such rarities come with staggering price tags, something that none of the dealers dispute. Many worry just how the show will fare this fall, given the softening auction prices last spring and the precarious economic climate in the country. ''There are a lot of gray clouds hanging over this show,'' says Herve Aaron, who runs the New York branch of Didier Aaron. ''But our business is peculiar. It doesn't always repond the way the rest of the economy does.'' According to Garrick Stephenson, who owns a gallery in New York: ''The massive spending spree of the 1980's is over. The attitude is very different right now - it's far more conservative. Certainly we won't see an avalanche of buying.''
Not everyone agrees. ''Collecting art is a kind of disease - once you have it, it's for life,'' says Dandois. ''My clients are highly sophisticated, and they know when a piece is too rare to pass up.'' According to Peter L. Schaffer, a co-owner of the Fifth Avenue gallery A La Vieille Russie: ''The boom is not over. Certainly there is a shakedown, which is long overdue. But people are finally realizing that buying art should not be just for investment purposes.''
Doris Leslie Blau, an antique-rug specialist, sees today's market in spiritual terms. ''We show fantasy, and fantasy sells, no matter what the world conditions,'' she says. ''It helps block out the harsh realities surrounding our lives.''

ROAD SHOW
In America, Anyone Can Become President.
It's One of the Risks We Take.
By Roger Simon.
356 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $19.95.
Most Presidential campaign books fall into one of two lines of descent: they are the offspring either of Theodore H. White's ''Making of the President 1960'' and its successors, or of Joe McGinniss's ''Selling of the President.'' White's books were serious, comprehensive, grand and elaborately respectful of both democracy and authority in America - the work of a man who cut his teeth at Time Inc. in its American Century days. Mr. McGinniss's book, in title and spirit explicitly a rebellion against the White approach, was cynical, very tightly focused on the world of political advertising and written mostly in dialogue and deadpan narration. 
Roger Simon's ''Road Show'' is much closer in spirit to Joe McGinniss than to Theodore H. White. Mr. Simon writes from the perspective of a front-line journalistic foot soldier in the long slog from the Iowa caucuses to Election Day: he is amiable but not ingenuous, he does not treat the question of which of the 1988 candidates will become President as a matter of the utmost gravity, and he concentrates on the texture of daily life in the campaign rather than pulling back to survey the national landscape.
Mr. Simon probably didn't have to agonize much over whether or not to take this approach - it is the natural outgrowth of his work as a columnist for The Baltimore Sun - but if it was a conscious decision, it was a smart one. In an age when Presidential campaigns are so intensively covered by the daily press that it may be impossible for a book writer to come up with something truly revelatory, Mr. Simon's technique is low-risk. Like a candidate who has artfully lowered expectations before a primary, he suffers no penalty for not having produced a sensational blockbuster, and he wins our admiration for whatever nuggets he manages to extract from this already much-mined story.
And there are nuggets. The one that will attract the most attention is an interview with a former mistress of Gary Hart's, in which she gives a detailed account of their affair, which took place just before Mr. Hart's involvement with Donna Rice. Since the woman is unnamed and Mr. Hart is now a private citizen, there will be much for journalistic ethicists to chew over here, but her story is irresistibly fascinating as a look at Gary Hart in action, so to speak, and at the heretofore insufficiently explored question of how these things are managed logistically in official Washington. Mr. Simon has also got meaty postgame interviews with Vice President Dan Quayle, Jesse Jackson and the Republican campaign strategists Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes, and he achieves some McGinniss-like effects by following around a television producer named Warren Steibel as he films Republican candidates' self-introductions to be broadcast before a primary debate. Another interesting detail is that after the election, President Bush took Bernard Shaw, the Cable News Network anchorman whose opening question in the fall campaign's second debate threw Michael Dukakis off, out to dinner and offered him a job (Mr. Shaw turned it down).
With every major figure he discusses - Mr. Jackson, Mr. Quayle, Mr. Bush, Mr. Dukakis, Albert Gore, Robert Dole and Alexander Haig - Mr. Simon manages to come up with some bit of material, some nuance, that provides at least a hint of what is behind the facade. Mr. Bush likes to tell dirty jokes, is driven to a state of what seems to be genuine despair by the application to him of the word ''wimp'' and can be instantly made to abandon his usual niceness by the suggestion that he is being unfairly attacked, or that he might lose some kind of competition. Mr. Dukakis is a cold fish who is so unwilling to listen to advice that his aides stopped trying to give him any. Mr. Quayle has a bedrock sense of entitlement that leads him to speak about everybody, including George Bush, in an unconsciously patronizing tone. Mr. Jackson, the candidate who spent the most time with Mr. Simon, comes across as a far more attractive figure than the press usually makes him out to be - smart, funny and possessed of a sure political vision, though also in the grip of a perpetual feeling of having been slighted.
These are only glimpses, though. For the most part, ''Road Show'' is about the increasingly bizarre campaign subculture, in which, by now, everything revolves around the conventions of television coverage, and hired image consultants, rather than the candidates themselves, are the true primary objects of the print reporters' journalistic energies. Mr. Simon himself ruefully admits at one point, ''As the candidates retreated farther and farther away from the press, the role of the handlers became more visible. The handlers were the guys who talked to the reporters. And reporters write about the people they talk to.''
Reporters who are self-possessed enough not to discuss the handlers in tones of utter breathlessness tend to strike a delicate balance in writing about them: disapproving of the state of Presidential campaigns in general but admiring of the handler's exploits in particular. This is what Mr. Simon does. Roger Ailes claims credit here for all of Mr. Bush's best bons mots and artfully distances himself from his most famous former client, Richard Nixon; even Mr. Ailes's I'm-an-obnoxious-jerk persona seems designed to attract future business from politicians who know they won't have to worry about his pulling punches or secretly favoring reporters over the people who pay his fees.
The most optimistic thought about the campaign system that comes to mind from Mr. Simon's description of it is that we might be in a temporary crisis that exists because most of the people now of Presidential-candidate age are too old to have learned their political skills in the television era. That's why they need so much handling - in the pages of ''Road Show,'' it's continually striking how bad most of them are at campaigning in the modern manner. There doesn't seem to be a chance that television will stop dominating Presidential politics; the best we can hope for is that aspiring politicians of the future will learn to master television fairly effortlessly as part of their early training, in the same way that politicians of Abraham Lincoln's generation all had to learn how to perform the unnatural act of speaking from lecterns for hours on end in stentorian tones and flowery phrases. That way voters could pick among several equally television-adept candidates who don't need constant coaching about how to interact with the camera.
If that day ever comes, it will become possible for campaign reporters to pull back a little from the daily minuet of the strategists. The dramatic events of the 1988 campaign - among them the withdrawals of Gary Hart, Joseph Biden and John Sasso, Mr. Dukakis's campaign manager - all transfixed the country as they unfolded, but they were so extensively chronicled, and so quickly forgotten, that when recounted two years after the fact they have an old and trivial feeling. Mr. Simon's achievement is akin to that of the wildcatter who drills one last producing well in a field everybody thought was dried up: it's amazing that he got a good book out of the quotidian reality of the Presidential election, but it's doubtful that there is a lot more great material for future authors.
Next time around, we might be due for a revival of the Theodore H. White tradition - a book that uses the Presidential campaign as an excuse to discuss the life of the United States in an election year, and that makes it clear which great economic interests, regions, ethnic groups, social classes and ideas were playing out their struggles through the thrust and parry of the race. The 1988 campaign, for example, plainly took place in the shadow of the Reagan era, with its economic ups and downs, its tax cuts, its aggressive conservatism and its racial tensions all strongly asserting themselves. Toward the end of ''Road Show,'' Mr. Simon writes, by way of criticizing Mr. Dukakis, ''Presidential elections aren't about competence or about ideology. They are about campaigning.'' The truth is that they're about much more.

Will Saturn Weather Geo's Storm?

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
It will be interesting to see what happens when General Motors finally gives birth to its new baby, the Saturn. Will buyers flock to ooh and ahh. To coo, perhaps to buy?
The product of the new corporation, five years or more in gestation, will make its debut Oct. 11, and those who have driven it say it has the heft and buzz of . . . well, of a Japanese car. 
That, of course, has been the point all along. Build an automobile that will push the invaders back to the sea by using their own wonderful tricks. General Motors has tried it over and over, without great success. But maybe - just maybe - the All-American product of Spring Hill, Tenn., will be a winner.
In the long meanwhile, however, G.M. has played out the same battle strategy as the rest of Detroit, putting its nameplates on small Japanese cars and selling them as its own. Decrying the aliens from one side of its mouth while touting them from the other.
There is really nothing wrong with that, because it has worked. But now there is the infant Saturn, and it is said to look like nothing so much as an Isuzu Impulse. And that is probably O.K., too. The Impulse, built by G.M.'s longtime affiliate in Fujisawa, Japan, is the latest addition to Chevrolet's Geo line, disguised by the nameplate that dubs it a Geo Storm.
Geo came into being in 1989 as Chevy's ''international vehicle line,'' and it now has more than 4,000 dealers across the country, selling four models: Tracker, Metro, Prizm and Storm, the latter replacing a car that had been called Spectrum.
For 1991, the front-wheel-drive Storm is the big news, and it comes as a hatchback coupe, a two-plus-two, and a sports model called GSi.
Base or sporty, though, the car is sleek, with aerodynamic lines, flush glass and little details such as hidden door handles that give it a wind-cheating .31 coefficient of drag. The body is very short, with almost no overhang behind the rear wheels, a design aspect that translates into further efficiency when you are looking for a place to park.
The tester was a GSi in ''flash yellow,'' a color bright enough to make the car all but throb, and the top-of-the-line coupe adds a more potent engine, power brakes, fatter tires on 15-inch wheels, a molded-in spoiler on the hatch, foglamps and other amenities.
At the stern, lights and dark glass span the little boat's transom, and the hatch button raises the glass on gas struts. One problem is the waist-high liftover, but the rudimentary rear seat does fold down, allowing added cargo space between the intrusive wheelwells.
The interior's swoop matches that of the exterior, with door panels and armrests flowing in a series of structural curves. With this car, in fact, curves are the order of the day, and the whole thing adds up to a rather pleasant space capsule.
The front buckets, upholstered in cloth, are molded and smooth, with little fussiness. The instrument panel juts out on a pod and contains full gauges, including a 9,000-r.p.m. tachometer and a 120-m.p.h. speedometer. There are the usual useful bins, a holder for toll change and a glovebox that is surprisingly large in such a compact car.
Residing in the hub of the wheel is an air bag, and that allows manual seat belts, far better than the mechanized shoulder monsters that choke you, startle your passengers, and lull you into forgetting to buckle the necessary lap belt.
While the base coupe carries a 95-horsepower 1.6-liter four with 12 valves and a single camshaft, the GSi's engine has 16 valves driven by twin cams, and it puts out 130 horses. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and an electronic four-speed automatic can be had for an extra $700 and change.
The engine, while less muscular than the turbo version that is available in the Isuzu Impulse, is certainly adequate, and the 2,371-pound GSi accelerates strongly, doing zero-to-60 in a bit more than nine seconds and cruising easily at speeds that will get the driver unwelcome notice.
There is handling to match the performance and, despite it all, the Storm manages to pull good economy out of its 12.4-gallon tank. With the smaller engine and manual transmission, mileage ranges from 30, city, to 36, highway, and the GSi's figures are 25 and 33.
As usual, the figures are lower with the automatic, but they are still quite good for a car that wraps up so much fun with a bit of utility in a package that is both small and inexpensive. The base two-plus-two has a sticker of $10,670, and the GSi starts at $12,395.
The Saturn is going to have to be a very good car indeed.

JUMP Program Aids Low-Cost Rentals By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Even during the construction boom of the mid-80's, new rental projects in the state were rare. Now two New Jersey developers and one from Manhattan are building rental housing under a state program meant to produce urban units for low-income families.
The three projects will create a total of 231 new and rehabilitated apartments in Newark, Hoboken and Carteret - 51 of them for low-income tenants.
The projects will be among the first to be realized under the state program, Jersey Urban Multifamily Production Program, known as JUMP. Since JUMP began two years ago the state has committed $18 million to nine projects totaling 623 rentals. 
Developers in the program must agree to set aside for 15 years at least 20 percent of the units for low-income families - those earning no more than 50 percent of the county median income - with a rent cap of 30 percent of income.
In Middlesex County, for example, a family of four earning no more than $24,500 would qualify for a low-income unit and pay about $600 a month.
In exchange, said William Rainwater, who supervises the program for the Division of Housing in the State Department of Community Affairs, the state provides an annual operating loan at 1 percent interest to keep the building from going into the red. The loan decreases each year, for a maximium of 15 years, until the building is self-sufficient.
Once having received a JUMP loan to get a project started, Mr. Rainwater said, developers apply for 30-year, tax-exempt mortgages from the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. In addition, by meeting JUMP's rules, developers can apply for Federal housing tax credits, which reduce the taxes a developer would pay on his profits over a 10-year period. The credits may be sold to investors.
Of the three developments under way, the largest, costing $21.75 million, is in Hoboken. There, Applied Development Associates is erecting a 12-story rental building with 150 units that is expected to be completed by December 1991. Hoboken officials view the project, Hudson Square North, as an opportunity to provide much-needed affordable housing in the mile-square city. The JUMP loan totals $3.7 million.
Joseph Barry, president of Applied Development, said the project is also benefiting from a $2 million Federal Urban Development Action grant. And the company is selling housing tax credits to Boston Financial Group, a syndicate.
The 30 one- to three-bedroom, low-income units will rent for $300 to $500 a month and, to comply with a city requirement, will remain affordable, relative to the cost of living, for 40 years. The anticipated market-rate rents will fall between $875 and $1,650.
Albert Alpert and Sons, a Manhattan development company, is taking advantage of a $1.7 million loan from the program to rehabilitate a vacant building on Elizabeth Avenue in Newark's South Ward, with completion expected next spring. Of the 49 one- to three-bedroom rental apartments to be created, 10 will be for low-income families. Market-rate rents are expected to range from $625 to $775. Joseph Alpert, the project manager, said the state funds ''limited the risks'' and made rentals economically feasible.
In Carteret, two private developers who got $900,000 from JUMP plan to remodel and put an addition on a vacant school at Pershing and Pulaski Avenues, creating 32 apartments at a cost of $2.7 million.
The project, being developed by Frank Raiae and Anthony Sirignano, also received a $950,000 grant from the Middlesex County Housing and Community Development Agency as well as a tax abatement from the borough, which effectively halves the real estate taxes on the property.
Mayor Peter Sica said that for Carteret, which has few rentals, the project ''will help keep families in the community who otherwise could not afford to stay.'' He said it also puts fallow property to use and brings in tax revenue.
Eleven of the one- and two-bedroom units will be reserved for low-income families. The rest will be $600 to $675 a month. Mr. Raia said construction is expected to begin soon and the project to be completed a year later.
The need for rental apartments has been mounting in New Jersey, and the Department of Community Affairs estimates that 70,000 affordable rental units are needed.
One reason for the shortage, many state officials say, is that over the last decade some 70,000 apartments were converted into condominiums or co-ops. Also, the scarcity and rising cost of land, changes in the Federal tax law and rent-control ordinances - in effect since 1973 - have thwarted the production of apartments.
New Jersey started a limited number of programs to spur rental housing. But those, like JUMP, that have counted on state appropriations, have been suspended as the administration of Gov. Jim Florio seeks to balance the budget.
Funds were not set aside in this year's budget for JUMP, and the long-term future of the program is uncertain.
''It's impossible to talk about affordable rentals without Federal or state subsidies,'' said Jacque Eaker, executive vice president of the New Jersey Council of the Multifamily Industry.
''The demand for such housing is great,'' he said. ''It is not the place to attempt to balance the budget.''
Charles Richman, assistant commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, said that ''the creation of affordable rentals is a state priority'' and that if the JUMP program ceases the concept of rental subsidies is not dead.
He and other state leaders are pinning their hope on a $135 million affordable- housing bond issue that New Jersey residents will vote on in November. Several components of the bond issue set aside funds for rental apartments.
There is also the state's four-year-old Balanced Housing Program, which relies on the realty transfer tax for financing and therefore was not dropped.
But the program has been affected by the soft real estate market. This year's pool of money is about $19 million, said Mr. Richman. For now, the $18 million committed to JUMP is safe.
Mr. Rainwater said he expects six other projects financed under the program to go into construction next year.

HEADLINE: New Housing Outlook For New York Is Gloomy

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Production of new housing in New York City rode a strong economy to a 14-year high last year, but the good news for a housing-starved city will probably not last long. Developers say that with inventories of market-rate housing high and buyers scarce, the city's private home-building sector will soon be as quiet as a vacant apartment.
Instead of building, the city's traditional housing developers say, they are sitting tight or looking for projects in other states until demand catches up with the supply of market-rate housing.
''For the first time since we went into business, we're looking at other parts of the country,'' said Donald Zucker, head of the Zucker Organization, which has built about 3,000 new apartments in the city in the last decade. ''I don't know anyone who is going ahead with new private construction projects in Manhattan. It's going to be a very quiet year next year from everyone's point of view.'' 
Mr. Zucker and other developers reported that the best investment today was in rental buildings, where demand has probably been increased by reluctant buyers looking for a place to live until the outlook for the sales market clears.
According to a recent report of the Department of City Planning, 14,680 new units were built last year, up from 1988's 13,222 and the highest number since 1976, when the 23,917 new housing units were completed. Last year was also the fourth in a row to show an increase in production.
Manhattan was the biggest winner, followed by Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn. The Bronx was the only borough in which new-housing production declined from the year before.
All but a handful of last year's housing completions were privately built market-rate housing, and experts say that slow housing development rates at the top of the market translate into less choice and higher prices for everyone.
Looking ahead, Yale Robbins - the real estate research, consulting and publishing concern whose reports on apartments sales prices are widely followed in the industry - reports that 2,501 privately built apartments are scheduled for completion in Manhattan this year, 2,507 next year and 604 in 1992. Manhattan was the only borough for which the company could gather figures, but as the bellwether for the city's housing market, its trend should match the rest of the city's, said Henry Robbins, the president.
The current issue of the Yale Robbins Guide to Construction Activity projected that besides the new market-rate housing production through 1992, there would be 2,674 privately financed renovated units and 5,678 subsidized new or renovated units completed in Manhattan. Most of the latter, it reported, would be under the city's ambitious 10-year plan to produce 83,000 new or renovated housing units for poor and middle-income tenants. In addition, it projected new financing or moderate rehabilitation for 140,000 additional units under the ten year plan.
An analysis by the Real Estate Board of New York of new housing permit applications seems to support the Yale Robbins figures and the city Planning Department's projections for lower housing growth in the city.
Although different from the Planning Department figures, which are based on the number of certificates of occupancy issued, the board's figures project falling completions in Manhattan over the next few years. From 5,924 units in 49 projects counted for 1989, the board projects completions of 2,879 units in 41 projects this year, 4107 units in 27 projects in 1991 and 2,104 units in 16 projects in 1992.
The Planning Department acknowledges that the city is not likely to see last year's level of housing production again soon.
''The city's economy has been depressed by cutbacks in manufacturing and financial services employment and a higher general unemployment rate,'' the department declared in its housing report. ''Realtors report that prices have fallen and that vacancies have risen in new luxury housing. New construction in 1990 is therefore unlikely to match recent levels.''
While encouraging, last year's level of construction was modest by past standards. In the 60's, spurred by government programs, the city averaged 38,000 new housing units a year; in the 70's this dropped to 16,500, a level considered all but catastrophic at the time, but good by today's standards.
By far the largest city in the country, New York now ranks 26th among cities in the number of new housing permits issued in the first six months of this year, behind such cities as Portland, Ore., Columbus, Ohio, and Baltimore, according to the Census Bureau. When ranked by housing permits per 1,000 population, the city is tied for last place with San Antonio among the 53 largest cities.
Housing experts are disheartened by the building of so few units in so large a city.
''This is one of the final nails in the coffin,'' said Peter Salins, chairman of the department of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College, ''because when you have a slowdown in production for the middle class, in the long run that means less choice and lower quality and higher prices for the poor.''
In the mid-80's, market-rate apartment construction in Manhattan was spurred by the 421a program, which granted builders 10-year tax abatements on new housing. The program expired late in 1985 in Manhattan for projects built south of 96th Street. Since then, builders have been able to get the abatements for projects below 96th Street only by investing in other developers' low-cost housing in the city and transferring the tax incentives to their market-rate projects.
But the drop in demand for market-rate housing has also dried up interest in such credit exchanges.
Several Manhattan builders have called for a renewal of the tax-abatement program for projects south of 96th Street as an antidote to the slack construction market.
Builders in New York City tend to specialize in geographic and market segments of the industry, and each has its reason for caution in today's market. But they seem to agree that prices for new housing have grown beyond the reach of too many New Yorkers.
At best, they say, several years will have to pass before the current supply of expensive and unsold apartments is absorbed, while at worst, the high housing prices will drive people away and leave the city with a smaller cohort ofstable middle class families.
''My biggest concern is that if we don't construct more housing, we are not going to have low-priced housing, by simple supply and demand,'' said Arthur Zeckendorf, a managing partner in the Zeckendorf Company, one of the city's oldest and best-known developers. ''At some point, demand is going to pick up, and then we will not be competitive with other areas.''
Without a new supply of housing to meet the demand, he said, prices will rise and the city's workforce will be forced out of the city.
''Exxon or Mobil or Penney's only pay their guys $50,000, and you cannot buy a place in a decent neighborhood with that,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said. ''So they move out, and that means less advertising, fewer newspapers, less work for developers.''
The Zeckendorfs' latest project nearing completion, the 202-unit Alexandria condominium at 72d Street and Broadway, has fared well in this market, the builder said. About 45 percent of the apartments have been sold since pre-completion sales began last spring, but at prices far beyond the average middle-manager's salary. Apartments are selling for about $430 a square foot - about $330,000 for a one-bedroom unit.
South of there, the 347-unit Three Lincoln Center development reported 80 apartments sold so far, with occupancy scheduled for November. The project, put up by the Stillman Group, is selling at about $660 a square foot, the developers said.
Some builders also reveal that they are having greater difficulties than ever before in getting construction loans, part of a credit squeeze that has put house building nationwide into six months of falling production.
''The reason you're not going to see a lot of new housing activity is that the banks have gone out of the business,'' said Dan Brodsky, a builder on Manhattan's West Side. ''You can't get a construction loan from a U.S. bank, or if you can, the terms are so onerous you can't do it. I don't think in the year 1990 all of the big banks in New York have made more than a half-dozen construction loans among them.''
Mr. Brodsky is currently building a new multi purpose commercial, institutional and rental apartment tower at 200 West 60th street. Besides the retail space on the lower floors, it will contain 132 units for St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital staff members, and, above them, 250 rental units ranging in size from studios to three bedroom apartments.
The project is being built with a construction loan that Mr. Brodsky lined up several years ago. ''I don't we could get the money today to build anything like it,'' he said.
Apartment developers guard their inventory carefully, but falling sales prices speak of plentiful demand.
''Everybody's looking for buyers,'' said Mr. Robbins, head of Yale Robbins, whose figures show what the city cocktail chatter has been reporting for months: the fewer the rooms, the greater the loss in value in today's market. Average prices per square foot for studio apartments dropped from $340 to $270 from July of last year to June of this year, he reported, while prices for one-bedroom apartments in his sample declined from from $370 to $350.
Robert Esnard, a deputy mayor in Edward I. Koch's administration and now vice president of the Zucker Organization, explained that single men and women, who might normally buy a small apartment, have either left the city or are renting, while families, especially those with children, will continue to buy because most prefer to own a home.
''The $40,000, $50,000 yuppies don't exist anymore the way they did,'' he said, ''but the family needs of middle- and upper-income people are still there.''
According to the Planning Department's housing production figures, Manhattan remained the center of new-housing construction in the city, with 5,979 units - 40 percent of the total - completed last year. Most new housing was built south of 96th Street, with a heavy concentration in Murray Hill, where Mr. Zucker has been active, the Upper East and West Sides, Chelsea and Chinatown and Little Italy.
Queens, with its appeal to small-lot builders, its relatively low density and its attraction to thrifty, hard-working immigrant families, came in second in new housing production, with 3,555 units completed last year, a 69 percent increase over the previous year.
Staten Island, the only city housing market where one-family homes still dominate the construction scene, was third in housing production, with 2,201 new units, about half of them on the island's southern end.
Brooklyn reported 2,098 new homes completed last year, a 28 percent increase over the year before. About 39 percent were in the downtown, East New York and Fort Greene areas, with the rest scattered evenly throughout the remainder of the borough.
The Bronx, the only borough to report a decline in housing production, went from 1,248 units in 1988 to 847 last year. About half were built in the West Farms and Eastchester sections.
The Real Estate Board's comparison of housing construction permits for the first halves of 1989 and 90 indicate that the building slowdown forecast for the coming years has already started. In the first half of last year, developers applied to build 7,706 units in 3,207 projects, the large number of projects reflecting the popularity of two- , three- and four-unit projects outside Manhattan.
In the absence of a strong sales market, some condominium and co-op builders have resorted to renting their space, recalling the wry adage that a long-term investment is only a short-term speculation that did not pan out.
This strategy allows builders to retain the expected increase in value of their apartments, and cash in by converting them into cooperatives or condominiumks at the right moment. The Boulevard, a new co-op at 2373 Broadway, at 87th street started accepting rentals to fill unsold apartments, and in Queens, dozens of two- , three- and four-family projects are being rented rather than sold.
For small builders, an inability to sell translates into an inability to build further.
''In terms of taking your investment and turning it back into more housing, it's hard to do if you're stuck with a rental,'' said a Manhattan architect who works mainly with a small Queens builder, and who asked that he not be identified.
''Most of these small builders do a project at a time and take the money and do another one,'' he went on. ''But if they can't sell, they have to stop producing.''
Some builders think renting is the best strategy in a soft sales market anyway.
''The rental market is strong,'' said Mr. Brodsky, the West Side builder. ''Maybe more people are renting because they're afraid to buy, so they rent and wait to see what happens to the market.''
Mr. Brodsky built the 31-story condominium at 45 West 67th Street, at the corner of Columbus, a few years ago and made a discovery about the sales.
''The sales market is very dependent on the timing of when you come out,'' he said, ''which is something that you cannot control. The rental housing market is not so specific. You have more time to make your money.'' Mr. Zucker says he is glad to be back in the rental business. ''I hate sales,'' he declared.
What about his condominium at 30 East 85th Street, on the corner of Madison - a select Manhattan address if ever there was one?
''I only do it because the market makes me do it,'' he said. ''But I'd rather own what I build.''

P. D. Q. BACH
P. D. Q. Bach, who has announced that his current concert tour will be his last, will be on stage at the Jewish Community Center in West Orange next Sunday, spoofing serious music as irreverently as ever.
The purported prodigal, and youngest, son of Johann Sebastian Bach, he is also known as Prof. Peter Schickele, a composer of more than 100 pieces of bona fide serious music who has won recognition in his own right.
The invented Bach is a hard act to follow, however. ''P.D.Q. Bach: 1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults,'' a debut album, won the Grammy in 1989 for best comedy recording of the year, and a new album is out with obviously immortal pieces like ''Oedipus Tex,'' ''Classical Rap'' and ''Birthday Ode to Big Daddy Bach.''
In addition, P. D. Q. Bach has appeared on many television shows, and Professor Schickele has written ''The Definitive Biography of P.D.Q. Bach,'' published by Random House. 
Those assisting the classical music satirist in the performance are billed as the Semi-Pro Musica Antigua, Dana Krueger, mezzanine-soprano, and Peter Lurye, pianoer. Ms. Krueger is a mezzo-soprano who performs regularly with the Opera Festival in Central City, Colo., and is on the opera faculty at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Canada. Mr. Lurye writes and produces music for television and is principal pianist for the New Jersey Symphony and the Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic.
The program will include ''The Magic Bassoon,'' with Mr. Schickele dressed as a fur-legged Pan and Ms. Krueger as a sylvan nymph. It will begin at 8 P.M. at the center, 760 Northfield Avenue. Tickets are $25, or $23 for students and the elderly, and may be ordered by calling (201) 480-4200.
Information: (201) 736-3200, extension 251.
 
WRITERS' DAY
Music, mystery and poetry - even architecture and astrophysics - will be on the program for the New Jersey Writers' Day at Bloomfield College on Saturday.
Lynn Wenzel will read selections from her new book, ''I Hear America Singing,'' and Diana Weber will sing selections that were popular from Colonial days to the 1930's. The book is a cultural history traced through sheet music.
The artist Harry Devlin will read from his recent best seller, ''Portraits of American Architecture: Monument to a Romantic Mood 1830-1900,'' which is illustrated with his renditions of outstanding American buildings and examines the economic, artistic and social factors that led to the architectural style of the period.
Eric J. Lerner, a physicist who has abandoned mainstream thinking on the origins of the universe, will read from his book, ''The Big Bang Never Happened,'' which is to be published soon.
Caroline Crane will read from her latest mystery novel, and poetry will be served up by Madeline Tiger, Penny Harter, Penelope Schott, Norma Sheard, Joan Handler and Mika Applebaum. William Higginson, a haiku expert, will also read from his works.
The event, sponsored by the New Jersey local of the National Writers Union, will be held from 1 to 5 P.M. in the faculty meeting room of the arts building. The campus is off Broad Street in Bloomfield.
Admission is $5. There will be a cocktail hour at the end of the afternoon when the audience can meet the writers.
Information: (609) 883-8878.
 
TONY BENNETT
Tony Bennett, whose voice and style have mellowed without faltering during a career of more than 40 years, will star in the Friday Evening Club's 90th gala anniversary celebration on Saturday in Denville.
The master of the romantic ballad, Mr. Bennett is also an accomplished painter whose works have been exhibited around the world. After he performs, the singer will attend the gala's supper dance at the Mountain Lakes Club, 18 Lake Drive.
The concert will be held from 8 to 10 P.M. in the auditorium of Morris Knolls High School in Denville. Tickets for only the concert are $25, $30 and $35.
Tickets including the black-tie supper dance are $150, $250 and $500. The Friday Evening Club, based in Morristown, will use the proceeds to enhance the enjoyment of its concerts by those who are hearing or sight impaired. The deadline for reservations is tomorrow.
Information: (201) 538-6413.
 
ARTISTS' HOUSE TOUR
A tour of artists' houses and studios in Englewood, Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs on Thursday will include the opportunity to meet the artists and see them at work.
Robert Glaisek, painter; Coco Schoenberg, ceramist; Joan Fine, sculptor; Ina Chappler, ceramist; Imari Nacht, graphic designer, and Peggy Silverstein, sculptor, are among the artists opening their houses and studios for the event.
The Studio of Fine and Decorative Arts, where the artists Marguerite MacFarlane, Peter Cozzolino and John Merlino have their workshop, will also be included in the tour.
Participants may visit any or all of the sites during the self-guided tour from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.
The tour is sponsored by Salute to Women in the Arts of Emerson. Tickets, which are $15. may be reserved or purchased the day of the tour at Jewel Spiegel Galleries, 30 North Dean Street, in Englewood, where refreshments will be served.
Information: (201) 568-0159 or (201) 568-1616.
 
PHOTO SLIDE TALK
''People Outside the Mainstream'' will be the subject of a slide talk by the photographer Claudio Edinger on Tuesday as his exhibition carrying the same title opens at Drew University on Route 24 in Madison.
In his talk, Mr. Edinger will concentrate on people truly living on the edge, but the show of 30 black-and- white and 10 color photographs encompasses a wide spectrum.

HEADLINE: Rutgers, Confronts A Crossroads

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
ACROSS from Old Queens here, workers are completing a $9.6 million renovation of Winants Hall, a stately 100-year-old building, in preparation for its dedication in November as a new administrative center. With the building refurbished inside and out and with the lawn freshly sodded, Winants is yet another example of Rutgers's decade-long drive to transform itself from a tired state university into a first-class institution of higher education and research.
But Winants Hall is also a symbol of frustration. Faced with a reduction of $26 million, or nearly 11 percent, in state aid this year, the university has had to take a number of economies, including postponing the use of its new administrative center until next year to save several hundred thousand dollars in operating expenses.
The budget cut, following a $7.9 million reduction in state aid last year, has been felt by students and faculty alike. Tuition has risen 10.8 percent, to $2,856, for full-time undergraduates; lightweight football and women's lacrosse have been dropped as intercollegiate sports, and the student health service is now closed between midnight and 8 A.M. There is a greater reliance on part-time instructors, and the full-time faculty members, including administrators, are carrying heavier teaching loads. 
While Rutgers officials say the quality of instruction has so far not been affected, there are concerns that the momentum toward academic excellence will be undermined if budget cutbacks continue. Like other New Jersey state colleges and departments of state government, Rutgers has been told to plan for a further 8 percent reduction in state aid next year.
''Everybody's worried, and you need to be,'' said Dr. Francis L. Lawrence, who starts work tomorrow as Rutgers's 18th president. ''I'm concerned about maintaining faculty salaries and raising tuition. It's not just our reputation, but I'm concerned for New Jersey because this is the source of future leaders for the state.''
Whether Dr. Lawrence's leadership will be substantially different from that of his predecessor, the late Edward Bloustein, remains to be seen, but he is expected to focus much of his attention on the Rutgers undergraduate.
''What I'd like Rutgers to be is a complete paradigm - research, teaching, learning and public service,'' Dr. Lawrence said. ''We're all going to have to focus more on undergraduate instruction. In a sense, it's the highest pinnacle to which we should aspire.''
Academic deans at Rutgers have been told to make classroom instruction their highest priority, an action that, while applauded by most in the university community, may take its toll on the quality of the future faculty. ''It has been quite serious,'' said Dr. Richard McCormick, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences on the university's New Brunswick campus. ''The pain has been inflicted on research and the ability to attract new people to the faculty. I've warned all the department chairs that they may begin searches for faculty, but there's no assurance that they can consummate those searches with actual appointments.''
The financial difficulties at Rutgers came at a time when the institution seemed to be making significant strides in gaining the respect it so covets. Dr. McCormick said that the departments of political science, chemistry, psychology and computer science were on the brink of achieving the national prominence already enjoyed by its departments of English, history, philosophy, physics and astronomy, and mathematics, and that many others had well-developed plans in place to make the leap.
''This is the shame of it all,'' he said. ''There are a number of departments that are in that position. They have every legitimate academic reason to make that jump in the early 90's, but the dollars aren't there.''
The budget cuts have also created a $50 million backlog of maintenance projects, as money that had been earmarked for repairs has had to be applied to the library and to preserving classes.
In the wake of the nearly completed $600 million capital construction program, the deferred maintenance strikes an odd contrast to the many modern buildings that have appeared since the construction program began in 1986. Next to the glistening new fiber optics center in New Brunswick stands an engineering complex with doors that do not shut and a ventilation system badly in need of repair. Nearby, on the top floor of the Rieman chemistry laboratory, a pan collects water from a leaky roof.
While most state universities are facing budget problems, the situation at Rutgers seems particularly acute because of its relatively recent resolve to join the top ranks of state research universities.
''There is a delicacy about our new identity,'' said Susan Cole, vice president of administration and personnel. ''People would be perhaps less concerned about it if we had been here longer. Rutgers is such a young university to begin with, and its current identity is even younger.''
Compounding the sense of uncertainty on campus is the arrival of Dr. Lawrence, formerly academic vice president and provost of Tulane University in New Orleans, who has his own vision of what a state university, and Rutgers in particular, should be. It was under Dr. Bloustein, who served as president from 1971 until his death from a heart attack last December, that Rutgers began its effort to become a premier research center. New centers in medicine, biotechnology, fiber optics and other areas of research were developed, and the university was invited in 1989 to join the Association of American Universities, a group of leading research universities in the United States and Canada.
But the heavy focus on research has led to complaints that undergraduate education and the humanities at Rutgers have been neglected. The new president sees no inherent conflict between his emphasis on teaching and learning and the university's research endeavors. He said he had been most successful as a French teacher when immersed in research and could impart some of the excitement of new insights.
To enhance learning at Rutgers, Dr. Lawrence said, he would like to see a resource center for students with peer tutoring, computer-assisted instruction and workshops on learning skills. He would also like to insure that the university's teaching assistants, who are often foreign, be fluent in English and aware of cultural differences.
For the faculty, he suggested there might be lectures on effective teaching and lunchtime seminars led by colleagues on what works and does not work in the classroom.
 
Videotaping of Instructors
He also supports the idea of videotaping instructors in class. ''That's bound to be controversial, but it's really to tell whether they speak loudly enough or look at the rostrum instead of the kids,'' he said.
In addition, Dr. Lawrence said he has been reading about New Jersey's 30 most distressed urban school districts and would seek to strengthen public service efforts, like possibly offering a contract to ninth-grade students from those districts that would guarantee admission to Rutgers and adequate financial aid if they successfully followed a prescribed curriculum Dr. Lawrence acknowledged that he was relatively unfamiliar with New Jersey and its politics of higher education and said he hoped to soon become better acquainted with Gov. Jim Florio and state legislators. The time he has spent in the state has been primarily limited to recruiting students for Tulane. ''I was a good recruiter, but I'm going to stop that now,'' he said.
One of the biggest changes Dr. Lawrence is expected to bring to the presidency is in terms of management style. Dr. Bloustein, a man of strongly held convictions, earned a reputation for occasional abrasiveness and intractability and, at times, alienated segments of the Rutgers and higher education community.
Dr. Lawrence, in contrast, is viewed as a conciliator with a soft touch who prefers to reach a consensus before making a decision. A Moliere scholar known for his wit and easy manner, he was particularly popular among students at Tulane, who once affectionately honored him as ''Hullabaloo Man of the Year.''
 
Study Committees Appointed
Concern about undergraduate education at state universities is not a new subject. Dr. Bloustein was troubled enough by charges that undergraduates were being neglected in the university's pursuit of research and graduate education that he appointed three provost committees on the New Brunswick, Camden and Newark campuses to examine the issue.
The New Brunswick report, the only one so far released, concluded that there was ''no inherent conflict'' between the two missions and recommended a number of ways to strengthen undergraduate education.
Dave Pantos, a student representative to the board of governors, said he agreed with the report's recommendations but feared that they might turn out to be ''administrative lip service.''
''Students are beginning to realize that they don't have to have 500-person classrooms with no discussion sessions, they don't have to be taught by teaching assistants or part-time lecturers, and they don't have to be working with 30-year-old microscopes,'' he said.
Mr. Pantos said Rutgers would be represented at a rally of state colleges in Trenton in November to call for greater state support for higher education.
 
Former Chancellor's View
Dr. T. Edward Hollander, former New Jersey Chancellor of Higher Education and now a professor at Rutgers-Newark's Graduate School of Management, said Rutgers would be hard pressed to continue its forward movement with a continued reduction in resources.
''One can absorb a 1 percent or 2 percent cut by simply deferring or rearranging,'' he said. ''When you reach a level of 10 percent or 11 percent, you're changing expectations about the future in a way that is demoralizing to the staff and faculty. That, I think, is what Rutgers should most fear and probably does most fear.''
Dr. Hollander, who was Chancellor during the Byrne and Kean administrations before resigning in June, said he was not certain where higher education fit in Governor Florio's priorities.
''He's not clarified his goals with respect to the higher education system,'' Dr. Hollander said. ''The budget reductions, which were especially sharp in higher education, were not encouraging.''
 
'We Were Treated Fairly'
But other Rutgers officials are more sanguine.
''We were treated fairly in the budget process last year,'' said Donald Edwards, vice president of public affairs and development. ''We took our lumps along with everyone else.''
Mr. Edwards said this was his third state budget crisis since coming to Rutgers in the 1970's.
''I guess when you've been around as long as I have, you know there are bad years and good years,'' he said. ''Nothing lasts forever, including the bad times.''

HEADLINE: RACE RELATIONS;
Hard-Headed Detente

BYLINE: By Richard M. Nixon; Richard M. Nixon, the former President, recently completed ''Leaders,'' a book of profiles and reminiscences.

 BODY:
The debate over detente has become so charged with emotion that substance gives way to semantics.
To many Americans, detente has become a dirty word, virtually synonymous with appeasement. To most Europeans, it is a good word. To them it describes a period in the early and middle 1970's when tensions between East and West were lessened and when there was more trade, more contact, some liberalization in Eastern Europe, and, above all, a reduced danger of nuclear war. 
American critics of detente, by contrast, look with horror at all the Soviet advances of the last decade. They argue, correctly, that the Soviet leaders lie, cheat, steal and are out to impose their oppressive system on the whole world, and from this they conclude that the only safe course is to restore United States nuclear superiority, cut back contacts and attempt to strangle the Soviet Union economically.
This argument misses the point of detente, it misreads history and it would deprive the West of some of our most potent weapons in the East-West struggle. First, let us be clear about what detente is and is not.
There are two concepts of detente, which I call hard-headed and soft-headed. Soft-headed detente - appeasement in disguise -invites Soviet expansionism by reducing its cost. Hard-headed detente raises the cost of adventurism and thus encourages the Russians to negotiate.
This hard-headed detente is not a love affair. It does not mean that we and the Soviet Union agree. Rather, it means that we profoundly disagree. What it provides is a means of peacefully resolving those disagreements that can be resolved and of living with those that cannot.
Whether or not we agree with Clausewitz that war is the carrying on of political relations by other means, in a nuclear age the two principal competing powers must channel their competition into other means than war. That competition will continue. It is in our interest to direct it into those arenas in which we are strongest. We no longer outgun the Russians, but we do outproduce them, and we clearly outdo them in providing what people all over the world want: freedom, abundance, the chance to live in peace and let the human spirit thrive.
The more we retreat into an angry cold war confrontation, the more we reduce the competition to those levels on which the Soviet Union is strongest. The one thing the Kremlin is good at is wielding raw power, through military might and terror tactics. Where the contest is waged on that ground, Moscow has the advantage. Where we shift it to other grounds, we have the advantage.
The Soviet Union has desperate economic problems. Looking at these, some analysts argue that if we just squeeze the Russians economically the regime will collapse and will be replaced by a less oppressive one. This misreads history, and it misreads the nature of the Soviet dictatorship. Rather than decreasing repression, it would increase it. An oppressive dictatorship is strengthened, not weakened, by external confrontation.
We can call this peaceful competition. We can call it waging a struggle by nonmilitary means. We can call it detente. Whatever we call it, it is better than the alternatives of either sterile confrontation or nuclear conflict.

Howard Beach, U.S.A.

BYLINE: By ROGER WILKINS; Roger Wilkins is a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a public-policy organization.

 BODY:
Although Mayor Koch's intentions in visiting Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic Church were laudable, the anger with which he was met by its Howard Beach parishioners was totally understandable. The people there figure they're not very different from those in any other all-white neighborhood and thus should not be singled out for deviating from the national norm.
And why shouldn't they take that position? More often than not in our history, racism has been explicitly supported by our leaders, and at other times it has been sanctioned by winks and by nods. National leadership of the kind that helped enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is rare. 
Howard Beach is a lot like Little Rock, where in 1957 Gov. Orval Faubus's resistance to school desegregation forced the Government to deploy troops just to permit a handful of black children to enter Central High School. If President Eisenhower had applauded the decision in Brown v. Board of Education instead of distancing himself from it by asserting that you cannot legislate for the hearts and minds of Americans, Mr. Faubus might not have had the nerve to mount a rear-guard fight for segregation.
Had President Reagan and his Administration not signaled in hundreds of different ways that racism was not only permissible but could be officially sanctioned - as with providing tax breaks to schools that segregate - then the white Howard Beach youngsters might not have acted as they did.
In such a context, youngsters are emboldened to chase blacks at midnight, real estate agents keep neighborhoods segregated, personnel officers find reasons not to hire or promote blacks, academics develop theories to prove that Federal programs incapacitate poor blacks, Congress retreats from the economic problems of race, and aspirants for the Presidency flee from the issue entirely.
At such a juncture in our national consciousness, why shouldn't people of Howard Beach feel aggrieved to be singled out? Some youths simply acted out the national mood and things got a little out of hand.
People's lives are horribly stunted when, by virtue of their color, they are denied adquate education, decent jobs, suitable housing and a sustaining hope. We need national and local leaders who will fight those evils daily, not posturers who don't raise their voices until somebody has been killed for being lost and lonely in the wrong neighborhood.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW;
A Blueprint For U.S. Forces

SERIES: Is the cold war over? An occasional series

BYLINE: By John Lehman; John Lehman was Secretary of the Navy from 1981 to 1987.

 BODY:
The new Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, has hardly settled in his seat and already the civilian and uniformed sachems of the military tribe are leaping about him with their hair on fire, urging immediate decisions. He should refuse - until he has made his most important choice.
That choice is this: Should we accept a military of roughly the same proportions as today's, but drastically compromised in effectiveness by cuts in operations, maintenance, training and modernization? Or, should we create a fundamentally different military establishment that has fewer but more effective active forces and greatly expanded reserves, which could be quickly mobilized? 
The second alternative won't appear in the bureaucrats' option papers, but it's the only logical choice.
Two facts argue for a new approach. First, the immediate Soviet threat is much diminished. Mikhail Gorbachev's realism, Soviet economic decline, ethnic strife and the very success of the Reagan military buildup have turned the Soviets away from an unwinnable arms race.
Is it tactical retreat or strategic change? We don't yet know. For the foreseeable future, however, the Soviets will invade neither the oil producers of the Persian Gulf nor the allies of NATO.
Whatever the reality, Wetern perception of the Soviet threat, especially in Europe, has dissipated. That leads to the second reality, which is the certainty of deep cuts below current Pentagon plans.
If the Administration chooses to continue down the road of orthodoxy - the only road the bureaucracy will present as a choice -then we will repeat the peacetime collapse of our military in the 70's, or even the 30's. In the defense industries, competition will disappear, economies of scale will be lost and unit costs will explode. Morale in the armed forces will collapse. A few big-ticket weapons will be canceled, but herds of cripples will be continued. Moreover, since land troops outnumber seamen by 4 to 1, the sea services will suffer disproportionately.
The alternative, which will horrify the 90,000 defense bureaucrats, is to shift perhaps a third of our force structure from full-time regulars to the ready reserve. This plan would cut overall defense costs by 10 to 15 percent, or $30 billion to $45 billion. The only loss of military capability would be the need for additional weeks or even months to mobilize fully for all-out war.
To fill the expanded reserves, we must pay reservists more, especially at the lower ranks. Even if we doubled current pay, the average cost of a reserve soldier would still be about one-eighth that of a regular.
Since the costs of active manpower now eat up about half of the defense budget, the cuts that are almost certainly coming could easily be absorbed without reducing our forces or falling behind in military technology - if this path is chosen.
We would not have to withdraw forces from Europe or South Korea, and the Navy could still keep its battle groups forward.
The tradition of this country is the citizen soldier and sailor, not the large, professional standing force. American privateers captured nearly 100 times more British ships in the War of Independence than did the Continental Navy, and the ratio of reservists to regulars in World War II was about 70 to 1. Let us make a virtue of budget necessity and global relaxation, and shift back toward that tradition. (March 26, 1989)

HEADLINE: COUNTERPOINT;
Ignorant Drug Policy

BYLINE: By Lester C. Thurow; Lester C. Thurow is dean of the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.

 BODY:
The United States' war on drugs has led to the attempted ouster of Panama's leader, the virtual kidnapping of a Honduran, new efforts to burn crops in Bolivia and a proposed Congressional resolution accusing Mexican officials of accepting bribes. A short time ago, similar actions were directed at Pakistan, Colombia, Peru, Turkey and Thailand.
Before we further damage our foreign relations, we should admit the failure of efforts to interdict drug supplies abroad and focus instead on reducing demand at home. 
The current approach has led us to demand actions of others that we would not for a moment tolerate if asked of us. Consider what we would do if a foreign government kidnapped one of our citizens or if its parliament passed a resolution accusing us of complicity with drug dealers.
Drug sellers face what in the jargon of the economics profession is known as an inelastic demand curve. This means that if supplies are cut back by 10 percent, prices rise by more than 10 percent, leaving the seller with higher profits than before the cutback.
If our goal is to deprive criminals of large profits from selling drugs, economic theory and history teach us that legalization is the only answer. When liquor sales were legalized after Prohibition, criminals left the bootleg liquor industry because the huge profits available while the Government was attempting to stop liquor sales vanished.
If we do not legalize products for which there is a huge demand, profits will remain enormous and suppliers will always come forward. Individual sellers can be arrested, but others will take their place.
A demand-side solution would be expensive. Jailing buyers, educating addicts and changing the conditions that lead to pathological behavior - none of these are cheap. But effective interdiction of drugs at our borders would require an army of guards. Foreign interdiction is often advocated as a cheap alternative to expensive, politically divisive policies at home, but that view is a mirage.

King's Heritage

BYLINE: By TAYLOR BRANCH; Taylor Branch wrote ''Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-63.''

 BODY:
In death, as in life, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has been plastered over thickly with labels: Christian martyr, dreamer, Communist, the black Moses, De Lawd, national hero, womanizer and saint, among others. A multiplicity of names carries great meaning. It is significant that Dr. King's formal birth name, Michael, was changed to Martin Luther in 1934, when he was 5 years old, and it is also significant that the name of his people is once more the subject of internal debate - this time whether ''black'' should give way to ''African-American'' as ''Negro'' gave way to ''black'' some 22 years ago.
Unfortunately, labeling can block rather than facilitate discovery. We label things in order to blot them out. Because race can be so unbearably sensitive, admirers as well as detractors of the civil rights cause use names for self-protection - ''racist,'' ''militant,'' ''Uncle Tom.'' There is no explanation, resolution, satisfaction or atonement - only a banishment whose very swiftness suggests a fear of candid discussion. 
Segregationists controlled most of the labeling machinery during the early years of Dr. King's brief career.
The civil rights movement took us deep into fundamental questions about democratic practice. That is why we honor Dr. King, its leader, with a national holiday, and on this fourth observance, around what would have been his 60th birthday, we ought to try to apply the depth of his democratic commitment to our own times.
We need to ask ourselves: What does it mean that many whites of good will privately feel no hope for, nor empathy with, the urban black poor, and that many black politicians themselves are baffled by the underclass? Can a nation founded on self-government conclude that the pleasures and profits of drugs are irresistible to human nature?
Can we seriously believe that we may become the world's first nation to suffer economic decline from excessive generosity to its poor? Why is it that blacks and Jews, two peoples commonly devoted to the justice of the Mosaic prophets, are seen to be at one another's throats? Why is there virtually no competition in elections for the House of Representatives? Why are these issues absent from our recent campaigns?
Dr. King's life offers instruction in the underlying principles of democracy. As a schoolboy, he survived a bout of skepticism largely by adopting theologian Reinhold Niebuhr's theories of justice. Mr. Niebuhr defined justice as society's best approximation of perfect love.
Dr. King grounded his religious faith close to the Jeffersonian intuition on the equality of human spirits. ''We will win our freedom,'' he wrote in his ''Letter From Birmingham Jail'' in 1963, ''because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.''
On a more practical plane, Dr. King and some of the early members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee engaged in a classic debate over the appropriateness of princely leadership in a democratic cause. Often Dr. King confessed himself to be too caught up in the ramifications of his position, far behind the students in willingness to advance the cause by sacrifice or innovation.
At other times it was the students who were paralyzed, whereas Dr. King faced his casualties. He went straight to the families of the four girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing in 1963 and demanded that he be allowed to preach over the caskets. ''At times life is hard,'' he said at the group funeral, ''as hard as crucible steel.''
 
While the F.B.I. and several
Southern states collected thick political files on Dr. King's 1957 visit to Highlander [Folk School, in Tennessee, where blacks and whites were committed to social advancement], they failed to preserve a word of what he said. They should have, however, for those words still ring true today.
He spoke of a skittish nation in which the best people, ''for fear of what they will be labeled,'' avoid discussion of the most vital questions. ''Channels of communication between whites and Negroes are now closed,'' said Dr. King, who was then 28. ''Certainly this is tragic. Men hate each other because they fear each other. They fear each other because they don't know each other. They don't know each other because they can't communicate with each other. They can't communicate with each other because they are separated from each other.''

Wrong on the Berlin Wall - And Most Else

BYLINE: By Eric Alterman; Eric Alterman, a senior fellow of the World Policy Institute, is writing a book about Washington pundits.

 BODY:
It has been a long and rocky road for America's foreign policy elite since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
Not since Copernicus, perhaps, have so many been so wrong so frequently with so little humility.
''He has no new ideas,'' assured Carnegie Endowment Sovietologist Dimitri Simes when Mr. Gorbachev was named General Secretary. ''In many respects, more dangerous,'' warned Zbigniew Brzezinski. It will be ''two to four years'' before he can consolidate his power, noted Henry Kissinger. While blinding us with perestroika, insisted Mr. Brzezinski, the Soviets were actually pursuing peredyshka - a breathing spell. Richard Nixon rehabilitated himself in the Establishment's eyes with the view that ''under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's foreign policy . . . has been more aggressive, not less.'' 
In Eastern Europe we were told to expect more of the same. Seweryn Bialer of Columbia University wrote in 1986 that the ''main thrust of Gorbachev's Eastern European policy is to strengthen the Soviet hold on its empire and to control the satellite parties more tightly.'' As late as February 1988, Mr. Bialer was still insisting that ''the Soviet leadership . . . has no intention of transforming the major national institutions.''
Once Mr. Gorbachev's seriousness became undeniable, this chorus of disapproval grew cacophonous. ''Gorby'' may be worthy of our sympathy, but he was likely to be overthrown by hard-liners. The Harvard Sovietologist and frequently televised expert Marshall Goldman was remarkably consistent in predicting Mr. Gorbachev's imminent demise.
As Poland sped toward democracy, the same hypercaution reared its head. In February 1989, Mr. Brzezinski said that further events in Poland could spark a Soviet military takeover in Moscow.
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger seems to prefer the ''remarkably stable and predictable'' atmosphere of the cold war to the uncertainty of a thaw. (When Mr. Gorbachev proposed visionary arms cuts at the U.N., Mr. Eagleburger complained about the timing of the speech.) The current establishment line on Mr. Gorbachev is that while he will survive Kremlin challenges, national animosities and economic inefficiencies will probably do him in. The prescription: Our sincere best wishes, but of course we must be prudent and cautious. No change in policy.
The Establishment has been singing this do-nothing tune for nearly five years now. The question Americans should ask as they watch the walls of arrogance reduced to dust in Eastern Europe: How long can we afford to keep listening?

HEADLINE: THE LITERARY EYE;
Happy Families Are Alike

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GASS; William Gass is professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis.

 BODY:
In olden days. two lovers, when they died, in honor of the love they had for one another were often buried together. Nowadays, instead, they marry. Children, cars and houses stand above them, mark their place, for there they lie, beneath six feet of mortgage and insurance, locked in an eternal institutional embrace, their shrouds the slick white silk of ''shared experience.''
R.I.P. - the Rent Is Paid. This, indeed, is often just what love seems for: it multiplies the suburbs, paves the streets; it makes scout leaders, clubby women, choirboys, caddies; it fuels, in fact, our whole society, for how is so much of its work to be accomplished except by these domesticated pairs, hauling Brand Names docilely across the shelf-lined reaches of the American Dream. 
Once we thought that sturdy independence was one admirable consequence of the ownership of land; but what, in time, has come to be hatched behind the drawn draperies of the housing tracts? An insularity and narrowness of spirit.
Birth, marriage, death, the years and years of Christmas, are almost wholly economic occasions; purchase is the family's single public purpose. We and the world both know we have a baby - look at what we've bought. Yet what we've bought buys us.
The family is the center of our lives, yet is expected to deal with - what? The husband putters, the wife gardens. Happiness is somewhere near. Work is where the money's made the family spends on family happiness. What, then, is possible? Only a rich intimacy. But how can this be achieved when the basic things (eating, sleeping, loving) are cut off so completely from the world, surrounded with insignificance, and defended with hypocritical lies which doom it to exchanges of spirit exclusively trivial?
Unless you are going to abandon the family as a center value (there is every reason for doing so, but this means opposing the whole social and economic direction of our culture), you must give the home importance by doing your real-life work there.
To freely give and freely to receive, to live an open life with at least one another is in atmosphere of acceptance and trust - secretless - imagine what that entails; what an extraordinary achievement it would be; what confidence it would require and give; what knowledge of oneself, and in general of man; and what large social lies would have to be erased from one's conscience for truth to become conscious in such precious company; what exhilaration to have one's spirit finally freed; and what a priceless gift - to hold like a wild young animal another's safety in one's hand, or to place your soul in just such jeopardy, and still to be loved.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
OIL SHOCK RAISES GLOBAL ECONOMY'S UNCERTAINTY INDEX

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
 But another worry rose with the soaring price of oil, especially in the United States: the threat of a recession that would impose new strains on financial institutions, real estate developers and corporations laboring under the unusually heavy burdens of debt contracted in the borrowing binge of the 1980's. The biggest borrower was the United States Government, and last week, with the economic scene darkening, budget negotiators from the Administration and Congress struggled to make a deal on how to cut federal deficits by $500 billion over the next few years.
 Above all else, financial markets hate uncertainty -- and the most impenetrable uncertainty troubling the markets today is how high the price of oil will go, for how long, and how much damage it will inflict on the closely interdependent national and world incomes.
 What would a serious oil price shock do? First, it would increase the costs of producing virtually everything: automobiles, steel, plastics, clothing, fertilizer -- and hence farm products -- trucking, air fares, truck fares, bus fares. Those industries that use the most energy would suffer the biggest rises in costs, and the biggest squeeze on their profits if they could not pass the rising costs along. 
 The overall inflationary pressure from the oil price increase could be counteracted by tightening monetary policy -- but that in turn would drive up interest rates, making it tougher for consumers to buy houses, cars, and any other big items they would buy on time. It would make the charges on their credit cards bigger and cause many to cut back their spending on soft goods as well.
 Or, the central bank, in an effort to ease the squeeze of rising oil prices, could make too much money available, and that would drive up interest rates anyway, because loans would be repaid with dollars that were worth less.
 Higher interest rates, higher energy costs and squeezed profits would cause many businesses to cut back on new plant and equipment, research and development, advertising -- and labor. That would increase unemployment, which would mean another twist to spending and business sales. The danger to corporate solvency would intensify, and many businesses would go bankrupt, laying off still more employees. The failing businesses and dismissed workers would then be unable to pay off their loans to the banks, which would grow insolvent and, unless bailed out, fail.
 Such is the nature of a real recession -- one that "feeds on itself," as Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, put it. Even worse, the feeding frenzy can become worldwide. As each nation gets into trouble it imports less, and the exporting nations suffer. Commonly, they try to find ways to protect their own businesses, through import quotas or higher tariffs. That messes up world trade, hurting rich countries and poor -- though the poor, living close to the edge even before the slump, have nothing to fall back on, of their own or from their governments. Anger rises, political revolts fester, and wars may follow.
 But there are less frightening possibilities for what the gulf cisis portends. In a study aimed at applying some perspective and concreteness to the speculations, economists of the World Bank have laid out four scenarios for the world economy. (See charts at right).
 The first scenario, a rapid return to normalcy, assumes that the crisis will be over by the end of this year, or soon afterward. After a spike, oil prices would drop as economic growth slowed and the flow of oil returned to normal levels. With oil already at $40, this scenario looks unrealistic. But expectations, rather than actual shortages, have set oil prices soaring. If fears of war end, expectations would turn around and drive prices back down.
 The second scenario, short-term uncertainty, sees no resolution to the Middle East crisis for another year to 18 months. World demand for oil holds constant but world supply drops by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Even with peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis, market insecurity lingers. Expectations that Saddam Hussein will not soon march out of Kuwait, that United States forces will not pull out of Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations will not cancel its embargo on Iraq make this stalemate scenario more credible, thouigh persistent anxieties make the oil price assumptions still look low. The drag on economic growth and the pressures on inflation could be even greater.
 The third scenario, prolonged uncertainty, assumes that the crisis is not resolved for several years. In real terms, oil prices would decline steadily, reflecting gradual increases in world oil supplies and a slowdown in the growth of world oil demand. Given the assumption that risks of hostilities persist, the study's statement that oil prices will "Fluctuate around $29 a barrel" sounds as euphemistic as J. P. Morgan's famous prediction that "Stocks will fluctuate." When the risks of war are high, oil prices will shoot up; when they fall, oil prices may fall (but not necessarily as much). In this climate, it seems unlikely that a steady $29 price will prevail.
 The final scenario is war. "If efforts to defuse the existing crisis fail and war breaks out in the Middle East," says the World Bank study, "Iraqi, Kuwaiti and Saudi oilfields could suffer long-lasting damage, effectively removing up to 10 million barrels a day from the world market." and causing a huge price increase. Once the war ended, prices would moderate as oil-importing countries cut consumption by conservation measures, improvements in fuel efficiency and substituion of non-oil fuels, and as exploration and development reached new heights and gulf producers reconstructed their damaged oilfields.
 But the war scenario is even more of a guessing game than the others. The World Bank's construct, which assumes a quick and decisive defeat of Iraq, focuses on the immediate impact on oil capacity but ignores the potential destruction of other physical facilities, including factories, equipment, dams, highways, airports, and most important, human lives. It leaves out the possible spreading of the war to other Middle East countries.
 Some analysts, politicians and oil ministers (notably the former OPEC leader, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani of Saudi Arabia) are writing much more disastrous war scenarios, pushing the oil price to $80, $100, or still higher, with a devastating effect on the developing countries, Eastern Eruope, indeed, the entire world economy. In that light the World Bank study is neither far-fetched nor hysterical.
 There is genuine danger of war as long as Saddam Hussein refuses to pull his forces out of Kuwait and President Bush refuses to negotiate until he does. The United States has sought to make clear that it is not bluffing when it says that Iraq would face utter destruction if it launched a war, or severe retaliation if it engaged in terrorism. American officials contend that the more seriously their threat is taken, the greater the hopes for peace.
 Nevertheless, anxieties stemming from this game of chicken are reverberating through financial markets all over the world. With investors digesting all the news they can assimilate and putting their money where their mouths are, in New York, Frankfurt and Tokyo, the financial capitals of the 'Tri-piolar" Capitalist world, the securities markets have all turned bearish.
 The Tokyo stock market has plunged the most -- with the Nikkei 225 average falling more than 40 percent. The exchange had undoubtedly been overbuilt more than the others, as money made in Japan's wildly booming real estate market poured over into the stock market. The gulf crisis and fears about the consequences of the oil shock on Japan, totally dependent on imported oil, sent the Tokyo market plummeting. Similar fears have haunted the other major markets. already preoccupied with domestic issues.
 
A Replay of '87?
 But stocks also crashed in 1987, and the real world economy was not knocked off its expanding course. Will the script be repeated this time? The "wealth effect" of the last crash, which was expected to hurt the real economy by inflicting psychological pain on consumers and businesses, causing them to tighten expenditures, did not work that way. But the oil shock hits the real economy more directly by forcing higher outlays on fuel, and less on other goods and services. If governments and central banks seek to cushion the oil shock by simply making more money available, it would not change the relative-price effect resulting from more costly oil but only cause overall prices to rise faster.
 
Deficit Budgeting
 In the United States, a resolution of that other stalemate -- between the President and the Democrats over the swelling budget deficit -- would set the stage for lower interest rates that might stave off recession without unleashing inflation. That step would improve the chances that this country can weather the oil-price storm and not sail into a financial hurricane behind it.
 But economists say any budget agreement would have to be followed with more sweeping action. A stronger energy policy aimed at conservation and production of alternative fuels, for example, would help reduce dependence on unstable Middle Eastern sources and ward off threats to the environment. Strengthening and closely monitoring the American financial structure could help prevent the kind of highly risky behavior that produced the savings and loan debacle.
 Economists also see the need to keep the world economy from splitting into hostile trade blocs and to make world markets more open to trade not only in manufactured goods but in farm products, intellectual property and services. That is among the goals of the current Uruguay Round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 With the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Untion diminished, a shift in the balance of United States military forces toward coping with the sort of threats that Iraq or other rogue states may pose might help prevent these situations.
 Collective security and world economic growth may be the best antidote against future wars, now that the axis of greatest danger has shifted from East- West to North-South.

Who Profits? Not Us

BYLINE: By Oskar Morgenstern; Oskar Morgenstern is professor of economics at New York University

 BODY:
 Since January 1961, we have lost 44,000 dead, 288,000 wounded and many missing. Yet there is no record of any Soviet or Chinese soldiers killed or wounded except perhaps in accide4nts. We have lost more than 1,390 fixed-wing airplanes and 1,800 helicopters. Form these planes, we ahve dropped more bomb tonnage than rained on Nazi Germany - yet without decisive results.
 Over the last five fiscal years, we have spent $104 billion on that war - more than 12 percent of our national income in 1968. Day after day during the last four fiscal years we have paid an average of $65 million for Vietnam, and this rate is only slowly-decreasing.
 What a drain on our resources with the complex consequences of stock market boom and bust, uncontrolled inflation with its inherent danger of hyperinflation, chronic balance3 of payment troubles, the highest interest rates in decades, high unemployment, all accompanied by profound social and racial unrest, by turmoil on the campuses, on the streets; by the alienation of large parts of youth from flag and country. And the Communist powers? Can there be a more ideal situation for them, totally devoid of risk?
 So the profit of the war has accrued over years and continues to accrue to precisely those two countries whose ideology and physical power the U.S. is trying to stem in the preposterously inefficent manner of fighting their satellites on their own terms.
 Those who in this country have been pushing the war are achieving the exact opposite of what, in good faith, they are striving for: a strong and solidly prosperous U.S., the prevailing peaceful force in this troubled world.

Affordable Starter Homes Do Well in Weak Market

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

 BODY:
 Although central Massachussetts and Plymouth, like the rest of the state and of the Northeast generally, have lost jobs and shown a rise in unemployment over the last two years, some builders have been successfully cultivating a niche they found and occupied even before the economy started sliding.
Statewide, unemployment went from 4.6 percent in 1989 to 6.7 percent this August, according to the state Department of Employment and Training.
The builders who can take advantage of the current demand despite that slippage are those who can get low-cost land and construction loans.
In Gardner, for example, in the central part of the state, land costs about $25,000 to $40,000 an acre, compared with $80,000 to $150,000 in the suburbs close to Boston, said Conrad J. Donell, president of C. D. Homes in Ayer, about 50 miles west of Boston. 
 Professor Case, who is also a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that because many banks are troubled by bad real estate loans, they are making construction loans only to builders who are well established in the area, who have built other successful developments in the last 10 years and who propose projects judged especially salable.
"Those getting the loans were a success before the boom and didn't let it get to their head by overexpanding," he said.
One development that has succeeded in the current market is Deerberry Ridge, a subdivision of 100 single-family homes that Mr. Donell's company is building in Gardner, a small, old industrial city in a generally rural area about 60 miles west of Boston.
Sales of the two- and three-bedroom homes, which range from 998 to 1,600 square feet, began late in 1988. So far, 67 have been sold, at an average price of $138,000, Mr. Donell said, adding that he expected to sell 30 to 35 more by the end of the year.
"Sales aren't really any slower than they were last year," said Mr. Donell, whose family has been building entry-level housing in the area for two generations. In 1986, Mr. Donell said, he built and sold 25 units and last year he built and sold 42.
About five miles south, in Fitchburg, a city of 40,000, Mr. Donell's brother, Robert, president of the Donell Corporation of Ayer, is building Westbrooke Commons, a $6 million project of 50 detached single-family condominiums priced from $97,000 to $125,500. Nine have been completed or are under construction, and six of those have been sold since marketing began in June. The development is on a 17-acre wooded hillside within walking distance of downtown Fitchburg.
The cedar-sided two- and three-bedroom homes, some with unfinished second floors, range from 860 to 1,344 square feet. All have full basements, two-car garages, fireplaces and patios.
Last year, Robert Donell sold out a $17 million subdivision of 102 single-family homes in Leominster, another small city, about five miles east of Fitchburg. The homes, in a development called Jamestown Commons, were priced from $119,000 to $149,000 and included fireplaces, oak kitchen cabinets, plaster walls and rear decks.
By October, Robert Donell expects to break ground on Shawsheen Commons, a $26.5 million, 220-unit project of single-family homes and two- , three- and four-family dwellings in Wilmington, 20 minutes north of Boston. The multifamily dwellings will start at $129,000 per unit, with the single-family homes priced from $159,999 to $169,000.
The Donells can get construction loans because of their companies' track records and the family's reputation as builders of quality starter homes. Even in the mid-80's residential building boom they built such homes. "Our market is first-time buyers and it is always there," Robert Donell said.
Another subdivision of starter homes has been under construction since 1987 in Plymouth, an hour south of Boston and the last town before Cape Cod. So far, 207 of the 837 single-family homes have been built and sold at $117,000 to $149,000.
The houses range from 1,400 to 1,800 square feet and some are on a pond, hence the name of the development, the Ponds of Plymouth. Kevin B. Sweeney, a partner of the developer, L & S Builders Corporation of Pepperell, said he sold 43 Ponds units in 1987 and 43 last year and expects to sell 70 this year. Between 1987 and this year, he said, prices were lowered 5 percent.
Mr. Sweeney said he was able to produce low-cost starter homes because "I bought the 1,200-acre site from six to 10 years ago for $1 million and was able to hang onto it."
"The people who are building in this market," he said, "are geared to small homes for first-time or move-down buyers and were able to get cheap land."
"Most of the country is down," said Dean Crist, a research economist for the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, "but there are places that are doing well."
A relatively small number of new homes, including single-family and multifamily units, are being built in Massachusetts compared with a few years ago. Michael DiBitetto, president of the Massachusetts Homebuilders' Association, said he expected 16,000 to 18,000 housing starts in 1990, down from the 1986 peak of about 40,000. In the eastern part of the state, which has about half the population, starts are down to under 6,000 units this year, from about 24,000 in 1987, Professor Case said.
With an unsold inventory of about 55,000 units statewide and banks reluctant to extend construction loans, "the mid-priced spec house is just a memory," said Joseph C. Polcaro, president of the Polcaro Construction Company in Sandwich, on Cape Cod. "Activity here is mostly lower-end and some upper-end custom houses."
Little in the way of multifamily housing is being produced, except for projects that were started a few years ago. Joseph E. Corcoran, general partner of Corcoran Jennison Companies of Quincy, just south of Boston, which has built approximately 8,000 condominium and rental units in the state, has not started a new multifamily project in at least two years. The company is finishing projects started before 1988.
"With the 1986 changes in the tax law that discouraged investor ownership of condominiums, there was a glut of unsold condominiums that weakened rental prices," Mr. Corcoran said. "Although the condo glut is just about absorbed, you still can't charge enough rent to cover construction and operation unless you have very low land and infrastructure costs."
Many projects now being built were started a few years ago as developments of mid-priced and more expensive homes, but were taken back by the construction lender, Mr. Corcoran said. The homes are coming on market now at up to half the original target price, he said.
Although Massachusetts is in a recession, with housing prices down an average of 15 percent, homes are selling. Professor Case estimated that about 75,000 would sell this year, down from 85,000 in 1989 and 100,500 in the peak year of 1987. In another recession year, 1982, 42,500 homes sold.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
New Season: Audacious, Varied and Vital

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
WHAT are the consequences of the austere economic outlook and the precarious state of the arts for the new season? Conservative? Perhaps compromised and curtailed theater fare? Not so. Consider the audaciousness, variety, vitality - and sheer bounty - of the theater season just begun in Connecticut's regional playhouses. A survey of the repertories of the state's professional companies affirms the freeing power of the playwright's art. If it is to reflect reality, it is also reflecting upon it, making statements of defiance and transcendence.
Instead of the sort of escapist entertainment people are said to crave during stressful times, audiences will be in for explorations of economic and ethical issues, moral dilemmas, value systems in disarray and the suppression of the individual. What ails us is being confronted, not camouflaged, and it's being done with a heady sense of cosmic consciousness.
Responsibility, identity and survival are to be examined at New Haven's Yale Repertory by international voices like Vaclav Havel (''Largo Desolato,'' which the President of Czechoslovakia wrote after he had been incarcerated as a political dissenter) and the Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol (''Underground,'' which takes place during the Nazi occupation of Lithuania). 
Artistic freedom in Czechoslovakia is also the subject of ''Wenceslas Square,'' a relatively unacknowledged work by Larry Shue, who was known for flightier things like ''The Nerd'' and ''The Foreigner.''
The ramifications of financial pressures are variously investigated in four plays at the Long Wharf Theater, in New Haven. ''The Voysey Inheritance,'' now playing, is about the ethics of investing at the turn of the century in Boston. In ''Valued Friends,'' four roommates measure their relationship against a real estate speculator's offer. And ''The Baby Dance'' is about the selling of an infant by impoverished parents to an upscale couple.
Offstage, a resourceful way of dealing with a forbidding economy can involve a collaboration between two theaters.
Hartford Stage and the Old Globe Theater, in San Diego, for example, are sharing the costs of the world premiere of the prolific A. R. Gurney's newest work, ''The Snow Ball,'' which has 15 actors and ballroom dancing yet, choreographed by Graciela Daniele. The play moves to the theater in California immediately following its Connecticut engagement.
The first play of the season at Stamford Theater Works, ''Remembrance,'' represents a similar alliance between the company and Off Broadway's Irish Arts Center. And Samm-Art Williams's ''Home'' is to be presented in January by the Stamford Center for the Arts and the Black Artists Theater Company, a new organization in Stamford.
 
'Laboratory' for New Works
Instead of a falloff in theater activity, another addition to Connecticut's professional producing organizations may be noted. Aptly called the American Premiere Theater Series and described as a laboratory for the development of new plays and musicals, the company is about to spring forth in Fairfield, with the promise of new works by playwrights like D. L. Coburn, who wrote ''The Gin Game.''
The works of playwrights heretofore pronounced as promising are also awaited: Suzan-Lori Parks's new work is ''Betting on the Dust Commander,'' an interweaving of African and American traditions of jazz and storytelling to be seen at Company One in Hartford. Similarly awaited is Howard Korder's ''Search and Destroy,'' a dark comedy about a modern American everyman scheduled for the Yale Repertory season.
Those who require the classics won't be shortchanged. Look to Chekov (''Ivanov'') and Moliere (''Scapin'') in Yale Rep's 25th-anniversary season. Look also to Ibsen (''Master Builder'') and Shakespeare (''Julius Caesar'') at Hartford Stage, and Ibsen again, as adapted by Arthur Miller (''An Enemy of the People'') at Long Wharf.
And for a touch of Broadway glitz, with a box office star or two, the perennial road companies passing through the Bushnell in Hartford, the Shubert in New Haven and the Stamford Center for the Arts include a full-blown production of ''The Fantasticks'' (starring Robert Goulet) and ''Mame'' (starring Juliet Prowse). The capstone of such traveling Broadway showmanship is likely to be ''Grand Hotel'' with Tommy Tune's Tony Award winning and inseparable direction and dances recreated.
And in a season rife with significance, don't forget that ''Grand Hotel'' is awhirl in the decadent - and ominous - splendor of pre-war Berlin, mixing portents and pertinence with instant musical theater gratification.
Following are the theatrical offerings that have been scheduled. In some cases the companies have not completed their calendars, and theatergoers should call to confirm a play's run.

HEADLINE: Voters Keep Rejecting Their Towns' Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
OXFORD'S First Selectman, Raymond L. Drapko, will be spending the next several days cutting the budget that the voters sent back to him.
Mr. Drapko said that he was disappointed that the budget had failed to pass in a referendum last week, but that he was getting used to going back to the budget-making starting line. He has done it six times now.
Part of the problem in getting a budget passed, Mr. Drapko said, is that this is the first year in which residents will be paying for bonds for a $16 million capital-improvement program. The bond payments alone would have raised taxes by almost 25 percent if other adjustments had not been made, he said. 
''It's kind of like using a new credit card,'' Mr. Drapko said. 'You go out and buy and buy and buy, and then when the first bill comes in you say, 'Oh my gosh, what have I done?' ''
 
Fears About State Aid>
In addition, Mr. Drapko said, state financing for education and other programs fell short of what was promised, and with a $1 billion state deficit predicted next year, aid could decline more. The result could be that the budget difficulties this year could turn into open revolt in 1991.
''In Oxford, the individual homeowner is going to have a hard time if the state reduces aid to towns,'' Mr. Drapko said.
An increasing number of towns in the state have rejected budget proposals in multiple referendums this year. According to a study last week by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, 72 of Connecticut's 169 towns held referendums this year, rather than passing the budgets at town meetings, a much simpler process. A budget goes to referendum either because of a petition filed with the town clerk or because the town meeting adjourns to a referendum.
Of those 72 towns, 28 had 2 referendums, 12 had 3, 6 had 4, 1 had 6, and 5 towns - Bethlehem, Bridgewater, Roxbury, Washington and Woodbury - had to go to the polls seven times to pass a budget.
The study noted that three other towns besides Oxford - Coventry, Old Saybrook and West Hartford - had not passed budgets more than two months into their fiscal years.
''It's the highest number of budget referenda that's ever taken place,'' said James J. Finley, legislative services director for the Conference of Municipalities. And, he said, the conference has no records of any town having to go through six or seven votes on a single budget.
 
'Have to Be a Magician'
Mr. Finley said the number would probably have been higher, but cities usually have no provision for a budget referendum. Still, some cities, like Hartford, faced tax protests nonetheless, he said.
''The polls are telling us people want more services and lower taxes,'' Mr. Finley said. ''You almost have to be a magician to accomplish those dual purposes.''
Mr. Finley said grand lists, tallies of all taxable property, grew an average of only 3.2 percent this year, while state aid to towns increased only 3.6 percent. The two sources account for more than 75 percent of town revenues. Inflation was running at least 5 percent, and spending increases were greater than that for towns that have been granting large teacher salary increases this year, Mr. Finley said.
As a result, more than 70 percent of Connecticut towns had to raise taxes this year, Mr. Finley said, and that led to the worst budget battles the conference has seen.
The conference is concerned that the state budget next year will be balanced by reducing aid to towns, Mr. Finley said.
''Our pitch to the legislature and gubernatorial candidates is going to be, 'Don't shift the deficit to the cities and towns,' '' he said. ''It's going to be the toughest challenge we've faced in more than a decade.''
 
Only Postponing Problems>
In Woodbury, a budget that was passed on the seventh try contained no tax increase, ''but that will not be possible next year,'' said First Selectman Katherine H. Campbell.
She said that the taxes were kept in place by reducing the number of capital projects from the year before, but that can be a problem in the long run.
''Every time you knock $50,000 off the road budget, you've only postponed your problem,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''If you put those things off too long, you face million-dollar repair projects in a few years.''
Next year, municipalities are expected to face the toughest budget preparation in a decade, and they will be doing it with a new governor and probably no idea what to expect in state aid. Gov. William A. O'Neill is not seeking re-election.
''No matter who is elected,'' Ms. Campbell said, ''there will have to be a shakedown period as they settle in, and it will come at the height of our budget-making time.''
Ms. Campbell said another problem was the increasing state requirements for in areas like special education and recycling of solid waste.
''We all agree recycling is a wonderful idea,'' she said. ''But it's going to cost us all a lot of money. And the state's telling us to do it without giving us the money to do it with.''
 
A Budget Decrease
In Oxford, Mr. Drapko said, the original budget would have increased taxes to 43.6 mills from 34.3 mills. A mill equals $1 in taxes for every $1,000 in assessed value of property.
With an eight-mill increase built into the budget for the principle and interest due on bond payments for an elementary school and sewer and water lines, Mr. Drapko said, only 1.3 mills of the increase could be attributed to new taxes. But the voters would not buy it.
The budget defeated on Tuesday called for taxes of 39.1 mills, which means that after accounting for the bond payments, the budget actually decreased. That was done by eliminating a constable position and cutting jobs and material from the public works budget.
''It would depend on having a mild winter,'' Mr. Drapko said. ''If we have a lot of snow, we've definitely got a problem.''
George C. Eggert, First Selectman in Bethlehem, where the budget took seven tries to pass because of concerns over education spending, said town government spending increased 5 percent, which he called inadequate.
''We cannot increase it enough to cover things we really should be doing,'' Mr. Eggert said. ''We have a serious problem keeping our roads up. We have a tough time finding money for fire equipment.''
But Mr. Eggert said more disturbing is taxpayer talk of withdrawing from the Region 14 school district, which includes neighboring Woodbury, because it would be more costly for Bethlehem to operate its own school system.
But Woodbury has twice the population of Bethlehem, and this year Woodbury residents turned out in sufficient numbers to pass the school budget despite a ''no'' vote in Bethlehem.
''We all have to pull together if we're going to get through this,'' Mr. Eggert said. ''It's not a them-versus-us issue. It's the whole state that has a problem.''

HEADLINE: Why Limit Indexing to Capital Gains?

BYLINE: By GEORGE NASTAS 3D; George Nastas 3d is a marketing and financial consultant.

DATELINE: HASLETT, Mich.

 BODY:
As a compromise in the tortuous budget negotiations, the Bush Administration has sensibly suggested the indexing of capital gains, so that we don't pay taxes on gains that are attributable solely to inflation. Indexing of capital gains probably will stimulate investment, at least moderately. But why stop there?
There is one major flaw with the Bush proposal, as a prominent tax expert, Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, was quick to point out. By indexing capital gains alone, the Government would create an enormous incentive to shift money from interest-yielding investments, like savings accounts and bonds, to capital assets, primarily stocks. Among other things, this shift would hurt hard-pressed banks and S.& L.'s. 
But that's not the only reason to extend indexing to other investments.
Over the years, business and government leaders and economists have chastised Americans for ''saving too little.'' They lecture that our low savings rate and the consequent lower availability (and higher cost) of investment capital puts industry at a competitive disadvantage.
What they don't talk much about are the motivation and incentives for saving, how the system seems designed to persuade Americans to consume now rather than save. This, far more than a capital gains tax, inhibits savings and investment.
When people save or invest, they are postponing consumption until sometime in the future. For this, they demand compensation - interest, dividend or capital gain. Naturally, a rational person will save more as the return increases.
What is the reward in the U.S. for postponing consumption? Consider the following example, in which a person invests $10,000 in a relatively risk-free instrument, such as a certificate of deposit or a Government bond.
If the investment earns 8.5 percent, the investor would receive $850 at year's end. If inflation is running at about 5 percent, however, the return declines by 5 percent of $10,000, or $500, during the year.
If the investor is in the 33 percent Federal tax bracket and, as in Michigan, is subject to a 4.6 percent state income tax, he or she pays 37.6 percent of the $850, or $319.60, as a tax penalty for investing. (Obviously, the loss would be higher if the state tax rate were higher or if there were additional taxes on investment income.) So, for a one-year investment of $10,000 at an 8.5 percent return, our saver receives a real, after-tax return of $30.40. ($850 minus $500 for inflation minus $319.60 for taxes.) This is hardly an incentive that is going to persuade anyone to postpone consumption.
Even if the investor was taxed only on the real gain - in other words, if the gain was indexed for inflation -he or she would pay tax on only $350 ($850 minus $500). His tax would be 37.6 percent or $131.60 of the $850. His real return would be $218.40 or 2.184 percent after tax and inflation on the $10,000. Still not much of an incentive to save or postpone consumption.
Note that, under the current system, Federal and state governments receive $319.60 from the savings effort of this investor, who gets only $30.40. There's little mystery about who gains the most from saving.
Clearly, the return to the saver is inadequate to justify savings or investing. Americans are acting rationally when they bias their spending toward current consumption, rather than saving for the future.
If America is serious about encouraging investment and savings, there must be more incentive for Americans to save. Certainly, indexing of capital gains doesn't go far enough.
Eliminating taxes on investment income (interest, dividends and capital gains) or adjusting all investment income for inflation before calculating income taxes would be a step in the right direction. More encouraging - though, admittedly, no more of a political possibility - is an investment tax credit for consumers. A credit of 10 percent of the investment amount against current personal taxes made available to all Americans, perhaps with a reasonable upper limit of $1,000 per person per year, would stimulate savings.
But we have to ask ourselves whether a country that rewards a saver with a $30.40 annual return on $10,000 is really serious about increasing saving.
