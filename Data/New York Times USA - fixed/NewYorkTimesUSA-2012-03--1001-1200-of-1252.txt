HEADLINE: The Formerly Routine Is Now the Tendentious

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Some things that Congress does are meant to be difficult: budgets, tax law changes, the health care overhaul, the undoing of the health care overhaul.
But there are a host of things that used to be almost routine that the 112th Congress has managed to make laborious and at times downright tedious -- a departure from the traditional desires of members to pass legislation during an election year and claim accomplishments to trot out back home.
Most recently, Congress has been unable to agree on a highway bill -- once a fairly simple exercise -- to replace one that expires at the end of next week. Should Congress fail to act, scores of construction projects around the country could be halted. 
This week, a bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank -- a self-financing agency that helps get American goods sold overseas -- failed despite bipartisan and business community backing. Without Congressional agreement by the end of May, the bank will lose its authorization and will hit its lending cap sooner.
That legislation was wrapped up in a series of very modest jobs-related bills that passed the House overwhelmingly and were embraced by President Obama. Yet the Senate managed to drag that legislation into a weeklong fight over amendments intended to strengthen consumer protections. Once it passed, everyone left feeling more resigned than victorious.
Lawmakers blame a polarized Congress -- reinforced by redistricting, which has pushed many members to the far edges of their respective parties for primaries -- along with a lack of trust among party leaders and desire by both sides to rob each other of victories for combining to make it so.
''Everybody is afraid to give an inch,'' said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, who is in his ninth term. ''Redistricting has added to the problem because you have people running to the right of you or if you're a Democrat someone running to the left.''
Democrats specifically cite conservatives in the House, whose desires to shrink government go beyond what Republicans have sought in the past, as the main impediments. ''It's an ideology that believes there is no role for the federal government in providing investments to make our economy strong,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.
It is a theme that Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has hit much of the year.
''As lousy the dancer as I am,'' Mr. Reid said this week, ''I would still rather do that than fight. But all I get are opportunities to fight. And I've avoided a lot of them. I'm going to continue to, as many as I can, because there are certain things we don't need to fight over. We don't need to fight over the highway bill, we don't need to fight over Ex-Im Bank, and we don't need to fight over a budget which we already have.''
Republicans counter that Senate Democrats make everything worse by trying to duck difficult votes; the chamber has not passed a budget in three years.
''I'd point to the lack of work by the Senate this whole entire year,'' said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington. Further, they say, easy things used to be easy because there was more money, and members were bought off with treats for their states.
''I think when it comes to things like the highway bill that used to be very bipartisan, you have to understand it was greased to be bipartisan with 6,371 earmarks,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said this week, when asked why things were so gummed up. ''You take the earmarks away, and guess what? All of a sudden people are beginning to look at the real policy behind it. So each one of these bills will rise or fall on their own merits.''
The transit bill has been a particularly gruesome collision. The House transportation committee passed its own version earlier this year, an ambitious five-year plan that would have ended the allotment that public transit usually receives from the highway trust fund and paid for some of the program with new money from drilling, a plan that alienated many Republicans.
Mr. Boehner then more or less committed to passing the Senate's two-year version of the bill, which was far more modest in scope, before going on a week recess this month. When the House came back this week, that bill was suddenly no good, with Republicans citing a lack of mechanisms in the bill to pay for it.
House Republicans now want a short-term extension and Democrats are balking. Without some form of extension, the federal government will stop collecting the gas tax and the Highway Trust Fund will eventually run out of money, meaning highway projects would eventually be stopped.
The Ex-Im Bank extension is another migraine. It was last authorized in 2006, by voice vote in the House and unanimous consent in the Senate. But some conservatives now oppose the extension -- although it is supported by the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups -- preferring to dismantle the agency.
Even a widely popular bill that passed the Senate this week to prohibit insider trading by members of Congress, which Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, called ''the most significant ethics legislation to pass Congress in years,'' hit snags over amendments. Also true, with the collections of jobs bills this week. ''This place has been increasingly ideologically rigid,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''It makes it impossible for it to function.''

HEADLINE: President of Dartmouth Chosen for World Bank

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House on Friday named Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College and a global health expert, as its nominee to lead the World Bank.
That makes Dr. Kim the front-runner to take the helm of the multinational development institution on June 30, when its current president, Robert B. Zoellick, will step down at the end of his five-year term. Tradition has held that Washington selects the head of the World Bank and Europe the leader of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, since they were founded during World War II.
Dr. Kim's name was not among those widely bandied about since Mr. Zoellick announced his plans to move on last month. Highly respected among aid experts, Dr. Kim is an anthropologist and a physician who co-founded Partners in Health, a nonprofit that provides health care for the poor, and a former director of the department of H.I.V./AIDS at the World Health Organization. 
''The leader of the World Bank should have a deep understanding of both the role that development plays in the world and the importance of creating conditions where assistance is no longer needed,'' President Obama said Friday. ''It's time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.''
In a statement, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary and an alumnus of Dartmouth, praised Dr. Kim: ''Development is his lifetime commitment, and it is his passion. And in a world with so much potential to improve living standards, we have a unique opportunity to harness that passion and experience at the helm of the World Bank.''
Dr. Kim, who was awarded a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship in 2003, was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1959 and moved with his family to the United States when he was 5. He graduated from Brown University in 1982, earned an M.D. from Harvard University in 1991 and received a Ph.D. in anthropology there in 1993.
He was the first Asian-American to head an Ivy League institution when he took the Dartmouth post in 2009.
While working with Partners in Health in Lima, Peru, in the mid-1990s, Dr. Kim helped to develop a treatment program for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the first large-scale treatment of that disease in a poor country. Treatment programs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are now in place in more than 40 nations, according to Dr. Kim's biography on Dartmouth's Web site. He also spearheaded the successful effort to reduce the price of the drugs used to treat this form of tuberculosis.
''Jim is all about delivery and about delivering on promises often made but too seldom kept,'' said Paul Farmer, a co-founder of Partners in Health, in an e-mailed statement. ''I can think of no one more able to help families, communities and entire nations break out of poverty.''
During his short tenure at Dartmouth, Dr. Kim won a reputation as a level-headed technocrat who frequently encouraged students to think globally.
''Most every college president has to get up and say it's important to go off and change the world,'' said Jonathan S. Skinner, an economist at Dartmouth. ''But there aren't many college presidents who've gone out and have changed the world.''
Dr. Kim's ascension to the head of the World Bank is not a sure thing. But the United States supported the candidacy of Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister, to head the International Monetary Fund last year, presumably assuring that Europe would support Dr. Kim's nomination.
In recent years, major emerging economies have criticized the decades-old gentlemen's agreement giving the United States control of the World Bank's presidency. The Group of 20 countries has called for a fairer, more transparent selection process for the top posts at the World Bank and the I.M.F., and the World Bank itself has reaffirmed its commitment to an open and merit-based process.
''We are trying to ensure that we start having a process whereby we can choose the most qualified person, regardless of nationality,'' said Amar Bhattacharya, the director of the Group of 24, an umbrella group of developing countries. ''The struggle is about the credibility of the process as much as it is about who wins.''
Dr. Kim, as an American, will not escape some of that criticism. But his background working in poorer countries may partly insulate him, and Mr. Obama was reportedly drawn to him in part because of his work fighting tuberculosis and AIDS.
In addition, powerful emerging market countries, like Brazil and China, failed to rally around a single, viable candidate since the announcement of Mr. Zoellick's departure.
Dr. Kim is not the only candidate for the World Bank job. On Friday, Angola, South Africa and Nigeria put forward Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister and former World Bank official.
Jose Antonio Ocampo, the former finance minister of Colombia and a United Nations official, is rumored to be another candidate.
Jeffrey D. Sachs, the development economist and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, had put himself forward for the position and won the support of some developing countries, including Kenya, although the United States was not supporting his candidacy. On Friday, Mr. Sachs withdrew his candidacy and endorsed Dr. Kim.
''Dr. Jim Kim is a superb nominee for the World Bank presidency,'' Mr. Sachs said in an e-mailed statement. ''I congratulate the administration for nominating a world-class development leader for this position.''
The World Bank will stop accepting nominations at 6 p.m. Eastern time Friday. If there are more than three candidates, the board will name a shortlist soon thereafter. The bank has said it intends to select its new president in the time for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings in April.
The bank provided $57.4 billion in support to low-income and middle-income countries last year. Under Mr. Zoellick's leadership, the bank raised an additional $90 billion for its fund for the world's poorest. It also opened up huge troves of data to the public to aid research on development and poverty.

HEADLINE: Macroeconomic Policy Wagers

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: There's more than one kind of risk. 

 BODY:
One of key arguments made by the proponents of fiscal austerity, even in a deeply depressed economy, has involved a sort of macroeconomic version of Pascal's wager. Yes, the more open-minded admit, borrowing costs are very low in the US and the UK. Yes, the arithmetic suggests that cutting spending now will do very little to improve the long-run fiscal prospect. But you never know - maybe the last trillion dollars of spending will be what causes a sudden loss of market confidence, turning you into Greeeeeeece. (Cue scary noises).
Leave on one side the enormous difference between countries that do and don't have their own currencies (and debt in their own currencies). Let me instead point out that there are other risks in the world.
Specifically, if allowing an economy to remain persistently depressed reduces long-run growth prospects -- and there's pretty good evidence to that effect -- then austerity in a depressed economy has enormous costs, and may even lead to a vicious circle of shrinking potential leading to even more austerity and so on. Indeed, maybe that's happening to the Cameron government right now.
So will the austerians admit that they might be making a terrible mistake, that far from safeguarding the future they may be destroying it?

HEADLINE: Lessons From The Great Canadian Slump

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Northern lessons on unemployment and inflation. 

 BODY:
So, is there still a lot of slack in U.S. labor markets? On the face of it, that seems an absurd question to ask, given the persistence of very high unemployment and an employment-population ratio far below pre-crisis levels. Yet it is being asked, partly because we don't see strong evidence of falling inflation.
But how good a criterion is that? Sharply inflation would be one thing -- but we don't see that either. And there's actually pretty good evidence that inflation tends to stall out at low but positive levels in the face of prolonged slumps.
Let me add something more to the mix: the case of Canada in the early 1990s, the subject of a classic analysis at the time by Pierre Fortin.
For idiosyncratic reasons, Canada imposed tight monetary and fiscal policy, leading to a very severe slump in employment:
As you can see, however, employment eventually recovered. And if you look at real GDP, this looks very much like a temporary (if prolonged) cyclical downturn. In the figure below I use trend growth from 1973 to 1990 as a baseline -- starting in 73 because everyone experienced a productivity slowdown starting then. And what it suggests is that by 2000 Canada was more or less back on the previous trend:
So did Canada experience continuing disinflation, heading toward deflation, as the slump persisted? Actually, no. Inflation fluctuated, even though the economy was nowhere near capacity until the late 1990s:
And wages never fell, indeed continued to rise, a phenomenon Fortin attributed to downward nominal stickiness plus dispersion:
I'd argue that Canada in the 1990s is a good model for America now: a severely depressed economy, suffering very much from lack of aggregate demand, in which the effects of downward nominal rigidity can all too easily be misinterpreted as signs that there isn't actually a lot of slack.
And the way to test this is to expand demand and see what happens; yes, there are some risks if I'm wrong (which I'm not!), but compare those with the risks of letting the economy stay depressed for no good reason.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Trayvon

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama weighed in Friday on the shooting of Trayvon Martin, and conservative women flock to Rick Santorum. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
President Obama weighed in Friday on the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot by a neighborhood watchman in Florida. Expressing his sympathy to the boy's parents, Mr. Obama did not mention race but said, "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon," Jackie Calmes and Helene Cooper report.

        
Although it's increasingly apparent that Rick Santorum is unlikely to become the Republican nominee, he has enjoyed enthusiastic support from many conservative women, who connect with his commitment to family values, Susan Saulny reports.

        
The movement to legalize same-sex marriage is gaining support beyond the typical Democratic and Hollywood donors, drawing contributions and momentum from Republicans, hedge fund managers and - perhaps most strikingly - straight people, Adam Nagourney and Brooks Barnes report.

        
One of the major issues in the Supreme Court fight over Mr. Obama's health care reform law is whether the government can make states expand Medicaid to cover millions of low-income people, a point states say is unconstitutional because their Medicaid financing is tied to their cooperation, Robert Pear reports.

        
In an unexpected move, the White House announced Friday that Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College and an expert on global health, is its nominee to lead the World Bank, Annie Lowrey reports.
Weekly Address:

        
After traveling around the country to promote his "all-of-the-above" energy approach this week, Mr. Obama described weaknesses in the nation's transportation and communications infrastructure in his weekly address, saying the United States can't attract innovative energy producers without some basic improvements. And Congress, he said, is "once again" standing in the way by not expediting a transportation funding bill. "The Senate did their part," he said. "Now it's up to the House to follow suit; to put aside partisan posturing, end the gridlock, and do what's right for the American people."
Washington Happenings:

        
Mr. Obama travels to Seoul, South Korea, this weekend, where he will meet with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and then President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea.

        
Tea Party activists gather in Washington on Saturday for the "Road to Repeal" rally, protesting Mr. Obama's health care law before the Supreme Court hears arguments on its constitutionality next week. Herman Cain and Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's attorney general who has challenged the law, are among those slated to speak.

        
On Sunday, the day before arguments on the health care law begin, religious organizations will spread thousands of flowers around the Supreme Court to represent the number of abortions performed every day.

HEADLINE: Santorum Unveils 'Obamaville' Video, Scary Music Included

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: The video reflects Rick Santorum's penchant for language and imagery brimming with disdain if not hostility toward the Obama presidency. 

 BODY:
In a new video from Rick Santorum, it is hardly morning in America. It is more like apocalypse in America.
From the opening sequence of a large raven to subsequent images of boarded-up buildings, a 1950s-style fallout shelter and alternating views of President Obama with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, this is one bleak future.
The video is meant to show the consequences of re-electing Mr. Obama. It never switches to a happier alternate universe in which Mr. Santorum is in command, nor does he break in at the end, as required in television ads, to say he approves this message.
But it reflects the message the candidate delivers on the campaign trail -- that the country is going to hell in a handbasket if President Obama remains in office.
It also reflects Mr. Santorum's penchant for language and imagery that have stood out in a presidential campaign brimming with disdain if not hostility toward the Obama presidency. Mr. Santorum has called Mr. Obama the "appeaser-in-chief" for what he contends is the president's weakness in not stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
John Brabender, the Santorum strategist who made the video, said it was a trailer for an eight-part series that will start in two weeks. Each of those videos will show how various Obama policies, such as those regarding health care and energy, have affected everyday life.
"It's just a little teaser to get people to start watching our episodes and do it in a way that piques their interest," Mr. Brabender said. "It's all about driving traffic to the Web site."
The trailer is set in a desolate town called "Obamaville." Here, gas prices soar so high that people seem to want to kill themselves (a man puts a gas nozzle to his head). The flame of a candle symbolizing religious freedom is blown out. A girl sits glumly on a bench in extreme poverty.
"Every day, the residents of this town must come to grips with the harsh reality that a rogue nation, a sworn American enemy, has become a nuclear threat," intones a narrator as the viewer is plunged into a cold war fallout shelter with old television sets and an air raid siren.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's image appears, quickly interspersed with one of Mr. Obama. Mr. Brabender said the coupling was meant to suggest the constant conflict that will ensue if Iran develops nuclear weapons.
The gloom-and-doom warning is similar to one Mr. Santorum issued toward the end of his unsuccessful 2006 reelection campaign for the Senate in Pennsylvania. With the polls showing him losing badly, he focused intently on what he called "the gathering storm" of threats from terrorists. One of his ads, also produced by Mr. Brabender, featured a mushroom cloud.
Asked if this video was over the top, Mr. Brabender said, "That's for a viewer to decide. But when you're talking about Iran having nuclear capability, it's hard to show anything visual that would be considered over the top. If this scares a few people and even if they say it's over the top, maybe they want to learn more. It would be a mistake on our part if we weren't sounding an alarm in a sensational way."
The trailer concludes: "Obamaville. More than a town -- a cautionary tale. Coming soon, to ricksantorum.com."

HEADLINE: The Outsourced Party

BYLINE: KEVIN BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans have turned themselves over body and soul to outside interests. 

 BODY:
Who speaks for the Republican party? The answer is that everyone does - and therefore, no one does.
Much air time and many trees have been wasted trying to explain the division, rancor and lethargy that have beset the Republican nominating campaign, now into its second year and threatening to run all the way to the party's national convention in late August. But it's no great mystery. Republicans have fallen prey to one of the favorite tactics of just the sort of heedless, improvident, twenty-first century capitalism they revere. Their party has been outsourced.
For decades, Republicans have recruited outside groups and individuals to amplify their party's message and its influence. This is a legitimate democratic tactic that they have carried off brilliantly, helping to shift the political spectrum in the United States significantly to the right.
When Republicans came to believe in the 1960s that they were up against a "liberal biased" media that would never give them a fair shake, they began the long march to build their own, alternative information establishment. As chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Mark Fowler, led the fight to abolish the "Fairness Doctrine" in 1987, further empowering what was already a legion of right-wing talk radio programs.
In 1949, drawing on a long history of court decisions; on public hearings; and on legislation mandating "equal time" for political candidates, the F.C.C. ruled that holders of radio and television broadcast licenses must "devote a reasonable percentage of their broadcast time to the presentation of news and programs devoted to the consideration and discussion of public issues of interest in the community," and that this must include "different attitudes and viewpoints concerning these vital and often controversial issues."
The Supreme Court repeatedly upheld the F.C.C.'s power to make such a rule - but never gave it the power of law. In 1986, a pair of Ronald Reagan's judicial appointees on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia, ruled that the Fairness Doctrine was not "a binding statutory obligation." 
Armed with this verdict, Fowler, who insisted on viewing television, in particular, as not a finite and supremely influential broadcast medium but "just another appliance - it's a toaster with pictures," persuaded his fellow commissioners to abolish the Fairness Doctrine. Furious Democrats in Congress passed legislation to codify the doctrine into law in 1987 and 1991, but these attempts were vetoed by Reagan and George Bush, respectively; Democrats have gone on trying to make the Fairness Doctrine law to this day, but have always been stymied by adamant Republican opposition.
Right-wing radio was dominant on the airwaves before the Fairness Doctrine was abolished. But now it had the field of public discourse virtually all to itself. It provided conservatives with a direct outreach to the public, free of any intercession by the "elites" Newt Gingrich is still denouncing in this season's debates. Right-leaning media networks such as Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcast Network and especially Clear Channel Communications soon became major media conglomerates, with no obligation to broadcast any conflicting views.
The biggest media coup of all for the Republican party, though, was the advent of nakedly partisan Fox News, created by Roger Ailes, former media advisor to the Nixon, Reagan and George Bush administrations. It was Ailes who thereby managed to throw the entire weight of Rupert Murdoch's worldwide media empire behind the party - and it was Ailes, reportedly, who kept it on the conservative straight-and-narrow when Mr. Murdoch toyed with the idea of putting the empire behind Barack Obama, the new Democrat, in 2008, much as it had backed Tony Blair's New Labour for a time in Great Britain. Instead, thanks to Ailes, conservative politicians and advocates saw both their ideas amplified and their wallets fattened by a dizzying array of Murdoch television shows, books and newspapers.
But it wasn't just in the media where the Republican party proved ingenious in outsourcing its rhetoric and shifting the national dialogue. In 1971, during Richard M. Nixon's first term in office, Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Republican corporate lawyer from Virginia, summoned the resources of the business community to the cause with his famous memorandum to the National Chamber of Commerce, "Attack on American Free Enterprise System."
Powell wanted "American business" to fight back everywhere it could against what he saw as the many enemies of free enterprise. Tactics would include demanding "equal time" on the nation's college campuses and - ironically enough - on the nation's airwaves, by appealing to the fairness standards of the F.C.C. Yet more importantly, Powell's memorandum inspired the founding of the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Manhattan Institute, and other conservative think tanks. Wealthy businessmen and other individuals from Richard Mellon Scaife to the Koch brothers stepped up, pouring millions of dollars into right-wing magazines, books and political campaigns.
Powell won himself an appointment to the Supreme Court - and the nation's capital won itself a major new industry. It may seem as if lobbyists in Washington have always been more numerous than locusts, but in fact when Powell wrote his memo just over 40 years ago, there were at most only a few hundred. Today, there are tens of thousands - leaders of a multi-billion dollar industry in its own right, and one mostly interested in "freeing" business from regulation and taxes.
The Republican effort to rally every conceivable outside entity to the party's cause was wildly successful. Again and again over the years, conservative policy institutes have armed the party's candidates with intellectual arguments, while the conservative media barrage has blasted a way through to high office for even the most lackluster Republican nominees.
Yet increasingly this meant that the Republican Party was outsourcing both body and soul. Both what the party believed in and its ability to do the heavy lifting necessary to win elections was handed over to outside interests - outside interests that did not necessarily share the party's goals or have any stake in ameliorating its tactics.
This has become suddenly and painfully evident this year. Party leaders may not have liked Rush Limbaugh's disgusting attacks on a Georgetown law student - calling her a "slut" and a "prostitute" for advocating that insurance companies provide affordable birth control - but what does he care?
If the Republicans lose the election, it will most likely mean all the more angry conservatives tuning in and driving up the ratings for Rush and his fellow radio ranters. Limbaugh is now facing a challenge from outraged liberals and others urging his sponsors to drop his show. But the most that the usually garrulous Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney would allow himself to say was that "it's not the language I would have used." Rick Santorum averred that Rush was "being absurd," but implied that was O.K. - "an entertainer can be absurd. He's in a very different business than I am."
But of course, he's not. Rush Limbaugh is in the very same business that Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney are in - and guess who's in charge? It's not the radio calamity howlers who take their cues from the party leaders now, but the other way around. 
This campaign season we've seen all the major Republican candidates for president adopt the bombastic, apocalyptic rhetoric of talk radio, insisting that we will "lose America" if they aren't elected, and filling their speeches and debates with ugly personal insults, directed at each other and at President Obama. The results are in the poll numbers. Unlike the sharp but generally civil 2008 primary fight between Obama and Hillary Clinton, which galvanized the Democratic base, the Republican struggle this year has been steadily driving down the party's appeal and driving up the candidates' negative ratings.
Poll numbers for Republicans in Congress have taken a nosedive, too, as the party's intransigence on Capitol Hill has allowed President Obama to appear reasonable by contrast. But what does that matter to the thousands of lobbyists who bring in more and more of the money for congressional campaigns? Sure, a Republican victory might afford them more closed-door sessions on rewriting federal regulations. But Democratic victories will serve their purpose just as well, making clear to the money men who send them to Washington that they are more needed than ever to resist "job-killing regulations."
Meanwhile, Fox News has become a special impediment to Republican order - largely thanks to its own success. All the enticements of the Murdoch empire have produced a generation of reality show pols, at least as interested in landing their own TV series as winning office. Two of the most popular Republican candidates for president going into the race, Mike Huckabee and Sarah Palin, both declined to run rather than jeopardize their shows. Newt Gingrich turned much of his campaign into book tours for himself and his wife. Ask yourself which was most likely: that Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann really thought they could be elected president or that they were looking to improve their "brand."
And after decades of trying to undo federal campaign-finance laws, Republicans at last succeeded - only to watch the party's wealthy sponsors diversify their interests from think tanks to super PACs. Why bother with all the time and expense of hiring a bunch of intellectuals to occupy some expensive piece of Washington real estate and hammer out policy positions - when you can go out and make a straight cash exchange for a candidate?
Even as Rick Santorum was pleading that sometimes you have to "take one for the team" in the last Republican debate, his candidacy was being kept alive largely by money from a single donor, Foster Friess, the conservative Christian multimillionaire with the Batman villain name. Gingrich has his own sponsors, the casino billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, hawkish supporters of Israel. Does what these individuals care about most fit in with the Republican party's election strategy? So what? 
It's not that these individual donors believe in things - conservative Christian stands on abortion, unmitigated support for Israel and so on - that are so different from what much of the party's base believes in. But political campaigns, especially national campaigns in America, are all about nuance and finesse - about just how you say something and when and where you say it. Presidential candidates need to elide certain issues at times, either things they know that they cannot do, but are loath to tell their base; or things that they intend to try, but cannot tell the rest of the electorate until they have gained power and built up the necessary public support; or things that they have no idea how they will handle until certain events play out and force their hand.
The question of whether or not the United States or Israel should attack Iran to suppress its nuclear program is a good example of this last sort of issue. Just what Iran's capabilities are of developing nuclear weapons, what its intentions are once it should have them, how successful any attack on them can be and what the consequences of such an attack might be are just some of the immensely complicated questions surrounding this debate.
Yet such complexities don't seem to matter much to the ravenously egotistical Gingrich, so long as they don't much matter to his sponsor. Money, it's true, has always played a critical role in American politics. But in the past, presidential nominees did more than simply try to raise money. They tried to build consensus within their party. Fringe candidates like Gingrich and Santorum were generally eliminated from the start by their past defeats or by their extremist views - college is evil - but if they weren't, our political system gave them the chance to take their arguments to the people in relatively small, manageable states and see if they caught on.
Now, none of that really matters so much. Forced to resign as speaker of the House by your own party? Handed the worst electoral defeat in your own state that anyone can remember? Way behind in the delegate count? In some circumstances, it might be good that even though you've failed previously you can still go out and make your case to the people. But now you can even fail at that, as well. It doesn't matter. Just one billionaire can keep you on the campaign trail!
Thanks to their inventiveness, Republicans have stumbled into the brave new world of American politics. From primaries to photo ops, from direct mail to voter suppression laws, the Republican party has almost always been the real innovator in electoral politics, usually leaving their slower brother, the Democrats, in the dust for at least a campaign season or two.
Now they've achieved the political equivalent of shuttering that foul old steel mill and shipping the hard work off for others to do while they dabble in these fascinating new derivatives. Now their candidates and their ideas are seen as so many junk bonds, and they don't seem to have the wherewithal to make the party over from within.
The Republican party has been moving to the right for half-a-century now and generally carrying the country with it. But in the past, even under the right's greatest hero, Ronald Reagan, this movement came in fits and starts, as Republican candidates and officeholders had to accommodate themselves to real-world situations and the qualms of their constituents. This is the chastening role that elections are supposed to play. Participating in a democracy means more than simply insisting, over and over again, in as loud and arrogant a voice as possible, in as many venues as your money will allow, what it is that you want. It means listening, it means convincing, it means compromising - all those things that political parties and their leaders used to be fairly good at.
At long last, Republicans seem to be finally coalescing around Mitt Romney's candidacy, and he could still win the presidency if the economy slumps again. But the longer-term problem will remain: how to maintain a coherent, mass political party when so many individuals are empowered as never before to redirect it to their own, personal ends.

HEADLINE: Not-So-'Mad' Ideas About Taxes

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
This month, the Roosevelt Hotel, on East 45th Street, initiated a special offer in commemoration of ''Mad Men,'' whose return to television on Sunday night for a fifth season is something surely known now even to preschoolers of merely middling sophistication. For $495 a night, guests at the Roosevelt receive a room, a DVD of the fourth season of ''Mad Men,'' a ''Mad Men'' cookbook and period cocktails -- the period, of course, being 1960s New York, when, in the show's imagination, any Scotch consumed after 10 a.m. betrayed a restrained and focused temperament. (I didn't call the hotel to learn how many drinks were included in the price for fear that any answer short of ''unlimited'' would have compelled me to accuse management of purveying historical falsehoods.)
Presumably, one could choose to stay at the Roosevelt because it is where Don Draper, during the show's second season, temporarily relocated while experiencing an early chapter of marital strife. Or perhaps, more sanely, one could stay because the Roosevelt embodies mid-20th-century Manhattan urbanity at a price point considerably lower than the Carlyle's. 
Since ''Mad Men'' began, in 2007, it has been suggested over and over that the series's appeal lies in the sublimated wishes of an upper-middle-class audience that longs for the kind of erotic abandonment and barfly afternoons that have all but vanished in a culture enraptured by third-grade soccer games and antioxidants. This argument ignores the extent to which sex is hindered by consequences on the show and the degree to which male regard for women is conveyed in an emotional range traveling quickly from lust to contempt. More significant, the thinking ignores the profound titillation of an era in which it was possible to live spectacularly well -- in Manhattan -- without the benefit of annual earnings in the tens of millions of dollars.
In a certain sense, wealthy people could live with a justifiable guiltlessness in ''Mad Men'' New York. Not because they were blind to the city's mounting racial crisis or to the perils of smoking or sexism, but rather because, fiscally speaking, they were paying their due. In 1966, which is where the new season finds us, the federal income tax topped out at 70 percent on income over $100,000 (approximately $700,000 in present-day dollars), a figure reduced from 90 percent in a tax cut enacted two years earlier.
Absent were any obvious incentives for amassing perverse amounts of money (and thus there was more time for the languorous lunch). In April 1968, Fortune magazine published a list of those Americans whose net worth exceeded $100 million; the list ended at 153. Today, those in the highest federal income tax bracket will pay 35 percent.
Long-term capital gains taxes were higher than they are today, and so were New York State income taxes: the richest paid 14 percent in 1966; today they pay 8.82 percent, and current law has that figure reverting to 6.85 percent in three years. Moreover, beginning his mayoral tenure in 1966, John Lindsay delivered the city's first personal income tax.
And yet well-off people hardly appeared to suffer. The new season has Don Draper living, at least in real-estate terms, very enviably, in a sweeping, modern apartment. ''Mad Men'' plays to libertine fantasies of louche living, but it also gives credibility to the liberal belief that high taxes won't constrain the rich.
Conservatives have argued that the era of high taxes augured the city's financial decline. James Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group that studies New York's tax and social policies, argues that that analysis ignores a confluence of events that included the suburban exodus brought about in large part by government subsidization of highways, like the Saw Mill River Parkway that Don once drove to his former home in Westchester County.
For those who remained in the city, it was not necessary to be Don Draper (who, in turn, was not Lloyd C. Blankfein) to live well. New to the market in 1966 were apartments in the city's first high-rise condominium building, the St. Tropez, at 340 East 64th Street. One-bedroom apartments started out at $29,241, and three-bedrooms reached $79,811, which translates today to about $219,000 and $600,000 when adjusted for inflation.
Needless to say, that is not what it costs to buy an apartment at the St. Tropez today, when a one-bedroom is listed for $939,000 and a three-bedroom for over $1.8 million. (Traveling further back into the mid-20th century, to 1957, it was possible to buy a four-bedroom apartment on Fifth Avenue, with views of Central Park, for what today amounts to roughly half a million dollars. It, in fact, would cost 20 times that.)
In essence, the city's upper-middle-class residents were the rich, and presumably there were far fewer stories in the press like one that appeared in Bloomberg Businessweek last month lamenting the pains of those in the financial industry forced to face smaller bonuses. ''I feel stuck,'' a marketing executive earning $350,000 a year said. ''The New York that I wanted to have is still just beyond my reach.''
For radically contrasting ideas of domestic life in New York, it is worth pairing a screening of ''Mad Men'' with a viewing of the new film ''Friends With Kids,'' and not solely because both feature the actor Jon Hamm. Set in the Upper West Side and Brooklyn of right now, its financially comfortable characters are hardly spared the mess of unhappy marriages and the toll of heavy drinking. But what they get alongside all of that are worries about private-school tuitions, smaller apartments, moldings with chipped paint -- the aesthetic unruliness from which ''Mad Men'' briefly rescues us.

HEADLINE: If 'Forever' Doesn't Work Out: The Same-Sex Prenup

BYLINE: By LOUISE RAFKIN

 BODY:
WHEN Ellen DeGeneres married Portia de Rossi in 2008, people wanted to know two things: What did they wear? And was there a prenup?
Regarding the first question, the couple wore Zac Posen.
The second question -- Ms. DeGeneres's representatives did not respond when asked if she had a prenup or not -- has become important for many other same-sex couples, who have discovered that all the new opportunities to marry are accompanied by a gloomy companion that hangs silently over every prospective newlywed: the possibility of divorce.
''The old adage 'with rights come responsibilities' comes to mind,'' said Frederick Hertz, an Oakland, Calif., lawyer and an author of ''Making It Legal: A Guide to Same-Sex Marriage, Domestic Partnership & Civil Unions'' (Nolo Press, 2009). 
Having mediated ugly same-sex breakups, both for those legally married and in domestic partnerships, Mr. Hertz is a staunch advocate of the prenuptial contract; he has worked on more than 100 in the last five years. Yet Mr. Hertz's unscientific guess is that less than 20 percent of same-sex couples talk to lawyers before reciting vows.
Lisa Padilla, 49, a Manhattan lawyer, and Allison Drew Klein, 55, a sales representative for Pitney Bowes, met during Rosh Hashana at their synagogue in 2010. In a matter of weeks, they formed a strong bond.
For both women, previous long-term relationships had ended badly, and in Ms. Padilla's case, the problems involved finances. Ms. Padilla, who owns her own law firm, said she made far more than her previous partner and paid for most of the couple's expenses.
After a giddy three months of dating, Ms. Padilla and Ms. Klein moved in together. They had been sharing costs equally, so when Ms. Padilla broached the subject of a prenuptial agreement, Ms. Klein was taken aback.
''It was unsettling, and took some of the romance away, '' she said. ''I read Lisa's insistence for a prenup as a lack of trust.''
Both women had considerable assets, including apartments and investments. ''I really wanted the assurance that if we were making a mistake, we could extricate ourselves easily,'' Ms. Padilla said.
Ms. Klein thought the issue was moot. After all, this was supposed to last forever.
For months, the question languished and the prenuptial document that Ms. Padilla had drafted lay untouched.
Both women hired lawyers, and the process was nerve-racking, more so -- curiously -- for Ms. Padilla. ''I was skip-happy in love, but scared, too,'' she said. ''I could see how the opportunities for misinterpretation abounded -- both between the two of us and among our friends.''
''We were looking ahead,'' she added, ''but we didn't have anything on paper.''
Eventually, Ms. Klein agreed to sign.
''In my opinion, Lisa had been taken advantage of in other relationships,'' she said. ''I wanted her to be able to feel safe in this one.''
The women were married in Manhattan last December. ''For the first time, I feel like I'm with an equal partner,'' Ms. Padilla said. ''My primary purpose with the prenup was to take finances off the table and engage in the relationship with our hearts.''
Michele Kahn, the lawyer who represented Ms. Klein, strongly advises those thinking about marriage to grasp all the ramifications, saying, ''During breakups, it's everyone for themselves.''
She says most often it is not the cost of the agreement ($2,000 to $5,000) that short-circuits the process, but the complicated questions that can arise over, say, alimony; compensation for a stay-at-home parent; and retirement accounts, which for same-sex couples cannot be divided without penalties and tax consequences.
Same-sex marriages are not federally recognized, which can make things messier, especially if a couple moves to a state that does not acknowledge their union. ''If the second state follows the rules of the first it probably will be binding, but some states have looser standards and if it's not written according to those looser standards, it might not be binding,'' Mr. Hertz said.
Prenuptial agreements were originally established to protect family wealth. That notion is sometimes cloudy in same-sex relationships.
''In the gay community there is a lot of socializing among people with large discrepancies in both income and family wealth,'' said Jooske Stil, a marriage and family therapist in Oakland. ''Romance often blooms before there's full disclosure about economic backgrounds and family inheritances.''
Erik Kaeding, now 34, a lawyer in San Jose, Calif., and his partner, Greg Wardle, now 40, married in 2008 during the brief time that same-sex marriage was legal in California. At the time, Mr. Kaeding, a former teacher, was in law school. He said he wanted Mr. Wardle, an electrical engineer who earned a considerably higher salary, to know he intended to contribute to the partnership equally.
The couple used a do-it-yourself legal book for their agreement, and Mr. Kaeding said it helped limn their expectations and clarify their relationship.
''I didn't grow up with the idea that I would be taken care of,'' he said. ''Or that I would be owed something if the relationship went badly.''
For some couples, particularly those who have been together for many years, if not decades, and jump at the chance to marry as soon as their state allows it, the very notion of spelling out a post-divorce existence can seem preposterous.
Mr. Hertz said, however, that he knew of several longtime couples who broke up during the prenuptial process. ''Same-sex couples are approaching marriage as a civil rights issue, not a private financial contract -- which is considerably less romantic and exciting,'' he said.
Despite talk of alimony and tax consequences, many lawyers, including Mr. Hertz, said the prenuptial process, if done right, can draw a couple closer.
''Even if the relationship is life-long and 'till death do us part,' there's always an end,'' Ms. Padilla said. ''It's just reality.''

HEADLINE: A Solid Luxury Option With a Lot of Options

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
EACH morning as the sun rises over Stuttgart, Mercedes-Benz executives must give thanks for the rise, fall, evolution and endurance of the S.U.V.
It certainly took Mercedes a while to find its calling in this lucrative all-wheel-drive market: the original M-Class, an Alabama-built cracker barrel with the soul of a minivan, did not portend a bright future when it arrived in 1998. Five years later, Mercedes began officially importing its G-Class, ne Gelandewagen. Conceived in 1979, this $75,000 Austrian off-roader had built a tiny following strictly on the gray market, with truck-loving Yankees paying well over $100,000 for used specimens.
Such action-figure S.U.V.'s won many battles, but eventually lost the war: As the rough riders fell back, overrun by car-based crossovers, the market essentially fell into Mercedes's lap.
What Americans want from today's S.U.V.'s is exactly what Mercedes is genetically programmed to provide: not armor plating and off-road prowess, just space for the family to relax in peace, along with comfort and safety. If those buyers rise to the luxury ranks, said S.U.V. must add a sprinkling of techno-treats and a leather-scented wrapper that suggests a desirable ZIP code. 
With this third-generation M-Class, Mercedes's confidence that its S.U.V. values are the right ones has never been clearer. This is a subtle but enormously skilled contender in the midsize luxury class. That is, if you can forgive a price that soars with every rich schmear of options. In looks, performance and, now, luxury, ML buyers will feel as though they're driving a mildly downsized version of the sumptuous GL, the three-row S.U.V. that's arguably the best of the big luxury barges.
If the two-row ML dovetails with your tastes, your family size and your credit score, the only question is how to fill 'er up: gasoline or diesel?
In this corner, the ML350 4Matic will be America's popular choice, with its 302-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6, upgraded with direct fuel injection. But after weeklong workouts with both models, I lean toward the challenger: the ML350 Bluetec 4Matic with a 240-horsepower 3-liter turbodiesel V-6.
Math majors may ask why a 240-horse diesel is preferable to a 302-horse gas engine; especially when the diesel's base price of $51,365 is $1,500 higher. So consider another number, 455, which describes not the engine of a vintage Pontiac GTO, but the incredible torque of the Mercedes diesel. That 455 pound-feet is 55 more than last year's ML Bluetec (horsepower has increased by 30), and it dwarfs the 273 pound-feet of the gasoline version.
The diesel's estimated economy rating of 20 miles per gallon in town and 27 on the highway also tops the 17/22 m.p.g. estimate of the premium-unleaded ML. Both models deliver power through a seamless 7-speed automatic transmission.
The ingot-solid chassis is shared in part with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, a vestige of Daimler's former ownership of Chrysler. The body, roughly an inch shorter and lower than before, adopts some of the stacked-Lego look of the E-Class sedan. The grille is upright and simplified, braced by an angular metal chin and an enlarged three-pointed star. Large, scooped-out air inlets, striped with LED lighting, have replaced demure fog lamps.
The cargo area is usefully box-shaped, bigger than you may expect, with a wide floor and little intrusion from the wheel wells.
Like its big brother, the GL, the M-Class looks classy and satisfied, a sport-ute with nothing to prove. It also retains its forward-slashing C-pillars, a look that some people can't abide -- a ''Russian Tonka truck,'' one colleague sniffed. If it's all a little on the conservative side, so are the suburbs the M-Class will call home.
The cabin receives the more visible sprucing up, with Benz-worthy wood and leather, firm but comfortable seats and an S-Class's worth of gizmos. Most of this costs extra, including the wood-and-leather steering wheel ($590) and soft ambient lighting ($155).
A well-designed self-parking unit uses radar to scan for available spots at up to 20 m.p.h., then neatly parallel-parks the vehicle, requiring the driver only to marvel and to brake. That feature adds $970. Do you detect a pattern?
The ML's main ergonomic upgrade has been to move an important control out of reach, at least until you want to touch it. Mercedes's dastardly cruise-control stalk, which drivers have been grabbing for years when they intended to use the turn signal, or vice-versa, has been relocated below the signal stalk.
The ML is as smooth as Wonka's chocolate river and as good at ferrying children. It's as quiet as any S.U.V. I've tested. Even the diesel's unobtrusive tick-tock sound, audible with the windows open, is virtually extinguished in the sealed compartment.
Mercedes estimates a dead-heat 0-to-60 m.p.h. run of 7.3 seconds for either the gasoline or diesel model. That's rather snappy performance for a vehicle that weighs more than 5,000 pounds.
But the ML's improved cornering was the real surprise, especially with the Dynamic Handling Package, which adds an adaptive air suspension, 20-inch alloy wheels and the Adaptive Curve system. As the ML swings into a curve, the system hydraulically couples its stabilizer bars, limiting how much the body can lean over. In a straight line, the wheels are freed to help tame bumps. Decoupling the bars also helps the M-Class negotiate off-road terrain.
So equipped, the ML cornered virtually as flat as a BMW X5 on a downhill run, though the Mercedes couldn't match the BMW's sporty, communicative steering.
The diesel, naturally, thrives at very low engine speeds. And for many people, that smooth, unstressed power is ideally suited to a well-marbled S.U.V.
Yet the revised gas burner has its own charms. Its newly enlarged V-6 revs with gusto to its much-higher 6,500 r.p.m. redline and responds quicker to the throttle. Either ML will tow a stout 7,200 pounds, though a special off-road package, including driver-selected modes for handling various terrains, won't be available until the 2013 model year.
The diesel registered 27 m.p.g. for a New York-to-Boston trip. The E.P.A. estimates that the average owner of the diesel ML will spend $2,800 a year on fuel, some $450 less than for the gasoline version.
The diesel does burn through another pricey liquid: AdBlue, the urea solution that is steadily metered into the exhaust stream to neutralize smog-forming nitrogen oxides. Diesel buyers must refill the seven-gallon urea tank every 10,000 to 15,000 miles. Some dealers charge around $300 for the service, though owners can top off on their own for much less.
The ML's base price is unchanged from last year despite the upgraded powertrain and more standard equipment, including a power liftgate, heated front seats, driver's knee air bag and LED running lamps and taillamps.
Solidly equipped, the Bluetec Benz reached $65,810. But my gas-powered test car, which starts below $50,000, came with nearly $25,000 in options -- half the price of the base vehicle! -- for a staggering total of $74,325. In the ML's defense, many buyers can and will live without a lot of the extras, like the Dynamic Handling Package (a steep $5,150); night vision ($1,780), rear-seat DVD entertainment ($1,970); adaptive cruise control, lane-departure and blind-spot warnings ($2,950); three-zone climate control ($1,450), the auto-parking unit; and an all-seeing, all-knowing xenon headlight system for $1,290. Eliminating just those options would keep the price under $60,000.
If you insist on splurging, you can still get the ML550 with a 4.7-liter 402-horse Biturbo V-8; it starts at $58,465. Those who want to make a truly mad dash to the ski cabin can opt for the ML63 AMG, upgraded with a 518-horse Biturbo V-8, for $95,865. A basic two-wheel-drive ML350 arrives in September.
Considering the shared genes of the Mercedes and Jeep, is an ML worth $15,000 to $25,000 more than a Grand Cherokee or, for that matter, the fine new Ford Explorer?
For a Jeep or Ford fan, a colorful adjective precedes the ''no.'' For a Benz loyalist, an education analogy might be in order: he may complain about the tuition, but he's not about to take his child out of private school.

HEADLINE: Back After a Short Nap

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
FOR a time, Claudia Aguirre and Joel Feazell lived happily in a two-bedroom one-bath co-op on the Upper West Side with their two daughters. But as the children grew, the space became increasingly cramped. In particular, they needed another bathroom. They began to hunt for a larger apartment, which eventually led them north of 110th Street. There, they spent months researching condominiums, co-ops and, finally, brownstones.
''It dawned on us that the price we would pay for one more bathroom on the Upper West Side would get us an entire brownstone in Harlem,'' said Ms. Aguirre, the principal of M247 Dual Language Middle School on West 92nd Street.
So last fall, the couple bought an abandoned 17-foot-wide four-story row house on West 120th Street for $920,000. They are now midway through a gut renovation. 
Ms. Aguirre and Mr. Feazell, who is a managing director at BNY Mellon, have joined a long list of middle- and upper-middle-class New Yorkers who moved to Harlem over the years in search of space and relative affordability. When real estate slumped in 2008, stories like theirs became less common, as glamorous new developments in a still-gentrifying Harlem suddenly seemed a risky bet. The median sales price in Harlem fell by nearly 16 percent between 2007 and last year, to $456,061, compared with less than 3 percent in Manhattan as a whole in the same period.
But in recent months, there have been signs of a resurgence, brokers and residents said. Inventory has fallen, with the number of apartments and brownstones for sale in Central Harlem, for example, decreasing by nearly 5 percent in 2011 compared with the previous year, versus less than 2 percent for all of Manhattan. During the same period, the median price in Central Harlem -- the area from Morningside Avenue to the west and Fifth Avenue to the east, and from 110th Street north to 125th Street -- jumped by nearly 18 percent, to $536,635. In East Harlem, from 97th Street to 125th Street east of Fifth Avenue, the median price increased by nearly 5 percent, to $440,000, in 2011.
This compares with an increase of just over 1 percent for all of Manhattan, according to Streeteasy data.
Sofia Song, the vice president for research of Streeteasy, said that increase could be attributed to a strong rental market and low interest rates -- a combination that makes buying more attractive.
The short commute on the express trains to Midtown and downtown Manhattan is a plus, as are the growing number of businesses in the area.
''We have a flower shop, a cute cafe down the street and a ton of hip new restaurants that have opened,'' said Melody Rollins Downes, who with her husband, Quintano Downes, recently spent $1.95 million on a renovated brownstone on West 120th Street, a few doors down from Ms. Aguirre and Mr. Feazell. Before the building was renovated, ''it was a crack house and the basement level was a gambling spot,'' she said. ''But now, this whole block has been transformed and there is really a great vibe up here.''
Norman Horowitz, an executive vice president of Halstead Property who has sold several hundred properties over the last decade in Harlem, said, ''Harlem was gentrifying before the recession, then there was a pause, and now the trend is picking up again.''
Some experts caution, however, that a Harlem recovery could be destabilized if a backlog of foreclosed or distressed properties went on the market. While figures are hard to come by, ''there is a lot of hidden inventory, where banks are just holding on to these units, but have yet to put them up for sale,'' said Willie Suggs, a well-known Harlem broker.
The supply of properties for sale has tightened for several reasons, brokers say. For one, condos built in the boom were more affordable to start with -- usually around $1,000 per square foot and under -- so deep price cuts on top of that ensured that many of the units were steadily, if slowly, bought up. Low interest rates and federal incentives also helped bolster sales.
The recession nearly turned off the financing spigot for new projects, and even now, with banks starting to lend again, developers are thinking twice before jumping back in the ring. Finally, when the market collapsed, some condominiums were converted to rentals.
At the Sedona, an 11-unit condominium at 346 East 119th Street, for example, just one apartment remains for sale. Three recent sales had multiple bids, said David Daniels, a vice president of Corcoran who represents the building. Unit 3A sold for $365,000, just $5,000 shy of the asking price, and 4A closed at $382,00, only $3,000 below asking. Unit 5A is now in contract for close to its asking price of $425,000 -- even after a $15,000 increase in February.
Some developers are raising prices. This month, for example, Fifth on the Park, a 28-story brick-and-glass condominium at 120th Street and Fifth Avenue at Marcus Garvey Park, increased the price on many of its units, including No. 13C, a three-bedroom two-bath, by $10,000, to $953,000; and No. 19C, also a three-bedroom two-bath, by $16,000, to $959,000.
Hoping to buy an apartment in Harlem before prices rose precipitously, Molly Glenn and her boyfriend, Daniel Truax, searched for four months before they closed in December on an 800-square-foot two-bedroom on West 148th Street for $265,000. ''It is everything we wanted,'' said Mr. Truax, 26, who is the athletics ticket manager at Columbia University.
''While most of our friends are in Brooklyn,'' said Ms. Glenn, also 26, a mechanical engineer at ThomasNet, ''the parts of Brooklyn we really like are more expensive than here. I just didn't see the point in spending more money to leave Manhattan and put a river between me and everything I do.''
Brownstones have also been selling at a clip, with the number of sales in Harlem up nearly 24 percent since 2008, to 47 sales last year, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. A five-bedroom five-bath at 329 Convent Avenue on the western border of Harlem sold for $2.3 million, a $100,000 increase over its asking price. Nearby, 319 Convent Avenue sold for $1.97 million, far above the $1.6 million asking price.
''Normally, between Thanksgiving and Valentine's Day we brokers go on vacation,'' said Ms. Suggs, who is preparing to list two brownstones this spring for around $3 million each, a price tag not seen since the market crashed. ''But not this year. People are willing to pay close to what they were paying prior to the market tanking, so we are doing our happy dance.''
Sensing that the market is turning, some developers are moving to bring new condos to the market. At 5 West 127th Street, a 13-unit condominium will go on the market in May. Mostly two-bedrooms, the apartments will have washers and dryers and granite countertops; some will have balconies. There will also a gym. Priced under $600 a square foot, the apartments range from $379,000, for a 698-square-foot one-bedroom with one bath, to $689,000, for a penthouse of 1,027 square feet with two bedrooms and two baths.
''Inventory is very low and the market is rebounding,'' said Yoni Bak, the vice president for real estate development at Kane Ventures, the developer of the West 127th Street condos. Kane is preparing to break ground on a similar 15-unit project at 56-58 West 129th Street. ''We are doubling down on Harlem right now,'' Mr. Bak said, ''because the prices for land are still reasonable up here.''
On West 116th Street, between Lenox Avenue and Fifth Avenue, L+M Development Partners is breaking ground on 85 market-rate condominiums. The project, still unnamed, is across from the Kalahari, a 249-unit condominium, now sold out, that the developers built in 2009. Like the Kalahari, the new development will include a gym and a community room, with prices somewhere in the $600-a-square-foot range.
''The finishes won't be over the top,'' said Lisa Gomez, the executive vice president for development at L+M. ''We will be using wide plank floors and stone countertops, but we don't think people are moving to Harlem for a fancy toilet bowl. They are moving to Harlem because they like the neighborhood or because they can afford more space for their money.''
But though prices are rising, they are still well below their peak. At the Sedona on East 119th Street, for example, 3A and 4A, the two units that recently sold, were listed for $445,000 each in 2010, and their recent sales prices represented an 18 percent and 14.2 percent discount respectively. And even after the price increases at Fifth on the Park, No. 13C is listed at a 24.4 percent discount from its original asking price of $1.26 million in 2008, while No. 19C is 27.3 percent below its original $1.32 million price.
Some builders contend that prices are still too low to justify new development. ''At $500 to $600 a square foot,'' said Michael K. Shah, the chief executive of DelShah Capital, a developer, ''condo projects just don't pencil out yet.'' Prerecession condominium prices in Harlem were around $850 a square foot, he said, and until prices climb further, ''there is just too slim a profit margin after factoring in the cost of construction and land -- I don't think you will see a lot of new development for at least another two to three years.''
Still, some brokers and residents insist that this market rebound is meaningful.
The Downeses had been living in a three-bedroom condominium on West 119th Street for six years before their growing family created a need for more space.
''We looked all over the city,'' said Ms. Downes, an executive vice president of Pacific Investment Management Company, ''but it was really hard to find any four-bedrooms for under $3 million.'' When they found the five-bedroom house around the corner on West 120th Street, they began a slow negotiation with the developer over the $2 million price tag.
''Then one weekend morning I was out walking my dog, and saw two couples looking at the house, talking about making offers come Monday,'' she said. ''I went up to them and said, 'Oh, we are already in contract, that is my house.' '' She and her husband, who works on Wall Street, quickly closed the deal and moved in earlier this year.
''The market is very competitive right now,'' she said. ''We were told by our broker we could probably relist this house today and get $2.7 million for it.''

THE BIG PROFILE
EUGENE LEVY
You may have thought he was a cool father for the awkward sex-ed primer he offered in ''American Pie,'' but Eugene Levy is even more considerate in real life. Levy, who returns in ''American Reunion,'' invited his then-teenaged son, Dan, to the original ''Pie'' premiere in 1999 -- but let him back out after realizing it might be uncomfortable. ''He said: 'You know what? I think I'll wait to see it with my friends,' '' Levy recalls. ''I said, 'Are you sure?' In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, Whew.''
LE QUOTIDIAN PAIN 
The 21st century has not been kind to France's gastronomic reputation. First the New World dared to challenge Bordeaux, then a Brooklyn-born professor became the world's authority on the baguette. Now food bloggers are carping about the quality of a cup of coffee in Paris. ''Good coffee is now the territory of what are called Anglo cafes,'' says Clotilde Dusoulier, a French food writer. ''We French are getting used to this outsider's eye, showing us where we've lost our way. What's interesting is that we're willing to listen. Once, we would have been too proud.''

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has introduced ''Meet and Seat,'' a way to post your Facebook or LinkedIn profiles on its Web site so that others can choose you as a seatmate. Or reject you. ''Since the launch, more than 400 people have shared their profile,'' says Lisette Ebeling Koning, a spokeswoman for the airline.
FOLLOW THE MONEY
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS A PUBLISHING CRISIS!
Reading 21 books about the financial crisis may be even more unpleasant than it sounds. An M.I.T. economist named Andrew W. Lo has recently written ''Reading About the Financial Crisis: A 21-Book Review,'' which is exactly what it sounds like. His conclusion? Economists still can't agree on some basic facts about what caused the crisis, much less on what to make of it all. ''There is no single narrative,'' Lo says. ''It's a Rashomon moment.''
THE BEATS VS. THE 1%
Seventy years ago, Henry Miller traveled the U.S. after a decade abroad and wrote ''The Air-Conditioned Nightmare'' to excoriate the bourgeois complacency he saw. ''That Roosevelt!'' he recalls his dad's New-Deal-averse neighbors complaining, ''as if they were saying, 'That Hitler!' '' The book later influenced the Beats, Jack Kerouac especially. And in the 99-percent era, its provocations overshadow ''On the Road.''
LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED
How far would you go to find your lost dog? Mike and Jordina Ghiggeri, whose 11-year-old Welsh corgi ran away in Westport, Conn., on New Year's Eve, printed some 10,000 fliers, installed 14 night-vision cameras and 4 dog traps (in which they caught a dog that had been missing for 18 months but wasn't their dog). Then they hired a pet detective and issued A.P.B.'s. ''We're not giving up,'' Mike told me.

HEADLINE: It Riles A Village

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
I WENT to find my aunt Ruth in Judson Church among the disgruntled at a public hearing last month about New York University's latest proposal to expand its Greenwich Village campus. It was a couple of weeks before the local community board denounced the proposal outright. A light mist was falling. I climbed the church steps. Beyond the long tables, where children drew with crayons, a bobbing sea of homemade placards demanded, ''Flowers Not Towers.''
I had been one of those children at the long tables years ago. This sort of meeting felt like home, in the neighborhood where I had grown up in a cheerful culture of endless protest at a time when N.Y.U. was not yet one of the biggest and most ambitious private universities in the country but still a modest school proudly catering to working New Yorkers like my mother and Ruth. 
The storm over NYU 2031, as this latest expansion proposal is called, has escalated into one of the city's most acrimonious land-use battles. No wonder. The plan is so clearly oversize that it's hard not to see it as a stalking horse for what school officials figure they can get permission from the city to build. The proposal envisions constructing some 2.5 million square feet (the rough equivalent of the Empire State Building) over the next 20 years on a pair of superblocks owned by the university below Washington Square Park. The blocks are now dominated by midcentury tower-in-the-park faculty residences called Washington Square Village and University Village.
Common sense and the billions of dollars that the project would cost suggest the university would be hard pressed to build half of what it's outlining during the next decade or two. The question is which half of NYU 2031 ought to get a go-ahead, if either. The school, meanwhile, is expanding its satellite campus in Brooklyn and its medical center in Midtown. Universities in the city move their campuses from time to time. Columbia did it in the 1890s, quitting Midtown for Morningside Heights. N.Y.U.'s ultimate development may lie beyond the Village. In any case, this latest proposed expansion should not be the start of some new open-ended phase of growth in the neighborhood but the end of it.
What does N.Y.U. want? Urban universities, like hospitals, are engines of civic economies, and the best ones have to keep up with new technologies and expanding programs in a competitive marketplace: they need state-of-the-art facilities to attract top talent. The city has been banking a good part of its future on intellectual capital: Cornell's prospective campus on Roosevelt Island, Columbia's in Manhattanville. N.Y.U. contributes to the cultural lifeblood of the Village, adding, among other things, ethnic diversity to an area that celebrates its historic reputation as America's bohemian capital but is increasingly home for the super rich. The school needs to upgrade and consolidate its core.
And what does the neighborhood need? Among other things, open space, green space. The debate over the development of the two superblocks has turned a fresh spotlight on the underrated urban virtues of Washington Square Village and University Village -- examples of how tower-in-the-park architecture, descended from Le Corbusier and widely discredited, can benefit an old neighborhood of brownstones and low-rise loft buildings if the city is dense, healthy and vibrant enough. The task is balancing necessary development with a local ecosystem.
The most radical part of what N.Y.U. wants is to construct two tall, crescent-shaped towers, 400,000 square between them (the architecture is still notional) on the 1.5 acres of open space between the two apartment slabs of Washington Square Village. Beneath that open space, in lieu of the current parking garage, the university wants to dig several floors down to create 770,000 square feet of underground classrooms.
This would entail, among other things, demolishing the raised concrete garden by Hideo Sasaki from 1959 that is one of the country's earliest parking garage roof structures, beloved by landscape historians, with its boxed crabapples, cherry and willow trees. I used to play in it as a boy. It's a severe park but peaceful. The Village has notoriously few public refuges, aside from Washington Square Park. This is one of them, though most people don't even realize it exists.
That's because over the years the university has effectively closed off the open space between the buildings with fences and gates, obscured it behind a cheap retail strip mall on La Guardia Place and allowed what should be accessible parkland to languish while arguing that building the towers with fresh landscaping around them would create an improvement. Demolition by neglect is the term of art.
The open space on these superblocks was originally calibrated to take into account the density of the apartment slabs. Private developers in New York are forever seeking exemptions to get around constraints that zoning or other forms of regulation establish precisely to protect neighborhoods from overbuilding and to preserve landmarks. These developers are very often successful, the approval system for circumventing restrictions being notoriously vulnerable to politics and influence. N.Y.U. stresses that in this case it's actually asking to rezone the superblocks with a net increase, not decrease, in publicly accessible open space, proving the school is trying to do what's right for the neighborhood.
But this is tricky because the calculation has to do with where that open space would be. It's essential to consider that these superblocks were created during the 1950s through a slum-clearance program of urban renewal under Robert Moses's authority that justified its exercise of eminent domain as a matter of public interest. So in a sense public interest, and not just N.Y.U.'s interest, continues to hold a special claim over the protection and disposition of the blocks' open space.
The crescent towers devised by N.Y.U.'s team -- Toshiko Mori Architect, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates and Grimshaw Architects -- are nonstarters by virtue of their bulk and height, but they do raise another interesting issue. Theoretically, increased density is an urban virtue. The Village is not as dense as some Villagers worry it is. Filling in some of the open space around tower-in-the-park housing projects with retail and street life often makes sense. The clash of different sorts of architecture, cheek by jowl, as the crescent towers would do with the '50s slabs, is a defining virtue of great cities.
But Washington Square Village is faculty housing smack in the middle of a prosperous, low-rise neighborhood where there's no shortage of retail. There is a need to breathe, though, a need for the sort of open space that these tower-in-the-park layouts originally provided.
Washington Square Park, a block away, is something else. A landmark destination, crowded and bigger, it's a place for spectacle. But neighborhoods still need neighborhood spaces for other sorts of personal interactions. The city should veto the crescent towers at Washington Square Village and compel the university really to open that space up: redesign and reactivate it as a park for Villagers, not just for freshmen skateboarders and iPod-engrossed graduate students.
In other words, make the whole thing a gift from the university to the neighborhood from which the school draws so much of its marketing muscle. Below-ground classrooms would still be fine if a new park could be designed at a continuous grade with the street, so that foot traffic flows easily into and out of it from all directions.
In exchange the city should allow N.Y.U. another big part of its plan: to replace its appalling gymnasium, a windowless brick fortress and blight on Mercer Street from the early 1980s, when the university's architectural message to the city was: Drop dead. Instead of the existing Coles Sports & Recreation Center the university can have its proposed multitower building, called the Zipper, not quite as big as imagined and accompanied by a promise of public amenities along with the pedestrian thoroughfare that is now part of the proposal, which would roughly extend Greene Street north. This would return some life to that forlorn corner of the Village, which has been abandoned for years to college gym rats.
The city could also approve a dormitory atop a prospective public school where there's now a supermarket near the corner of Bleecker Street and La Guardia Place. A new elementary school would bring another potential boon to the neighborhood, so long as the city decides it actually wants a school there. (That's not clear yet.) The proposed school and dorm, at 14 stories, would loom over the adjoining gardens and the buildings across La Guardia. (''Goodbye Greenwich Village, Hello Midtown'' says a protest sign on the garden fence.) But the site needs some building to anchor that corner and the fine 1960s landmarked high-rises of University Village, called Silver Towers, two of which house faculty, the third, residents of a Mitchell-Lama cooperative.
A beautiful new 1.5-acre park, an elementary school, public amenities and a new pedestrian street to awaken a dead corner: all that seems like a fair trade for the neighborhood in return for a couple of the big buildings the university wants, which would replace undistinguished ones. N.Y.U. would get about half of what it's proposing, or maybe more. It has an unfortunate knack for commissioning some of the worst work from big-name architects (Bobst Library, the Kimmel Center), so everything will finally depend on vigilant oversight of the architectural details. But, in principle, what results could actually improve that stretch of the Village, and not just benefit the university.
I couldn't find my aunt in the crowd at Judson Church that morning. Fading vision has slowed her down lately, so when the meeting ended, I figured I had time before she made it down the steps to check out Washington Square Village and University Village again.
By the time I was a boy, University Village and Washington Square Village were facts of the neighborhood. Older Villagers, like my parents and aunt and uncle and their friends, watched the changes with trepidation. I took them for granted.
My friends and I ran around the gardens, under the trees, and rode the elevators to get bird's-eye views back down onto my building a few streets west. The glory of the Village was its diversity and the ever-present light and sky, immediate and enveloping over all the low buildings. But this modern world was for me fresh and amazing. The mash-up of architectural styles went along with the magnanimity of the neighborhood's self-image.
Designed by Paul Lester Wiener, Washington Square Village is one of the city's underrated architectural successes, immense without somehow seeming so big, its mass broken up by terraces and panels of glazed bricks in primary colors and white, and by the generous open space between the slabs.
Likewise, it's partly the too-formal but generous space around Silver Towers (the work of James Ingo Freed at I. M. Pei & Associates) that makes those towers look elegant and almost slender. They're cast-in-place rectangular concrete structures, Brutalist in concept, but with deep-set windows and a pinwheel plan that presents to passers-by a constantly shifting series of profiles, changing with the light of day. Stolid, sober, with their sculptured facades, like high-rise Sol LeWitts, the towers have helped keep the Village from becoming too cute.
Perceptions shift with generations. Some young Villagers I talked to on the street that morning said they found it easy to picture N.Y.U.'s proposed expansion. That was heartening in a way, but they also said they would love more park space.
I spotted my aunt struggling down the church steps. She took my arm, and I guided her up the street to a coffee shop a few blocks away where she railed against the university plan. A few protesters floated past, toting their placards. I laid out my compromise to her, and we argued for a while, then kissed goodbye before I walked to the subway in the drizzle.
Some things never change. Some things shouldn't.

HEADLINE: Rentals Offered, With Bragging Rights

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
A DEVELOPER that has played a big role in converting boardrooms into bedrooms in the financial district is preparing to leave its largest mark yet on the neighborhood.
Metro Loft Management, the owner of eight offices-turned-apartments in the area, recently added 70 Pine Street, a 66-story Art Deco high-rise built in 1932, to its portfolio.
The former headquarters of the embattled American International Group, 70 Pine is the fifth-tallest building in New York. Its limestone, brick and granite exterior, which tapers to a point like a rocket ship of the Flash Gordon era, was declared a landmark, as was its orange-marble lobby, whose details include aluminum light fixtures with a design of petals. 
Metro Loft bought 70 Pine this winter for $205 million with a longtime partner, the Eastbridge Group, a fashion-retail-focused investment firm based in Luxembourg. The million-square-foot skyscraper is scheduled to open as a rental by the summer of 2013.
The developers said they would determine the exact number of apartments within a month, when interior demolitions will begin.
Under one plan, a 300-room hotel would be on the lower floors, and above would be 700 apartments, whose residents could avail themselves of the hotel's services and staff, said Nathan Berman, a Metro Loft principal. Under a different plan, the skyscraper would be exclusively a residence, with about 970 apartments, he said.
Either way, the smallest apartments would be 400-square-foot studios, the largest 1,800-square-foot four-bedrooms, in a nod to families moving to the Wall Street area.
That area can still feel like a ghost town on weekends, when financial workers have cleared out. But a pioneering spirit will help draw new residents to the neighborhood, said Mr. Berman, as he gazed down at its streets from the light-filled observatory on 70 Pine's top floor.
''This is not where your grandmother used to live,'' said Mr. Berman, who emigrated from the Soviet Union as a teenager and sold contemporary art before starting his real estate business in 1995. ''This is not where people take over their parents' apartments, and so on. It's very new and very interesting.'' Developers say the observatory will be either a common space or part of a 6,000-square-foot triplex. Also visible from there is New York by Gehry, the luxury rental at 8 Spruce Street that Mr. Berman considers his chief competition.
But the ceilings at 70 Pine, at 12 feet high, will eclipse those in the Gehry building, Mr. Berman said, and prices appear competitive. Typical studios at New York by Gehry rent for about $2,700 a month, according to Citi Habitats, which handles its rentals; 70 Pine's will average $2,400, Mr. Berman said.
And once it opens, 70 Pine, at 950 feet, will become New York's tallest residential building, which means it will bump New York by Gehry, at 876 feet, from the top spot. (But those bragging rights will very likely be short-lived. One57, the new condo-hotel to open on West 57th Street in the fall of 2013, will clock in at 1,004 feet.)
The recent history of 70 Pine is somewhat stormy. Built as the headquarters of Cities Service, the oil company that later became Citgo, the building was bought by AIG in 1976. Severe losses brought on by the recent economic crisis led AIG to accept a $183 billion bailout from the federal government, which later demanded that the company sell real estate to help pay off its debt.
In 2009, Kumho Investment Bank, in a partnership with the developer Youngwoo & Associates, bought both 70 Pine and 72 Wall Street, across the street, for $150 million, with a plan to convert 70 Pine to condominiums.
Kumho and Youngwoo later parted ways in the midst of a sluggish sales market. Youngwoo then sued its former partner on charges of having pushed it out.
After the split, Kumho hired Sciame Development to advise on whether office space, condos or hotels constituted the best use for 70 Pine, but it then changed course again, selling 70 Pine to Metro Loft and Eastbridge in a deal that closed in December. Sciame has sued Kumho for $7.7 million, claiming breach of contract, an accusation that Kumho denies. The case is ongoing.
The legal issues may obscure the larger point that developers are continuing to bet big on the financial district, said Clifford Finn, the president for new development of Citi Habitats. ''It's now a first-choice destination for people,'' he said. ''It may not have started out like that, but it ended up that way.''

HEADLINE: What Happened To the Girls In Le Roy

 BODY:
The stigma regarding mental illness continues to exist. The phrase ''it's all in their heads'' is quite offensive to individuals whose illness is psychologically based -- literally in their minds. Why do we find 
it so hard to understand that these illnesses are quite real? Is it because they don't always respond to medications and thus are more difficult to ''cure''? Stress and anxiety take an incredible toll on the body, and conversion disorder is simply a less well known and more dramatic outcome than a migraine headache or an ulcer.
WENDY MOLUF, Mount Holly, N.J., posted on nytimes.com
It is stressful to live in a part of America that used to be so rich and is now so poor. And it is sad that a community, so unable to face its own present-day problems, would waste such energies on worrying about a 40-year-old train derailment. And it is a shame that the affluent world outside of Western New York would bring in its self-serving hucksterism and fashionable pseudoscientific bunk on the pretense of ''helping'' these terribly damaged people. And it is a crime that Americans living in other places would watch all this for their entertainment. You would have to be sick yourself, or a terribly foolish person, to think the root of all of this isn't clearly 40 years of economic decline and a lot of psychological stress.
MARK SCHREINER, Raleigh, N.C., posted on nytimes.com
This article reminds me of Susan Sontag's book ''Illness as Metaphor.'' Her central thesis was that the less we understand about the etiology of a particular disease, the more likely we are to assign a psychological cause to it. Then, as soon as the true biological nature of the illness is discovered, the need for psychological explanations falls away. Thus, the ''romantic, dreamy, artistic'' tuberculosis patient and the ''angry personality'' of the cancer patient. How easy it is to blame the victims, especially if they're teenage girls.
IDLEWILD, Queens, posted on nytimes.com
I can't help wondering if the response from doctors would have been the same if this were occurring in boys. Our culture seems to view what young women have to say and what they experience as highly unreliable.

HEADLINE: When Poverty Was White

BYLINE: By NELL IRVIN PAINTER. 
The author of ''The History of White People.''

 BODY:
CARRIE BUCK, or rather her last name, appears just once in the books of Charles Murray, the conservative sociologist and author of the recent work ''Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,'' his portrait of the decline of poor white Americans. To find it, you have to look through the endnotes for the introduction to his most famous book, ''The Bell Curve,'' in which he cites Buck v. Bell, the 1927 Supreme Court case that approved Ms. Buck's involuntary sterilization.
It's a striking omission, because her case highlights the historical blindness of Mr. Murray's narrow focus on the cultural and policy changes of the 1960s as the root of white America's decline. The story of white poverty, as Ms. Buck's story illustrates, is much longer and more complex than he and his admirers realize or want to admit.
In 1924 Virginia ordered Ms. Buck, 18 years old, unmarried and pregnant, to be forcibly sterilized. Her legal guardian appealed, and the case made it to the Supreme Court. The winning argument blamed her pregnancy on hereditary weaknesses -- in particular, her presumed feeblemindedness. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s majority opinion entered history: ''Three generations of imbeciles are enough.'' 
Involuntary sterilization was the early 20th century's remedy for what Mr. Murray blames on changes in the 1960s. But it was precisely the changes of that era -- for black civil rights, women's rights, poor people's rights -- and socially committed Catholicism that ended this inhumane practice.
Along the way, though, something got lost. Ms. Buck, sterilization, white poverty -- this older history disappeared in the mid-20th century, when prosperity isolated the stigmata of poverty in black Americans. In 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action'' laid blame on a black ''tangle of pathology'' of ghetto culture. Mr. Moynihan voiced a logic widespread at the time, translating the disarray associated with poverty into a racial trait.
And so when Mr. Murray faults poor whites' morals today, he unwittingly joins an earlier tradition of blaming the poor for their condition, whether they be black in the 1960s or white at the turn of the 20th century.
The roots of the movement for the involuntary sterilization of poor whites -- the policy that Ms. Buck embodied -- reach back into 19th-century social-betterment circles and an abundant social science literature on poor families.
The movement's pioneer was Richard L. Dugdale, corresponding secretary of the Prison Association of New York and secretary of the National Prison Association. He took up the scientific study of crime after the economic panic of 1873, which he blamed on unmarried sex, drunkenness and crime.
After visiting county and state jails, Mr. Dugdale published a report destined for greatness: ''The Jukes: A Study in Crime, Pauperism, Disease and Heredity, Also Further Studies of Criminals.'' By Mr. Dugdale's calculation, the ''fornication,'' ''crime,'' ''prostitution,'' ''bastardy,'' ''intemperance'' and ''disease'' of generations of the pseudonymous Jukes family had cost New York State a staggering $1.3 million.
''The Jukes'' found favor among penologists, social workers and social gospellers, who combined a humanitarian commitment to the poor with a scientific approach to charity. One admirer was the Rev. Oscar Carleton McCulloch of the Plymouth Congregational Church in Indianapolis. Inspired by Mr. Dugdale, Mr. McCulloch sought to make his own philanthropy scientific through research on Indiana's poor, some of whom came through his church doors.
One result was ''The Tribe of Ishmael: A Study in Social Degradation,'' which appeared in 1888. In it, Mr. McCulloch answered a gigantic question in the burgeoning field of heredity at a time when the concept of ''race'' divided not just white and black, but white people themselves: How could Americans of supposedly the finest racial stocks -- English, Saxon and Anglo-Saxon -- engender a long history of pauperism and crime?
The answer, Mr. McCulloch said, still lay in blood, but in blood of the wrong kind. He wasn't being original when describing the English ancestors of the Ishmaelites as the ''old convict stock which England threw into this country in the 17th century,'' but he was among the first to put it into a social-scientific context.
That logic was largely superseded in the 1910s by a seemingly more advanced approach to the persistence of white poverty: I. Q. testing. Such techniques to quantify intelligence aligned perfectly with an interventionist approach to social betterment, thanks to Charles Benedict Davenport, head of the Eugenics Record Office. Mr. Davenport stood at the hard end of a continuum of eugenic thinking, beside so-called negative eugenicists like Madison Grant, who proposed the literal elimination of people he thought inferior.
Though genes were not yet fully understood, Mr. Davenport had something like them in mind when he argued that intelligence was passed on as a single ''unit trait.'' That unit trait could be quantified, in the words of an enthusiastic tester, as ''the value of a man.'' (Mr. Murray made a similar argument in ''The Bell Curve,'' though he has since moved away from I. Q. hereditarianism.)
Mr. Davenport urged Henry H. Goddard, head of research at the Training School for Backward and Feeble-Minded Girls and Boys in Vineland, N.J., to test his charges. Mr. Goddard found the perfect resident, a 22-year-old he called Deborah Kallikak. His results, published in 1912 in the best seller ''The Kallikak Family,'' invented the name Kallikak by joining the Greek ''kalos'' (goodness) and ''kakos'' (badness).
HER forebear, he deduced, had engendered two families: one upstanding, from a legitimate union, and Deborah's degenerate one, from sex with a feebleminded barmaid. Rating Deborah a ''moron,'' Mr. Goddard concluded that she would lack moral judgment and blamed her mental handicap on her ancestry. According to Mr. Goddard, Deborah's degenerate branch counted 36 illegitimate children, 33 sexually immoral persons (mainly prostitutes), 3 epileptics (epilepsy was considered solely hereditary), 82 dead babies, 3 criminals and 8 brothel keepers. How to block the propagation of hereditary social ills? Sterilization.
States had started sterilizing in 1907 to prevent crime, idiocy and imbecility, in the parlance of the day. But some governors vetoed sterilization laws; in other states, courts invalidated the laws as cruel and inhumane, for lack of due process and for lack of equal protection.
Were sterilization to prevail, expert guidance was needed, and Mr. Davenport's Eugenics Record Office supplied it in the form of a model sterilization law devised to withstand court challenge. Virginia passed the first such act in 1924.
The first person slated for sterilization under Virginia's new law was Carrie Buck, the daughter of an unmarried mother living in the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded. Since both mother and daughter had been designated as feebleminded, her sterilization was deemed necessary to halt the propagation of ''the shiftless, ignorant and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South.'' After her sterilization, she lived an otherwise normal adult life.
Along with Ms. Buck, some 65,000 Americans were sterilized before 1968. Virginia repealed its sterilization law in 1974, and in 2002 the state placed a commemorative marker to Buck v. Bell in Ms. Buck's hometown of Charlottesville. The governor issued a formal apology.
Involuntary sterilization is no longer legal, and intelligence is recognized as a complex interplay between biology and environment. Indeed, the 1960s, the era that Mr. Murray blames for the moral failings that have driven poor and middle-class white America apart, was the very same era that stemmed the human rights abuse of involuntary sterilization. (Not coincidentally, it was the same era that began addressing the discrimination that entrenched black poverty as well.)
The stigmatization of poor white families more than a century ago should provide a warning: behaviors that seem to have begun in the 1960s belong to a much longer and more complex history than ideologically driven writers like Mr. Murray would have us believe.

HEADLINE: Mangled Horses, Maimed Jockeys

BYLINE: By WALT BOGDANICH, JOE DRAPE, DARA L. MILES and GRIFFIN PALMER; Rebecca R. Ruiz and Matthew Orr contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
RUIDOSO, N.M. -- At 2:11 p.m., as two ambulances waited with motors running, 10 horses burst from the starting gate at Ruidoso Downs Race Track 6,900 feet up in New Mexico's Sacramento Mountains.
Nineteen seconds later, under a brilliant blue sky, a national champion jockey named Jacky Martin lay sprawled in the furrowed dirt just past the finish line, paralyzed, his neck broken in three places. On the ground next to him, his frightened horse, leg broken and chest heaving, was minutes away from being euthanized on the track.
For finishing fourth on this early September day last year, Jacky Martin got about $60 and possibly a lifetime tethered to a respirator.
The next day, it nearly happened again. At virtually the same spot, another horse broke a front leg, pitching his rider headfirst into the ground. The jockey escaped serious injury, but not the 2-year-old horse, Teller All Gone. He was euthanized, and then dumped near an old toilet in a junkyard a short walk from where he had been sold at auction the previous year. 
In the next 24 hours, two fearful jockeys refused their assigned mounts. The track honored two other riders who had died racing. As doctors fought to save Mr. Martin's life, a sign went up next to the track tote board: ''Hang in there, Jacky. We love you.''
On average, 24 horses die each week at racetracks across America. Many are inexpensive horses racing with little regulatory protection in pursuit of bigger and bigger prizes. These deaths often go unexamined, the bodies shipped to rendering plants and landfills rather than to pathologists who might have discovered why the horses broke down.
In 2008, after a Kentucky Derby horse, Eight Belles, broke two ankles on national television and was euthanized, Congress extracted promises from the racing industry to make its sport safer. While safety measures like bans on anabolic steroids have been enacted, assessing their impact has been difficult because many tracks do not keep accurate accident figures or will not release them.
But an investigation by The New York Times has found that industry practices continue to put animal and rider at risk. A computer analysis of data from more than 150,000 races, along with injury reports, drug test results and interviews, shows an industry still mired in a culture of drugs and lax regulation and a fatal breakdown rate that remains far worse than in most of the world.
If anything, the new economics of racing are making an always-dangerous game even more so. Faced with a steep loss of customers, racetracks have increasingly added casino gambling to their operations, resulting in higher purses but also providing an incentive for trainers to race unfit horses. At Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, the number of dead and injured horses has risen sharply since a casino opened there late last year.
Mr. Martin's injury occurred in a state with the worst safety record for racetracks, a place where most trainers who illegally pump sore horses full of painkillers to mask injury -- and then race them -- are neither fined nor suspended and owners of those drugged horses usually keep their winnings.
The failure of regulators to stop that cheating is reflected in the numbers. Since 2009, records show, trainers at United States tracks have been caught illegally drugging horses 3,800 times, a figure that vastly understates the problem because only a small percentage of horses are actually tested.
In the same period, according to the Times analysis, 6,600 horses broke down or showed signs of injury. Since 2009, the incident rate has not only failed to go down, it has risen slightly.
The greatest number of incidents on a single day -- 23 -- occurred last year on the most celebrated day of racing in America, the running of the Kentucky Derby. One Derby horse fractured a leg, as did a horse in the previous race at Churchill Downs. All told, seven jockeys at other tracks were thrown to the ground after their horses broke down.
A state-by-state survey by The Times shows that about 3,600 horses died racing or training at state-regulated tracks over the last three years.
In one 13-day stretch of racing in 2010 at Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino in New Mexico, nine horses died racing, five were hauled away in ambulances and two jockeys were hospitalized, one in critical condition.
''It's hard to justify how many horses we go through,'' said Dr. Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for the California Racing Board. ''In humans you never see someone snap their leg off running in the Olympics. But you see it in horse racing.''
Even some of America's most prestigious tracks, including Belmont Park, Santa Anita Park and Saratoga Race Course, had incident rates higher than the national average last year, records show.
Why racehorses break down at such a high rate has been debated for years, but the discussion inevitably comes back to drugs.
Laboratories cannot yet detect the newest performance-enhancing drugs, while trainers experiment with anything that might give them an edge, including chemicals that bulk up pigs and cattle before slaughter, cobra venom, Viagra, blood doping agents, stimulants and cancer drugs.
Illegal doping, racing officials say, often occurs on private farms before horses are shipped to the track. Few states can legally test horses there.
''They are pharmacist shops,'' said Dr. George Maylin, the longtime head of New York State's testing laboratory. ''Nobody has any control over what they are doing.''
Even so, legal therapeutic drugs -- pain medicine in particular -- pose the greatest risk to horse and rider. In England, where breakdown rates are half of what they are in the United States, horses may not race on any drugs.
At higher levels, pain medicine can mask injury, rendering prerace examinations less effective. If a horse cannot feel an existing injury, it may run harder than it otherwise would, putting extra stress on the injury. As many as 90 percent of horses that break down had pre-existing injuries, California researchers have found.
''This is just a recipe for disaster,'' said Dr. Tom David, who until this year was chief veterinarian for the Louisiana Racing Commission. ''Inflamed joints, muscles and mild lameness are masked by medication and therefore undetectable to the examining veterinarian.''
While high-profile Triple Crown races get the most attention, the mainstay of racing in America is the lower tier, so-called claiming races. Horses in these races are most vulnerable, in part because regulators often give them less protection from potentially dangerous drugs.
The Times analysis found that horses in claiming races have a 22 percent greater chance of breaking down or showing signs of injury than horses in higher grade races. That lower level of race has been particularly affected by the arrival of casinos.
At Aqueduct, most of the 16 horses that have died so far this year were in the lower ranks, where purses have increased the fastest because of new casino money.
''It's hard to watch these poor animals running for their lives for people who could really care less if they live,'' said Dr. Margaret Ohlinger, a track veterinarian at Finger Lakes Casino and Racetrack in upstate New York. She performs pre-race inspections and treats horses injured in races but is not responsible for their overall care.
Last year at the track, Dr. Ohlinger counted 63 dead horses. That, she said, is more than double the fatalities of five years earlier.
Oversight Undermined
Race officials have always done their best to hide fatal breakdowns, erecting screens around fallen horses and then refusing to disclose the tracks' accident rates.
But amid criticism that individual state racing commissions lacked the will to make the sport safer, and the threat of federal oversight, the industry promised changes, including new restrictions on the use of drugs, a program to accredit racetracks and drug-testing laboratories and uniform rules for punishing drug violators.
The industry also set up a national database where tracks were asked, but not required, to report injuries with the promise of confidentiality.
So far, the response to these reform measures has fallen short.
Fifty-five tracks pledged that they would seek accreditation, requiring among other things prerace inspections and postmortem examinations, or necropsies. Fewer than half have kept their promise.
''Some tracks do not have the money to spend to meet our standards; others think it's window dressing and why bother,'' said Michael Ziegler, executive director of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Safety and Integrity Alliance. ''Any follow-up with tracks has gone unanswered.''
The laboratory accreditation program, introduced in July 2009, has fared even worse. After calling the program an ''unprecedented'' step that ''ultimately will change the face of drug testing in this country,'' a consortium of industry groups that manages it says not a single lab has been accredited.
An association of racing regulators wrote to Congress on May 14, 2010, boasting that with the exception of anti-bleeding medicine, ''race day medications are not allowed.'' Yet records show that in Florida, a major racing state, trainers continue to use corticosteroids, an anti-inflammatory, on race day.
The national repository for injury reports, maintained by the Jockey Club, the most powerful racing industry group, has been more successful, gathering data from 92 percent of the racing days.
''We put it into a database, and we provide tools back to the racetracks where they can analyze and slice and dice the information themselves,'' said James L. Gagliano, president of the Jockey Club, who says the group has encouraged racetracks to make the statistics public. So far, 24 out of 86 tracks have done so.
To assess how often horses get injured, The Times bought data for about 150,000 races from 2009 through 2011, then searched for terms indicating that a horse encountered a physical problem, like ''broke down,'' ''lame'' or ''vanned off.''
Although the people who chronicle the races, known as chart callers, can be stylistically different, they are taught to use standard industry terms, and their descriptions constitute the official record used by gamblers to evaluate horses.
The analysis showed that during those three years the rate of incidents for horses in the United States was 5.2 per 1,000 starts.
By contrast, Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, which year after year has one of the lowest breakdown rates in North America, had an incident rate of only 1.4, according to the Times analysis. ''One of the differences here is medication is not as permissive as it is in the U.S.,'' said Jamie Martin, executive vice president of racing at Woodbine.
According to the analysis, five of the six tracks with the highest incident rates last year were in New Mexico. All are casino tracks, commonly called ''racinos.'' Ruidoso, where Jacky Martin was injured, topped the list in 2011 with 14.1 incidents per 1,000 starts. Ruidoso attributes its incident rate in part to the failure of horses to acclimate quickly to the track's elevation. Some horses that appeared to be injured, track officials said, may have simply needed time ''to catch their breath.''
Yet no accident over the last three years can match what occurred in a single race on Feb. 29, at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races in West Virginia. Eight horses started. Seven fell. One finished. Along the way, seven jockeys were left scattered on the ground.
The next and final race was canceled, not just because it took so long to clear the track, but also because too few jockeys were available or willing to ride.
Drug Violations
It was the day's first race in Hobbs, N.M. The track was fast and the weather clear. Shortly after noon on Oct. 16, 2010, nine young horses were loaded into the starting gate at Zia Park Casino.
With the finish line a mere 400 yards away, this would be an all-out sprint, horse racing's equivalent of a drag race. While these races, run by a breed called quarter horses, lack the ebb-and-flow suspense of a longer thoroughbred race, they make up for it in a pure adrenalin rush. The best quarter horses can hit nearly 50 miles an hour.
Three weeks earlier at Zia Park, Mark Anthony Villa was on the back of a quarter horse when it fell just past the finish line, throwing him to the ground. With a herd of thousand-plus-pound animals bearing down on him, Mr. Villa tried to crawl to safety.
He never made it. A horse's hoof struck him in the head with such force that his helmet shot like a bullet across the track. He died within an instant, leaving a wife and twin children.
For years, track veterans could only speculate as to whether racing quarter horses was more dangerous than racing thoroughbreds. In fact, the Times analysis shows that quarter horses have a nearly 29 percent greater chance of breaking down or showing signs of injury.
With Mr. Villa's death still on the minds of riders and spectators, a gray 2-year-old colt named I Glance at Chicks settled in the 6 hole waiting for the starting bell. For bettors, he was an animal to watch. The horse had won his only race and was trained by Andres Gonzalez, who, according to racing commission records, was not above allowing his horses to race with extra help. Illegal help.
A week earlier, another horse trained by Mr. Gonzalez had raced at Zia Park with 12 times the legal limit of a drug that mimicked steroids. By the end of 2011, Mr. Gonzalez would have amassed a dozen drug violations in just four years. His uncle, Ramon O. Gonzalez Sr., for whom he often worked, had his own lengthy list of violations, including accusations that he drugged 10 horses in just two months.
Whether I Glance at Chicks felt pain as he raced is unknown, but he never challenged for the lead. Shortly after crossing the finish line in fifth place, he broke down. The diagnosis: a bone fracture in his front left leg and ligament damage, injuries from which he could not recover.
A veterinarian, Dr. Clayton McCook, euthanized the colt with an injection of pentobarbital. Afterward, Dr. McCook wrote a note ''to whom it may concern,'' expressing his distress to the authorities over this fatal breakdown and others like it.
''I have had to euthanize several horses due to catastrophic injuries and feel they are occurring in greater numbers than one should expect,'' Dr. McCook wrote. ''I do not pretend to be an expert in racing surfaces, nor in the training of racehorses, but I do know that something appears to be amiss at Zia Park.''
According to an analysis of race records, Zia Park in 2010 had the nation's second-highest incident rate, 13.3. Last year, it ranked fourth with a rate of 11.9. After horse owners complained about the track surface, Zia Park officials said they spent $80,000 resurfacing it before the 2011 racing season.
During the three days that a Times reporter visited Zia Park last November, eight horses collapsed, died or were transported off the track. At the time, track officials said it was company policy not to allow a reporter access to the backside where trainers stable their horses.
Christopher McErlean, vice president of racing at Penn National Gaming, which owns Zia Park, said in a statement that the Times analysis used figures ''produced by nonmedical professionals for the purpose of handicapping feature races.''
Mr. McErlean also said some horses are vanned off as a precaution and may not actually have been injured.
But Zia Park officials said that last year, ''a significant number'' of horses had to be carried off the track because of exhaustion stemming from the possible abuse of a drug that mimics anabolic steroids as well as ''other medication issues.''
Mr. McErlean said Penn Gaming endorses tougher penalties for those who violate drug rules.
Without a postmortem exam of I Glance at Chicks, no determination could be made as to whether a pre-existing condition or some other unknown factor might have played a role in his demise. But tests did reveal that the horse had been dosed with a large load of a powerful painkilling medicine called Flunixin.
In at least two states, 2-year-olds may not race with any Flunixin. Not so in New Mexico, where they can run with up to 50 nanograms of the drug, more than double the amount allowed in a higher class of competition called graded stakes races.
But even that higher amount was not enough for Mr. Gonzalez. I Glance at Chicks carried 282 nanograms of Flunixin.
To put that figure in perspective, Dr. Mary Scollay, chief veterinarian for the Kentucky Racing Commission, said she had never seen such high levels in her state.
''When you look at the history of our medication violations -- Flunixin -- most are under 50 nanograms, 35 nanograms, something like that,'' Dr. Scollay said. In fact, she said she had never seen a violation in Kentucky over 104.
In New Mexico, it is common practice.
Tests on horses in New Mexico showed results over 104 nanograms on 68 occasions since 2009, with some registering 1,000 and even 2,400, records show. The levels are so high that regulatory veterinarians in other states say the horses must have been drugged on race day, a practice that is forbidden.
Before the New Mexico Racing Commission could pass judgment on the overdosing of I Glance at Chicks, another horse trained by Mr. Gonzalez tested positive for even higher levels of Flunixin. The extra dosing did not hurt performance. The horse finished first, and its owner, Mr. Gonzalez's cousin Ramon Gonzalez Jr., got to keep his winnings.
If Andres Gonzalez was worried about how the racing commission viewed his treatment of I Glance at Chicks, he need not have been. Records show he received a warning and nothing more.
Lax Penalties
New Mexico's racing industry -- the tracks and their regulators -- has been unusually slow in responding to the safety alarms.
Four of the state's five racetracks, including Zia Park and Ruidoso, are unaccredited, and the track where Mr. Martin's injury occurred does not report accidents or positive drug tests to groups that monitor such events.
New Mexico also recorded no positive tests in 2010 and 2011 for the most frequently abused pain medicine in racing, phenylbutazone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory commonly known as ''bute.'' After The Times asked why none had been found, the new executive director of the state's racing commission, Vince Mares, said that after researching the question, he discovered that the previous leadership ''had cut back on the tests'' for financial reasons.
Without a national law regulating drugs in racing, New Mexico regulators can be as lenient as they wish in disciplining drug violators.
Trainers in New Mexico who overmedicate horses with Flunixin get a free pass on their first violation, a $200 fine on the second and a $400 fine on the third, records show.
In Indiana, by contrast, winnings are forfeited after the first drug offense. ''If someone who violates the rule thinks the penalties are going to be mild or nonexistent, then breaking the rules is just a cost of doing business,'' said Joe Gorajec, the executive director of the Indiana Horse Racing Commission.
New Mexico gives offenders another break: it wipes away Flunixin violations every 12 months, allowing trainers to again overmedicate horses without penalty. Dozens of huge Flunixin overdoses have resulted in warnings only.
Sometimes the same horse is illegally drugged twice. On May 9, 2009, Runawayslew, a horse trained by Andres Gonzalez, raced with two anti-inflammatory drugs. Nineteen days later, under another trainer, Runawayslew raced on cocaine.
To varying degrees, the picture is similar nationwide. Trainers often face little punishment for drug violations, and on the rare occasions when they are suspended, they are allowed to turn their stables over to an assistant. Since January 2005, 116 trainers have had five or more drug violations, and 10 trainers had 10 or more, records show.
In New Mexico, Cody Kelley, an Albuquerque lawyer who represents people accused of violating racing commission rules, including Andres Gonzalez, said punishments were too arbitrary.
''Are there people that cheat at horse racing in New Mexico? Yes, happens everywhere,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''But I think our commission right now is not equipped to deal with it. What we need are national rules.''
Mr. Mares, the New Mexico racing chief, agrees that his agency needs more uniform penalties to avoid charges of favoritism. ''There is an issue of consistency -- you can quote me on this,'' Mr. Mares said. ''It is being addressed.''
New Mexico recently became the first state to temporarily ban all horses from racing on clenbuterol, a drug that aids respiration, but that has been widely abused because it can build muscle.
In recent years, the state commission has had its embarrassments.
One former investigator faces trial on charges of stealing horses while working at the commission. Another trainer's doping violation was dismissed because the assistant attorney general handling the case neglected to show up in court. And the commission had to drop charges against Ramon O. Gonzalez Sr. for drugging 10 horses because it forgot to file the proper paperwork, according to the state attorney general's office.
Nonetheless, odds are slim that any of the Gonzalezes -- Andres, Ramon Sr. or Ramon Jr. -- will show up at a New Mexico racetrack any time soon. In late January, a federal grand jury in Albuquerque indicted them on charges of participating in a drug trafficking scheme tied to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels. All have pleaded not guilty.
Andres Gonzalez was arrested at Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino in New Mexico. His uncle, Ramon Sr., was arrested while pulling a horse trailer that the authorities said was carrying 26 kilograms of cocaine and 500 pounds of marijuana.
Masking Pain, or Healing It
Breakdowns can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor track surface and jockey mistakes. But drugs, often used to mask existing injuries, are the prime suspect.
''It's not that these medications caused the injuries, but the trainers knew the horses were injured and gave them the meds to get them into the race,'' said Dr. Arthur, the veterinarian for the California Horse Racing Board.
Necropsies are considered essential to determining if an existing injury contributed to a fatal breakdown. However, only 11 states require them, a Times survey found.
In California, where necropsies are required, researchers found that a ''large majority'' of horses had existing problems at the site of their fatal injuries.
''To be fair, some of that is microscopic and may not be readily apparent,'' Dr. Arthur said. ''We're trying to figure out why vets and trainers are not identifying injuries prior to catastrophic injuries.''
But many prior ailments are indeed serious. The Times obtained hundreds of necropsy reports on racehorses that died racing in Pennsylvania and found problems that included ''severe degenerative joint disease,'' ''severe chronic osteoarthritis'' and pneumonia with ''severe, extensive'' lung inflammation. One horse had 50 stomach ulcers. Another had just one eye. Pathologists also found metal screws in two horses that had broken bones from previous accidents.
In the United States, horses are usually allowed to run on some dose of pain medication, usually bute. The question, fiercely debated in the racing community, is at what level do therapeutic drugs make racing unsafe?
Virginia's fatality rate went up after regulators in 2005 raised the allowable level of bute to 5 micrograms from 2 micrograms. ''Our catastrophic incidents increased significantly,'' said Dr. Richard Harden, equine medical director for the state racing commission.
Virginia returned to the lower level in 2009, though the fatality rate has not come down.
Iowa's fatality rate rose by more than 50 percent after the state in 2007 allowed a higher level of bute.
Regulatory veterinarians say the higher allowable levels make it difficult for them to spot lameness and injury during prerace examinations. In one study, researchers at Oklahoma State University said they found bute in most of the horses that died racing or training at Oklahoma tracks in 2010. Six had both bute and Flunixin, a dangerous practice called ''stacking,'' the report said.
The researchers also expressed concern that despite fewer races, a record number of horses died, necessitating a ''careful re-evaluation of track surfaces, medication/enforcement and prerace examinations.''
But prominent owners and trainers, and even some veterinarians, say evidence linking drugs and breakdowns is unconvincing.
Kent H. Stirling, chairman of the national medication committee for the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, said there was ''no scientific evidence whatsoever'' that 5 micrograms of bute on race day is dangerous.
Mr. Stirling and others say sore horses should not be denied therapeutic medicine when needed. ''If you're a horseman and you're trying to keep a horse going and keep him happy and healthy as you can, then these therapeutic medications are very helpful,'' he said.
Regulators typically view prescription drug violations as more benign than the use of banned substances on horses. And they constitute the bulk of the 3,800 violations that The Times found by surveying racing states.
But others, including racing regulators overseas, say horses should not compete on any drug regardless of type.
''Therapeutic drugs, by definition, are used for healing and curing,'' said Arthur B. Hancock III, whose farm produced three Kentucky Derby winners. ''Drugs that mask pain and enhance performance are not 'therapeutic.' They are what they are: performance-enhancing drugs.''
The industry group that runs graded stakes races had promised to ban all therapeutic drugs for 2-year-olds, but in late February backed off, saying it did not have enough time to bring state regulators on board.
George W. Strawbridge Jr., a prominent breeder and owner, resigned from the group over that decision, calling it ''one of the most craven acts'' he had seen.
''How on earth did we get to this sorry state?'' Mr. Strawbridge said. ''The first reason is that in this country there are no significant consequences for doping horses.''
Respecting the Ride
Chris Zamora knows the sensation of riding a sore horse. But one ride in particular stands out.
On Nov. 25, 2008, Mr. Zamora was guiding his horse, Sinful Heart, into the first turn at Zia Park when he sensed something was wrong. ''He didn't want to take the turn,'' he said. ''He was in pain.''
Sinful Heart drifted out, clipped heels with another horse and fell. A trailing horse tripped over them.
Mr. Zamora, the winner of more than 1,000 races, nearly died in the accident, fracturing his skull, pelvis, ribs and four vertebrae. His lungs collapsed, his liver was lacerated and his heart was compressed. ''They had to insert a needle to take the pressure off of my heart,'' he said.
Sinful Heart survived to race three more times, in successively cheaper races, never winning before collapsing and dying on the track at Ruidoso.
Four months after his accident, in March 2009, Mr. Zamora returned to the track. But he had changed. No more cheap horses. ''I tried to ride quality over quantity,'' he said. ''I didn't ride a horse that somebody said was already sore. I scratched more of them at that time than I had in my whole life.''
The best trainers might have been unhappy, he said, but they trusted his judgment and fixed the problem. ''They were great horsemen,'' Mr. Zamora said, offering the ultimate compliment.
But not all were. Now, he said, some trainers just go to another rider. ''These guys will head a horse up until it breaks down completely, and when there's a man on top of them, it's bad,'' he said.
Other injured jockeys tell similar stories. ''I think more should be done for the horse to let him heal naturally than to be getting him to the next race so we can get one more race out of him,'' said Randy Meier, a winner of more than 4,000 races, many in the Chicago area.
Along the way, Mr. Meier broke his neck, collarbones, ribs, shoulder, legs, arms, wrist and sternum and developed a brain bleed.
New Mexico jockeys have been hit particularly hard. Not only was Mr. Villa killed and Mr. Zamora and Mr. Martin critically injured, Juan Campos died in an accident in August 2008; Jimmy Ray Coates fell the same year, his heart stopping twice after breaking his femur, shoulder and collarbone; Carlos Rivas had no pulse en route to the hospital after rupturing his aorta in 2010, and the same year Kelsi Purcell fractured multiple vertebrae in a spill.
There were other injuries as well.
''We've been through this so many times,'' said Terry Meyocks, national manager of the Jockeys' Guild. More than 50 permanently disabled jockeys receive assistance from the Jockeys' Guild, he said.
After Mr. Zamora's accident, Mr. Martin, a friend and hunting partner, had told him not to abandon hope. ''You'll be back,'' he said. ''You're in great shape, it won't be that long. You're not done. You won't be in a walker.''
Like all jockeys, Mr. Zamora knew the risks of riding. ''Every time you do it, you take a chance one is going to break it off. Even with the soundest horse you take a chance.''
Good jockeys can alter their ride if a horse is sore or about to break down. In some cases, though, there are no hints, no warnings. And that is when jockeys face the greatest danger.
Jacky Martin had no warning.
''I thought he was going to die,'' said Adrian A. Ramos, who was riding in the same race. ''He hit the ground hard, real hard. I was behind him and I saw everything.''
A Second Chance
The question almost everyone at the track wanted to ask was why. Why did Mr. Martin, at the top of his game, the winner of a record seven All American Futurities, agree to ride a cheap claiming horse with no victories just three days before he was to ride the favorite in the $2.4 million Futurity?
The favorite did eventually win and would have paid him $120,000, the jockey's standard share. For riding the horse that broke his neck, Mr. Martin took home little more than the cost of a tank of gas.
Until that wrenching moment in the Ruidoso dirt, Mr. Martin at age 56 had been on a redemptive journey to right the wrongs in his life, to help younger jockeys avoid the mistakes he had made and to regain what he had lost: an opportunity to sit atop a racehorse and to coax from it all the power it was willing to give, and nothing more.
For four years, Mr. Martin had been barred from racing after being sentenced to probation in 2006 for poaching deer and possessing less than a gram of methamphetamine. He and his wife, Tracey, also his agent, moved to Louisiana. ''I worked horses every day for three and a half years being a gallop boy,'' Mr. Martin said. ''That's all I was, a $10 gallop boy.''
In the afternoon, Mr. Martin helped to build fences and even a barn, his wife recounted. ''We actually bagged horse manure and sold it and delivered it just to get through,'' she said.
It was a steep fall for a man so highly revered in the sport that Mexican businessmen would send armed guards to escort him to high-stakes races south of the border.
''After a time, he took ownership for the wrong things that he did and worked his way through it,'' Ms. Martin said. Just as important, friends say, he developed an even deeper appreciation for the role others played in racing, from grooms to horse owners struggling to stay in the game.
In the summer of 2010, Mr. Martin was finally cleared to race, and he returned to Ruidoso unsure of how he would be received. When word spread that ''Jacky was back,'' owners were eager to extend a helping hand, but most of all, they were eager to win.
And win he did. With the racing season half over, Mr. Martin stormed into the lead to become the top winner and champion jockey for 2010.
''He was so grateful he got a second chance,'' Ms. Martin said in December. ''He was on the radio saying: 'People out there need to know that they can be forgiven and succeed. If I can fix my screwed up life, you can too.' ''
In Mr. Martin's quest to win an eighth Futurity in 2010, his horse lost by a nose in one of the biggest upsets in the history of that race. But the loss did not diminish the joy he felt competing again.
''It's just a fairy tale for it to turn out the way it has,'' Mr. Martin told a racing publication in 2010.
Mr. Martin fell a year later, on the Friday before Labor Day at the beginning of the final, biggest weekend of racing at Ruidoso. The tens of thousands of spectators, who would later fill the stands and line the distant highway with parked cars, had yet to arrive.
Only a small, quiet crowd, including relatives of riders, trainers and owners, was on hand to watch Mr. Martin go down. One woman screamed because she mistakenly thought her husband had been the one injured.
The authorities did little to determine why Mr. Martin's horse, Phire Power, broke down. The commission said drug tests found no prohibited substances, but the scope of those tests is unclear, including whether the horse was tested for bute. The state also said the horse's body did not undergo any postmortem exam before it was destroyed.
Within minutes, Ms. Martin was escorted onto the track to be with her fallen husband. Over the next six months, she would rarely leave his side.
In two days, Mr. Martin had been scheduled to sign autographs at Ruidoso to raise money for injured jockeys. Instead, other jockeys signed autographs to raise money for him.
Since the accident, Mr. Martin has been in and out of hospitals in three cities. He has suffered through infections, pneumonia, nausea, weight loss, bed sores and other problems. He remains paralyzed, unable to move his arms or legs. He breathes with a respirator.
Meanwhile, the racing community has rallied to his side, sending not only words of support but also money to help defray his mounting health care costs. Ruidoso's owner, R. D. Hubbard, promised $100,000. There have been silent auctions and other fund-raisers. His wife worries that it may not be enough.
Through it all, Mr. Martin refuses to feel sorry for himself.
In December, as he struggled to breathe in a Houston hospital, he told a reporter softly that he had no regrets.
''It's a bad deal,'' he said. ''But if I could do it again, I would be right out there doing it. I ride horses. It's the risk every jockey takes.''
Back home in El Paso, Ms. Martin says her husband derives one of his few pleasures from sitting in his wheelchair next to a window watching horses train silently in the distance.
Mr. Martin's injury deeply affected Mr. Zamora. He was not only losing a friend from the jock's room, the sport was losing a rider, a gentleman, who had come to represent the best it had to offer.
''He rode the best horses in the world, but he was worthy of the best horses in the world,'' Mr. Zamora said. ''He had great hands. He let a runner be a runner instead of going to the whip too early. Them animals loved him, and they ran for him and he understood them. When one didn't want to run, he let 'em not run. He didn't take to the whip. You have to understand them -- that's what makes a great horseman. And he was. He was special.''
Last fall, several weeks after Mr. Martin's spill, Mr. Zamora left the jock's room for the last time.
''I knew I had come so close, and I couldn't deal with that.''
Pain, Up Close
It was the third race at Ruidoso on July 11, 2009.
In the stands, Laura and Armando Alvarado sat with their two grandchildren, ages 11 and 14.
The Alvarados were not racing fans, but this was a vacation -- they had driven up to the mountain resort from El Paso -- and they thought their grandchildren might enjoy watching their first horse race.
Mr. Alvarado took the children down to the rail for a closer look. Ten horses sprinted out of the gate, including a gray Texas-bred quarter horse named Sinful Heart, the same horse that fell several months earlier, nearly killing Chris Zamora.
Just past the finish line, Sinful Heart, with another rider on its back, broke down, collapsing on the track. ''The horse is bleeding!'' one of the children cried out.
The children were not visibly shaken, but Ms. Alvarado said she was sorry they had to witness death at such a close range. After a few more races, they went shopping.
Five days later, a relative with a passion for racing was visiting the Alvarados, and they all went to the track.
''It was going to be an all-day experience, and I thought how nice to have this man give them all this history and details,'' Ms. Alvarado said.
Once again, Mr. Alvarado took the children to the rail to watch the finish of the day's first race.
This time, a horse broke its leg, pitching its rider -- who happened to be Chris Zamora -- into the ground, where rider and animal rolled like tumbleweeds across the finish line.
''It was awful,'' Mr. Alvarado said. Although Mr. Zamora was not seriously injured, the horse was. ''The bone was showing through the skin,'' Mr. Alvarado said.
Both children began to cry. ''I have never seen anything that horrible close up,'' Mr. Alvarado said. ''The kids were terrified.''
The horse was euthanized on the track. The family quickly left the premises. Ms. Alvarado said: ''I told Armando, just drive. We wanted to get out of there.''
Afterward, her granddaughter said, ''I don't want to go to a racetrack ever again.''
Ms. Alvarado wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper.
''For the sake of the animals and children, we felt compelled to let city officials, agencies and others know of this painful experience and urge you to investigate,'' she wrote.
She said she sent copies of the letter to the mayor, the track, its chief veterinarian, the Humane Society and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Ms. Alvarado expected a response.
She never got one, she said.

HEADLINE: 19th-Century Themes, Some Resonant Today

BYLINE: By AILEEN JACOBSON

 BODY:
Stony Brook, N.Y.
AT first glance, an 1839 oil painting, ''Catching Rabbits,'' showing two boys with a dead rabbit and a wooden trap, does not seem to have a political message. Likewise, an 1835 canvas, ''The Sportsman's Last Visit,'' depicting a young woman coquettishly listening to one man as she ignores another in the room, seems to have no agenda beyond an amusing look at a suitor spurned.
Both, however, are part of ''Facing the Issues: William Sidney Mount and Current Events,'' an exhibition at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages that seeks to link paintings by Mount, who lived in Stony Brook and did much of his work here, with the political, economic and social events of his time. Some of them even have relevance today. 
This is one exhibition in which it is important to read the texts on the wall and pay attention to details in the pictures. Some knowledge of American history helps, too.
The exhibition includes a dozen paintings by Mount, copies of four political cartoons from the Library of Congress collection and a portrait of Mount, who was born in Setauket in 1807 and spent time in New York City and on Long Island.
Mount's works are also owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan, and other major museums around the country. The Long Island Museum has the largest collection, thanks to gifts by the philanthropists Ward and Dorothy Melville.
The rabbit painting, according to a wall text, was commissioned by a wealthy member of the Whig Party and ''plays with a much-used political charge made by both parties regarding the vulnerability of new voters: they were merely rabbits, easily trapped.''
There were more new voters because, as many citizens moved from farms to the city during the late 1820s and 1830s, states either loosened or removed property-ownership requirements as a prerequisite for voting, according to Betsy Radecki, the museum's director of education.
Ms. Radecki helped assemble the exhibition and guides several groups of grade-school children through it each week. Democrats, she said, were perceived as more likely than Whigs to attract the ''average guy'' and thus to benefit more from the new voters.
A cartoon next to his rabbit painting picks up the trapping theme. ''The New Era Whig Trap Sprung,'' an 1840 lithograph by Henry R. Robinson, shows President Martin Van Buren trapped in a log cabin. The reference, Ms. Radecki said, was to the ''log cabin and hard cider'' campaign waged by Van Buren's Whig opponent, William Henry Harrison; it portrayed Harrison as a man of humble origin (which was not true).
Though a Democrat, Van Buren was seen as rich and ''a bit of a dandy,'' as Ms. Radecki put it. The cartoon ''parodies Martin Van Buren as a rich guy claiming to be a man of the people,'' she said, adding that the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was sometimes viewed in a similar way.
The painting and cartoon, along with some of Mount's other work, she said, relate to today's events in several ways: ''You can draw parallels, that politics is a nasty business and that we're making fun of the rich and of greed as much now as we did then.''
One of Mount's paintings contains an easily missed reference to greed. His 1850 ''California News'' shows a crowd gathered in a room (probably the Stony Brook post office) listening raptly as one man reads from a newspaper about the gold rush. The wall text directs the viewer to a picture of pigs hung above a door, noting that it was ''probably Mount's comment on those who rushed to California to make their fortunes.''
Mount's own views on political and social issues aren't necessarily reflected in his paintings, Ms. Radecki said, and not all his themes -- like the temperance movement, the population shift from the country to the city and the 1852 presidential election, in which many Whigs voted for a Democrat, Franklin Pierce -- shed light on events of our current era.
''He was in the business of making money as an artist, so he would paint what people told him to paint,'' she said, or what he thought would sell if a painting was not commissioned. He drew idealized, nostalgic views of rural inhabitants in some pieces and mocks them in others, possibly including ''The Sportsman's Last Visit.''
The painting contrasts ''a provincial 'hick' who wears his hat even when indoors,'' the wall text says, with his ''rival, the sophisticated man dressed in urban elegance, who has won the affections of the young lady.'' Mount seems to show a bias, Ms. Radecki said, adding, ''It looks as if he's taking the side of the sophisticated city guy.''
To his credit, she said, Mount differed from many other artists of his day by coming to paint African-Americans as individuals instead of stereotypes.
''School Boys Quarreling,'' painted early in his career, in 1830, contains a stiff, stereotypical rendering of a black boy looking on as white boys fight in a barn, similar to portrayals in an 1848 Nathaniel Currier cartoon hung nearby to demonstrate the demeaning ways black people were often presented.
But in Mount's 1845 ''Dance of the Haymakers,'' a black boy standing by a barn is portrayed more naturalistically, tapping two sticks together. ''He's part of the music, part of the action,'' Ms. Radecki said.
''Facing the Issues: William Sidney Mount and Current Events'' runs through June 17 at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages, 1200 Route 25A, Stony Brook; (631) 751-0066 or longislandmuseum.org.

 COMMENTARY: In ''California News'' (1850), a man reads aloud about the gold rush. The accompanying wall text in the exhibition directs the viewer to a picture of pigs above the door, probably an allusion to those who went to California to make their fortunes.

HEADLINE: A Long Road to Regulating Derivatives

 BODY:
If there is one lesson from the financial crisis that should be indelible, it is that unregulated derivatives are prone to catastrophic failure. And yet, nearly four years after the crash, and nearly two years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank law, the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market is still dominated by a handful of big banks, and regulation is a slow work in progress. 
That means Americans, and the economy, remain at risk. Properly regulated, derivatives -- financial instruments that hedge risk -- help to stabilize the economy. Unregulated, they are all too easily converted into tools for vast speculation, as demonstrated by their role in inflating the real estate bubble, amplifying the bust and provoking the bailouts. Unreformed, they will cause havoc again.
Even if they don't cause a meltdown, unregulated derivatives are still an economic threat. That's because derivatives have become deeply embedded in the economy. Pension systems use them to hedge investment risk. Food companies use them to lock in crop prices. Airlines and manufacturers use them to lock in prices for fuel or metal. But because there is no central exchange where derivatives' prices are listed, no one knows if the prices banks charge are reasonable.
What is known is that the banks make billions of dollars a year on derivatives deals -- lush profits that are surely higher than they would be if the market were transparent and competitive. Overcharging means that bankers are enriched with money that companies could otherwise invest in their businesses and that consumers could otherwise keep in their pockets.
The Dodd-Frank law charged two agencies with writing a broad range of new rules to rein in derivatives -- the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees derivatives linked to oil, crops and other commodities, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees securities-based derivatives. There has been progress. The C.F.T.C, in particular, has moved ahead with sound rules to create competition, promote safety, increase transparency and tame speculation. But some of the toughest rules are languishing -- like the crucial Dodd-Frank requirement that most derivatives be traded on an open exchange, with prices visible before deals are made.
That would minimize the practice of trading derivatives as private bilateral contracts, in which the price is whatever the bank says it is. Over a year ago, the C.F.T.C. sensibly proposed a system in which buy and sell offers would be electronically posted and widely accessible. In response, industry lobbyists and some lawmakers have made the absurd argument that open trading would hurt banks' flexibility to continue doing business as usual.
Unfortunately, in today's political environment, even absurd arguments have the power to delay or derail vital reforms. Republican lawmakers, with some Democratic support, have proposed legislation to roll back the rules on open trading even before regulators have finalized them. Rules that have been finalized are increasingly subject to protracted legal challenges by the financial industry. And regulators are routinely reduced to pleading with Congressional appropriators for chump change to carry out their duties.
It is up to President Obama, who takes credit on the campaign trail for reforming Wall Street, to provide full-throated support for implementing and enforcing the Dodd-Frank rules. Otherwise the law will be a reform in name only.

HEADLINE: The Diaper-Changing Index

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE

 BODY:
Once during a disagreement with my husband, I complained that he wasn't helping enough with our daughter, and I gave him a long list of the parenting chores I was shouldering on my own. ''But you like doing all that stuff,'' he blurted in his defense. I don't recall how the conversation ended (probably badly), but I thought of it while reading a new study about the more mundane responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 181 heterosexual college professors who had children 2 or younger to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the pleasure they experienced from child care. 
On 16 out of 25 child-care tasks -- like changing diapers, taking a child to the doctor or getting up in the middle of a night to attend to a child -- women reported statistically significant higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. Over all, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's.
Is it really true that women end up shouldering more of the parenting burden simply because they like it more -- or at least dislike it less? Steven Rhoads, a University of Virginia political-science professor and the study's lead author, surmised that some women may have inflated their enjoyment scores because of feelings of guilt or cultural pressure. But he also said some research suggests that a woman's parenting skills are deeply rooted in biology. Women with high levels of testosterone, for instance, often show less interest in babies, while a father's testosterone levels are known to drop when a new baby arrives, ostensibly a biological mechanism to encourage bonding with the infant.
Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did. In Sweden, where family leave for both parents is particularly generous, men use about 20 percent of the 480-day benefit. Women use nearly all of it.
It's difficult to untangle how cultural and economic pressures or biological hard-wiring influence parenting. Plenty of men change diapers, and studies show that mothers and fathers alike spend more time with their children than they used to. Men have more than doubled the time they spend on child care since 1985. Yet women still spend twice as much time with the kids as men, says the University of Maryland sociologist John Robinson, who oversees the Americans' Use of Time project.
Notably in Rhoads's study, the two parenting activities that gave men the most pleasure (and women, too) were playing and talking with their kids. But when men were asked to rate how often they actually did those things, their scores were about 10 and 40 percent lower, respectively, than women's. In the end, perhaps the issue is not that mothers are overburdened by their children -- my husband was right when he said I liked being a mom -- but that men, for all their progress as fathers, are still missing out.

HEADLINE: Call It The Age Of the Shadow Bank Run

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
I RECENTLY asked a group of colleagues -- and myself -- to identify the single most important development to emerge from America's financial crisis. Most of us had a common answer: The age of the bank run has returned.
Since the end of World War II, economists have generally thought that runs on banks were dead, at least as a phenomenon in advanced nations. In the United States, for example, bank deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and, as a last resort, the Federal Reserve can back deposits by printing money. 
The new complication is that bank deposits are no longer the dominant form of modern short-term finance. The modern bank run means a rush to withdraw from money market funds, the disappearance of reliable collateral for overnight loans between banks or the sudden pulling of short-term credit to a troubled financial institution. But these new versions are in some ways still similar to the old: both reflect the desire to pull money out of an endeavor -- and to be the first out the door. And both can set off a crash.
These newer forms occur in the so-called shadow banking system, involving short-term financial credit not guaranteed by the deposit insurance umbrella. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, shadow banking accounts for about $15 trillion in assets -- more than the traditional banking system. But as recently as 1990, the shadow-banking total was much lower, at less than $4 trillion. The core problem is that the growth of short-term credit has been outracing our ability to protect it, and since 2008 most investors have realized that these shadow-banking transactions are not risk-free.
On top of this problem is the market for derivatives. The quantity of open derivatives amounts to trillions, and these positions are another source of short-term credit risk. So a need for sudden payouts could also prompt a run on a financial institution.
It now seems that the 21st century will resemble the 19th and early 20th centuries, with periodic panics and runs on financial institutions, perhaps followed by deflationary collapses. In the euro zone, these problems have plagued banks and entire countries, like Greece and Portugal. The ''country as bank'' is a new and not entirely reassuring catch phrase, and it shows that the problem goes beyond the private sector.
If a central bank is deft enough, it can avoid deflation by using loans and monetary policy to guarantee the liabilities of run-prone institutions. That worked reasonably well in 2008, but in the long term such a policy sets up the system for even more danger, by subsidizing bank risk-taking and precarious financial structures.
Another problem is that ending those central bank guarantees isn't always easy. The European Central Bank has stemmed a financial collapse for now, but only by lending large amounts to banks at 1 percent for a three-year window. And yet the euro zone has entered a recession, so it's unclear when troubled European banks can return to private capital markets. The central bank may end up taking over much of the allocation of capital.
The arrangement also assumes that economic growth will pick up fairly quickly in the euro zone -- hardly a certainty. And there is little market discipline to force European banks to clean up their balance sheets or to exercise caution for the future. So the system remains extremely vulnerable.
Another feature of this new order is that more and more financial transactions will be collateralized with the safest securities possible: United States Treasuries. Demand for them will remain high, and low borrowing costs will ease our fiscal problems. Still, the resulting low rates of return serve as a tax on safe savings, encourage a risky quest for yield and redistribute resources to government borrowing and spending. It isn't healthy for the private sector when investors are so obsessed with holding wealth in the form of safe governmental guarantees.
THIS entire package of problems seems to be part of ''the new normal'' -- it's not going away anytime soon.
Some economists, like Ricardo J. Caballero of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , have called for extending governmental guarantees well beyond traditional bank deposits. That would check the problem, but at what cost? In a larger financial crisis based on insolvency, our government would face intolerable financial burdens, as happened in Ireland when its government guaranteed bank debts.
A broader government guarantee would also spread the moral-hazard problem to an even larger class of financial transactions, raising the odds that the guarantee will someday have to be paid out. In any case, bailouts for creditors are already politically unpopular, and are unlikely to be expanded.
In short, no promising financial path is before us. It's good that the American economy seems to be recovering, and this may shove some problems into the future. But banking and finance remain a mess at their core. Welcome to the 21st century.

HEADLINE: How Much Was That Treatment?

 BODY:
Analysts are finding huge disparities in the amounts that private insurance plans pay for common medical procedures. This goes largely undetected by patients and their doctors because hospitals and private insurance plans treat their negotiated prices as confidential. 
Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund have analyzed data from the small number of states that require public disclosure. In New Hampshire, they found a threefold to fourfold spread in what the biggest health insurers pay for the same procedure performed at different hospitals. They also found substantial variation in what different insurers pay for the same procedure at the same hospital. One big health plan paid $2,300 for a colonoscopy at a particular hospital, while another paid $3,100; one plan paid $1,400 for magnetic resonance imaging of the back, while another paid $2,300.
There is no evidence, as yet, in New Hampshire that disclosure has reduced the variation in prices or caused many patients or doctors to change their choice of hospitals. That could be because disclosure has only just started, the information is often difficult to extract, and many patients may equate higher prices with better quality care or don't care about price because they are well insured.
Meanwhile, an annual survey by the International Federation of Health Plans found that the prices paid in the United States in 2011 were far higher than the prices paid in other advanced countries, and that within this country the amounts paid for services varied greatly.
The American numbers were derived from a commercial database of transactions between 100 health plans and thousands of providers from all 50 states. Among the disparities: the bottom 25 percent of prices for a day in the hospital were $1,450 or less, and the top 5 percent were more than $11,500. For routine doctor visits, those numbers were $64 and $162.
The gaps may reflect differences in economic conditions around the country as well as differences in the bargaining power of hospitals and insurance plans. In some markets, dominant hospitals and physician groups that all insurance plans feel they must include in their networks to attract customers can drive up prices. That problem will only get worse as hospital consolidations expand.

HEADLINE: Hiring The Blind, While Making A Green Statement

BYLINE: By NICOLE LAPORTE

 BODY:
WHEN Chris Yura, chief executive of the apparel company SustainU, was looking for a factory to produce 24,000 T-shirts, it was important that it be within 200 miles of where the fabric was made.
SustainU, based in Morgantown, W.Va., uses all-recycled materials to make clothing for colleges and universities. As its name indicates, it is committed to ''social, economic and environmental sustainability,'' Mr. Yura says. Lighter transportation demands would mean more environmental benefits and a faster turnaround time, not to mention reduced shipping costs.
The company found a factory in Winston-Salem, N.C., that seemed a logical choice. But it was no ordinary factory. Owned and operated by Winston-Salem Industries for the Blind, the factory has a work force that is blind or otherwise visually impaired. 
To many, this may have been a deterrent, or at least raised doubts. ''Even though you have the Americans With Disabilities Act, it's still a challenge because people who are not familiar with the blind have misperceptions about what they can or can't do, and it affects their decision to give people a chance,'' said Kevin A. Lynch, chief executive of the nonprofit National Industries for the Blind.
The unemployment rate for blind adults of working age is nearly 70 percent -- a number that has been stagnant for 30 years, Mr. Lynch said.
There may be a notion that hiring blind workers -- or any disabled worker, for that matter -- means spending more time, money and resources on training and equipment. But Mr. Yura said he found that there ultimately was no difference in either cost or quality between working with the Winston-Salem agency, an affiliate of the national group, and any other domestic manufacturer.
When blind people contact the agency, they often have very little work experience. They are trained to complete specific tasks and are set up with adaptive equipment to help them do their jobs. If they are making eyeglass lenses, for example, audio alerts let them know when the lenses have spent enough time in a fining, or polishing, machine. Or if they are assembling parachutes, tactile measurement guides, in the form of long wooden rails, help make sure that the lengths of ropes are all equal.
The training offers practical skills and an opportunity for upward mobility through certification classes. Workers with no experience receive minimum wage, while those with some experience are paid in line with workers doing similar jobs at other area factories, said Jeanne Wilkinson, vice president for business strategies at the Winston-Salem agency.
Anastasia Powell, a mother of three daughters who has been with the agency seven years, works in the factory's T-shirt unit. Her job is to sew together shoulder seams. She received four months of training, and her sewing machine is specifically designed for her. A four- to six-inch metal strip is attached to the machine's foot -- where the needle contacts the fabric -- to help line up the material.
''I gather my material at the corner, under my foot-- the foot secures the material -- and line up the guide,'' Ms. Powell said. ''The guide helps me make sure the seam is straight, and helps me cut off an accurate amount of material. After that, I complete the process on the second side of the shirt and send it over to the next operation.''
Ms. Powell, who has been completely blind since the age of 21, called the alteration to her machine ''very minor.''
''The only difference between me and a sighted person is just that four- to six-inch strip of metal,'' she said. ''Nothing else had to be added.''
THE federal government has long known about the effectiveness of a blind work force. The National Industries for the Blind was established in 1938 as a result of a law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that required federal agencies to buy supplies made by blind workers.
Ever since, the group and its agencies have been making products as varied as brooms and mattresses for the government and military. (In addition to clothing, the Winston-Salem agency produces eyeglasses for veterans and parachutes for soldiers in Afghanistan.)
But with the gradual withdrawal of American forces from war zones and the overall downsizing of the military, the national group hoped to do more business with private-sector companies in the future, Mr. Lynch said.
''I think there's a growing interest out there in the general public for social responsibility, and I think that's translating over to corporate responsibility,'' he said. ''There is also a real interest for things made in America.''
Showing that high-quality products can be made in America by people who are blind is a major selling point, he said.
Mr. Yura, who is already lining up another job with the Winston-Salem agency, is happy to endorse this message. And as for how those 24,000 T-shirts turned out? ''You would never know whether the person who made the garment had full vision capability or not. It all looks the same. It's the same product at the end of the day.''

HEADLINE: The Outsourced Party

BYLINE: By KEVIN BAKER. 
Kevin Baker is the author of the ''City of Fire'' series of historical novels, ''Dreamland,'' ''Paradise Alley'' and ''Strivers Row.'' This is a shortened version of an essay that appears in full at nytimes.com/campaignstops.

 BODY:
Who speaks for the Republican Party? The answer is that everyone does -- and therefore, no one does.
What accounts for the division, rancor and lethargy that have beset the party's nominating campaign? It's no great mystery. Republicans have fallen prey to one of the favorite tactics of the heedless, improvident, 21st-century-style capitalism they revere. Their party has been outsourced.
For decades, Republicans have recruited outside groups and individuals to amplify their party's message and its influence. They have carried this off brilliantly, helping to shift the political spectrum in the United States significantly to the right.
When Republicans came to believe in the 1960s that they were up against a ''liberal biased'' media that would never give them a fair shake, they began the long march to build their own information establishment and to make it predominant. 
In 1987, Mark Fowler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, persuaded his fellow commissioners to abolish the Fairness Doctrine. Since 1949, the commission had required television and radio stations to ''devote a reasonable amount of time'' to public issues and to present different viewpoints on said issues. But Mr. Fowler insisted that television was not a finite and supremely influential broadcast medium but ''just another appliance -- it's a toaster with pictures.'' He was backed by a pair of Reagan appointees on the federal bench, Robert H. Bork and Antonin Scalia, and the president himself, who vetoed a Democratic effort to codify the doctrine into law.
Right-wing radio was already prevalent on the airwaves before the Fairness Doctrine was abolished. But now it had the field virtually to itself. Conservatives gained a direct outreach to the public, free of any intercession by the ''elites'' Newt Gingrich is still denouncing. Right-leaning media networks like Clear Channel Communications became major media conglomerates -- with no obligation to broadcast any conflicting views.
The biggest media coup of all for the Republican Party, though, was the advent of nakedly partisan Fox News, created by Roger Ailes, a leading Republican media adviser. Mr. Ailes thereby managed to throw the weight of Rupert Murdoch's worldwide media empire behind the party. Conservative politicians and advocates saw both their ideas amplified and their wallets fattened by a dizzying array of Murdoch television shows, books and newspapers.
But it wasn't just in the daily media where the Republican Party proved ingenious in outsourcing its rhetoric and shifting the national dialogue. In 1971, Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Republican corporate lawyer soon to be appointed to the Supreme Court by Richard M. Nixon, summoned the business community to the cause with his famous memorandum, ''Attack on American Free Enterprise System.'' Mr. Powell wanted business to fight back against what he saw as the many enemies of free enterprise, and his call to arms inspired the founding of the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Manhattan Institute and other think tanks. Wealthy, right-wing individuals from Richard Mellon Scaife to the Koch brothers poured millions of dollars into the battle of ideas.
The Powell memorandum also sent a vast influx of lobbyists to Washington, increasing their numbers from, at most, a few hundred in 1971 to tens of thousands today -- a great majority interested in ''freeing'' business from regulation and taxes.
Conservative policy institutes armed the party's candidates with intellectual arguments, while the conservative media barrage blasted a way through to high office for even the most lackluster Republican nominees. Yet this meant that the Republican Party was outsourcing body and soul. Both what the party believed in and the heavy lifting of campaigns was handed over to outside interests that did not necessarily share the party's wider goals.
This has become suddenly and painfully evident this year. Party leaders may not have liked Rush Limbaugh's calling a Georgetown law student a ''slut'' and a ''prostitute'' for daring to disagree with him on birth control -- but what does he care? A Republican loss will most likely mean more angry conservatives tuning in and driving up ratings. The most that the garrulous Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, would allow himself to say about the controversy was that ''it's not the language I would have used,'' while Rick Santorum averred that Mr. Limbaugh was ''being absurd'' but implied that it was O.K. -- ''he's in a very different business than I am.''
But he's not. Mr. Limbaugh is in the very same business that Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney are in -- and guess who's in charge? It's not just that the radio calamity howlers have cowed the party leaders -- it's that they've remade them in their own image. The leading Republican candidates for president have adopted the bombastic, apocalyptic rhetoric of talk radio, insisting that we will ''lose America'' if they aren't elected and filling their speeches and debates with personal insults. The results are in the poll numbers, as the campaign has steadily driven down the party's appeal, driving up the candidates' negative ratings.
Poll numbers for Republicans in Congress have taken a nose dive, too, thanks to the party's intransigence on Capitol Hill. But what does that matter to the thousands of lobbyists who provide more and more of the money for Congressional campaigns? Sure, a Republican victory might afford them more closed-door sessions on rewriting federal regulations. But Democratic victories will serve their purpose, too, affirming their never-ending fight against ''job-killing regulations.''
Meanwhile, Fox News has become a special impediment to Republican order. All the enticements of the Murdoch empire have produced a generation of reality show pols, at least as interested in landing their own TV series as winning office.
Two of the most popular Republican candidates for president going into the race, Mike Huckabee and Sarah Palin, declined to run rather than jeopardize their shows. Newt Gingrich turned much of his campaign into book tours for himself and his wife. Ask yourself which was most likely: that Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann thought they could be elected president or that they were looking to improve their ''brand.''
AND after decades of trying to undo federal campaign-finance laws, Republicans at last succeeded -- only to watch the rise of the super PAC in their place. Rick Santorum's candidacy has been kept alive largely by Foster Friess, the conservative Christian multimillionaire with the Batman villain name. Mr. Gingrich has his own sponsors, the casino billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, hawkish supporters of Israel. Does what these individuals care about most fit in with the Republican Party's election strategy? So what?
Yet participating in a democracy means more than simply insisting, over and over again, in as loud and arrogant a voice as possible, in as many venues as your money will allow, on what it is that you want. It means listening, it means convincing, it means compromising -- all those skills that political parties and their leaders used to be fairly good at, and that political campaigns taught them to be good at. But that doesn't much matter to candidates who owe their first loyalty to one or two wealthy sponsors.
Thanks to their inventiveness, Republicans have stumbled into the brave new world of American politics. They have achieved the political equivalent of shuttering that foul old steel mill and shipping the hard work off for others to do while they dabble in these fascinating new derivatives. But now their candidates and their ideas are seen as so many junk bonds, and they don't seem to have the wherewithal to make the party over from within.
Republicans seem to be finally coalescing around Mitt Romney's candidacy, and he could well win the presidency if the economy slumps again. But the longer-term problem will remain: how to maintain a coherent, mass political party when so many individuals are empowered as never before to redirect it to their own, personal ends.

HEADLINE: The End Of an Era In Indiana

BYLINE: By CRAIG FEHRMAN

 BODY:
ANDERSON, Ind. -- At its peak, the Wigwam attracted 5,000 season-ticket holders to Anderson High School boys' basketball games. The teams and the crowds measured up to the gym's 8,996-seat capacity. That made the Wigwam the second-biggest high school gym in America, but Anderson athletic directors still found themselves testifying in divorce hearings over the custody of season tickets.
Gradually, though, the enthusiasm diminished. Last season, about 450 season tickets were sold. Given the struggling economy of this city, which has lost many of its manufacturing jobs and residents, the Wigwam's expense could not be justified, and it closed last summer.
''We're getting better and better players,'' said John Harrell, who worked for 40 years on the sports desk of The Herald-Times in Bloomington and now runs Web sites about boys' and girls' basketball in Indiana. ''But the interest has really leveled off. And it's not going to go back up.'' 
Indiana still boasts 12 of the nation's 13 largest high school gyms. That is one reason people continue to romanticize the state's relationship to basketball. Another is the season-ending state tournament. For decades, all Indiana schools competed in one bracket. The possibility of upsets like Milan's against the much larger Muncie Central to win the 1954 state title -- fictionalized in the movie ''Hoosiers'' -- helped the tournament draw 1.5 million spectators in 1965. By the early '90s, attendance was down to 750,000.
In 1997, the teams were divided into four classes based on enrollment. Old-timers, and at least one state legislator, still smart over the switch to ''class basketball.''
Other cultural changes in Indiana, however, seem to have had a great effect, including the growing popularity of high school football, which has doubled its attendance over the past 20 years.
More subtle shifts have chipped away at basketball's student cheering sections. Many boys and girls play other sports, some of them year round. And nonathletes often work after-school jobs.
Adults here have also turned elsewhere for entertainment. In the early 1980s, the Anderson High Indians could outdraw the Indiana Pacers, and the Colts were still based in Baltimore. Now fans keep up with the professional franchises in addition to Indiana's college teams.
This season, for the first time in 50 years, the Indians did not play in the Wigwam. They moved into a refurbished gym that holds 2,800, the smallest capacity in their North Central Conference, and finished the season 9-13. But a recent visit here revealed that the heart of Indiana basketball still beats.
''If we could reopen the Wigwam, I'd lead the charge,'' said Joe Nadaline, a longtime Anderson boys' basketball assistant who just completed his first season as the head coach with a first-round loss in the state tournament. ''But we also need to build a new tradition.''
Shrinking Schools
Anderson, 40 miles northeast of Indianapolis, got its start in manufacturing when natural gas was discovered there in the 1890s. The city grew rapidly, adding downtown businesses, a four-story brick high school and, in 1925, the first Wigwam, which held 4,800 fans. Anderson's center also included tightly packed subdivisions and the First Baptist Church, which had one of the state's most vibrant youth groups and needed to use the Wigwam's parking lot on Sundays.
Anderson's population peaked at 70,000 in the 1970s, when General Motors operated more than 20 factories and employed one of every three Anderson adults. The city's three high schools -- Anderson, Madison Heights and Highland -- each topped 2,000 in enrollment, and all three of their boys' basketball teams regularly ranked in the state's top 10.
After graduation, students knew they could land a factory job, work for 30 years, then retire with a pension and benefits. During the 1970s energy crisis, Anderson made headlines for its 22 percent unemployment rate. The city that had once staggered its factory shifts now staggered registration times at its unemployment office.
Those jobs never came back, and G.M. left for good in 1999. Today, one cannot travel far in Anderson without spotting an abandoned factory or a shuttered school, and their closings are related.
''We have empty houses all over,'' says Roger Hensley, a volunteer at the local historical society. ''The young people, those who could afford to, have left.''
The First Baptist Church has moved to a smaller building on the edge of town. The area around the Wigwam is blighted by closed businesses and boarded-up homes.
As Anderson's population fell, to 56,129 in the 2010 census, schools were consolidated. In 1997, the aging Anderson High was an obvious cut. Less obvious -- to Madison Heights supporters, at least -- was the decision to rename their school Anderson and to preserve the Indians' identity.
Madison Heights alumni erected a gravestone memorial on the school grounds. Still, their reaction was nothing like the anger over the 2010 decision to turn Highland into a middle school. Many Highland parents refused to send their children to Anderson, the only remaining high school, which had a 57 percent graduation rate.
In the last three years, the city has lost more than 2,000 students and laid off more than 160 teachers, in addition to closing five schools. Several basketball players who live in Anderson now drive to (and start for) neighboring high schools.
The school board, which rejected the idea of closing the Wigwam in 2009, reversed that decision last March. About 200 people attended an emotional three-hour meeting in which Felix Chow, the new schools superintendent, gave a PowerPoint presentation on the costs associated with the Wigwam, including $2.65 million in needed repairs.
''The closing of the Wigwam was a financial consideration caused by the loss of students and residents in Anderson,'' said Chow, who would rather talk about Anderson's graduation rate, which improved to 71 percent in 2011.
But a few in Anderson still want to talk about the Wigwam.
Ron Hecklinski, who won 274 games and 5 sectionals in 18 seasons as the boys' head coach at Anderson, kept his promise to resign before coaching ''in some dinky little gym.'' He kept his word and became the team's radio announcer this season.
''Superintendent Chow wasn't from Anderson, and he didn't understand athletics,'' Hecklinski said. ''He just saw the bottom line.''
The Anderson basketball program retained enough mystique into the early 1990s that it attracted more than 60 applicants for its head coaching vacancy, including 12 college assistants (Hecklinski was one) and a college head coach. It is hard to convey that desire to current players.
''We can tell them and show them tapes,'' Nadaline, the current coach, said, ''but they can't understand it because they've never seen it. These kids have never been alive when the Wigwam was full.''
The Indians' final game last winter drew the largest crowd in years. It was a few days before the board's vote, and fans sensed that the end was near. Attendance for the victory against Bishop Chatard of Indianapolis was about 3,000.
Before the game, Hecklinski told the crowd, ''The Wigwam is Anderson.''
Basketball Showplaces
Although it can take a while for someone at Anderson High to track down the keys, the Wigwam is in better shape than many gyms still in use. It is quite impressive, even with its hydraulic goals wheeled into a corner and its bleachers retracted. The amenities include a weight room, a trainer's room and a video room. In the visitors' locker room, a white board still bears Bishop Chatard's game plan.
The Wigwam derived its power from its dimensions. After the first structure burned down in 1958, Anderson built a bigger and better Wigwam, with seven 250-foot roof beams and an 80,000-tile mosaic of an American Indian chief on the Gate 1 exterior. Opened in 1961 at a cost of $2.1 million, it included two tiers of bleachers. Anderson soon added more retractable bleachers on the Broadway-size stage.
Every seat mattered, because the biggest gyms host the sectionals and regionals during the state tournament, which began in 1911. Although some schools stayed in smaller gyms -- Milan's held only 1,000 fans -- far more built lavish structures.
In the 1920s, Muncie's city council approved $100,000 to build a high school gym -- during the same meeting it denied a request for a $1,800-per-year librarian. The Muncie Central Bearcats still play in their field house, but at 6,000-plus seats it does not rank among Indiana's 10 biggest high school gyms.
In 1959, New Castle, another member of the North Central Conference, opened a 9,325-seat gym -- and stole Muncie's role in hosting sectionals. The city had neglected a bigger gym in its plans for a new high school, so fans created a nonprofit and raised the money themselves.
In the early '80s, Nadaline, the Anderson coach, played for New Castle alongside Steve Alford, a future Indiana University star. The school would sell a total of 20,000 tickets for Friday and Saturday games.
''The whole conference was like that,'' Nadaline said. ''I didn't appreciate it then, but I appreciate it now.''
But no atmosphere was better than that of Wigwam, which combined sellout crowds with elaborate traditions, including a pregame dance by a boy and a girl in Indian dress. Nadaline remembered one Anderson game from Alford's senior season. With five seconds left and New Castle down by 1, Alford was fouled as he drove to the basket. A 94.4 percent free-throw shooter, he missed two from the line, and the next day's newspaper proclaimed, ''AHS Wins as Alford Chokes.''
The North Central Conference no longer harbors such intensity. This year, Muncie Central's declining enrollment forced it to drop to 3A from 4A, the largest classification, and each school draws smaller crowds, from about 4,000 per game at Kokomo, which played in last year's 4A title game, to about 500 at Huntington North. The other schools do not anticipate closing their big gyms, but their cities are struggling.
''Our conference was a manufacturing conference,'' Nadaline said.
Football Fridays
The stretch of cornfields and farmhouses that separates Anderson and Indianapolis shrinks every year. About halfway between them sits Hamilton Southeastern High School. It serves the suburban city of Fishers, a destination for people who left Anderson. Fishers is growing so fast, Hamilton Southeastern and Fishers High Schools, which opened in 2006, are pushing their 2,500-student limits.
Hamilton Southeastern has Indiana's top-ranked 4A basketball team and its best player, Gary Harris. It plays home games in a basic gym that holds 2,500 fans. Athletic Director Jim Self said the team's success had increased average attendance to about 1,500. But he marveled at the North Central Conference.
''Muncie Central fans came in force,'' he said of the schools' January matchup. ''We don't have that tradition here.''
What the city does have is high school football. The annual Fishers-Hamilton Southeastern game draws as many as 10,000 fans, forcing the schools to erect temporary bleachers.
''It's the place to be on Friday night,'' Self said. ''It's the way the school year starts.''
Longing for the Past
This year Mike Delph, a state senator, proposed legislation that would require the Indiana High School Athletic Association to bring back the old state basketball tournament setup.
''We lost part of our state identity when we went away from the single-class tournament,'' Delph said. ''You could put five guys and one good coach out there and, through hard work and team work, shock the world.''
Such upsets rarely occurred. At the Wigwam, Anderson's three high schools won sectionals for 22 consecutive years. But the association agreed to hold town hall meetings on the format after this year's tournament.
Bobby Cox, the association's president, said he was ''kind of surprised it came up at this point.'' He surveyed the members in 2000 and 2006, and each time more than 85 percent affirmed the current system.
At Hamilton Southeastern, Self said, not even the football team gets radio broadcasts or sells reserved season tickets. Still, the school's athletics keep improving. On Feb. 9, the basketball team beat third-ranked Carmel in a thrilling game.
''We were happy to have 1,800 fans,'' Self said. ''But part of us was like, 'Why isn't this a sellout?' ''
Turning the Page
On the same night Hamilton Southeastern defeated Carmel, Anderson hosted Muncie Central. It was the first time the rivals had played at Anderson's new gym, which looked markedly different from its days as the home of the Madison Heights Pirates.
Anderson added new concession windows, a new scoreboard and new energy-efficient lights. A red-and-green stripe was painted on the white walls and the large tile Pirate logo was covered with an American flag.
In some ways, it was all a big step up from the Wigwam, where the entire row of news media worked off one power strip. (One short would bring down the radio broadcast.) The players no longer have to drive three miles to the gym, which means practices can start earlier. And the band no longer needs a trailer to transport its instruments.
During halftime, some longtime supporters discussed the Indians' move. The oldest fans called the 1961 Wigwam ''the new Wigwam,'' and they expressed frustration. But others seemed more resigned.
''Believe me, I'd rather be at the Wigwam,'' said Joe Bonisa, president of Anderson's boosters club. ''But I'm not there for the gym -- I'm there for the kids.''
Anderson almost upset Muncie in a spirited game. But, as a new coach, Nadaline remains focused on the future. Nadaline, who spent 12 years as Hecklinski's assistant, used the move from the Wigwam as an opportunity to rebrand his team.
''It's P.R.,'' he said. ''I've got to sell my program.''
After the annual red-green scrimmage, he sent his players into the stands to shake hands. Anderson also held its first ''select-a-seat night.'' With the lights up and the new sound system humming, fans could assure themselves that their views of the court would not be so different.
The strategy seemed to work: the team averaged about 1,000 fans per game.
''For us, right now, it's a great little atmosphere,'' Nadaline said. ''The Wigwam wasn't a great place to play when there were 1,000 people.''
His players agree. Trey Boyd, a 6-foot-4 junior who is Anderson's tallest starter, said the new gym ''seems louder.''
''I'm a basketball player,'' he added. ''Anywhere I can play, I play.''
The Indians are losing only one senior, and they will be more comfortable with Nadaline's system next season. He also plans to take advantage of Anderson's status as a one-high-school town by installing his system with grade school teams and asking his players to coach some games. In other words, do more public relations.
''I'm 46,'' Nadaline said, leaning back in his chair. ''I'm not going to be setting any coaching records. This is going to take some time.''

HEADLINE: Both Coasts Watch Closely As San Francisco Faces Erosion

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The explosive waves of Ocean Beach, a 3.5-mile stretch separating the city from the gray edge of the Pacific Ocean, have long been a draw for tourists, local families and an international tribe of surfers.
But every few years, stormy surf driven by the weather pattern known as El Nino grinds away at a thinning section of beach, pulling sand out to sea. Some comes back, but two years ago, bluffs collapsed and massive amounts of sand disappeared for good.
Holding back the sea here seems as impossible as holding back the fog. But planners see Ocean Beach as a top priority in a long roster of Bay Area sites threatened by inundation because of what lies on its landward side: the Great Highway, a $220 million wastewater treatment plant and a 14-foot-wide underground pipe that keeps sewage-tainted storm water away from the ocean.
The question facing at least eight local, state and federal agencies boils down to this: With California officials expectingclimate change to raise sea levels here by 14 inches by 2050, should herculean efforts be made to preserve the beach, the pipe and the plant, or should the community simply bow to nature? 
''We are in some ways the tip of the spear for this issue,'' said Benjamin Grant, a city planner who is leading a study of the problem for the nonprofit San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, or SPUR.
Mr. Grant describes the beach's south end as ''an erosion hot spot.'' But, he said, all coastal communities will have to grapple with rising seas.
A disruptive rate of sea-level rise is one of the most daunting potential consequences of climate change. Recently, researchers warned in two new studies that severe coastal flooding could occur regularly in the United States by the middle of the century and that California would be among the states most affected. Previous studies have suggested that the rise in sea levels is poised to accelerate globally, although the evidence that this is happening is not yet definitive.
''Communities will be forced to respond in one way or another to the increased erosion and coastal storm damage,'' economists at San Francisco State University concluded in a recent study. Communities can either plan for the long term or improvise, storm by storm, until ad hoc solutions are inadequate, they warned.
Officials in cities across the United States and Canada are staying in close touch with San Francisco planners. ''People often wait to see what California does'' about environmental hazards, said Gary B. Griggs, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''So we have a chance to have a big impact.''
Locally, hundreds of millions of dollars ride on the Ocean Beach decision. The San Francisco State study projects that sea-level rise there could impose costs of more than $650 million by 2100 if nothing is done. The big-ticket items are the components of the Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant and related structures, which were completed in 1993 to meet Environmental Protection Agency demands for cleaner wastewater.
Erosion, of course, is a perennial issue for beachfront communities, and Ocean Beach, artificially expanded more than a century ago, has always been vulnerable. But as the planet warms, the problem is expected to become far more severe all along the northern Pacific Coast. Sand bluffs in the Bay Area, which for decades have eroded by an average of more than a foot a year, are expected to collapse at an ever-faster clip.
The options are to keep installing hard structures in front of vulnerable areas, replenish the sand or simply retreat and let the shoreline move where it will.
Each has a cost. Building walls or piling up riprap protects infrastructure. But it amplifies wave action as water ricochets off the hard surface with enough energy in its retreat to scour the sand. The scouring hastens the disappearance of bluffs and beach.
''The pros of riprap are that it can be long term,'' said John R. Dingler, an oceanographer with the Army Corps of Engineers. The cons, he said, are that ''there will be no beach at high tide.''
The armoring of the coastline interferes with beachgoers, infuriates environmentalists and surfers and disturbs vegetation and bird habitats. But after destructive storms, it has been San Francisco's solution of choice in recent years, with city bulldozers dumping thousands of tons of rock and chunks of concrete, granite and brick sidewalks into new breaches.
Two years ago, after fierce storms tore at the underpinnings of the Great Highway, the city created a revetment, or free-form wall, out of 12,000 tons of boulders. Yet last summer, the California Coastal Commission denied the city permission to install more armor and refused to issue retroactive permits for two existing structures. The city sued; the case is pending.
Mark Massara, a local lawyer and an avid surfer who has spent two decades lobbying and litigating over coastal disputes, is fiercely critical of the piles of stone. ''No one is willing to move or adapt -- they think we can armor everything,'' he said. ''Guess what? Not everything can be defended.''
Environmentalists tend to prefer the second solution: replenishing the shore with some of the tons of sand regularly dredged by the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that the waters are deep enough for cargo ships rumbling away from the Golden Gate Bridge. With enough sand, dunes could be rebuilt to mimic those that once covered the area, they say; areas on or near the beach are critical to the survival of species like the bank swallow, which nests in burrows inside sandy bluffs on the beach's southern edge and is listed as threatened in California.
The corps is considering an infusion of sand that could cost $10 million. It would last perhaps three or four years, Mr. Dingler estimated. ''Our economists said, given the value of the infrastructure, it's a worthwhile endeavor to try it once and see what really happens,'' he said. Still, one bad El Nino storm could undo everything, he added.
After severe storms in early 2010, repair work left the southern section of the Great Highway closed for much of the year.
The draft plan prepared by SPUR calls for reducing the northern part of the highway to two lanes from four, closing the southern section, and rerouting traffic inland, at an estimated cost of $30 million.
That ''enables us to do significant retreat -- removing the road and taking advantage of that space,'' said Mr. Grant, the planner. (The idea has not been welcomed by all the commuters or neighborhoods involved.)
The overflow pipe would no longer be protected by the Great Highway; instead, workers would build a low wall scarcely higher than the pipe itself, topped by a cobblestone berm that would slope down toward the surf. (Estimated cost: $60 million.) New sand dunes would protect the waste treatment complex itself.
When SPUR's final draft is ready next month, all of the agencies involved must agree on the plan. Michael Carlin, the chief operating officer of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, said that each agency receives constant updates and that they ''are all being brought along.''
When the proposed solution is ready, he said, ''I believe there will be buy-in from all.''
Mr. Grant predicted that far more coastal communities would face hard choices like these before long. ''Especially around beaches,'' he said, ''because they are so dynamic and they are so beloved.''

HEADLINE: At the Co-op, Tofu, Kale and Cocoa Puffs

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN
DENNIS DANAHER is contemplating a wall of cereal boxes at Elm City Market here. ''They still don't have the cereal I like,'' he says, but rather than go elsewhere he chooses another variety. That loyalty should be good news to Mr. Danaher himself, since Elm City is a food co-op and he is one of about 1,600 people who own it.
Food co-ops, counterculture vestiges of the 1970s, are re-emerging in Connecticut and in the nation as localized, noncorporate outlets for natural foods. Make that mostly natural foods. Like other co-ops, Elm City, which opened in November, believes its success will be rooted in having the broadest possible appeal. That means Mr. Danaher's cereal options included Cocoa Puffs and Frosted Flakes -- a decidedly different co-op model.
''I'll say,'' said Mark Regni, Elm City's general manager and 35-plus-year veteran of the grocery business, most of it in the natural foods sector. ''We're trying to become as much of a one-stop shop as possible. If we offer a compelling hybrid mix, then people will make the choices that are good for them.'' 
Three new co-ops -- Fiddlehead Food Co-op in New London and the Local Beet in Chester in addition to Elm City -- have started in the state in four years, and another is poised to open in Noank in a few weeks.
While still owned by customers who pay one-time membership fees, for which they typically receive a few minimal discounts, they are many steps removed from their hippie predecessors. No more patchouli wafting through the air, misshapen organic veggies or whole wheat breads that could double as cannonballs. Today's food co-ops tend to be slick community market reinventions that have thrown off their original members-only rules, volunteer requirements and even vegetarian philosophies.
Most now are bastions of local, fresh, organic and fair trade plus current trends like gluten-free, dairy-free and, lately, coconut and sprouted anything. Elm City buys produce, dairy, meat (there's an on-site butcher), baked goods and shelf-stable items, including beer, from about 115 local vendors (within 200 miles) and two dozen regional ones (within 400 miles). More vendors are expected in summer, when produce is at its peak.
Like other co-ops, Elm City specializes in bulk goods, mostly organic. It has about 250 varieties of nuts, grains, beans and more. But in keeping with the store's hybrid philosophy, you'll find Maxwell House and Folgers next to the locally roasted Bean & Leaf and Ashlawn Farm coffees. Local maple syrup is next to Log Cabin. And while there are seven shelves of milk alternatives -- soy, coconut, rice and almond -- you can also buy Diet Coke.
With dozens more companies now focusing on ''natural'' foods, Connecticut co-op shelves and freezer cases are stocked with many mainstream names: Annie's, Amy's, Newman's Own, Cascadian Farm, Red Mill, Arrowhead Mills, Muir Glen, Spectrum and more. But Elm City has raised the co-op bar with a commercial kitchen that daily produces dozens of prepared and reheatable items like lasagna and butternut squash with raisins.
There are also rotisserie-cooked chickens; made-to-order sandwiches and burritos; and a 35-foot bar with make-your-own-salad, four soups and hot dishes that can include things like barbecued pork and beef, and vegan curried chickpea stew. Lunchtimes are packed.
''I don't know what I want; there's a lot of options,'' said Lauren Maghini, staring into a cold case of sandwiches while holding a basket filled with bags of bulk rye berries, garbanzo beans, popcorn and green lentils, along with burritos and rice cakes. ''Even though there are some grocery stores that are local to where I am,'' she said, noting that she had come from Wallingford, ''they have a wider variety of a lot of organic free-range, antibiotic-free, local produce here.''
As much as co-ops like to talk about their community roots and local job creation, Ms. Maghini's reasons for co-op shopping were by far the most often cited.
On a late February afternoon at the Willimantic Food Co-op, Sharon Williams of Windsor Locks was on her weekly visit for 10 half-gallons of raw milk, and Kathleen King of Columbia, an eight-year member, was loading up on faro, garbanzo bean flour, sunflower seed butter, kale and daikon. ''I'm vegetarian and I can't eat soy products,'' she said. ''I can find a lot more things that I can eat here.''
After 32 years in business, Willimantic's active membership is around 6,000. Customer demand for local meat forced the store to give up its vegetarian status last year; bulk offerings have increased by 10 percent to hundreds of items: 10 flavors of cashews, including maple, garam masala and nori sesame; 22 rices; two-dozen beans; 10 trail mixes; the requisite coconut; and of course those elusive kamut nuts. ''I think that the interest in co-ops and product availability has totally increased,'' said Alice Rubin, Willimantic's general manager, who has worked at the store since 1984. ''But now the competition has increased, and that's a whole new twist.''
The surge is significant. Stuart Reid, executive director of the Food Co-op Initiative, said there are about 325 food co-ops nationwide, about 50 of them new in the last few years, and he was working with another 200 communities on new co-ops. Erbin Crowell, executive director of the Neighboring Food Co-op Association, said one-third of his 28 members in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont are startups. Both said the corporate aversion that has been propelling Occupy Wall Street is also buoying co-ops. The people who shop at co-ops are also the owners, Mr. Crowell said. ''There is an extreme level of loyalty you don't see in other businesses.''
In Chester, Kim Kellogg converted her community market into the Local Beet Co-op last May. She now focuses on local foods: produce, meat, honey, breads, and even tofu, and she is working with other co-ops to ease the ever-nettlesome distribution problems and to reduce prices through joint purchasing.
The Noank Community Market is set to open in a few weeks, replacing the Universal Food Store, which closed in 2011, after 106 years. Bailey Pryor, president of Noank, said he literally heard the disappointed customers from his film production office on the store's second floor. ''People cussing in the parking lot,'' he said. ''I could hear the angst coming through my window.''
Noank is going with an Elm City full-service model: mainstream groceries plus all the natural, organic and dietary requisites of the day. It will have a meat counter, a full-time chef for baked goods, prepared foods and catering as well as seating with Wi-Fi.
But co-ops remain economically tricky, as those who run Fiddleheads Food Co-op in New London, established in 2008, well know. With more of a 1970s look than the newer co-ops -- mismatched cold cases and makeshift shelving -- it has grown in fits and starts, specializing in bulk and local, with a few oddities like Mystic Syrups made with natural hickory bark extract, and Useful Weeds, a tea and spice company.
''Talk about growing organically, that's exactly how we grew,'' said Sheila Herbert, Fiddleheads' grocery buyer. ''We were in tough financial shape. We'd get a little money; we'd make it a little bit bigger.'' None of it would have happened without Fiddleheads' active and dedicated members.
''Seriously,'' Ms. Herbert said, ''You have to hang in there, so it's good to have some zealots involved.''

HEADLINE: The $200,000 Nanny Club

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
It took Zenaide Muneton 20 seconds to convince me that she was the perfect nanny. Short and dark-haired, she has a goofy, beaming smile and knows how to make everything fun for a little kid. Time to brush your teeth? She shakes her hands and does a pantomimed teeth-brushing dance. Bath time? She pumps her arms up and down in a going-to-the-tub march. After I told her I'd love to hire her, she smiled and thanked me.
Then we both laughed, because there is no way I could possibly afford her. As one of New York City's elite nannies, Muneton commanded around $180,000 a year -- plus a Christmas bonus and a $3,000-a-month apartment on Central Park West. I should be her nanny.
I began researching this bizarre microeconomy shortly after my wife and I started looking for someone to watch our son for a few hours a week. We met with several candidates, all of whom had good references and seemed fine with him. Still, we weren't sure how to judge them. Should we hire the one who seemed to be the most fun? The most experienced? A native English speaker or someone who could speak a foreign language to him? Someone with a college degree? A master's? 
We had no idea. But I began to wonder if price conveyed any important information about the nanny market. All the candidates we spoke with charged about $15 to $18 per hour, which, though standard in our Brooklyn neighborhood, seemed like a bargain when I learned that some nannies charge considerably more than double that rate. Would my son suffer with a midmarket nanny?
This fear led me to the Pavillion Agency, which specializes in finding domestic workers for New York City's wealthy. Pavillion introduced me to Muneton, 49, who grew up in ''a very poor family'' in Sao Paulo. In 1990, she befriended a young American woman who had relocated to Brazil. When Muneton invited her to her family's home, the woman saw her natural ease with children and suggested that she move to America and become a nanny. Within a few months, Muneton was caring for the children of a rich family in South Carolina for only $100 a week.
When Muneton started working through Pavillion in 2002, however, she increased her salary to $85,000 a year. As she gathered sterling recommendations, she began increasing her pay. Eventually she worked for some of the country's wealthiest people, whom she accompanied on private jets to many of the world's most exclusive resorts. Today, she says, ''there are no more poor people in my family.'' Muneton bought a nice house for her mother, a condo for her sister and a taxi cab each for two of her brothers. She also owns a beach house in Brazil, a penthouse in Miami and two properties (a six-unit building and a duplex) in Los Angeles.
How does a nanny earn more than the average pediatrician? The simple answer is hard work -- plus a strange seller's market that follows a couple of quirky economic principles. A typical high-priced nanny effectively signs her (and they are almost always women) life over to the family she works for. According to Cliff Greenhouse, Pavillion's president, that kind of commitment is essentially built into the price. Many clients are paying for the privilege of not having to worry about their child's care, which means never worrying if their nanny has plans. Which, of course, she can't, pretty much ever.
And, alas, it seems that there just aren't enough ''good'' nannies, always on call, to go around. Especially since a wealthy family's demands can be pretty specific. According to Pavillion's vice president, Seth Norman Greenberg, a nanny increases her market value if she speaks fluent French (or, increasingly, Mandarin); can cook a four-course meal (and, occasionally, macrobiotic dishes); and ride, wash and groom a horse. Greenberg has also known families to prize nannies who can steer a 32-foot boat, help manage an art collection or, in one case, drive a Zamboni to clean a private ice rink.
And then there's social climbing. ''A lot of families, especially new money, are really concerned about their children getting close to other very affluent children,'' Greenhouse says. ''How do they do that? They find a superstar nanny who already has lots of contacts, lots of other nanny friends who work with other high profile families.'' There are the intangibles too. ''I'm working with a phenomenal Caribbean nanny right now,'' Greenhouse says. ''She is drop-dead beautiful. Her presentation is such that you're proud to have her by your children's side at the most high-profile events.''
My wife and I don't care about any of that stuff. But it's hard not to wonder if the nannies who make twice as much an hour as the ones we're considering are also twice as good. Nannies can be evaluated in the same way as what economists call ''experience goods'' -- like wine, whose value can only be determined after experiencing it. When it comes to experience goods, price can be useful to reject anything below a certain minimum. After all, a $3 bottle of wine or a $5-an-hour nanny are pretty sketchy.
But price is useless -- or worse, misleading -- in differentiating among the adequate. I've often assumed that a $40 bottle of wine is twice as good as a $20 bottle even though the American Association of Wine Economists has essentially proved that the price of wine has almost no bearing on enjoyment. When nonconnoisseurs buy an expensive bottle, they're acting like new parents hiring a nanny: they're basically paying for a false sense of assurance. Or hoping to impress somebody.
Actually, nanny prices might be even more misleading than the wine market. They also bear resemblance to ''credence goods,'' an economic term for something -- whether a jar of vitamins or an auto tuneup -- whose true value can never quite be determined. You're more likely to overpay for a credence good in the hope that a higher cost increases the likelihood of a benefit.
So if economics can't fairly convey the price of a nanny, what does? Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a director at Columbia University's National Center for Children and Families, reassured me that academics know, roughly, nothing about how nannies impact children. There has not been any sort of serious study on nanny quality, she says, because it would be nearly impossible to get permission from nannies (often paid under the table) or their employers. Also, most child-development research is dedicated to at-risk children, and the kids of people with the resources to hire nannies don't typically qualify.
Brooks-Gunn did, however, have some advice for what can make a good nanny. The single-most important characteristic is the extent to which a nanny is responsive to the child's mood and interests. Brooks-Gunn said that when she chose a nanny, she simply handed her son to every candidate she interviewed and chose the one who responded most sensitively.
After our talk, I spoke with one of her graduate students, Erin Bumgarner, who moonlights as a part-time nanny for around $17 an hour -- the same amount that Park Slope parents pay to immigrant nannies with no college education. I couldn't think of any other field in which people with such disparate educational backgrounds could make the same amount. But Bumgarner told me it makes sense. She is willing to work for only parents she likes -- she already quit one well-paying job for this reason -- and who allow her to focus on her school work. The value of that is also built into the price. Even if it costs her a Central Park West apartment.

HEADLINE: Elaborate Weddings, Minus the Guests

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IT was minutes before the wedding, and the planner left nothing to chance. The reception hall, a plank-floored farmhouse in the Santa Barbara, Calif., wine country, had been decorated in peonies. The dinner menu, rendered in calligraphy, promised wild mushroom tortellini and halibut with verjus. In a field outside, a photographer and videographer stood at the ready, near a ceremonial canopy draped in velvet and the aisle strewn with guinea feathers.
The only thing missing were guests. But that's exactly what Carey and Brian Provost had planned.
''I wanted the dress, the vows, the flowers and the pictures,'' said Ms. Provost, 36, who took the unconventional step of turning the couple's elopement into a blowout. ''But when you have guests, we felt like it ends up being more for them, not for the bride and groom. We wanted it to be for us.'' 
An extravagant elopement might strike some as a contradiction. Isn't the whole point of eloping to steer clear of the Wedding Industrial Complex, to keep things simple and cheap?
But elopements are no longer confined to black-sheep members of the family who skulk off to a Las Vegas chapel because Mom and Dad do not approve. With the cost of a 200-guest wedding spiraling upward, and many people getting married (and remarried) at ages when they no longer feel a need to be the stars of their Big Day, couples are now considering a table for two as a civilized alternative to 12 months of planning hell.
Still, they want the day to be special. This is particularly true in an era when wedding blogs and Facebook photos have made nuptials a public spectacle. Why shell out for another rubber chicken dinner for Aunt Beatrice from Tuscaloosa, when what really matters are the luscious photos capturing the style and pageantry, which can be ''liked'' and ''pinned'' by users of social media sites?
It is a way to have your wedding cake and eat it, too.
''It was almost like a glorified photo shoot for the two of us,'' said Ms. Provost, who lives with her husband in San Antonio. ''We got to spend the whole day together, just the two of us, which almost made it more meaningful. There wasn't a distant cousin or mother or girlfriend there adding stress.''
The impulse to avoid stress is often the starting point. A year ago, Celia Tombalakian, a global marketing director for a medical devices company in New York, found herself mired in planning for a traditional ceremony at the University Club with her fiance, David Shafer, a 37-year-old plastic surgeon.
''The details kept snowballing,'' Ms. Tombalakian, 40, said. ''Finally we thought: Why are we buying into this? We have been sucked into the machine. Let's just do our own thing.''
They decided to run off to Las Vegas -- in high style.
''I didn't want it to be a drive-through, Britney Spears kind of thing,'' Ms. Tombalakian said. ''How do you get the best of both worlds?''
The answer: arrange an elopement with all the production values of a fairy-tale wedding. The couple hired a wedding planner, Andrea Eppolito, who booked them a corner suite of the Cosmopolitan hotel, with a wraparound balcony overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. She found the location, a private garden located on a nearby lake, hired Your Beauty Call -- a company that provides hairstyling and makeup for celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton -- to style Ms. Tombalakian. And she reserved them a window table at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, which served a miniature three-layer cake for two.
''We felt like guests at our own wedding,'' Ms. Tombalakian said. ''We were driving around that morning, saying, 'Isn't it amazing how nothing can go wrong?' ''
While an extravaganza like that is never going to be cheap, a ceremony for two invariably saves money over a ceremony for 200 (consider the catering costs alone). And in this economy, savings matter, said Jen Campbell, who runs Green Wedding Shoes, a wedding blog that has featured several ambitious elopements.
''For a couple fresh out of school, paying for a large wedding probably isn't possible without considerable support from their parents,'' she said.
Still, fancy elopements, or ''private ceremonies,'' as wedding professionals sometimes call them, can cost $10,000 to $100,000. (By contrast, the average wedding costs $26,000, according to a recent study by Brides magazine.)
But for older couples, particularly busy professionals, money is not always the only consideration. For them, priorities have often shifted.
''Clients getting married in their 20s say, 'I want to be in front of 200, I want to be a princess bride,' '' said Lisa Vorce, a wedding planner in Los Angeles.
Brides over 30 are often past the stage in life where they demand that their wedding day be the definitive day of their life -- part family reunion, part college reunion, with a dash of royal wedding mixed in, she added.
''They just want a special thing with their significant other,'' Ms. Vorce said. ''It's kind of like this glorified honeymoon.''
To fill that market, hotels and resorts in wedding-friendly locales like the Napa Valley or the Caribbean offer elopement packages coordinated by a full-time wedding consultant.
And the more spectacular the setting, the better. Whereas eloping couples in the past may have limited themselves to recording the event for a personal scrapbook by taking a few snapshots with a disposable camera, many now hire top photographers, knowing in advance that the photos will at the very least find a public audience on Facebook, if not on wedding blogs.
To be considered for such blogs, however, design matters. That means styling an elopement as ambitiously as any other wedding.
Shalini Saycocie, an art producer for a New York advertising agency, was planning to elope with her fiance, Chad Carbone, for a more intimate experience. She was inspired to create a mountaintop fairy tale of their own after seeing sumptuous photos of the Provost ceremony on the blog Style Me Pretty. She enlisted a planner in Eagle, Colo., Frosted Pink Weddings, to arrange a ceremony at Devil's Thumb Ranch in the Rockies last December.
After a private ceremony, which was held next to a fireplace covered in hyacinths, the couple retreated to an outdoor ice rink just as the sun was setting. There, James Christianson, a prominent wedding photographer, snapped away as Ms. Carbone, wearing a 1920s-style ball gown and a vintage beaver wrap, circled the ice with her new husband, against a backdrop of snow-dusted mountain peaks. Afterward, they set off sparklers and posed some more for the camera. The photos ran on Ruffled, another popular wedding blog, a few months later.
''The visual aspects were especially important for me, since our family wasn't there with us,'' Ms. Carbone explained. ''I wanted someone else to be the eyes for our friends and family.''
Having no guests also frees up what couples can afford to do for their wedding.
Quinn Ly, 28, a law-firm manager in San Diego, and Andy Van Le, a lawyer, decided to keep things small yet spectacular. Last month, they traveled to Vietnam with their wedding planner, Ms. Vorce; a floral designer, Mindy Rice; and a photographer, Aaron Delesie, to stage an elaborate ceremony amid the temple ruins at My Son. (The planner and florist served as witnesses.)
They hired local children to carry the posts for the ceremonial canopy. Flower girls in cream-colored traditional dresses called ao dai carried crocheted lace lanterns that were made by local artisans. Musicians performed on bamboo stringed instruments. Afterward, a chef prepared a feast for two on a private boat that glided down the Thu Bon river.
The ceremony was so elaborate that Ms. Ly did not even refer to it as an ''elopement'' but rather ''a wedding for two.''
''We had the rehearsal dinner, the hair and makeup, the cake cutting, the vow exchange,'' she explained. ''We had everything but the guests.''

HEADLINE: Auditioning for Real Chase Scenes

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
AS if the dispatcher had just barked out a ''10-13'' -- the New York police radio code for an officer needing assistance -- Capt. Anthony J. Raganella put the cruiser in gear and floored the accelerator. Seconds later, he was cornering hard. The tires were squealing.
But he did not turn on the siren, as he would have if he had been rushing to a real crime scene. Captain Raganella, the commanding officer of the department's Disorder Control Unit, was test-driving a new Ford Police Interceptor in a parking lot. 
Of course, the parking lot, at Citi Field in Flushing, Queens, had been marked off with a closed-loop course that was supposed to simulate the maneuvers an officer would make to cover 20 to 30 blocks with life-or-death urgency. After a couple of laps, Captain Raganella was enthusiastic about the Police Interceptor, which Ford designed to take the place of a 20-year stalwart, the discontinued Crown Victoria.
''This is wonderful,'' said Captain Raganella, who stressed that he was not speaking in an official capacity. ''I felt at home in the Crown Vic. I felt more at home in this. Going around turns, this gives you more confidence. A lot more. It feels locked down to the ground.''
Ford says it is replacing the police version of the Crown Victoria with five models -- two sedans based on the Taurus and three sport utility vehicles based on the Explorer. Officers accustomed to the Crown Victoria might be concerned about two things the new models do not have: rear drive and V-8 engines. The new models have standard all-wheel drive, an option on civilian Tauruses, and a choice of three V-6s, all more powerful -- and more fuel-efficient -- than the previous V-8s.
Ford's goal was a 20 percent improvement in fuel economy. Citing the example of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, whose 6,200 vehicles rolled up 27 million miles last year, Ford said the new cars would save at least $20 million a year on gasoline, based on the current pump price.
In the Crown Victoria's heyday, Ford sold roughly 40,000 a year as police cars. ''That would be a reasonable target'' for the new vehicles, said Lisa Teed, Ford's marketing manager for Police Interceptors. Ford says the Chicago Police Department has agreed to buy 500 Police Interceptors, the largest contract. Those cars will not have to go far once they roll off the assembly line: Ford is building the Police Interceptors at a southeast Chicago factory that dates to the Model T.
In New York, where the police department is already testing new Dodge Chargers, the plan for the Fords is ''to acquire a certain number to test in the fleet as a possible replacement for the Crown Vic -- successor, I should say,'' explained Paul J. Browne, the department's main spokesman. ''Some would argue nothing can replace the Crown Vic.'' Mr. Browne said the city liked to have ''two, and preferably three,'' manufacturers in the fleet, which has 1,829 marked police cars.
Ford has largely standardized the interiors of the new sedan and sport utility. Like Airbus airplanes, whose cockpits are nearly identical from model to model, the Police Interceptors have identical dashboards. The idea is to keep officers from being disoriented if their regular-duty sedan has to go in for maintenance and they are issued an S.U.V.
Ford also made the two models ''upfit friendly'' -- police jargon for options that go beyond law-enforcement-only standard equipment, like a column-mounted shifter, 18-inch tires, special brakes and under-body plates to protect the transmission and oil pan. ''Because they go airborne,'' explained Carl Widmann, the vehicle engineering manager.
Ford put the gear shifter on the column to clear space for a laptop between the front bucket seats. The seats are extra-wide around the hips -- not to accommodate patrol officers who take too many doughnut breaks, but to hold all the stuff they wear around their waists: guns, ammunition, walkie-talkies and so on.
The engineers redesigned the doors, eliminating storage pockets, after visiting a police garage in New York. ''All of the door panels were off'' the cruisers in the garage, Ms. Teed said. ''They said, 'We're riveting on these plastic panels because they're easier to clean.' I was like, 'We don't want you to have to take off the door panels. We'll make them so you don't have to.' ''

HEADLINE: Buyers Shift To Smaller Vehicles

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
THE Toyota Prius C, with a combined E.P.A. fuel-economy rating of 50 miles per gallon, is in such demand that a dealer in Florida reportedly levied a $7,000 premium on the $19,710 vehicle, a scaled-down version of the class-leading hybrid. 
Toyota, which began sales of the C on March 12, sold more units in its first three days than either Chevrolet, with its plug-in-hybrid Volt, or Nissan, with its purely electric Leaf, managed in all of February.
The C's popularity might be credited to rising gasoline prices and Toyota's improved quality and dependability. But analysts also identify a broader tendency among American consumers to move down market into smaller segments when they encounter shock at the pump, going from sport utility vehicles to crossovers, from midsize to compact sedans, and from compact to subcompact hatchbacks.
Recent sales seem to bear both theories out. ''Cars and crossovers, our most fuel-efficient vehicles, are now two-thirds of our business,'' Jim Cain, a spokesman for General Motors, said in an interview. ''The Sonic is doing fantastically well after a few months on the market,'' he added, referring to the new compact hatchback and sedan.
The brand sold 7,900 Sonics in February, its best month. The Ford Focus, with 23,350 sales, turned in its best February since 2000. Erich Merkle, a Ford sales analyst, said in an interview that the automaker was commanding its highest share of the small-car market in nearly a decade.
Shoppers can find any number of roomy midsize cars promising 30 highway m.p.g. or better, and as G.M. and Ford have shown, the midsize segment is booming.
''I absolutely think those results are a huge response to high gas prices,'' Lacey Plache, chief economist at Edmunds.com, said in an interview. ''Historically, people's interest in compacts and hybrids just ratchets right up when fuel prices rise. The whole Prius line has had trouble keeping up with demand.''
Mr. Merkle of Ford would not speculate about what price gasoline would have to reach for consumers to move more quickly into smaller cars. ''My best answer is that I don't know,'' he said. Still, many industry analysts said any increase at the pump would have to be sustained to be meaningful.
''The small-car results are a good sign of the acceptance of those vehicles, but if you're asking me if their sales will reach the magnitude of midsized cars, I'd say it's not likely soon,'' Christopher Hopson, a sales forecaster at IHS Automotive, said. ''The sweet spot in the United States is midsize.''
Small cars are also benefiting from high gas prices amid relatively optimistic economic indicators. He cautioned that the balance could be upset at any time. ''Really high gas prices would hit the economy as a whole, and the last thing we'd worry about at that point is small-car sales.''

HEADLINE: Coup Leaders in Mali Struggle to Assert Their Control

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- Residents of Bamako, the capital of Mali, waited in tension and uncertainty on Saturday for the outcome of a military coup d'etat that overthrew the country's elected government last week, ending more than 20 years of democracy in the nation. 
Regional analysts and residents said little appeared to be resolved as junta leaders struggled to maintain control amid increasing international isolation and persistent rumors of an imminent countercoup. State television, seized early on by the coup leaders, went off the air for an hour on Friday night as soldiers set up barricades around the downtown building housing it.
Later, Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, the coup leader who had received military training in the United States, appeared briefly to assure viewers of his ''good health,'' followed by repeated declarations of support for the junta from young people and other backers, many using the same language. Speaking of the countercoup rumors, a military spokesman, Col. Idrissa Traore, said Saturday that there was ''nothing serious in all that.''
Yet the announcement that the junta remained in control was hardly seen as definitive by observers. ''The situation is very fluid,'' said Dr. Abdel Fatau Musah, a senior official with the regional grouping of West African states, Ecowas, who left Bamako on Saturday morning. ''Nobody knows what is going to happen.''
Ecowas, which has condemned the coup, scheduled an emergency meeting of regional leaders for Tuesday in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
The whereabouts of Mali's elected president, Amadou Toumani Toure, remained unknown.
''There is a lot of insecurity,'' Dr. Musah said. ''It's going to be very difficult to see how this junta is going to survive. ''The country has run out of resources.'' Mali's air and land borders have been sealed since late Wednesday; food, fuel and cash are all running low; banks are closed, as are many stores.''
Dr. Musah added: ''The junta is made up of very young officers, very inexperienced. Ecowas wants them to quickly surrender.''
Opposition politicians in Mali continued to criticize the coup. ''With just weeks before an election in which the Malian people were getting ready to freely and democratically decide their future, nobody has the right to substitute themselves by force to popular will,'' Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, a former prime minister, said in a statement.
Mali, heavily dependent on aid, risks a near-total cutoff of foreign assistance. ''Any U.S. assistance to the government of Mali beyond what we give for humanitarian purposes is at risk,'' Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Friday. That point was relayed directly to Captain Sanogo by an official at the American Embassy in Bamako, the State Department said.

HEADLINE: The False Debate About Attacking Iran

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
I WONDER if we in the news media aren't inadvertently leaving the impression that there is a genuine debate among experts about whether an Israeli military strike on Iran makes sense this year.
There really isn't such a debate. Or rather, it's the same kind of debate as the one about climate change -- credible experts are overwhelmingly on one side.
Here's what a few of them told me: 
''I don't know any security expert who is recommending a military strike on Iran at this point,'' noted Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton University professor who was a senior State Department official earlier in the Obama administration.
''Unless you're so far over on the neocon side that you're blind to geopolitical realities, there's an overwhelming consensus that this is a bad idea,'' said W. Patrick Lang, a former head of Middle East affairs for the Defense Intelligence Agency.
''Most security experts agree that it's premature to go to a military option,'' said Michele Flournoy, who has just stepped down as the No. 3 official in the Defense Department. ''We are in the middle of increasing sanctions on Iran. Iran is already under the most onerous sanctions it has ever experienced, and now we're turning the screws further with sanctions that will touch their central bank, sanctions that will touch their oil products and so forth.
''So it has been bad for them and it's about to get worse,'' Flournoy added. ''The overwhelming consensus is we should give some time to let that work.''
Granted, American officials are deeply alarmed about Iran's nuclear program, although the fear is not so much that Iran would use nuclear weapons against Israel or anyone else. Iran apparently developed chemical weapons to respond to Iraq's chemical attacks during the Iran-Iraq war, and it showed restraint with them. Rather, the biggest fear is that if Iran tests and deploys nuclear weapons, other countries will follow. These could include Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt, setting off another round of nuclear proliferation.
Officials and security experts make several broad points about why a military strike on Iran anytime soon would be an abominable idea.
First, it would set back Iran's program by only one to three years -- and then it presumably would go ahead more covertly and with more domestic support than ever.
Second, this wouldn't be a single strike but would require sorties over many days to attack many locations. And the aim would be in part to kill the scientists running the program, so there would be civilian casualties. Day by day, anger in the Muslim world and around the world would grow at Israel -- and at America. The coalition pressuring Iran through sanctions might well dissolve.
Third, a regional war in the Middle East could result, sucking in the United States. Iran could sponsor attacks on American targets around the world, and it could use proxies to escalate attacks on American troops in Afghanistan.
Fourth, oil supplies through the Persian Gulf could be interrupted, sending oil and gas prices soaring, and damaging the global economy.
Fifth, sanctions and covert methods like the Stuxnet computer worm have already slowed Iran's progress, and tougher sanctions and covert sabotage will continue to delay the program in a low-risk way.
Granted, everything I say here may be wrong. Israel's 1981 attack on the Osirak reactor in Iraq and its 2007 attack on a Syrian nuclear project both went smoothly, without retaliation. The attacks set back those countries' nuclear programs much more than skeptics had expected.
Yet there's good reason to think that Iran is different, partly because its program is so dispersed and protected. More broadly, war is inherently unpredictable, and Israel has often been horrendously shortsighted in its interventions. Its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 turned into a quagmire that helped lead to the emergence of Hezbollah, while its de facto support for Hamas in Gaza in its early days harmed everyone (except Iran).
Let's also remember that as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu bangs the drums of war, that may empower Iranian hawks. ''The continual threat of a military strike is as likely to convince them to move ahead as to deter them,'' Slaughter notes.
Whether Israel will attack Iranian nuclear sites is one of this year's crucial questions, and people in the know seem to think the odds are about 50-50. We don't know that the economy would be harmed or that a war would unfold, but anyone who is confident about what would happen is a fool.
So as we hear talk about military action against Iran, let's be clear about one thing. Outside Netanyahu's aides and a fringe of raptors, just about every expert thinks that a military strike at this time would be a catastrophically bad idea. That's not a debate, but a consensus.

HEADLINE: Goodbye Malaria, Hello Condos

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
IT can seem hard to believe, but there was a time when people didn't value Central Park for its views.
In the late 1800s, after the park was created, most buildings were still no more than five stories high, residents often decorated with heavy curtains, and an infestation of malaria-carrying mosquitoes was a cause for alarm.
That was before skyscrapers began shooting up around the park, giving rise to the notion of ''park views.''
Today, those two words are worth untold millions in the world of New York real estate. Apartments overlooking the park can command prices of as much as $88 million, for the full-floor penthouse at 15 Central Park West, and the developer Gary Barnett is betting he can sell the two-floor penthouse at 157 West 57th Street, the crown jewel of his One57 project, for $115 million. 
But if park views at the south end bring such eye-watering premiums, what about residences at the north end?
To find out, I visited the Harlem side of the park. After getting off the subway at 110th Street, I walked just a few steps to 111 Central Park North.
There, from an 18th-floor apartment with a sizable terrace, you can look out on an idyllic view of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's landscaped wonder. Ducks glide through the Harlem Meer. Older residents walk slowly with canes next to groups of adolescent girls strolling through the garden during lunchtime. Just beyond the trees along Fifth Avenue is the Conservatory Garden, where brokers say they have seen brides being photographed. Absent were the horse-drawn carriages (and the accompanying trail of manure) and hordes of tourists that occupy the southern and southwestern side of the park.
The Harlem side is known as the ''mountain'' region of the park, for its more hilly terrain. On this day the southern sun was shining brightly, and the terrace at 111 Central Park North offered eastern and western exposures as well.
From here, you can see the opposite edge of the park, including the Plaza, and a construction crane hovering over One57 through the haze that offers a reminder of how that 90-story building will tower over most others in Midtown.
Harlem, it turns out, is one of the few remaining places in the city where you can get a park view for relatively low prices.
The price of this view? The three-bedroom three-bath condo, with 1,914 square feet, is listed at $2.39 million.
In 2008, as the financial crisis took hold, a buyer sold a penthouse in the building for $8 million, $500,000 less than he had paid, after trying to flip it for $12 million, said Jill Sloane of Halstead, a broker on the deal.
Walking east along Central Park North I passed low-slung residential buildings of no more than six stories, a correctional facility that houses the disgraced Tyco executive Dennis Kozlowski, and a church on the corner of Fifth Avenue. A small organic-food store is expected to open soon on the block, a sign, real estate brokers say, of the area's gentrification.
On the east side of the intersection, an agent gave me a tour 1280 Fifth Avenue, which opened last year and was designed by Robert A.M. Stern, the architect of 15 Central Park West.
The Harlem building offers tranquil, unobstructed views of the northeast corner of the park. There are ''intimate'' views from one seventh-floor corner unit I visited, and ''panoramic'' views from the higher floors of the 20-story building.
''People realize they would be paying double and triple in Midtown and would not have this kind of vista,'' said Tom Postilio, a broker at CORE. ''People with a little more pioneering spirit are here investing.''
About half of the buyers in the building so far have been foreign, and have predominantly been all-cash buyers, according to Kathleen Corton, a principal of Brickman, the developer.
Parul Brahmbhatt, a sales associate at CORE, parsed the difference for me in pricing at 1280 Fifth to help me understand the premium placed on park views. Unit 7B, which faces the park, has 1,480 square feet and is listed for $1.87 million. A north-facing unit on the same floor with no park view is going for $1.265 million and is just 10 square feet smaller.
Regardless of which side of the park an apartment faces, brokers and appraisers say a Central Park view is worth 25 percent to 50 percent more than a nonpark view for a similar-sized residence. New York is one of the few cities in the United States that put a higher premium on a park view than a river view, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel real estate appraisers. Views of the Hudson command a 10 percent to 25 percent premium. ''We are inward-looking,'' Mr. Miller said.
It's remarkable to think that in the 19th century ''the park was simply a kind of protector, a presentable front yard,'' said Christopher Gray, who writes the ''Streetscapes'' column for The New York Times. Early on, the park also was a health concern. An Oct. 13, 1877, edition of The Real Estate Record and Guide noted that malaria in the park was ''becoming more palpably widespread and painful.'' The ''chills and fevers and other malarious disorders'' were causing a ''widespread prejudice'' among residents ''against choosing any locality in the proximity of the park for a place of residence,'' The Record and Guide reported. Still, by the turn of the century, Fifth Avenue opposite the park was already the most desirable house site in the city, Mr. Gray said.
(Malaria was later controlled, obviously: The Times reported in 1888 that its incidence among park police officers had sharply decreased.)
Despite the health concerns, developers pushed to build taller buildings. By 1930, the 27-story San Remo towers and residential hotels like the Ritz, at 101 East 57th, were offering spectacularly different views. About a dozen buildings of that size were built before the Depression intervened, halting most construction. ''The typical building in 1960 was no different in mass than the typical building in 1925 -- they were all 15 to 18 stories,'' Mr. Gray said.
The concept of fabulous views didn't return until after 1961, when a zoning resolution awarded air rights for taller buildings in exchange for building plazas. The move spurred tall building construction.
The concept of marketing park views evolved as well. Nobody bothered with the idea of building penthouses until the early 1920s, preferring to leave tar-topped roofs. In the mid-1980s, Mr. Miller recalled, most new condominium buildings had little-used health clubs and pools on the roofs.
''Now the configurations tend to be weighted toward larger units at the top because of the premiums for larger square footage,'' he said. ''You get a double premium -- for the size and for the view. Developers are marketing for the global citizen as opposed to the family that wants to move into the city.''
The ''capitalists'' derided in The Real Estate Record and Guide in the 1800s who wanted to build tall ended up having vision akin to that of Steve Jobs, who instinctively knew we wanted iPads and iPhones before we ever thought to ask for one. Mr. Gray imagines that even a Vanderbilt might have a new appreciation today of park views. ''Ms. Vanderbilt, in her 1882 mansion on 57th and Fifth, if offered an apartment in 15 Central Park West, would say, 'Pretty cool, I could dig this.' '' he said. ''She would not say, 'I want some heavy curtains in here.' ''

HEADLINE: One Year Later, a New, Resilient Kyoto

BYLINE: By PICO IYER. 
PICO IYER is the author, most recently, of ''The Man Within My Head.''

 BODY:
ONE bright early spring morning this month, I took myself to Ryoanji, the Kyoto temple that is home to the world's most celebrated rock garden. There was not a single other foreigner in the place. Not even many Japanese were visible across the 120-acre compound (I'd scheduled my trip for spring break, when clamorous school tours are less in evidence).
So as I sat above the enigmatic presentation of 15 rocks, arranged with seeming randomness across a wide bed of raked sand, I could hear nothing but bird song from the cherry trees around me. A trickle of water from a thin bamboo chute issued into a stone basin around the corner, deepening as it intensified the silence. The characters around the basin said, ''What you have is all you need.''
Stillness, spaciousness and undistractedness are what I had just then. Though foreign tourism to Japan as a whole plunged by 50 percent in the three months following the earthquake last March, as of January 2012 it was only 4 percent lower, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. 
Nevertheless, the quiet amplitude that is one of the special graces of Japan has a new resonance this year. On the surface, the country that greets someone arriving from San Francisco or New York tomorrow is startlingly similar to the place you would have seen two years ago, despite last year's catastrophe. But deep down, Japan seems more vulnerable, and thus more wide open, than ever.
The 9.0 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown that hit the country on March 11, 2011, claimed almost 20,000 lives, overturned an economy that had already been foundering through 20 years of recession, and demoralized a citizenry dealing with one suicide every 17 minutes, a loss of direction, and what is now seven prime ministers in fewer than six years.
Yet it also highlighted the resilience, self-possession and community-mindedness that are so striking in Japan; suddenly, the country that had seemed to insist on its difference from the rest of the world could be seen in its more human, compassionate and brave dimensions. Japan has long been what the globally savvy magazine Monocle called, in a recent issue, ''The World's Most Charming Nation''; now it is also one of those most grateful for visitors.
To put it another way: On a typical day this month -- the anniversary of the tsunami, as it happens -- you could see huge illuminated flower arrangements in Kyoto's central Maruyama Park, while candles were sent floating down a nearby stream; you could join kimonoed women in following a path of 2,500 lanterns along the eastern hills of the ancient capital, and watch maiko, or apprentice geisha, performing ceremonial dances, free, at Yasaka Shrine. You could take a train and bus out to the stunning I. M. Pei-designed Miho Museum, which sits alone in a huge deserted natural park 70 minutes from Kyoto Station, complete with its own space-age tunnel for an entrance; or you could join 15,000 others in running Kyoto's first marathon.
Meanwhile, all around, the qualities that have long made Japan distinctive, and often humbling, are everywhere apparent. At the airport, cabbies jump out of their cars to help load the trunks of the taxis in front of them. In convenience stores, yellow-haired girls with ghostly eye shadow prove as disarmingly helpful and polite as recent finishing-school graduates. On March 3 this year, as every year, families nibbled on diamond-shaped rice cakes with pink and white and green layers and sent straw dolls floating down a stream in honor of Hina Matsuri, Girls' Day.
Over the 25 years I've been living around Kyoto, I've seen the city of 1,600 temples grow ever more festive, international and colorful. True, shameless developers continue to tear down wooden buildings to make room for ugly concrete blocks, and the narrow traffic lanes are increasingly crowded with cars.
Yet in other ways, the heart of Japanese culture is ever younger and hipper; its student culture (there are 38 centers of higher learning around Kyoto) was evident this month in improvised dance performances and art shows around downtown; new design hotels are appearing with every season; and temples now throw open their gates after nightfall so you can walk through illuminated wonder worlds in the dark.
Kyoto is still the ancestral home of the tea ceremony and kimono and Zen meditation; but it's also a uniquely stylish place housing Japan's first manga museum, a 15-story futuristic cube of a train station and the headquarters of Nintendo.
Signs are now in English (they weren't when I arrived), as are announcements on trains and buses. The strong yen makes prices 50 percent higher for those carrying dollars than they were five years ago, but Japan is still less expensive than Britain or much of Northern Europe, especially if you use a Japan Rail Pass and are careful about where you stay (a pizza at my local coffee shop costs less than $5 -- no taxes or tips to worry about -- and a can of high-end cappuccino from a vending machine, $1.50). Most of all, Japan remains less like anywhere else than anywhere else I know.
NONE of this is to deny the horror of last year's catastrophes. When I visited Sendai, the northern city closest to the epicenter of the earthquake, four months ago, I found the downtown area as bustling and brightly lighted as ever. But only 40 minutes away by car were harrowing scenes: pieces of laundry hanging outside completely gutted houses; gravestones toppled over.
That same month I visited the nearby fishing village of Ishinomaki, laid waste by the tsunami, with the Dalai Lama, and even this generally imperturbable leader of the Tibetans could not hold back his tears. Around the Fukushima nuclear plant, when I went there in October, stores were shuttered and streets bare save for workers from the plant killing time in pinball arcades or deserted three-table tearooms where the Beach Boys were singing ''I Get Around,'' again and again.
Yet even there, at a resort hotel barely an hour from the nuclear plant, the breakfast room was packed with eager golfers from Tokyo waiting to hit the first nine at dawn, in the pelting rain.
It's hard for outsiders to appreciate how much, after more than a thousand years of fires and earthquakes and wars, Japan is primed for adversity. Its people are notably cautious and prudent, but they're not given to wasted emotion. My Japanese wife, Hiroko, whose family comes from Hiroshima, saw her first grandchild born in Yokohama last year only to face a nuclear meltdown barely 150 miles away when the baby was all of 2 weeks old. Take sensible precautions, Hiroko told her son, but remember that nowhere will be entirely safe.
The boy who grew up next to us sent his own infant daughter -- and wife -- to live in Osaka, 250 miles from his Tokyo flat, but he continues to work in the capital, 130 miles from the nuclear plant.
Visitors today can therefore enjoy all of Japan's beauties, undiminished, while also offering moral and even practical support. A Discover Tohoku Tour is offering four- or six-day excursions to the places of beauty near the center of last year's tragedy, among them the classic island-dotted bay around Matsushima and the World Heritage site temples of Hiraizumi.
This month one of the many new low-cost airlines coming to Japan, Peach Aviation, takes to the skies with trips from Osaka to faraway Sapporo for less than $60, a sixth of what a train might cost.
In Mitsuyo Kakuta's ''Pieces,'' perhaps the subtlest and most beautiful story in ''March Was Made of Yarn,'' an anthology of short fiction just published in memory of last year's disasters, a woman in middle age looks back on her life after she learns that her husband had been with a young mistress at the time of the Great Tokyo Blackout.
''To acquire was not to be happy,'' she had learned during Japan's boom years, and now she sees that ''loss was not the root of unhappiness.'' As lights come back to her city, she reflects that the happy moments in her life cannot erase the losses she's known; nor can those losses ever keep her from knowing happiness.
To hold those two ideas in your head as many in Japan do -- to see that life means a joyful participation in a world of sorrows, and that suffering is not the same as unhappiness -- is one of the singular blessings this seasoned country still has to offer.
Paper cherry blossoms are fluttering above the stalls leading to the great Kannon Temple in the Asakusa district of Tokyo right now, and in the eighth-century capital of Nara, girls are carrying parasols under the plum blossoms to shield their faces from the bright spring sun.

HEADLINE: So You Want to Go to Myanmar?

BYLINE: By CEIL MILLER-BOUCHET

 BODY:
IT'S rare that a country bursts onto the tourism scene with quite as much vigor as Myanmar. After decades of isolation, it is Asia's newest hot spot, offering richly layered history, spectacular natural beauty and the edginess that comes with a country still in transition. Since the ruling military junta began to loosen its grip on the government in November 2010, signs of progress -- like the release of some political prisoners earlier this year and elections scheduled for April 1, with the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi running for a seat in Parliament -- have led Western nations, including the United States, to consider dropping long-held economic sanctions.
But a visit to the country, also known as Burma, can be a bit tricky. Here, then, is a cheat sheet for a visit. 
BEFORE YOU GO
Although it is now possible to get a visa on arrival, travel agents recommend having one in hand before your trip begins. Arrangements take up to three weeks and can be made via travel agents or directly through the Myanmar Embassy in Washington. Instructions can be found on the Web site (mewashingtondc.com/visas--passports.htm).
Most tourists visit during the dry season, from November to February. Vaccinations are not required, but Myanmar travel experts like Eric Kareus, the Asia destination manager at Asia Transpacific Journeys, recommend making sure your tetanus, typhoid and polio shots are up-to-date, and getting a hepatitis A vaccination. He added that travelers to remote areas, especially during the summer monsoon season, should consider prophylactic malarial medication.
Since Myanmar's economy is still cash based, plan to pack enough crisp, new dollars (accepted almost everywhere) for expenses, or settle lodging and flights in advance through a travel agent.
GETTING THERE
Although Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, is served from most major Asian hubs (there are no direct flights from the United States), the shortest and most convenient connections are from Bangkok. Depending on the season, up to eight flights a day -- including service by AirAsia (airasia.com), a regional low-cost carrier -- make the 90-minute trip. Well-maintained regional jets link major cities within the country.
LODGING
Accommodations generally provide excellent value (especially compared with neighboring Thailand) and range from smallish luxury properties in Yangon to friendly family-run hotels and tropical boutique resorts in other key areas. Thanks to the British colonial legacy, English is widely spoken in the major tourist areas.
SAFETY
Karen MacRae, a senior destination expert at Kensington Tours, said Myanmar is safe for families and described it as ''a whole country full of gentle people.'' However, rebel groups continue to be active in northern regions of the country, so tourists should stick to the south and central areas. But crime statistics are low -- the State Department Web site specifically mentions that ''violent crime against foreigners is rare'' -- and the Burmese generally welcome visitors.
As in many developing countries, travelers should drink bottled water only and avoid raw food except at tourist-friendly restaurants.
WHAT TO EAT
Which isn't to say that adventurous eating shouldn't be high on your agenda. Burmese cuisine is heavily influenced by its neighbors: India, China, Thailand. Ms. MacRae, who lived in Myanmar for two years, recommended lighter dishes like laphet, a pickled tea-leaf salad, and mohinga, a fish broth-based noodle soup ''akin to Vietnamese pho'' and best eaten, she said, at a Yangon street stall.
WHERE TO GO
The classic Myanmar itinerary begins in Yangon, where visitors will want to spend at least a day visiting the Shwedagon Pagoda -- a towering stupa covered in pure gold -- wandering among the colonial-era buildings downtown and bargaining for local crafts at the covered Scott Market.
Bagan, a dusty region 300 miles north of Yangon along the Irrawaddy River, is studded with thousands of bell-shaped stupas, brick temples and castlelike structures that date from the 11th to 13th centuries. Bagan can be reached from Yangon by air or via comfortable cruise boats that ply the Irrawaddy to and from Mandalay, in the central area of the country.
Both Lake Inle, in ethnically diverse Shan State, and Ngapali Beach, along the country's western Bay of Bengal shoreline, are good places for low-key R & R, with new resorts opening regularly. Emerging destinations include the pristine Mergui Archipelago in the southeast, great for snorkeling, and Mrauk-U, a 15th-century royal capital in the southwestern state of Rakhine.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Where Art Is Life, Ax Falls on Public Financing

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
European governments are cutting their support for culture, and American arts lovers are starting to feel the results.
In Italy, the world-famous opera house La Scala faces a $9 million shortfall because of reductions in subsidies. In the Netherlands, government financing for arts programs has been cut by 25 percent. Portugal has abolished its Ministry of Culture.
Europe's economic problems, and the austerity programs meant to address them, are forcing arts institutions there to curtail programs, tours and grants. As a result, some ensembles are scaling down their productions and trying to raise money from private donors, some in the United States, potentially putting them in competition with American arts organizations.
For Americans used to seeing the best and most adventuresome European culture on tour in this country, the belt-tightening is beginning to affect both the quantity and quality of arts exchanges. At least three European troupes that were expected to perform in January at the Under the Radar theater festival in New York, for example, had to withdraw as they could not afford the travel costs, and the organizers could not either. 
''It is putting a pretty serious crimp in international exchanges, especially with smaller companies,'' said Mark Russell, artistic director of Under the Radar. ''It's a very frustrating environment we're in right now, tight in part because of our own crash, but more generally because it seems to me now that every time we get around to the international question, we have a meltdown and go back to zero.''
For artists and administrators in Europe, such changes are deeply disquieting, even revolutionary. In contrast to the United States, Europe has embraced a model that views culture not as a commodity, in which market forces determine which products survive, but as a common legacy to be nurtured and protected, including art forms that may lack mass appeal.
''Culture is a basic need,'' said Andreas Stadler, director of the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York and president of the New York branch of the European Union National Institutes for Culture. ''People should have the right to go to the opera.''
Over all, he added, ''Culture is much higher on our political agenda than it is here, because it is so linked to our identities.''
Germany and France, the largest and most stable economies in Europe, are suffering the least and can even point to increases in financing for some officially favored programs, genres and ensembles that are seen as promoting the countries' images abroad, like film.
But other countries with governments that are led by conservatives or technocrats -- like Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands and Britain -- have had their culture budgets slashed. So have others that are being forced to cut public spending to remain in the euro zone, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland.
In the case of the Netherlands, the culture budget is being cut by about $265 million, or 25 percent, by the start of 2013, and taxes on tickets to cultural events are to rise to 19 percent from 6 percent, although movie theaters, sporting events, zoos and circuses are exempted. The state secretary of education, culture and science, Halbe Zijlstra, has described his focus as being ''more than quality, a new vision of cultural policy,'' in which institutions must justify what they do economically and compete for limited funds.
In practical terms, that has meant that smaller companies, especially those engaged in experimental and avant-garde efforts, bear the brunt of the projected cuts. Large, established institutions, like the Rijksmuseum, the van Gogh Museum, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Dutch National Ballet, are in a better position to fend for themselves.
''The economy is not that good any more, so to get support, you have to be a large company with an international reputation,'' said Michael Nieuwenhuizen, the senior project manager for international affairs of the Netherlands Music Center. ''Plus, the government wants to see value for the money and links that to the markets, so that if you have an audience, you get rewarded.''
As a result, he added, ''we're going to lose some orchestras and choirs.''
And in the dance field, said Sophie Lambo, managing director of the Internationaal Danstheater, of Amsterdam, ''it's going to be a tsunami.''
In the boom years before the economic crisis hit late in 2008, it was not uncommon for touring European orchestras, ballet and opera companies and theater troupes to travel beyond New York, to cities like Minneapolis and San Diego. That has now become more difficult, and when it occurs, the European performers expect their American hosts to cover more of the costs.
''We have less money and have changed our concept of cooperation,'' said Mr. Stadler of the group of European cultural institutes, which has 44 members. ''We expect more from our partners and we will negotiate tougher.''
The cutbacks are hitting so hard that some of the cultural institutes in New York that have been intermediaries for arts companies in their home countries have experienced reductions of staff or salary, or both.
The crisis is also affecting what kind of art is performed and how it is made. After returning from Europe last month, Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center and Spoleto arts festivals, said that a trend toward new work with fewer characters or players, especially with commissioned pieces, seemed to be growing.
''Many playwrights are writing things for three performers instead of eight, and if you are a composer, you may be writing for a chamber group rather than a symphony,'' he said. ''That also is a factor of the current climate: artists want to have their work performed, and smaller productions are inevitably less expensive to put on.''
Some of those scaled-down works are now beginning to find their way to the United States. The lineup for this summer's Lincoln Center Festival, announced last week, includes ''Emilie,'' a 2010 ''monodrama'' opera for a single singer, written by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho, which had its American premiere last year at Spoleto.
In New York, European arts institutions are also looking for smaller, less expensive places to present their offerings. ''Why spend so much money on Carnegie Hall when there are cheaper places available?'' one organizer of cultural exchanges said, insisting on anonymity so as not to jeopardize business ties.
Others are trying to forge closer ties to American institutions. The Romanian Film Festival, which has done much to promote awareness of the Romanian new wave of prizewinning directors and actors, was presented last year at Lincoln Center with the Film Society of Lincoln Center as a co-sponsor.
''Compared to five years ago, we no longer think of doing things alone, on our own'' said Corina Suteu, of the Romanian Cultural Institute. ''All of a sudden, you have to become creative, you need to look for partners, whether American, European or even from other continents. I'm doing this, and all of my colleagues are doing the same.''
As they scramble to stay afloat, affected institutions in Europe are also cultivating private donors anywhere they can be found. But with little experience with, or understanding of, that kind of fund-raising, they often turn for advice to the American institutions with which they have built longstanding affiliations.
''I can tell you that across the board, they are talking about their governments saying that they are going to have to move toward an American model,'' said Joseph V. Melillo, executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. ''But there's no tradition of individual philanthropy in many of these cultures, and so they lack both the motivation and tax incentives to give.''
As a result, some European arts institutions have begun looking for financial support in the United States, courting American companies or wealthy Americans with emotional ties to an ancestral homeland. But that means, as Mr. Stadler acknowledged, that ''we are also competing with American institutions, which are also hit hard.''
Artists worry that money will flow to established entities that tend to be more conservative, rather than to more experimental companies that have served as incubators of new talents. That, they say, has profound implications for the artistic process.
The established companies ''need to refresh their work by working with younger artists, and it's the small and middle-sized companies that bring diversity and innovation,'' said Ivana Muller, a choreographer based in Amsterdam. ''You've created a different dynamic of production now,'' she added, ''and A lot of good work will disappear because it can't sustain itself.''
Even when the crisis subsides, many fear that the impact of the cuts could permanently affect every stage of the artistic process, from creation to consumption.
''Perhaps instead of doing Brian Friel, one does Noel Coward, because the box office is important,'' said Mr. Redden, the festival director, trying to put himself in the place of his European counterparts. ''Some of these trade-offs are inevitable, but I think that if it becomes all drawing room comedies and not gritty theater, it would be devastating. It has not gotten to that yet, but there is definitely a kind of calibration going on.''

HEADLINE: Just the Facts. Yes, All of Them.

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
AT 7 years old, Gilad Elbaz wrote, ''I want to be a rich mathematician and very smart.'' That, he figured, would help him ''discover things like time machines, robots and machines that can answer any question.''
In the 34 years since, Mr. Elbaz has accomplished big chunks of these goals. He has built Web-traversing software robots and answered some very big questions for Google, along the way becoming a millionaire several hundred times over.
His time-machine plans, however, have been ditched for something he finds more important: trying to identify every fact in the world, and to hold them all in a company he calls Factual.
''The world is one big data problem,'' Mr. Elbaz says from his headquarters, a quiet office 14 floors above the Los Angeles Country Club. He is a slim, soft-spoken man who weaves in his chair when an idea excites him. ''What if you could spot any error, as soon as you wrote it? Factual is definitely a new thing that will change business, and a valuable new tool for computing.'' 
In the booming world of Big Data, where once-unimaginably huge amounts of information are scoured for world-changing discoveries, Mr. Elbaz may be the most influential inventor and investor. Besides Factual, he has interests in 30 start-ups, including an incubator in San Francisco dedicated to Big Data. Factual's headquarters, in a high-rise on the Avenue of the Stars, hosts seminars for a data community he hopes to foster in the Los Angeles area.
Mr. Elbaz also serves on the boards of the California Institute of Technology, his alma mater, and the X Prize Foundation, which offers cash prizes to teams that meet challenges in space flight, medicine and genomics. The company he sold to Google, Applied Semantics, is the basis of Google's AdSense business, which brings Google close to $10 billion in revenue annually.
While valued for his investments and guidance, Mr. Elbaz remains relatively little-known. He is so self-effacing that he recently walked through a conference of 3,000 data scientists, recognized only by the staff members of one of his investments. He lives quietly with his wife, a former federal prosecutor, and his three children in a modest ranch house in West Hollywood. For fun, he plays basketball at a local sports club.
His mental and financial assets, he says, are like gifts he needs to deploy so the world works better.
''If all data was clear, a lot fewer people would subtract value from the world,'' he says. ''A lot more people would add value.''
Creating clear, reliable data could also make Factual a very big company.
''Gil is pretty far ahead of the rest of us, the one entrepreneur where it takes a few meetings before I really understand everything he is talking about,'' says Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist who backed Factual through his firm, Andreessen Horowitz. ''Three years ago, he thought Factual was his biggest chance to change the world. Over time, the world has moved his way.''
Since its start in 2008, Factual has absorbed what Mr. Elbaz terms ''many billions of individual facts we've collated.''
Geared to both big companies and smaller software developers, it includes available government data, terabytes of corporate data and information on 60 million places in 50 countries, each described by 17 to 40 attributes. Factual knows more than 800,000 restaurants in 30 different ways, including location, ownership and ratings by diners and health boards. It also contains information on half a billion Web pages, a list of America's high schools and data on the offices, specialties and insurance preferences of 1.8 million United States health care professionals. There are also listings of 14,000 wine grape varietals, of military aircraft accidents from 1950 to 1974, and of body masses of major celebrities. Odd facts matter too, Mr. Elbaz notes.
He keeps 500 terabytes of storage near Factual's headquarters. That's about twice the amount needed to hold the entire Library of Congress. He has more data stored inside Amazon's giant cloud of computers. His statisticians have cleaned and corrected data to account for things like how different health departments score sanitation, whether the term ''middle school'' means two years or three in a particular town, and whether there were revisions between an original piece of data and its duplicate.
Factual's plan, outlined in a big orange room with a few tables and walled with whiteboards, is to build the world's chief reference point for thousands of interconnected supercomputing clouds. The digital world is expected to hold a collective 2.7 zettabytes of data by year-end, an amount roughly equivalent to 700 billion DVDs. Factual, which now has 50 employees, could prove immensely valuable as this world grows and these databases begin to interact.
FACTUAL sells data to corporations and independent software developers on a sliding scale, based on how much the information is used. Small data feeds for things like prototypes are free; contracts with its biggest customers run into the millions. Sometimes, Factual trades data with other companies, building its resources.
Some current uses are for adding information like restaurant locations to cellphone maps, or for planning sales campaigns. But more broadly, Factual is meant for the heart of a great business of our age: using all the cloud-based data and algorithms to find patterns in nature and society, for scientists to observe and businesses to exploit.
''Data has always been seen as just a side effect in computing, something you look up while you are doing work,'' Mr. Elbaz says. ''We see it as a whole separate layer that everyone is going to have to tap into, data you want to solve a problem, but that you might not have yourself, and completely reliable.''
A restaurant chain, for example, might use Factual to figure out whether a new location is near the competition, and how the locals have talked about the place on Yelp, the social ratings site. Checking for gas stations near the restaurant can indicate how many cars come off the highway. The chain can also employ Factual to see where it is mentioned on the Web, or to correct what other people are saying about it.
Financed with $27 million by a constellation of Silicon Valley luminaries, Factual remains closely held. But it already has thousands of customers. Facebook, CitySearch, AT&T and others use it for information about places. Newsweek used the database to help rank America's greenest companies.
Others use Factual data for tasks like product planning and customer care. There are no profits yet, as Mr. Elbaz puts money into more data sets and talent, which already includes advanced mathematicians, data scientists from LinkedIn and Google, and at least one specialist in late Roman archaeology.
Competitors in the new industry include Microsoft, which says its Windows Azure Marketplace has ''trillions of data points,'' as well as a language translator. People can sell data sets to Azure, too. Infochimps offers geographic and social data, among other kinds, while companies like Gnip and Datasift offer insights from Twitter and other social sites. Wolfram Alpha, founded by another mathematician, has both data and computations that are used by Apple's Siri, among others.
And a young company called ClearStory, also financed by Andreessen Horowitz, is trying to tie together all of these companies, often called data marts, in a way ordinary people can use. There are also several open-source data repositories, with public and private information that developers plug into their algorithms.
Several other data specialists, mostly from Google, have left their jobs to wrangle lots of information in new ways. David Friedberg, a former product manager at Google, has started the Climate Corporation, which uses government data on weather, soil porosity and the root structures of wheat and soybeans to write crop insurance.
Mr. Elbaz is also an investor in Kaggle, which awards cash for finding data patterns. It was used by NASA, for example, to find a better way to measure the shape of galaxies; in the first week of competition, a Ph.D. student in glacier mapping had outperformed NASA's algorithms. He has also put money into ZestCash, which makes payday loans that are cheaper than the industry's average, judging risk via criteria like cellphone bills and how its applicants read the ZestCash Web site.
The ZestCash C.E.O., Douglas Merrill, once ran Google's internal information systems.
''We feel like all data is credit data, we just don't know how to use it yet,'' he says. ''This is the math we all learned at Google. A page was important for what was on it, but also for how good the grammar was, what the type font was, when it was created or edited. Everything. What Gil is doing at Factual is the same. Data matters. More data is always better.''
MR. ELBAZ was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Ohio, Texas and Florida. His father, who was born in Morocco and grew up in Israel, was a school principal and professor of Hebrew literature. His mother, a journalist, died when Mr. Elbaz was 18. At age 3, he began writing a repeating series of numbers at preschool. He read almanacs and enjoyed watching the crawl of stock prices on TV, seeking patterns.
''He would go to a lot of math competitions, and come out with three or four prizes,'' says Nissim Elbaz, Mr. Elbaz's father. ''In between the math contests he'd take tests in physics for fun. When I would tell him what a genius he was, he'd give me a dirty look, so I learned to keep it in my heart.''
The elder Mr. Elbaz recalls that when he tried to explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to him, the son replied that the hatred would end if the two sides could just agree on the facts.
From an early age, Mr. Elbaz would also figure out math-related businesses -- like buying the entire supply of a single brand of baseball cards in El Paso, Tex., then reselling them at three times the money at a memorabilia convention.
''We'd do lotteries based on guessing the number of marbles in a jar,'' says Eytan Elbaz, his younger brother, who has worked with Gil and now has two start-ups of his own. ''When he was 16, he held a contest based on rolling a Yahtzee dice. He stayed up the night before making a spreadsheet to figure out all the payouts against what we'd take in.'' Mr. Elbaz's other brother, Noam, has spent the last decade studying at a yeshiva in Israel.
At Caltech, Mr. Elbaz majored in applied science and economics. Interested in the subject of monopolies, he won an award for a paper that determined that companies would take financial losses to corner their markets.
He worked for I.B.M. for two years, looking at the use of computers in problems of manufacturing, then went to Sybase, a database company. This was in the early 1990s, when I.B.M. was stumbling in the transition from mainframe computers to servers and PCs.
His younger brother says he thinks that the experience changed him. Many employees were ''just trying to hold on to their jobs, not working together for the company,'' Eytan says. He recalls how Gil, concerned about how employees were hoarding their data, ''started talking about how much better it would be if people shared data.''
Mr. Elbaz then joined a semiconductor start-up called Microunity and became a consultant, saving money and playing the stock market to help finance his own first business. His father gave him $10,000 to invest for him, which Mr. Elbaz tripled in 18 months. When Mr. Elbaz and a Caltech friend decided to form a company in 1998 -- it became Applied Semantics -- his father told him to put the stock winnings into it.
Applied Semantics software quickly scanned thousands of Web pages for their meaning. By parsing content, it could tell businesses what kind of ads would work well on a particular page. It had 45 employees and was profitable when Google acquired it in 2003 for $102 million in cash and pre-I.P.O. stock.
While Mr. Elbaz would not say how much he made from the deal, his father's $30,000 from the stock investments was eventually worth $18 million. ''He certainly changed my retirement,'' Nissim Elbaz says.
Mr. Elbaz became the head of Google's engineering office in Santa Monica, Calif., near where he lives with his wife, Elyssa, and three sons. He has donated several million dollars to a handful of causes, including science education, environmental efforts and an organization that helps Los Angeles nonprofit groups. He has also donated to Common Crawl, a Google-type Web examination tool that researchers can access through Amazon's computers.
''Having money is overrated when you are brought up not to believe you are entitled to it,'' he says. ''You can make enough money to not need things, or you can just not need things.''
In 2007, Mr. Elbaz left Google to start Factual. When Mr. Horowitz, who along with Marc Andreessen runs Andreessen Horowitz, was asked to invest in Factual in 2009, he struggled with the idea that Mr. Elbaz would want to work hard on another start-up when he was already rich. But when Mr. Elbaz described his palace of facts, Mr. Horowitz said he recognized a true believer.
''I asked him, 'Aren't you too rich to build this company?' '' Mr. Horowitz recalls. ''He gave me one of the longest and most thought-out answers I'd ever heard. He thinks this is a chance to change the world -- that matters to him more than money.'' Mr. Horowitz says Mr. Elbaz told him he needed the money as an incentive for the engineers, and that he needed to reach his goal while his mind was still strong enough.
''I eventually realized this was not a 'too rich to work hard' problem.'' Mr. Horowitz said.
Other investors in Factual include Ron Conway, Esther Dyson, Index Ventures and the Founder Collective.
FACTUAL also has offices in Shanghai and in Palo Alto, Calif., where Mr. Elbaz wants to add more talent from Silicon Valley. His first two employees in Palo Alto were Tim Chklovski, with a doctorate from M.I.T. in artificial intelligence, and Tyler Bell, who worked at Yahoo on maps after a decade at Oxford piecing together how ancient Rome became early Europe.
''Roman amphorae get dug up around Europe, and get described in all sorts of different ways, in different languages,'' Mr. Bell says. ''What we do here is the same kind of restoration. We started to learn it well when we had one million data sets uploaded. The early stuff was things like senators and how they voted, or ZIP codes, types of cigars, lists of video games. Merging ZIP codes is easy. Merging different ways people feel about toys is hard.''
Part of the difficulty, even among employees, is deciding how much data is enough. ''For sure, we want the correct name and location of every gas station on the globe,'' Mr. Bell says. ''Not the price changes at every station.''
''Wait a minute, I'd like to know every gallon of gasoline that flows around the world,'' Mr. Chklovski cuts in. ''That might take us 20 years, but it would be interesting.''
At most start-ups, talk about doing the same kind of thing, only bigger and better, 20 years from now might seem like a marriage of the delusional and the dull. Mr. Elbaz and his team, however, say they feel that it makes sense. Telling everyone the true facts of the world is at least the work of a lifetime.
''Lately, I've been thinking that we need to get more personal data,'' Mr. Elbaz says. He doesn't mean names and addresses, but their genetic information, what they ate, when and where they exercised -- ideally, for everyone on the planet, now and forever. ''I want to figure out a way,'' he says, ''to get people to leave their data to science.''

HEADLINE: The Flight to Beauty

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
Maastricht, the Netherlands
THE lady in pearls was shimmying under a table. Valentino skirt tucked primly around her knees, she lay on her back beaming a flashlight on a yellowed label, a scrap of paper that lent apparent weight to the proposition that the article on view was as old as its seller claimed.
This was at the European Fine Art Fair, where it is not at all unusual to see well-polished people getting intimate with French-waxed consoles, where old specimens can be seen squinting through loupes at granite busts of even older specimens and where for the past quarter-century the acquisitive rich have descended each spring in hordes. The early social arbiter Emily Post once characterized groups like this as the Worldlys, the Oldnames and the Eminents.
Post was referring to proto-1-percenters, people who in her quaintly cockeyed view were somehow ''innately exclusive.'' Updated for a new century, her list of the economically anointed would likely include some new names -- the Megabucks, say, or the Birkins (for the Hermes bag that has become the LeSportsac of the rich) and also the Tail Numbers, a title denoting a group that seems to get around on only private jets. 
All of them arrived last week in this sleepy city a 90-minute drive east of Brussels for the silver anniversary of an annual event that -- like other points on an increasingly important circuit of international art and antiques fairs -- is a destination for a restless and vagrant tribe seemingly always on the move.
There amid the hordes of bejeweled and tailored patrons at a V.I.P. opening were the New York philanthropist Beth Rudin DeWoody, Calvin Klein and Joel Arthur Rosenthal, the Bronx-reared and Paris-based jeweler to the super-rich who styles himself as JAR. There were the billionaire Sheik Saud al-Thani of Qatar and regulars like the British artist Marc Quinn, the New York socialite Susan Gutfreund and Tomas Maier, the designer for Bottega Veneta.
People who pay attention to these things can surely recall the slyly haughty slogan for that label, created by the advertising whiz Peter Rogers decades before Bottega Veneta was swallowed up by the Gucci Group: ''When Your Own Initials Are Enough.''
The sort of buyers one sees at the Maastricht art fair are not only gratified by their own monograms or cyphers, but also have titles and crests. As antic and gauche and hilariously brash as contemporary art extravaganzas like Frieze in London or Art Basel Miami Beach assuredly are, it is a fact that one will never spot Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands judging a Kim Kardashian look-alike contest or darting around booths at the Miami Beach Convention Center shopping for Damien Hirst spin-art or a Chris Ofili picture ornamented with elephant dung.
It is apt that a Dutch queen often characterized as a low-key royal should have opened a fair sometimes characterized as the anti-Art Basel, a determinedly quiet assemblage of 260 dealers who this year brought along with them $1.5 billion worth of old master pictures, archaic Chinese bronzes, so-called fine French furniture and virtually anything bearing the stamp of antiquity.
Dealers who arrived at the fair, which opened for an invitation-only preview on March 15, fretful that the economic woes of the euro zone would cut into sales, seemed to breathe more easily when big-ticket items sold quickly. Maastricht is a long fair -- 10 days -- and it is too early to gauge the final results. Yet perhaps what the New York antiques dealer Carlton Hobbs called ''the flight to beauty'' among the super wealthy was evidenced by the fact that, within hours of the fair's preview opening, a Rubens Crucifixion sold for perhaps as much as $3.9 million to a Boston couple; a copy of Holbein's famous portrait of Henry VIII sold to an English collector for $:2.5 million, or $4 million; a suite of 18th-century intarsia pictures of German castles from Mr. Hobbs's booth sold to an unidentified collector for $665,000; and a rare Jean Prouve armchair brought to Maastricht by Axel Vervoordt, the Belgian antiquarian and tastemaker, and priced at close to $1 million, was dispatched to a European collector.
So were the venerable wood-paneled walls, costing about $291,000, that made up Mr. Vervoordt's display. Booths bristled with the tiny red stickers that indicate a work has been sold. ''There's a definite buzz,'' said Mr. Hobbs who brought along a 13-foot tall gilded frame by the 18th-century English carver Paul Petit, ornamented with three-dimensional representations of eagles, what its creator called ''savages,'' as well as drums and flags.
''You get the sense that people are coming here ready to spend,'' Mr. Hobbs said.
Evidently they came with the itch. An Italian banking heiress arrived eager to see some fresh-to-the-market slashed canvases by Lucio Fontana, an Argentina-born Arte Povera painter from Italy; an austere still life of bowls by the Italian painter Giorgio Morandi; and an 18th-dynasty Egyptian figure of a walking man.
''There were three at the fair,'' the heiress said with some surprise, referring to those wooden sculptures. ''Stone is one thing, but you have to question how wood survived all these years.''
One of the draws for the 70,000 visitors and collectors at Maastricht is the rigorous authenticating process of the 30,000 objects that are shown here. In the days before the fair opens to the public, an impartial panel of specialists examines the goods on offer, allowing only those that pass historicist muster to be sold.
That fact underscores a shift in the art market over recent decades, the growth of a cadre of advisers and experts who guide and protect their wealthy charges from the chicanery and pitfalls that abound in the art and antiques trades.
The Italian heiress, who preferred to remain nameless, arrived at Maastricht by private jet in a group that included her father and the suave Milan-based dealer Matteo Lampertico.
''We like one of the Morandis,'' Mr. Lampertico said over risotto at a dinner at the Beaumont Hotel on the night of the fair's opening.
''More than that I don't say,'' Mr. Lampertico added. ''You damage the painting if you talk too much.''
Damage control is naturally essential to a market, said Clare McAndrew, the founder of the research and advisory firm Art Economics, which trades in intangibles like perceived beauty and relies on that most mercurial of all qualities: taste.
''Even ultra-high-net-worth individuals,'' she noted, were spooked away from the marketplace at the onset of the recession, along with everyone else.
''Art may have held its value compared to other luxury goods,'' she said, yet its overall value dropped by a third two years ago.
''Before 2007, it was possible to sell virtually anything, and now it's not so easy to do so,'' Dr. McAndrew said. That reality is acutely felt in countries like the United States, which lost its traditionally dominant edge in the global arts and antiques trade to China for the first time last year ''Still, many people look at art as a safe haven, a place to park money,'' she said. ''There are not that many rosy alternatives around.''
Once upon a time in the 1980s, Ms. Gutfreund, a decorator, socialite and wife of the financier John Gutfreund, was an emblem of a certain kind of consumer excess.
Ms. Gutfreund, a former flight attendant who now describes herself as a ''hausfrau,'' owns a Fifth Avenue duplex and still maintains residences around the world.
''I'm not collecting things,'' Ms. Gutfreund said, as she sipped Champagne at the Derek Johns booth, where the specialty is old masters paintings.
''I'm getting rid of things,'' she said. ''I'm getting rid of a 6,000-square-foot house in Paris originally arranged by the decorating great Henri Samuel and sending everything to Christie's. But I'm not doing what everyone my age is doing and going modern. I'm classic. I dress classic. I decorate classic. I don't see myself doing what people my age do and living in a plain white cube.''
Ms. Gutfreund was one of the guests who'd gathered to celebrate the publication of ''Masterpieces of Orientalist Art,'' a monograph focusing on a collection assembled over the last 18 years by Shafik Gabr, a billionaire Egyptian financier.
Mr. Gabr had flown in from his house in London (he also has places in Cairo, Prague and Washington) on a private jet, bringing along guests, including the former Pakistani prime minister Shaukat Aziz, a passel of minor nobilities and the Chinese entrepreneur Angela Chen.
''Collecting is about connecting to people and sharing,'' said Mr. Gabr, whose dark sunglasses were perhaps worn as protection against the blinding gloss of pictures varnished and restored to the high finish modern collectors seem to prefer.
Collecting, Ms. Chen said, is indeed about sharing. Ms. Chen came accompanied by her current boyfriend, a French count, and her good friend, the German duchess Alexandra von Croy.
''She has everything I want: a position, a title, a husband, six children,'' Ms. Chen said of Ms. von Croy. ''And I have everything she wants, meaning freedom and money.''
Mr. Gabr alighted in the Netherlands just long enough to host a Friday night dinner -- for Ms. Chen, Ms. von Croy and several dozen recently acquired friends -- at a chateau outside Maastricht before hopping his jet home well in advance of the Cinderella hour.
But like a true collector, he somehow found time to make a new purchase. Nobody likes to leave an art fair empty-handed.
''We found the most amazing Art Deco sculpture in the Egyptian style,'' said Wendy Goldsmith, a former Christie's executive who oversees Mr. Gabr's collection. ''It's the kind of thing that proves why you need Maastricht, because we never would have seen it anywhere but here.''
Why was that, she was asked?
''It was being offered'' by a gallery in East Nowhere, Germany, Ms. Goldsmith added, although ''nowhere'' was not exactly the word she used.

 BODY:
The 1.7 million members of the Class of 2011 witnessed, within the four-year span of their college careers, one of the greatest bull markets in United States history and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Last spring, they shed their caps and gowns and joined a kind of B.A. bread line. Unemployment among recent liberal-arts graduates, at 9.4 percent, was higher than the national average, and student-loan debt, at an average of nearly $25,000, had reached record levels. Worse still, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was reporting that only 5 of the 20 jobs projected to grow fastest over the coming decade would require a bachelor's degree. Though the statistics still show that a college degree correlates with both higher income and lower unemployment in the long run, diplomas didn't seem very valuable when they were handed out last May. 
Graduating seniors at schools like Drew University in Madison, N.J., have felt the stresses of the job market acutely. For all its merits -- including a much-admired theater department and a prestigious Wall Street internship program -- Drew ranks 94th among 178 private liberal-arts colleges on U.S. News & World Report's annual list. The middle of the collegiate pack is not where you want to be when you're competing for a diminishing number of entry-level jobs.
Members of Drew's Class of '11 are typical of their peers nationally in that their success in the job market seems to have less to do with their G.P.A.'s or their persistence and more to do with their family connections, fields of study, networking skills and luck. How else to account for the unemployed Phi Beta Kappa waiting by a silent phone? Or the anthropology major who is forgoing grad school to become a dog groomer? Or the English major who can't earn enough money to make the monthly payment on her $128,000 student loan? (Drew is unusually expensive; tuition plus room and board run more than $50,000 a year.) Equals on campus, the 309 members of Drew's Class of '11 are already being divided into the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Seven months after graduation, The Times Magazine spoke with 226 of them about their rough journey into the real world.
THE SAMPLE
17% of our sample of Drew University's Class of 2011 is unemployed. 39% have full-time jobs, including six who have both full- and part-time jobs. 35% of students who are employed part time have two or more jobs. 74% of students who are interning are unpaid. 22% of students are in graduate school. 34% of jobs involve food service, retail, customer service, clerical or unskilled work.
THE CONTENTED LAYABOUT
I tried to join the military but was rejected. Right now I'm just hanging out at the apartment, just trying to have some fun. I'm one of those people who feels pretty confident that I can get whatever I want if I just try for it. I play poker once in a while to support myself.
Jonathan Pransky, unemployed
THE WOULD-BE BARISTA
Classicists aren't particularly in demand even when the economy's thriving, but I was optimistic that I'd at least be able to find an opening as a barista, which, considering my love for tea and coffee, would actually be pretty fun for me. I never would have thought that researching and writing a 10-page paper about societal attitudes toward marriage in ancient Rome and Greece would be easier than finding a part-time job.
Alex Alfaro, unemployed
THE CONFLICTED CAPITALIST
I never really saw myself in the finance sector, but I'm trying to be positive about it, even if part of me feels like a traitor for having a job on Wall Street when people are outside occupying it. I have to decide if I'm staying at this hedge-fund job -- how can I not when I see how difficult it is for people to find jobs? How can I turn this job down on principle? But the overall feeling I get from being in finance is that I don't really like the attitudes and the way things are done, so I'm kind of bargaining against myself. I'll wait it out a year, and then I want to try something else.
Allie, intern at a hedge fund
THE DISHEARTENED HONORS STUDENT
I will be brutally honest: my postgraduation experience has turned from hopeful to bitter very quickly. I powered through my four years of college with the assumption that doing well and getting my bachelor's degree would be the key to having a future. I graduated with a 3.76 G.P.A. and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. I joined the student council. I spent four summers interning for the Fresh Air Fund and volunteered for the Alzheimer's Association. I have nothing to show for my hard work but $24,000 in student loans. I've lost count of the number of job applications that have been ignored, and the ones that I did receive a response to still sting. I've stopped carrying both the house phone and my cellphone with me to every room that I move to, and I've stopped checking my e-mail every 20 minutes. I'm still trying because I have no other choice.
Kristin, unemployed
Number of mothers interviewed because their son or daughter couldn't get out of bed: 2.
THE DETOX GURU
I got sick freshman year, which led me to various nutritionists, which led me to start studying nutrition. After graduating, I didn't want to be at the mercy of the current job market, so I opened my own practice offering colonics-based nutritional treatments. I started out making $100 an hour. I never thought I'd be able to make this business succeed -- it's such an off-label product -- but it's doing really well, and I'm looking to expand within the year.
Maren Epstein, founder, H20:Flow
THE MOVER AND SHAKER
I currently have three jobs. None of them has any correlation with what I plan on doing in the future, though I do plan to continue to teach belly-dancing.
Eri Rosshirt, fund-raiser, Rutgers University; saleswoman at Kid's Consignments, and Athena's Home Novelties; M.A.T. degree candidate, Rutgers
Correction: An earlier version of this credit misspelled Ms. Rosshirt's surname as Rosshart.
THE DOG GROOMER
This was never the plan, but my friend's holistic pet-food store, where I'm currently working, is booming. So is another friend's grooming business. If anything, more money is being poured into pet care since the economy went bad. Eventually, I hope to start my own grooming business.
Jordan Stamper, part-time employee, holistic pet-food store
THE SCHMOOZER
A lot of it just came down to networking skills. I knew it was going to be hard, so I did a lot of internships. The best thing to do is to have them like you, to keep in contact during the year and hang out with them. I knew the job was there before I graduated. It comes down to networking well and knowing who you need to maintain relationships with when you're not there.
Alex Belfiore, trainee at the distressed-high-yield-bond desk, Tullet Prebon
Worst work schedule: 4 a.m. to noon stocking shelves at a department store at Christmastime.
THE REFUSENIK
I was offered an unpaid internship at a law firm but turned it down. If you can't pay me $10 an hour, you don't deserve to be in business. The job market makes me feel like stabbing myself in the face.
Adrienne Delibert, unemployed
THE CYNICAL SHOPGIRL
Honestly, I was one of those lost souls at graduation that every guidance counselor warns you about. I was thinking that maybe I'd join the Peace Corps, but then my dad said that because of my French major, they would send me to West Africa, and that's not exactly the safest place in the world. He was uberparanoid about that. I graduated from a really good school and learned another frigging language, and now I'm peddling $150 jeans to 50-year-old women who can't fit in them.
KELLEY, saleswoman at a clothing shop
THE ANXIOUS ATTORNEY-TO-BE
I feel very fortunate to have had an idea of what I wanted to do from such a young age, and even more fortunate that it involved graduate school. What can you do with a bachelor's degree anymore? I'm hoping that the job market will pick up in the three years I spend at law school, because a lot of lawyers are getting laid off. The American Bar Association is even encouraging college students not to apply to law school, citing the bleak job market.
Noah Rich, J.D. candidate, Georgetown Law
THE GOOD DAUGHTER
After I applied to over 100 jobs in the first month after graduation, including white-collar and blue-collar jobs, the only places to call me back were PetSmart, Wawa and Staples. I decided to work at Wawa, as it was the closest job to my house, though I nearly didn't get the job because they considered me overqualified. I took out loans from Sallie Mae in order to attend Drew, and now they're charging me $1,164 a month, which I definitely can't afford, especially now that I've quit my job at Wawa. I called Sallie Mae to try to change my loan payments, and they said there wasn't much they could do, and if I couldn't pay them, I would go into default. Because my parents are co-signers, Sallie Mae could put a lien on my parents' house.
Katelyn Noland, temporary administrative assistant at a labor union
THE SANDWICH ARTIST
My degree is in economics, and I was looking for a job in the sports industry. I work at a deli.
Brendan T. Michael, food-service employee
THE BANKER WHO DEFIED THE ODDS
Coming from a smaller school that is not Harvard or Columbia, you're not in the Top 5 or 10 on the radar for these larger banks. Basically the only interviews I got were through connections; most of them seemed like courtesy interviews. It becomes exponentially harder after the interview to actually land the job. I interviewed with Credit Agricole -- and then they went on a hiring freeze.
Benjamin Lynch, trader assistant at Fairfield Financial Advisors; masters in financial engineering candidate, Baruch College
Tersest interview: a 15-word text message (''Currently I am not working and I really don't have any comments on the subject'').
THE BIRTHER
I want to be more secure than my parents were. My father has been unemployed on and off since I was in high school, and my mother is an executive secretary. As a midwife, I can move easily and raise a family. A nursing degree will be a cushion should all else fail. Right now a lot is changing in women's health policy. Insurance companies don't want to pay as much, and studies show that women who use midwives have fewer complications and less postpartum depression. My friends all want to use midwives.
Katharene Suarez, part-time receptionist at OB/GYN clinic; part-time bakery employee; R.N. and midwifery degree candidate, City University of New York
THE APPLE THAT DIDN'T FALL FAR
I dreamed of writing an ethnography, but as I entered my senior year at Drew, those doors were closing fast. I heard from students who'd graduated ahead of me in poli sci and behavioral science that it's hell out there. You feel doom in the air. But it's not a sad story. I'd been taking my father's company for granted, and it's a beautiful opportunity in front of me. This is my career.
Cassie Schupp, property management assistant at Park Street Development Corp.
THE DREAMER
I guess I had unrealistic expectations. I thought that someone was going to hand me a job and say, ''You're the one we want and you'll go far, kid.'' That wasn't the case. Some days you just sleep in, and you're not sure why. But it ended up working out.
Matthew Miller, former legal assistant, now traveling in Spain
THE FORTUNATE ONE
I did a lot of hunting around job Web sites and sent out 150 applications. People do get lucky and like their first job.
Zachary Rapp, research technician in cancer genetics, Columbia University Medical Center

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2012

 CORRECTION:
A credit on March 25 with an article about the post-graduation experience of the Class of 2011 from Drew University in Madison, N.J., misspelled the surname of one member who wrote about the three jobs she is working now. She is Eri Rosshirt, not Rosshart. The credit for another member, Benjamin Lynch, misidentified his employer and misstated his current academic status. He works for Fairfield Advisors L.L.C.,not Fairfield Financial Advisors, and he is taking pre-master's financial engineering courses at Baruch; he is not a master's candidate in financial-engineering there. The article also misstated a category of liberal-arts colleges in an annual ranking by U.S.News & World Report; it is national, not private.

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL RICH

 BODY:
''We have snakes,'' Mary Brock said. ''Long, thick snakes. Kingsnakes, rattlesnakes.''
Brock was walking Pee Wee, a small, high-strung West Highland terrier who darted into the brush at the slightest provocation -- a sudden breeze, shifting gravel, a tour bus rumbling down Caffin Avenue several blocks east. But Pee Wee had reason to be anxious. Brock was anxious. Most residents of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans are anxious. ''A lot of people in my little area died after Katrina,'' Brock said. ''Because of too much stress.'' The most immediate sources of stress that October morning were the stray Rottweilers. Brock had seen packs of them in the wildly overgrown lots, prowling for food. Pee Wee, it seemed, had seen them, too. ''I know they used to be pets because they are beautiful animals.'' Brock corrected herself: ''They were beautiful animals. When I first saw them, they were nice and clean -- inside-the-house animals. But now they just look sad.'' 
The Lower Ninth has become a dumping ground for unwanted dogs and cats. People from all over the city take the Claiborne Avenue Bridge over the Industrial Canal, bounce along the fractured streets until they reach a suitably empty area and then toss the animals out of the car. But it's not just pets. The neighborhood has become a dumping ground for many kinds of unwanted things. Contractors, rather than drive to the city dump in New Orleans East, sweep trailers full of construction debris onto the street. Auto shops, rather than pay the tire-disposal fee ($2 a tire), dump tires by the dozen. The tire problem has become so desperate that the city is debating changes to the law. (One humble suggestion: a $2 reward per tire.) You also see burned piles of household garbage, cotton-candy-pink tufts of insulation foam, turquoise PVC pipes, sodden couches tumescing like sea sponges and abandoned cars. Sometimes the cars contain bodies. In August, the police discovered an incinerated corpse in a white Dodge Charger that was left in the middle of an abandoned lot near the intersection of Choctaw and Law, two blocks from where Mary Brock was walking Pee Wee. Nobody knew how long the car had been there; it was concealed from the closest house, half a block away, by 12-foot-high grass. That entire stretch of Choctaw Street, for that matter, was no longer visible. It had been devoured by forest. Every housing plot on both sides of the street for two blocks, between Rocheblave and Law, was abandoned. Through the weeds, you could just make out a cross marking the spot where Brock's neighbor had drowned.
It is misleading to talk about abandoned lots in the context of the Lower Ninth Ward. Vast sections of the neighborhood have been abandoned, so it's often unclear where one property ends and the next begins. (An exception is the sliver of land on the neighborhood's innermost edge, where Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation has built 76 solar-paneled, pastel-hued homes -- though this seems less a part of the neighborhood than a Special Economic Zone.) To visualize how the Lower Ninth looked in September -- before the city's most recent campaign to reclaim the neighborhood -- you have to understand that it no longer resembled an urban, or even suburban environment. Where once there stood orderly rows of single-family homes with driveways and front yards, there was jungle. The vegetation had all sprouted since Katrina. Trees that did not exist before the storm are now 30 feet high.
The cartoonish pace of vegetation growth resembles something out of a Chia Pet commercial, but it is hardly surprising to New Orleanians long accustomed to roads warped by tree roots and yards invaded by weeds. The soil in the Lower Ninth is extraordinarily fertile, thanks to centuries of alluvial deposits from the Mississippi River, which forms the neighborhood's southern boundary. From the river, the neighborhood descends, like a long ramp, down to an open-water, brackish marsh called Bayou Bienvenue. This back part of the neighborhood, which, at its lowest point, is four feet below sea level, was the most devastated by the storm and remains the least inhabited. Its population has decreased by 85 percent since 2000.
Many of the ruined buildings have been cleared away, and most of the old foundations are obscured. The inhabited lots, about one per city block, are the exception. With their dutifully trimmed lawns, upright fences and new construction, they stand out like teeth in a jack-o-lantern. But wilderness encroaches from all sides. ''My neighbor just saw a little family of coons parading across the street,'' said Don Porter, who lives south of Claiborne Avenue, in one of the more occupied areas of the neighborhood. There are four houses on his block, and only two are vacant. ''And you see rabbit,'' he said. ''You see egrets. Pelicans.''
''A raccoon climbs on top of our roof,'' said Terry Jacko, 23, who stood with his brother Terrence, 19, in the front yard of their Reynes Street house. ''It's huge. The first time I heard it, I thought it was a dude.''
''I saw a possum in the backyard the other day,'' Terrence said. ''Its teeth were about this big. I killed it with a stick. It was coming toward me, so I hit him. He just flipped over. I stayed inside after that.''
There have been sightings of armadillos, coyotes, owls, hawks, falcons and even a four-foot alligator, drinking from a leaky fire hydrant. Rats have been less of a problem lately because of the stray cats and the birds of prey. But it's not just animals that emerge from the weeds. ''Sometimes I see people coming out of there,'' Terrence said, pointing at the ruins of two houses, shrouded in weeds, across the street. ''They're trying to get in my home.''
Johnny Windsor, who lives with his wife in a rebuilt house nearby that is surrounded on every side by forest, has seen even more disturbing things. ''They drag bodies in there,'' he said, pointing to a thicket across the street. Bad things have been happening in the abandoned lots. While walking home from school one evening, a 16-year-old girl was dragged into a blighted house and raped. Now Windsor and his wife take turns sitting outside, keeping watch. ''You never know,'' he said, ''if someone's lying in the grass, ready to shoot.''
For six and a half years, the neighborhood has undergone a reverse colonization -- nature reclaiming civilization. Residents have fought with hatchets and weed trimmers to rebuff the colonizers: Southern cut grass, giant ragweed, Chinese tallow trees. But the effort has been largely futile. The lots require constant vigilance. A lot left untended for three months will be thick with knee-high weeds; after five months, saplings begin to rise. By last August, the sixth anniversary of Katrina, it was clear that nature had triumphed.
In September, the mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu, announced what amounted to a troop surge in the battle for the Lower Ninth. He called it the Nuisance Lot Maintenance Pilot Program. It was the city's third attempt to clear the overgrown lots in the Lower Ninth. The first contractor chosen for the job was revealed to be a convicted felon; the second contractor, hired a year ago, was asked to clear each lot only once, which was not particularly helpful, because the vegetation grew back within months. This time, the city decided to handle the job itself, using municipal agencies to hire workers and oversee the project. The pilot program consists of a single crew of 12 men -- all residents of the Lower Ninth or ex-offenders. They have waged a block-by-block campaign to reclaim the land. The program concludes at the end of this month. At that point the cycle will begin again.
To understand why New Orleans ceded an entire neighborhood to nature for six years, it's necessary to revisit a chapter from the post-Katrina era so painful that few in the city have the stomach to discuss it. The Tulane geographer Richard Campanella has called it ''the Great Footprint Debate.'' With most of New Orleans in ruins, the city had to decide how to rebuild: which areas should receive priority and which should be redeveloped?
The problem, as some saw it, was mathematical. In 1960, the population of New Orleans peaked at 627,525. To accommodate the boom, the city expanded into low-lying marshland that was previously considered unfit for human habitation. These newer, lower-lying neighborhoods were hit hardest by the storm. (The Lower Ninth is higher, on average, than New Orleans East, Gentilly, Broadmoor and Lakeview, but it suffered the most damage because of the two breaches of the Industrial Canal levee, which serves as the neighborhood's western boundary.) A year after Katrina, the city's population plunged to about 200,000; meanwhile, the street grid, since 1970, had increased by more than 10 percent. Could a city built for 627,000 maintain a population less than a third of its size? Could taxpayers afford to maintain services like garbage removal, policing, sewer pipes and miles of perpetually eroding streets? And if not, what should be done with the lowest-lying areas and their exiled inhabitants?
A panel commissioned in 2005 by Mayor Ray Nagin, Landrieu's predecessor, recommended converting large sections of the hardest-hit neighborhoods into ''green space.'' This activated the survival instinct of local community groups, who saw it as a covert attempt to eradicate the city's poorest (and blackest) neighborhoods. These suspicions were not allayed by statements like the one made by Joseph Canizaro, a wealthy white property developer who led Nagin's panel: ''As a practical matter, these poor folks don't have the resources to go back to our city just like they didn't have the resources to get out of our city. So we won't get all those folks back.''
Nagin rejected his commission's recommendations and adopted in its place an approach that most generously might be described as laissez-faire. Residents were allowed to return to the Lower Ninth -- which, at 2.25 square miles, is more than four times the size of the French Quarter -- as they desired, and the city's footprint would be preserved. According to the recent census, 5,560 people now live in the area, nearly three-quarters fewer than in 2000. There is currently no police or fire station, supermarket or hospital. Most residents haven't returned -- some because they cannot afford to, others by choice. Between its light population density and lack of basic services, much of the Lower Ninth has fallen into the very condition that New Orleanians after the storm were desperate to avoid: it has become green space.
Landrieu, elected in 2010, has directed considerable amounts of federal and local financing to construction projects in the Lower Ninth. These include $60 million for street repairs, $50 million for rebuilding schools and $14.5 million for a new community center. But clearing the lots is the logical first step. How can you repair a street if you can't see it?
''The debate about the footprint is history now,'' Campanella says. ''You can't reintroduce that question six years later, given that the city, the state and the nation as a whole has already committed recovery dollars to rebuilding houses and fixing utilities. To go back and reopen the wound -- it's too late. The baby's already born. Maybe next time we could revisit this. I hope there isn't a next time. But of course there will be.''
When Landrieu took office, New Orleans had the highest percentage of blighted properties of any American city -- higher than Cleveland, Flint, Mich., and even Detroit, which, during the last 60 years, has lost 1.1 million people, roughly the population of Dallas. But unlike those of the Rust Belt cities, the population of New Orleans is growing -- it is now 356,000 -- and its blighted properties have been decreasing. In 2008, one of every three New Orleans properties was uninhabited; today, the number is less than one in four.
Landrieu has emphasized blight reduction and generally spent the government's money according to his constituents' wishes. For this he has earned their appreciation; a poll conducted in November gave him an 88 percent favorability rating. ''The people of New Orleans, through their elected officials and their advocacy, have decided to rebuild every part of New Orleans,'' Landrieu told me. That decision ''necessarily put us on a longer course and created a challenge that is hard to achieve, especially with a limited amount of money. But I think that you can, with a lot of good strategy and thought, rebuild neighborhoods. We're in an exercise now that's attempting to prove that point.'' It remains to be seen what point will be proved by this approach, but Landrieu is not wasting any time. He has promised to complete more than 100 ''recovery projects'' within four years, or just in time for the next mayoral campaign.
Campanella operates on a different time frame. As a geographer, he has the luxury -- or Cassandra's curse -- to contemplate the city's future three decades, even three centuries from now. The walls of his Tulane office are decorated with giant photographs of New Orleans, the Mississippi River and the United States taken from outerspace.
Few cities have been more acutely influenced by their geographical location than New Orleans, which the geographer Pierce Lewis once called the ''inevitable city on an impossible site.'' Here, location is destiny; or, more precisely, elevation is destiny. The oldest, wealthiest, whiter, ''historic'' neighborhoods, where most transplants reside, are on high ground. Most of the newer and poorer neighborhoods, where the greatest concentration of native New Orleanians live, are at, or below, sea level -- and sinking. The difference between the French Quarter, which survived Katrina relatively unscathed, and the back section of the Lower Ninth, is nine feet.
Campanella's geographical history of New Orleans, ''Bienville's Dilemma,'' is essential reading for those new to town. Readers often ask him where in the city it is safe to live. ''I tell them that the higher the elevation, the closer to the river and the closer to the historic urban core, the less vulnerable you will be,'' says Campanella, who is himself a transplant. This is not immediately apparent because the port accents of Brooklyn and New Orleans share the same progenitors. ''The population we have now is roughly the population we had a hundred years ago, in the 1910s,'' he said. ''I would love to see our current population living on higher ground, in neighborhoods teeming with life -- people on the streets, walking and taking the streetcar to work, living within proximity of most of their needs. I realize that we cannot go back in history. There are 100-year-old cultural transformations that you can't just ignore. But that is what I would hope for, to the extent that it's possible.''
The ruination of the Lower Ninth has attracted geographers and ecologists from around the world, especially those in the burgeoning field of catastrophe studies -- a field with a busy future. ''It's a fascinating natural laboratory,'' Michael Blum, an ecologist at Tulane, says. ''New Orleans in general is an outstanding arena in which to understand basic ecological principles related to disturbance. The Lower Ninth lies at the heart of that.''
The closest analogy to what happened in the Lower Ninth, Blum says, is a volcanic eruption on the order of Mount St. Helens. The next closest is the tsunami that hit Japan's northeast coast a year ago. This is what distinguishes the Lower Ninth from the most derelict neighborhoods in cities like Detroit and Cleveland. Katrina was not merely destructive; it brought about a ''catastrophic reimagining of the landscape.'' As in Japan, a surge of water destroyed most human structures. In much of the neighborhood, nothing remained -- neither man, plants nor animals. The ecological term for this is simplification. ''In 2007, before rebuilding started, when you went down there, it was like going to an agricultural field,'' Blum says. ''Literally it was wiped clean.''
What happened over the intervening years has made the Lower Ninth one of the richest ecological case studies in the world. Ecologists hypothesize that, after a catastrophic event, human communities and ecological communities return at the same rate. But this theory has not been tested in real time. Blum is among a coalition of scientists -- ecologists, ornithologists, botanists, geographers and sociologists -- that is studying the Lower Ninth's recovery to learn how man, and the environment, will cope with future catastrophes.
In the race between nature and man, nature has jumped out to an early lead. But the pattern of growth has been bizarre. The Lower Ninth has been besieged by a flora feeding frenzy. A chaotic mix of plant species, many of which have never existed on that land, are battling for dominance. Before the area was cleared for plantations in the mid-1700s, the Lower Ninth was divided into three ecosystems, depending on elevation. The riverfront was lined with reeds and brambles; behind that was a dense hardwood forest; and farthest back, where Mary Brock and Pee Wee live, lay a cypress swamp populated by stands of palmettos. Today there are very few species native to the land, other than several kinds of sedge and aquatic grass. Only a handful of palm, live oak, pine and bald cypress trees survived the storm.
A variety of species, some exotic, have moved in, among them crepe myrtle, black willow and golden rain trees laced with vines. The undergrowth is a chaotic mix of weeds as high as basketball hoops and flowering shrubs like lantana, oleander and oxalis. Invasive species have infiltrated the neighborhood from the major avenues, the seeds transported by the flatbed trucks that drive to the city. The plant and animal life varies quixotically from plot to plot, as the new species entrench themselves, mustering strength, before fighting for additional territory.
The ecological composition of the neighborhood may be diverse, but it is also extremely unstable. ''It's a very odd mix, one that you wouldn't other/wise see in nature,'' Blum says. ''It's a Frankenstein community.'' Ecologically speaking, Katrina has created a monster.
The 12 men hired to tame this monster meet in the Lower Ninth every morning at 7:30. They wear sunglasses, jeans, boots and bright green city-issued T-shirts. On the back of each shirt is a fleur-de-lis; the front bears the slogan ''Fight the Blight.'' The Nuisance Lot Maintenance pilot program clears 20 properties a day. When the crew first arrives at a lot, several men tramp through the bramble, dragging to the curb any large pieces of garbage or tires they find. Then comes the tractor, a two-wheel-drive Mahindra 4025, which a crew member drives through the property like a battering ram.
''I haven't seen any bodies or skeletons,'' Enri Jacques, one of the older members of the work crew, said. ''Just wild rabbits, coons and garter snakes.'' After Jacques lost his home in the storm, he slept on the Claiborne Bridge for four nights. He learned about the pilot-program job from his probation officer. ''It beats being incarcerated,'' he said. ''It was very hard for me to find work. This job is a blessing of Christ. My house is still not totally livable right now, but now that I'm working, I'm able to put a little money aside.''
After the tractor finishes its circuit, two men stroll through the lot waving weed trimmers, the gasoline-powered machines used for residential lawn cutting. They resemble a fencing foil, only the tip culminates in a small mechanical spool that spins roughly a hundred times per second. Weed trimmers are powerful enough to cut most plants and shrubs, but not trees. When Adrian Tillman, a lanky, 28-year-old member of the crew, uses a trimmer, he wraps a black shirt around his head so that the flying debris won't cut his face.
Tillman did construction work at Jackson Barracks, the military base in the Lower Ninth that is still being repaired. After being laid off, he struggled to find a job until his mother told him that the city was looking for people from the Lower Ninth to cut grass. Since Tillman must constantly cut the grass around his own house, he was prepared for the work. ''It's a laid-back job,'' he said, especially because the crew was told to stay clear of any trees or ruined structures. His neighbors thanked him for his work. ''When they see us coming,'' Tillman said, ''they clap their hands.''
A property is crossed off the list once the grasses and weeds are cut and the sidewalk swept clean of debris. To be clear, a ''cut'' lot does not resemble in the slightest a mowed lawn. The field is often reduced to a pockmarked stubble, bald patches alternating with tussocks of jaggedly shaved 6-inch weeds. In other lots the quantity of vegetation is so great that, when the crew's work is done, the ground is covered by a heavy carpet of mowed grass. But it doesn't last long. Plots cleared this December are already sprouting wildflowers a foot high.
Not everyone in the neighborhood has been satisfied with the work of the Nuisance Lot Maintenance pilot program. A Mr. Harris, who declined to give his first name, stood on a viewing platform built on the flood wall at the edge of Bayou Bienvenue. He ate sunflower seeds while three friends, lifelong residents of the Lower Ninth, baited lines for drum and redfish. Harris gestured at a cleared lot near Florida Avenue, at the edge of which stood a pile of construction debris left behind by the crew.
''If we're going to pay you money to do that, I want professional work,'' he said. ''Hire some real professionals. I don't want it to look like that there.''
Harris spit out his sunflower shells in disgust. A luxury motor coach, filled with tourists behind tinted windows, trundled down Florida Street toward the Make It Right houses. Seventeen expletives have been edited out of the following paragraph:
''Every day 20 tour buses come down this street to look at this neighborhood and take pictures,'' Harris said. ''Don't tell me they're just touring the city. If you're trying to tour the city, then you're in the wrong neighborhood. They just ride around in the part that's been devastated. Lower Ninth Ward ain't receiving a single penny for that. Why can't I get something? Why does the man driving the bus get all the money? I ain't a guinea pig. I don't want to be put under a microscope. We're the ones that suffered down here, who lost everything. There are still dead people that they haven't accounted for. It's frustrating. It took almost seven years for the Ninth Ward to look like what it looks like now, and it still don't look like [anything].''
The going rate for a Hurricane Katrina tour of the Lower Ninth Ward is $40. Motor coaches are operated by Big Easy Tours, Historic New Orleans Tours and Gray Line, which offers customers an ''eyewitness account of the events surrounding the most devastating natural -- and man-made -- disaster on American soil!'' plus the chance to ''drive past an actual levee that 'breached.' ''
Tauck, the upscale guided-tour operator, spends one morning in the Lower Ninth as part of its eight-day New Orleans package (from $2,750). The day begins at the Greater Little Zion Baptist Church, which was founded in 1900 and rebuilt a year after the storm. The 42 members of the tour, almost all of whom are white and appear older than 60, sit patiently in the pews, cameras in laps, while a video showing the destruction is projected on the sanctuary. An introductory talk about the horrors of Katrina -- the unmarked graves, the toxic mold, the cruel bureaucratic inanities of FEMA -- is presented by Laura Paul, a 41-year-old Canadian who came as a volunteer aid worker after Katrina and never left. In her previous life, Paul was a client coordinator for global express aircraft at Bombardier Aerospace outside Montreal. Now she runs lowernine.org, a nonprofit organization whose volunteers rebuild homes, operate an urban farm and collected the data on abandoned lots that was used to develop the Nuisance Lot Maintenance pilot program. Tauck donates $25 per tour participant to lowernine.org.
''The issue with the neighborhood is not the tours themselves,'' Paul said, ''but the fact that people are making bank on them and not giving anything back to the community. And they can be disrespectful: people get out of the buses, trample private property and take pictures. I really do think that Tauck is doing the right thing. I like the company, I like the tour guides, I like the people they bring to the neighborhood. You're talking about upper-class, predominantly white people. They have a lot of money.'' A woman from a Tauck tour once sent Paul a check for $5,000.
''Getting money after a storm is like shooting fish in a barrel,'' Paul added. ''But long-term recovery? People just don't want to know how long it takes. The truth is discouraging. It could easily take another 10 years. We'll work until we run out of money. The problem is that someday -- and this might already be starting -- people will be like: 'Seriously? Enough with the Katrina stuff. Please, just stop.' ''
The only person on the Tauck bus who seemed truly uncomfortable about the tour was Renee Whitecloud, the tour guide. Whitecloud, who grew up in New Orleans, carries in her wallet a photograph of her flooded street in the Broadmoor neighborhood. By the time she returned home after the floodwaters receded, mold had crept all the way up to the second floor. The mold was ''psychedelic,'' she said. ''Green, orange, yellow, all different colors.'' She developed asthma and allergies and suffered frequent migraines. ''I love the city,'' Whitecloud said, ''but this is a hard day for me.'' She stood outside the bus while her tourists walked through a house on Caffin Avenue that lowernine.org rebuilt. ''It's in your face,'' she said. ''Every time I do this tour, I have to revisit the trauma.'' When the Katrina video plays in the church, she stands outside.
Because the motor coach is too large to negotiate the broken residential streets, it drives in a rectangle around the most devastated section of the Lower Ninth, sticking to the major thoroughfares. During a tour in October, it drove alongside the Industrial Canal, pausing so that the passengers could see the area where the levee breached. As it slowly passed through the Make It Right houses, a teenage boy ran to the curb, and the driver -- whose own house is still gutted from Katrina -- pulled over. The door opened and the boy stepped on. The bus filled with the kind of silence that follows a popped balloon. The boy held a carton of homemade pralines.
''Three for $10,'' he said. ''Buy one for a good cause.''
The 42 members of the tour group sat stiffly in their seats, staring forward in silence.
''Like to donate a dollar? Anyone?''
Nobody moved.
''Going once, going twice . . . Sold! To the guy in the black jacket!''
The man in the black jacket flinched violently.
''No? O.K., then. Going once, going twice . . . Sold! To this woman here in the front row!''
No one offered the boy any money. After another excruciatingly long pause, he stepped out onto the street. The motor coach scuttled back to the French Quarter.
The Nuisance Lot Maintenance pilot program has now cleared more than 1,200 lots. The transformation of the neighborhood is stark. Ruined houses still tilt like old prizefighters on nearly every street; the roads are chassis-rattling slalom courses; and there are few people, other than tourists, in sight. But no longer are there full blocks of uninterrupted jungle. The worst parts of the neighborhood are desolate but neat. It is uncertain what exactly will happen next to the cleared lots. As Jeff Hebert, the executive director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, said, ''Cutting grass once isn't really a good option.'' In the Lower Ninth, a property remains cleared for only three to six months. A Chinese tallow tree, for instance, will grow from seed to two-foot-high sapling in a summer and six feet within a year.
When I asked Landrieu what might be done next with the lots, he had no specific answers but emphasized the need for private development. ''We don't know what the end looks like,'' he said. ''We think we know what the process looks like. We want to get those lots back in the hands of private-property owners so that they can take responsibility for them. Anything we can do to make them attractive to private investors, we want to do.'' He acknowledged that, while the city has made significant progress in fighting blight in other poor neighborhoods, the Lower Ninth ''has become a symbol of New Orleans's rebirth, whether that's justified or not.'' Nor is it simply a question of restoring the conditions that existed before the storm. ''I keep telling people that we're not putting things back like it was,'' he said. ''We're building the city we want to become.''
Hebert wasn't any more specific. ''All properties will receive a level of maintenance until such time as there is interest in the property for new housing or alternative uses like parks, community gardens, etc.,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''It is not the goal of the city to maintain in perpetuity.''
I recently accompanied Peter Yaukey, an ornithologist at the University of New Orleans who has been surveying bird life in the Lower Ninth for six years. On his first visit, a month after the storm, he was not allowed north of Claiborne Avenue because the authorities were still searching for bodies. The first thing he noticed was the silence. When a sound editor from the HBO show ''Treme'' asked him what type of birds were heard in New Orleans after the storm, Yaukey said there was a nearly complete absence of bird song. The city had no ambient sound. You could hear a boombox from three blocks away.
Many of the birds that used to be common in the Lower Ninth -- like mourning doves and house sparrows -- had almost entirely disappeared and only now are beginning to return in small numbers. But over the course of several years, as the lots grew thick with weeds and the rodent populations increased, Yaukey observed that something strange was happening. Large predators, which feed on rats and mice, began to appear in high numbers. So high, in fact, that there was soon a much greater concentration of hawks, falcons and shrikes in the Lower Ninth than would be found in a rural environment. He suspected that barn owls were building nests in the blighted buildings. The word Yaukey used to describe the concentration of raptors was ''supernatural.'' Both senses of the word seemed to apply.
Yaukey, who bears a strong resemblance to the actor Thomas Haden Church and has the same raspy voice, began spotting birds through the windshield as soon as we turned off Claiborne. He wore a pair of binoculars around his neck, but he didn't need them to identify the birds that glided hundreds of feet overhead: a white ibis, a red-tailed hawk, a turkey vulture and an osprey, clenching in its talons a fish plucked from the Industrial Canal. There were plenty of species at street level as well: blue jays, cardinals, American crows, Eastern phoebes, killdeer, loggerhead shrike, kestrel falcons, bronzed cowbirds and, rarest of all, an open-ground woodpecker. A great egret, regal and stiff, promenaded down the middle of Choctaw, stalking lizards. A flock of roughly 300 European starlings pecked at insects and weed seeds on the Caffin median. An exceedingly plump red-shouldered hawk perched on the bending branch of a mulberry tree. To Yaukey's amazement, the hawk did not budge even when we came within 10 feet. ''It looks pretty tame,'' he said. ''Almost to the point of being goofy.''
Yaukey was surprised by how substantially the lot-maintenance crew had altered the landscape. He pointed out that the overgrown lots that did remain were rapidly changing. The tall weeds were being crowded out by saplings and trees, especially the aggressive and omnipresent Chinese tallow, whose leaves had begun to turn yellow, crimson and purple. If left alone for another five years, the Chinese tallow might conquer every inch of land in the Lower Ninth, creating a suffocating monoculture, but for the time being, a wide variety of plants thrived in the understory. He was especially eager to find a dense lot that he could explore with the hope of finding birds, like sparrows, that favored brush. He found a suitable spot -- three contiguous abandoned lots -- at the corner of Jourdan and Law. We were just a few blocks behind Brad Pitt's houses and across the street from the Industrial Canal levee. It was at this spot, more than six years ago, that four of the concrete slabs cracked, the soil gave way and the inundation of the Lower Ninth began.
Before the car came to a complete stop, Yaukey was out the door, tramping into the weeds. Birds started hopping and darting about. He made birdcalls: pish-pish-spish-spish-SPISH. Wee! Weeweewee! And another that is difficult to transcribe but sounded like a rotating lawn sprinkler.
By the time I locked the car, he was 20 feet away, obscured to his neck by the high weeds. The birds were calling back to him. ''Field sparrow,'' he marveled, cocking his head. ''Swamp sparrow.''
Pish-pish-spish-spish-spish-SPISH.
''I've gone whole winters without seeing a field sparrow in the New Orleans vicinity. Field sparrows, swamp sparrows, simply do not winter in residential New Orleans. So this habitat . . .,'' he trailed off. ''I can come here and see them.'' The excitement was high in his voice.
It was difficult to keep up -- he had the bounding energy of a child let out to recess. The brush was so dense that it was impossible to find secure footing. Every step cracked a branch. Thorns tugged on pants. Cordlike vines noosed around ankles like booby traps. I kicked a concrete slab, concealed beneath a mound of dirt -- the foundation of the house that once stood there.
''Rattlebox!'' Yaukey said, pointing to an invasive South American tree he spotted in the middle of a thicket. Clusters of dark brown pods dangled like earrings from its stalks. Only a sandy tuft of Yaukey's hair was visible now. His voice was hard to make out, and I had to ask him to repeat himself.
''Orange-crowned warbler!'' he shouted back at me. ''Ruby-crowned kinglet!''
Finally I gave up. Yaukey was too deep in the woods. It was no longer possible to distinguish which calls were his and which the birds'. He walked around a stand of 15-foot Chinese tallow trees, the green and crimson leaves waving mournfully in the wind. And then he was gone. The wilderness just swallowed him up.

HEADLINE: A Moment of Truth For Health Care Reform

BYLINE: By LINCOLN CAPLAN and PHILIP M. BOFFEY

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act will have immense political importance. The law, which rivals Medicare in scope, is the biggest achievement of the Obama administration. Striking it down has become a Republican crusade.
The justices, like the rest of the country, are clearly aware of the politics of the moment. But a decision on the merits will endure long after this election season -- it could alter the allocation of power within American government and Congress's authority to solve national problems.
The act requires almost all individuals to obtain health insurance, either through private plans or public programs, or pay a financial penalty. It places new requirements on health insurance, like full coverage for preventive care. And it will subsidize insurance for low-income and moderate-income people, while expanding Medicaid programs in the states to cover many millions more. 
Here is a look at the issues to be argued over three days this week in this extraordinary case.
MONDAY The first issue has not received much attention but is a crucial hurdle: the federal Anti-Injunction Act. This arcane law bars suits to block a tax until the tax is actually levied and paid. If the court decides that this law applies in this case, it could delay ruling on the legality of the individual mandate for three years.
Since no party in the Supreme Court litigation has claimed that the act applies, the court asked an independent lawyer to argue the position that the court cannot rule on the mandate's constitutionality until the financial penalties for failing to obtain insurance go into effect in 2015.
Federal appeals courts are split on this question. The Fourth Circuit ruled that the penalty is a tax, so the suit it considered is barred for now. The appeals courts for the District of Columbia and the Sixth Circuit came out the opposite way.
Both the Obama administration and the challengers oppose the court-appointed advocate's view. But if the court is persuaded by his argument, it could avoid making a hard decision in a heated election season.
TUESDAY Does the Constitution give Congress power under the commerce clause to require Americans to obtain health coverage? Every relevant constitutional precedent over the last 75 years says yes. The mandate is a core part of Congress's effort to reform the national markets in health care and health insurance.
The criticsinsist that the mandate is unconstitutional because it regulates inaction. But the distinction they draw between inaction and action makes little sense. Refusing to pay a tax, for instance, is ''inaction'' that is clearly subject to government regulation. Choosing not to have health insurance is just as clearly a financial action -- one that could shift future medical expenses onto others in the health system.
The court needs only to decide whether there was a ''rational basis'' for Congress to conclude that the health care of 50 million uninsured people affects interstate commerce. Not since the New Deal has the court struck down a law with an economic purpose as exceeding Congress's power.
There may well be a split among the conservative justices about the mandate, with two or more joining the moderate liberals to uphold it. In 2005, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the 6-to-3 majority in upholding Congress's power to prohibit marijuana use for medical purposes. Justice Scalia wrote then, ''Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce.''
He might agree with what Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a George W. Bush appointee on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in upholding the mandate: ''Not every intrusive law is an unconstitutionally intrusive law.''
WEDNESDAY The morning session will be devoted to ''severability,'' the question of what happens to other provisions of the law if the individual mandate is struck down. The law's opponents say the entire law must fall because they believe Congress would not have passed the other provisions, which raise money and reduce costs, without it. The Obama administration argues that the only provisions that would have to fall are those prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or charging them higher premiums. (Those parts, it says, depend on the mandate adding healthier, cheaper people to insurance pools.) There is a third, more sensible position: the rest of the act stands because courts generally avoid striking down entire laws when one provision is flawed and Congress quite likely would have enacted the reform's other elements without the mandate.
The second issue involves Congress's power to require states to expand Medicaid. Although most of the expansion cost would be paid by the federal government, states would pick up a small part of it, starting in 2017. The Republican-controlled states argue that the law unconstitutionally ''coerces'' them to cover more people and that the penalty for failing to -- allegedly losing all their Medicaid funding -- leaves no choice but to capitulate. This issue is really just a policy struggle between the parties. Thirteen Democratic-leaning states filed a brief backing Medicaid expansion, skewering most of the Republican arguments. The 11th Circuit appeals court in Atlanta has ruled that the law is not coercive and that federal officials can impose lesser penalties than stopping all Medicaid funding. There is no reason for the justices to disagree. LINCOLN CAPLAN and PHILIP M. BOFFEY

HEADLINE: 'I Drifted Into the Sea at night. Now I've Paddled Back.'

BYLINE: By ADAM STERNBERGH

 BODY:
There is a clip online of the Charlie Rose show from 1996, in which Rose invited three young novelists to talk about the future of American fiction, and this clip is often -- and thanks to the Internet, may forever be -- cited by anyone writing the history of Mark Leyner. That's because Rose's panel comprised David Foster Wallace, promoting ''Infinite Jest''; a young and anxious-looking Jonathan Franzen, the author, at that time, of ''Strong Motion''; and Leyner, the most intense, and in a certain sense, significant young prose writer in America. 
That last descriptor is one of Leyner's own invention, and it recurs repeatedly in his best-known novel, ''Et Tu, Babe,'' published exactly 20 years ago. ''Et Tu, Babe'' is an adrenalized, needle-to-the-red satire of (among many other things) the derangements of celebrity mass worship in a disjunctive culture-gone-wild. It centers on an enormously wealthy and fantastically successful novelist named Mark Leyner, who has a fan club called Team Leyner, lives in a sprawling encampment called Leyner HQ, where he's guarded by a phalanx of artificially enhanced nonagenarian cyborg bodyguards and is given to lounging by his pool ''encircled by the eight-ton, four-foot basaltic bluestone pillars from Stonehenge's inner circle that I bought with a portion of my last advance from Harmony Books.'' The novel is deranged and hilarious and would stand today as the most inspired parody of life in the surreal age of the Internet, social media and reality TV, if not for the fact that it essentially predated the advent of all three. (At that panel, Charlie Rose did ask his guests about the impact of the Internet on fiction, which is weird, because to my recollection, the Internet in 1996 was basically bleeps, blorps, the occasional e-mail and beer coasters made from surplus AOL CD-ROMs.)
Back in the 1990s, in a twist we might even call Leyneresque, the outsize cult success of ''Et Tu, Babe,'' as well as of his previous book, ''My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist,'' conveyed to the real-life Leyner a significant level of actual fame. He appeared on the cover of The Times Magazine, under the coverline ''America's Best-Built Comic Novelist.'' He wrote a monthly column in Esquire. He was a recurrent guest on David Letterman's show, and Conan's, and Jon Stewart's old talk show on MTV, and Bill Maher's ''Politically Incorrect,'' on which he once sat next to Eartha Kitt, who, during a discussion of sexual harassment, reached over and grabbed his junk. (Again: Leyneresque.)
On the Charlie Rose panel, the three young novelists sat together in the familiar round table, infinite-void-of-nothingness that is the Charlie Rose set. Each responded to Rose's questions about the state of fiction more or less in character: Franzen, who had a wavy pageboy haircut that frizzed out untempered to nearly chin level, defended the classical novel as an oasis for readers who feel lonely and misunderstood. Leyner, wearing a robust, Mephistophelian goatee -- perhaps fitting for the man Wallace once accused of being ''a kind of anti-Christ'' -- said simply: ''My relationship with my readers is somewhat theatrical. One of the main things I try to do in my work is delight my readers.'' Wallace looked much as we picture him now, posthumously chiseled into Mount Literature: the ponytail, the bearish features, the rough scruff on his jaw. He played the part of a calming, Midwestern-inflected mediator, saying, ''I feel like I'm, if you put these two guys in a blender. . . . ''
It's strange, of course, to watch that clip now, knowing what we know. One of these authors ended up committing suicide. One ended up on the cover of Time. And one of them -- Leyner, the most intense and, in a certain sense, significant young prose writer in America -- published one more novel in 1997, then stepped away from novel-writing altogether. Now, after a not-entirely-planned 15-year-hiatus from fiction, he returns this month with a new novel, ''The Sugar Frosted Nutsack.'' But he's re-emerging into a very different culture; one that in his absence has become, oddly, even more grotesquely Leyneresque -- so much so that you might wonder (he certainly has) if there is a place left in it for Mark Leyner.
''I am considering Tweeting,'' Leyner announced recently, to a table of friends, over dinner in the West Village, as though Tweeting is an activity he has been encouraged to pursue and is eager to master, even if he's not quite sure yet what it entails. He should be a natural -- it's hard to imagine another writer better equipped to spit out short, artfully crafted, vaguely aphoristic and absurdo-delightful nuggets of text. (Here's a Twitter-ready sentence lifted, more or less at random, from one of his novels: ''Now, I'm a writer, but I've always fancied myself something of an amateur forensic pathologist.'')
Yet Leyner, who is 56, regards Twitter cautiously. He's like an expert zoologist circling a species of animal he has not yet encountered. He's much more oriented toward having a mysterious existence, he says, and ''every now and then issuing a piece of work, rather than being available every 45 seconds.'' But this stance is out of step with the current moment. Salman Rushdie, once in hiding, now Tweets pretty much all day. So Leyner's 18-year-old daughter, Gaby, has been giving him tutorials. You can now find him on Twitter at @leynermark. He'd hoped to get @markleyner, but somebody claim-jumped his name.
Over the past decade, while the rest of America's novelists were trying to find their footing in this unsteady new terrain -- the tectonic upheavals/ of Facebook and Twitter; the Internet-led dissolution of the private self; the corrosive yet increasingly commonplace notion that each citizen needs to reinvent himself as a brand -- Leyner has been off in Hollywood, doing what former novelists have done there for the past century or so: making money. Also: being unhappy. Also, and more specifically: writing movies (he had one made, ''War Inc.,'' a political satire starring John Cusack and Ben Kingsley, released in 2008); befriending movie stars (he's now pretty good pals with Cusack); and doing work-for-hire script doctoring that is lucrative but incrementally soul-eroding in a frog-in-the-boiling-water kind of way. ''It's not that everything was mercenary, or that it was all odious and frivolous,'' he told me over lunch at a cafe near his home in Hoboken, where he has lived this whole time, while shuttling back and forth to the West Coast. ''But ultimately, I'm amazed that I emerged from it all with any dignity and self-esteem at all.'' His most common experience, he recalls, went something like this: Some eager producer would discover his work and decide that Leyner's strange and singular vision was exactly what a project needed. Then, several weeks or months or years later, Leyner would hand in a script. The reaction, all too often, was something like, ''What the hell is this?''
So that went on for about 10 years.
He, too, seems bewildered at the duration of this Rip Van Winkle-like intermission in his life -- ''the interregnum, this strange and perverse lapse of time,'' as he puts it. He didn't intend to stray from fiction for so long. ''It's kind of like falling asleep on a boogie board,'' he says. ''You take a nap and you wake up and you've drifted far away and there's no one on the beach anymore and it's night. I drifted into the sea at night. Now I've paddled back.''
This return is good, if unexpected, news for fans of Leyner. Not everyone is a fan of Leyner, mind you. Many fiction fans, by this point, may have no recollection of who he is. But if you are a fan of Leyner, you will rejoice at his return. And you will reliably have a story of your Come-to-Leyner moment.
''I was an undergrad going through various boring literary journals for something that might excite me,'' says Sam Lipsyte, the author, most recently, of ''The Ask.'' ''I ran across these bits that blew me over. I was hungry for anything Leyner after that.''
''He caught me at just the right time,'' says Lev Grossman, the book critic for Time magazine and the author of ''The Magician King.'' ''When I read his work, I thought it was just electrifying. Instantly every other novel I'd ever read just seemed painfully dated.''
My own Come-to-Leyner moment happened when I found ''Et Tu, Babe'' in the library and, intrigued, opened it -- then read through it in one sitting, right there in a stiff-backed library chair. I remember the central sensation was less one of appreciation or even affection than of wonder, as in: Wait, is this allowed? I felt as if I had stumbled on something thrilling and illicit -- a piece of literary samizdat. Leyner did not surf the zeitgeist so much as dive in to the zeitgeist, grow gills, wrestle the undertow and reverse the tides. His novels aren't narratives, precisely; rather, they're cascades of deadpan, absurd, imagistic juxtapositions, like ''Dad was in the basement centrifuging mouse spleen hybridoma, when I informed him that I'd enrolled at the Wilford Military Academy of Beauty.'' And his writing is funny -- unabashedly, repeatedly, relentlessly. To this day, you can bring me 10 contemporary novels with HILARIOUS! stamped all over their covers and I will show you 10 pages of Leyner that are funnier than all of them combined.
A few years after his 1997 novel, ''The Tetherballs/ of Bougainville,'' it became clear that another book was not forthcoming, and I, like many fans, was disappointed and vaguely confused. I was even more confused when his name popped up, a few years later, on a series of comical question-and-answer books about medicine, written with Dr. Billy Goldberg, the first of which was titled, ''Why Do Men Have Nipples?'' (Leyner met Goldberg while Leyner was writing for the TV medical drama ''Wonderland''; they hit it off and wrote the books, which were a huge success.)
Still, as the century turned, the disappearance of Leyner the novelist, the fiction-guerrilla, also seemed strangely fitting. As Lev Grossman told me: ''His aesthetic was so intense, it almost made sense that it should burn itself out. I always kind of imagined Leyner having finally collapsed in on himself, becoming a neutron star or a black hole. Because, my God -- who could keep up writing like that?''
While Leyner was working almost entirely for Hollywood, he would occasionally have dinner with his fiction editor, Michael Pietsch, the subtext of which, Pietsch says, was ''When will I get your next book?'' Pietsch first encountered Leyner in 1989 after reading a short story of his titled, ''I Was an Infinitely Hot and Dense Dot,'' which had been picked up and reprinted in Harper's. Pietsch has since become a kind of fabled figure in publishing: he's the executive vice president and publisher of Little, Brown, and, among many other accomplishments, he edited ''Infinite Jest,'' assembled the pieces of Wallace's notes into ''The Pale King'' and most recently acquired Chad Harbach's ''Art of Fielding.''
I asked him if he could recall the feeling he had when he first encountered Leyner's writing. Rather than describe the sensation, he simply read to me the beginning of that story, which he happened to have on hand: ''I was an infinitely hot and dense dot. So begins the autobiography of a feral child who was raised by huge and lurid puppets. An autobiography written wearing wrist weights. It ends with these words: A car drives through a puddle of sperm, sweat and contraceptive jelly, splattering the great chopsocky vigilante from Hong Kong.''
Then he paused, as if to say: Well, there you have it. Imagine how I felt stumbling onto that.
For someone who once claimed to have been raised by huge and lurid puppets, Leyner has a disappointingly normal biography. He was born in Jersey City and grew up in suburban New Jersey, the son of an attorney. He started writing fiction while at Brandeis, where an early mentor, Alan Lelchuk, praised his very first piece to the class, then told Leyner, ''There's no way you'll be able to keep that up.'' Leyner took this as a kind of dare and kept it up for the next two decades.
Leyner is a compact man who spends a lot of time at the gym (''I have bantam psychology,'' he told me. ''Mighty Mouse or Napoleonic''). In his younger years, he liked to drink and get occasionally bellicose; he still likes to drink, but he's not so bellicose, though he did recently just narrowly avoid a bar fight after he and his pal Jeremy Pikser, a screenwriter, were discussing, somewhat too loudly, the theoretical casting of the Olsen twins in a movie.
Leyner describes his writing routine as ''standing up, pacing around, swatting a Nerf ball against the wall,'' only occasionally interrupted by ''periods of very sustained, grim, Glenn Gould-ish sitting.'' His great literary heroes are Baudelaire, Stephane Mallarme and Terry Southern, and he has said, on many occasions, that the purpose of his writing is to instill delight, on a sentence-by-sentence basis -- to create the vertiginous feeling in the reader that literally anything might happen next; that any new world could be conjured out of nothing, born before your eyes in a Big Bang on the blank white page.
As you might expect, his style did not win over everyone. Michiko Kakutani, for one, has written, ''a little bit goes a very long way.'' And David Foster Wallace, in a long essay published in 1993 titled ''E Unibus Pluram'' about TV, fiction and irony, launched a weirdly sustained attack on Leyner, dismissing his work as ''both amazing and forgettable, wonderful and oddly hollow.''
At the time that I encountered this essay, Leyner and Wallace were both writers I greatly, even genuflectingly, admired. So reading it was like overhearing your parents fighting in the other room. In hindsight, the essay does not seem to me to be Wallace's finest hour -- as much because of his now-musty-seeming distrust of television as for his diatribe against Leyner (a writer he once admitted in a letter to Jonathan Franzen of being ''sickly searingly envious of,'' along with Franzen, William Vollmann and David Leavitt).
When I asked Leyner about it, 20 years after the fact, he claimed he wasn't confident he'd ever read the essay in full. Though as we talked, it became clear he was more than familiar with its arguments. He and Wallace were friendly, if not exactly friends -- they shared an editor and, at least one time, cigarettes, right before that Charlie Rose appearance. Leyner says Wallace apologized for the ''anti-Christ'' quote, which he said was taken out of context. Recalling that now, Leyner laughed. ''It's hard to imagine what other context it could have been said in.''
Leyner has only one strong objection to the essay. ''I never thought of what I did as ironic,'' he says. ''And I think that's a fundamental mistake in David's take on my work. I always thought of my work as being animated by a spirit of unhinged generosity. And transparency. Neither of which can be defined as irony.'' He does sound slightly pained when he admits this. Not upset by the perceived attack, per se. But rather saddened that this unhinged generosity, as he puts it, could have been so seriously misunderstood.
As Leyner recalls, he was in a beat-up van in Bulgaria with no seat belts, and he was spinning -- spinning -- spinning -- slowly, or it seems slow anyway -- because the van had just blown a tire at a hundred miles an hour.
And he remembers thinking, as you would in such a situation, about his life.
He remembers thinking: There seems to be a very good chance that I will die.
And if I do, I will never see my daughter again.
Or go to the gym.
Or write another novel.
This was five years ago, when he was en route to scout locations in Bulgaria for ''War Inc.,'' and it was the first time he'd thought about writing another novel in a very long time.
Still, the accident wasn't quite enough to shake him loose from Hollywood. That only happened later, after he was hit by a car, in L.A., outside a munchkin hotel.
He was staying at the Culver Hotel in Culver City, working on postproduction. It was, he recalls, the hotel at which the munchkins bunked during the filming of ''The Wizard of Oz.'' (It was a full-size hotel, he assured me, lest I imagine him stooped at a half-size water basin or dangling off the end of a munchkin-length bed.) While crossing a parking lot, he was hit. The driver stopped, got out, gave him the once-over while he sat, dazed, on the asphalt, then tossed him a business card and drove away.
He was more or less O.K. One knee was torn up pretty bad. It was enough to send him back to Hoboken, where he lay in bed all day for weeks recovering and rereading Thomas Hardy and ''Moby Dick,'' and, eventually, slowly, starting to formulate a book.
Some time later, Michael Pietsch got an e-mail. Leyner reported that he had a first sentence he liked: ''There was never nothing.''
And then, two years later, Leyner delivered ''The Sugar Frosted Nutsack,'' completed and ready for print.
''It is very important to me, maybe excessively important to me, that what I do is unlike anything else,'' Leyner says. He understands that his cultural re-entry poses some difficulties for him in this regard. He is older. The culture is different. He is different. He claims not to be a big reader of contemporary fiction -- he was finishing, when we met, a biography of the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss -- but he's aware that the contemporary landscape for fiction is, in many ways, more traditional and staid than the one he exited 15 years ago. Many of today's name-brand writers seem less concerned with finding stylistic ways to lasso the whole wide wackadoodle world than they are with revivifying classic structures and draping them in modern garb.
Moreover, Leyner's own once-radical narrative tactics might no longer seem so jarring, or even all that unusual. ''Because of the Internet, it's easier to lurch among many disparate things,'' he says. ''Now it's just the way people spend their day.'' (As I was transcribing this very interview -- this very quote -- on my computer at work, I was simultaneously watching a video of Megan Fox being scared on the ''Ellen'' show by a man in a giant banana suit. So: point taken.)
''When I was writing the earlier books,'' Leyner says, ''I felt very much a part of something that was happening. There was a certain surfing-the-zeitgeist feeling about it all. I had very much the opposite feeling when I wrote this book.'' To continue the boogie-board analogy, he says, ''I really felt like when I paddled back, there was nobody, and I didn't know where I was. I really felt completely alone.''
''Nutsack'' is in many ways, both literally and artistically, a product of that isolation. While he wrote it, he showed it to no one, getting no feedback. ''This book had to have a certain completely enclosed, impenetrably claustrophobic kind of madness to it,'' he says. The result is a strange and indescribable novel, even by the standards of Leyner, purveyor of the strange and difficult to describe. It involves gods who live on the top floor of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It involves an unemployed 48-year-old ex-butcher named Ike Karton who lives in New Jersey and hangs out all day on his stoop. It involves legions of blind, chanting bards who gather to recite the epic story of Ike Karton, the text of which is called ''The Sugar Frosted Nutsack,'' which is also the text of the book. It involves haunting repetitions of the Mister Softee jingle; suicide-by-cop; Audrina Patridge; Ted Williams and Snooki (twin Snookies, actually). It is, like Leyner's previous novels, intermittently miraculous and often hilarious. It is also, unlike his previous novels, at times almost achingly sad.
One night while out over drinks, Leyner's friend Jeremy Pikser, the screenwriter who co-wrote ''Bulworth,'' described reading ''Et Tu, Babe'' for the first time, right before he met Leyner. ''I could tell immediately that the things that bugged the hell out of him were the exact same things that bugged the hell out of me,'' he said. I wondered what he meant: What bugged the hell out of him? Nonagenarian cyborg bodyguards? Subcutaneous radioactive tattoos? He cited the scene in the book in which Mark Leyner holds a writing conference, identifies all the most promising writers, then kills them. ''It's about the preposterousness of celebrity, the preposterousness of fame,'' he says. ''And the fundamental preposterousness of being a writer or even a person. That feeling that you have to be the best in the world, versus the terror that you are nothing and you are no one.''
It's probably worth noting that, in his first few novels, Leyner's protagonist was an outsize cartoon of unfettered bravado named Mark Leyner, who stood like a colossus over a haywire landscape. ''Nutsack'' stars Ike Karton, unemployed, ''paranoid and maladaptively hostile,'' the victim of a car crash (he was hit by a Mister Softee truck); and possibly delusional; his damaged head like an attic jammed with all manner of wild detritus: gyrating goddesses and endless epics chanted in his honor and recurring visions of his own, glorious, lonely, inevitable death (at the hands of the Mossad). Ike Karton makes no claim to be the most intense, and in a certain sense, significant young prose writer in America. He's simply a man standing alone on a stoop in New Jersey, his face trained toward faraway gods.
Leyner says that when he returned, he realized that he needed to take this centripetal turn inward, in part because his old approach by itself ''just isn't going to seem so mind-boggling to someone.'' Then he states matter-of-factly, as if to remind himself of something he forgot, ''And boggling someone's mind is something I like to do.''

HEADLINE: Groups Blanket Supreme Court On Health Care

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Justice Clarence Thomas likens all the outside political pressure that the Supreme Court is facing over its review of the Obama administration's sweeping health care law to the distraction faced by a free-throw shooter confronted with fans waving wildly behind the basket. Neither, in his view, has much impact in the end.
''Why do you think they're never distracted? They're focusing on the rim, right?'' Justice Thomas said when asked at a forum two weeks ago about the pressures of the health care case. ''That's the same thing here. You stay focused on what you're supposed to do. All that other stuff is just noise.''
With three days of arguments scheduled for this week, the nine justices will need the steely nerves of a clutch free-throw shooter to block out all the noise surrounding a case that has generated perhaps the most intense outside lobbying campaign that the court has ever seen. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has helped lead opposition to the health care law, has been hosting moot court sessions to prepare lawyers involved in the case. Advocates on all sides of the issues, including Tea Party leaders who are against the law and health care professionals who favor it, are planning rallies. Many groups, like the American Constitution Society, liberal backers of the law and of Congress's power to regulate commerce, are setting up war rooms and daily briefings on the Supreme Court steps.
In all, groups involved in the debate have spent tens of millions of dollars in the last two years to steer the political and legal debate. And a record number of organizations -- 136 so far -- have filed amicus curiae or ''friend of the court'' briefs, densely packed with historical citations and legal arguments, to urge the court to either strike down or uphold the law.
''Whenever you see a blockbuster case, we see the different groups coming out,'' said Anthony Franze, a Washington lawyer who was a co-author of a study of such amicus briefs. ''And this is the blockbuster of blockbusters.''
With the start of arguments this week, the lobbying efforts move from Congress squarely to the Supreme Court, which has found itself drawn increasingly into politically charged cases in recent years, including its intervention in the 2000 Florida recount in Bush v. Gore; its rulings limiting the sweep of executive power in Guantanamo Bay; and its remaking of campaign finance law in the 2010 Citizens United ruling.
Lobbyists and lawyers with a stake in the case will be giving near-instant analysis for their clients and for reporters, many of whom will be covering the arguments from start to finish.
Proponents of the sweeping 2010 law, working with the White House, have also developed ''talking points'' to emphasize the potential harm if the law is thrown out, including the reduction in coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and for young adults who wish to remain on their parents' policies.
The groups filing amicus briefs include not only the usual heavy hitters like the chamber, AARP and virtually every major health care association, but also obscure groups that have rarely, if ever, been involved in a Supreme Court case.
''We don't expect to be even a blip on the court's radar, except to maybe count up the 'for' and 'against,' '' said Quentin Rhoades, a lawyer for the Montana Shooting Sports Association, which filed a 26-page brief opposing the law as a breach of states' rights. He said he spent about 50 hours, pro bono, preparing the brief with another lawyer.
Dozens of other constituencies filing briefs put in similar efforts.
Economists are wading into the debate with briefs that offer clashing views of the benefits and harms that they believe the health care law brings.
Catholic and anti-abortion groups are opposing it because of concerns about federal financing for abortion services.
And the State of Massachusetts, which approved a similar insurance model under Gov. Mitt Romney in 2006, argues in its amicus brief that its experience ''confirms that Congress had a rational basis'' to impose minimum insurance requirements.
Typically, law clerks wade through the amicus briefs -- known as green books for their covers -- and highlight notable issues for the justices. But getting a justice's ear is not cheap.
Lawyers who work on amicus briefs before the Supreme Court say it can cost $25,000 to $100,000 in lawyers' time and expenses to prepare one, plus $1,500 or more to have them printed and distributed at the court.
But does the cajoling from outside groups have any real impact on the court's decisions? At least in the case of the formal amicus briefs filed with the court, research suggests that the answer, increasingly, is yes.
A study published last year in The National Law Journal by Mr. Franze and R. Reeves Anderson, his colleague at the law firm Arnold & Porter, found the Supreme Court justices not only receiving more amicus briefs than ever before, but also citing them as support for their opinions far more often as well.
But the effects of less formal politicking -- news coverage, rallies, protests, forums and other ''noise,'' as Justice Thomas called it -- are less clear.
In a speech last year in Kansas City, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said politics outside the court's chambers generally did not play a part in its deliberations.
But there are no doubt times when it has, he acknowledged, pointing as one example to the court's infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857 that classified blacks as property but not citizens.
When Justice Thomas was asked about the outside pressure in the health care case at a law forum at Wake Forest University this month, he brushed it aside with a wave of the hand, saying all that matters are the formal pleadings that sit in a mail bin.
''All that other background noise, I never -- I don't listen to all this stuff,'' he said. ''I don't read the papers, I don't watch the evening news.'' If justices let outside pressures distract them, he said, ''in my opinion, you have no business in the job.''
Among the stories in the news media over the last few months were questions about whether he and Justice Elena Kagan could objectively consider the health care case because of personal and political connections.
Liberals in Congress and elsewhere contend that Justice Thomas's objectivity is called into question by the paid consulting work that his wife, Ginny Thomas, has done with Tea Party groups in opposing the health care law.
Conservatives, meanwhile, assert that Justice Kagan's own impartiality could be compromised by her role as President Obama's first solicitor general during the start of the legal fight over the health care legislation.
Neither justice has indicated any hesitation to hear the case. And Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has said that he has confidence in all his justices to decide when they may want to remove themselves from a case because of a possible conflict.
Bradley W. Joondeph, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has cataloged briefs in the case, said that while he saw no need for either justice's recusal, he believes it is unrealistic to think the court could fully insulate itself from outside pressures.
''There's no way for human beings to screen out the rest of the world on a decision like this,'' Mr. Joondeph said. ''This just sort of stands out as one of those cases where the institutional stature of the court is on the line.''

HEADLINE: The Electric Car, Unplugged

BYLINE: By JOHN BRODER. 
A reporter on energy and the environment for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE future would appear bright for the electric car. Gasoline prices are high. The government is spending billions on battery technology. Auto companies are preparing to roll out a dozen new electrified models. Concern is growing about the climate impacts of burning oil. And tough new fuel economy standards are looming.
Yet the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate. General Motors has temporarily suspended production of the plug-in electric Chevy Volt because of low sales. Nissan's all-electric Leaf is struggling in the market. A number of start-up electric vehicle and battery companies have folded. And the federal government has slowed its multibillion-dollar program of support for advanced technology vehicles in the face of market setbacks and heavy political criticism.
The $41,000 Volt, in particular, has become a target of conservatives. Glenn Beck called the Volt ''crappy.'' Rush Limbaugh accused General Motors of ''trying to kill its customers'' by selling an unsafe car. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said while campaigning for president in Georgia last month that the Volt was too small to handle a gun rack (a claim proved wrong repeatedly on YouTube). 
Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman of General Motors, defended the Volt before Congress earlier this year after revelations that the battery pack in one Volt caught fire three weeks after a federal crash test. Federal authorities eventually declared the car no more flammable than regular gasoline-fueled vehicles.
''Unfortunately, there's one thing we did not engineer,'' Mr. Akerson said. ''Although we loaded the Volt with state-of-the-art safety features, we did not engineer the Volt to be a political punching bag. And that, sadly, is what it's become.''
Is this the beginning of the end of the latest experiment in the electric car, whose checkered history goes back to the dawn of the automobile age? Can the electric car survive only with heavy government subsidies and big consumer rebates? Are the Teslas and Fiskers and ActiveEs and Volts and Leafs destined to be the playthings of only rich technophiles with a couple of spare gas-powered cars at home?
Or is this what an emergent technology looks like before it crosses the valley of death?
''Face it, this is not an easy task,'' said Brett Smith, assistant research director at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''You still have an energy storage device that's not ready for prime time. You still have the chicken and egg problem with the charging infrastructure. That's not to say it's not viable over the long run. But the hype is gone and the challenges are still there.''
The market for all-electric and plug-in electric cars in the United States is tiny, amounting to fewer than 20,000 sales last year out of total light-vehicle sales of 12.8 million. Even in optimistic forecasts, plug-in vehicles will account for less than 5 percent of the global market by 2025.
Hybrids that do not require external charging, however, like today's Toyota Prius and many others already in showrooms, are a growing segment. Forecasters say they could represent as much as 6 percent of the market by 2015 and 25 percent by 2025, in part because they are among the few vehicles currently on track to meet the government's proposed new fuel economy standard of roughly 50 miles per gallon by 2025.
Other propulsion technologies, like natural gas and fuel cells, are more likely to be seen first in heavy trucks and local delivery vans because of limited refueling options.
Jon Bereisa is a former G.M. systems engineer who helped design the Volt and was among the lead developers of the company's mid-1990s experiment in electric vehicles, the ill-fated EV1. He says that the prospects for the electric car are much better today than they were then, but technical development, cost reduction and consumer acceptance are going to take far longer than most people expect.
''There is much more political support for it today, for a variety of reasons,'' he said. ''Global warming, energy security, petroleum prices, all these vectors are aligned to support the electrification of the automobile, whether it's hybrid, plug-in, extended-range hybrid or full battery-electric.''
But he added that the Volt was an incredibly complicated device in the early stages of development. ''When you push the start button, you've got 10 million lines of software running. On an F-15, it's about eight million lines of code. You're really driving a modern data center, and a lot can go wrong.''
He noted that the current Volt was the first generation and predicted that its third version, which will come between 2020 and 2025, will gain wide acceptance, as long as G.M. does not end the project and the government backs a nationwide infrastructure of charging stations.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, who has been a strong supporter of alternative vehicle and fuel technologies, proposed this month spending more than $4 billion to encourage purchases of electric and natural gas vehicles and to speed construction of charging and fueling stations. He is seeking to raise the current $7,500 purchase incentive for electric and plug-in electric vehicles to $10,000, and to make it a point-of-sale rebate rather than a credit to be claimed on a tax return.
David B. Sandalow, the assistant secretary of energy for policy and international affairs, said that the Obama administration was fully committed to nurturing this technology, and he is persuaded that, eventually, it will catch on.
''It is the future of transportation,'' said Mr. Sandalow, who saves money on gas by commuting to work in a Prius converted to run 30 miles on battery power alone. ''The only question is how fast and how soon.''
He said that China, Germany, Israel, South Africa and other nations were racing ahead with electric vehicle programs and maintained that President Obama's goal of putting one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 was achievable if Congress fully financed his rebate and infrastructure proposals.
Most analysts doubt the million-car goal is achievable, as the enthusiasm over electrification in the industry has begun to flicker and the price of battery technology remains stubbornly high.
At the recent auto show in Geneva, for example, Peter Schwarzenbauer, a top executive at Audi, said of electric vehicles, which generated considerable buzz at previous shows, ''Reality is phasing in.''
And Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the German automaker Daimler, said that cost, range and consumer rates remained serious problems for the electric car. Still, he said, the company would continue work on such vehicles, as well as those powered by gasoline, diesel and hydrogen.
''There is no alternative,'' Mr. Zetsche told reporters. ''We believe it is our responsibility to push this technology forward and make it marketable.''
The fate of the electric car remains hazy, with technical, economic and political forces working both for and against it. Chris Paine, who made the 2006 documentary ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' about the demise of G.M.'s EV1 at the hands of the car company, government regulators and the oil industry, said he was alarmed at how quickly the political climate had turned against the Chevy Volt and other electric vehicles, and offered a theory as to why.
''The attacks leave me a bit stunned,'' he said in an e-mail message. He said the Volt had been more successful in the marketplace than the early Prius was and that today, unlike in the late 1990s, the government and the auto industry are fully behind electric vehicle programs.
But one possible culprit still stands to gain if the electric car is killed yet again, Mr. Paine suggested.
''Not too hard to guess,'' he said. ''With Americans paying $250 a month to fill up on gasoline when electricity can do the job in a Volt for $50 a month, why are we being told electric cars are failures? Who could possibly be behind this?''

HEADLINE: Don't Cry for Her, Argentina; She Landed the Big Role

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
EVITAS tend to be formidable women -- Patti LuPone, Madonna, Elaine Paige -- so Elena Roger, the Argentine actress who stars in the Broadway revival that opens April 5, stuns at first glimpse.
Dramatically collapsed on the floor of a rehearsal hall (no worries, it's the part of the script where Evita is not feeling so good), Ms. Roger, barely 5 feet tall and weighing 98 pounds, seems not so much an actress as a limp collection of rags. In London, where she played Eva Peron in the 2006 revival of ''Evita'' that took her from unknown to sensation, great writerly phrases about her size were tossed out in the press: ''Shoulders narrow as a bar of hotel soap,'' ''five foot nothing half feral child,'' ''ineradicably tiny.'' 
Then you later watch Ms. Roger in a dress rehearsal at the Marquis Theater, in a number with the pop star Ricky Martin, who plays her acerbic critic Che, and Michael Cerveris, as her husband Juan Peron. Evita is sexually maneuvering her way up Argentine society, and Ms. Roger has seemingly grown three feet. Her voice may not wield the belt of Ms. LuPone, who originated the role on Broadway, but it is rich and powerful, deeply accented with Spanish. She has also been a professional tango dancer. One sweep of her leg, one pasada, and you have four decades of Argentine conflict.
''I feel very connected with the story,'' she said.
That has not merely to do with the histories Ms. Roger has digested, or the never-released film she found from when Eva was an actress (''She was quite good''), but the lore Ms. Roger has absorbed about Eva Peron simply by being from Argentina. She speaks of an aunt who hid a bust of Evita when Juan Peron was out of favor and in exile, then displayed it in the dining room when he came back; the family arguments that continued decades after Evita's death about whether the Perons had been good or bad for the country.
Mr. Cerveris hears the connection in her way with a song. ''The thing that moves me most is the authenticity and the sincerity and the veracity of the voice,'' he said, ''a tonal quality owing less to Broadway and far more to the Argentine singing and folk and tango tradition that she has by birth.''
''Evita,'' with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, has not been produced on Broadway since 1979. The New York and London revivals, directed by Michael Grandage and choreographed by Rob Ashford, feature some changes. Che, portrayed by Mandy Patinkin as Che the revolutionary, will be Che the Everyman, as the role was originally envisioned, the current creative team said. The Oscar-winning song ''You Must Love Me,'' written for the 1996 film version starring Madonna, has been incorporated into the show. And Mr. Grandage said dance is a more important element.
Yet in sticking with Ms. Roger in the title role of the $11 million musical (Christina DeCicco will play the part at matinees), producers are taking a risk in a star-driven Broadway, which may explain the biggest change between London and New York: the addition of Mr. Martin, who arrives with a built-in fan base.
If the pressure's on her, Ms. Roger doesn't show it. Warm and playful, this 37-year-old actress is the sort who greets a newcomer with a hug. In floppy sweats in her nondescript dressing room she's another vegetarian actress having a salad for dinner. But in Buenos Aires she's a film and theater star who lives with the film and television actor Mariano Torre. She is also a star in London, where she followed ''Evita'' with leading roles in Donmar Warehouse productions of ''Piaf'' and ''Passion.''
Though Ms. Roger was born almost two decades after the death of Eva Peron, the first lady of Argentina from 1946 until her death from cancer six years later at 33, debates about the legacy of the Perons lived on in her family. Her paternal grandparents, who came from Patagonia, in the south, were pro-Peron. Her grandfather worked in the post office and saw the toys that the Peronista government sent to children every Christmas; he was able to buy his home because of government aid.
Ms. Roger's maternal grandfather, who had fled Italy in 1925 after hearing that Mussolini's men were after him, took a darker view. His daughter, Ms. Roger's mother, suspected that the Perons had bankrupted the country. She told Elena of attending an athletic camp, run by Juan Peron after Eva had died. Juan's fondness for young women was so well known that Ms. Roger's mother didn't want to eat lunch.
''She was scared they had put something in the food,'' Ms. Roger said.
She was afraid she would be drugged and taken advantage of sexually? Ms. Roger nodded her head yes.
Yet her research on Eva has led her to be sympathetic. The Perons did improve the lives of workers. They did give women the vote. And it would be hard for her not to like a character she has to portray. ''I try to understand,'' she said, ''and not judge.''
Ms. Roger, whose father was a rubber salesman and mother was a housewife, grew up in Buenos Aires, the youngest of three children. She studied dance from the age of 8 and singing from 12. Although one director told her she was too short ever to be a leading lady, she worked successfully, often in foreign shows like ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''Saturday Night Fever'' and ''Les Miserables,'' in which she played Fantine, the role originated in London by Randy Graff.
Argentina's economic meltdown in 2001 -- which included mass demonstrations and President Fernando de la Rua fleeing the Casa Rosada, the executive mansion, which had been the stage so often for Eva Peron (and where ''Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'' is sung) -- had a personal effect on Ms. Roger. Her father had a stroke, which she is convinced came from the stress.
''This was the end of everything,'' Ms. Roger said. ''He is not able to move the right side of his body, he is not able to walk, he was 45 days in coma.'' He can understand what people are saying, she said, but cannot speak.
The financial crisis also derailed some of her own theatrical projects. Ms. Roger found work in soap operas, performed in concert, and toured Europe for three months with a tango company. Then, in October 2005, an Argentine friend, Ana Moll, who was working in London for Mr. Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group, heard that the revival was being planned. She recommended Ms. Roger, who flew to London at her own expense.
''It was clear she could sing it,'' Mr. Rice said. ''The initial concern was whether she had the command of English.''
Determined to win the role, Ms. Roger worked with a bilingual friend on English pronunciation. When she was invited back -- this time the company paid -- it was apparent she was a quick study. And this time Mr. Lloyd Webber was there.
''Everything was very emotional,'' Ms. Roger said.
''When I was singing, 'What's New, Buenos Aires?','' she added, she really knew the places. ''Rio de la Plata, Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio. I worked so much in Corrientes, the theater street. I was trying to show in my eyes, 'Look, I know those streets.' ''
When she sang ''Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'' in her last audition, Ms. Roger cried.
''We were in Andrew Lloyd Webber's house in London,'' she said. ''Ana came with me because I couldn't understand English very well. I was singing all the big songs for the producer and Tim Rice, and a great thing was the pianist didn't have the music for 'You Must Love Me,' so Andrew played.
''I suddenly was thinking: 'Oh, my God, I am from Argentina, from that neighborhood. I am so simple, what am I doing here? And someone like Andrew is playing for me to sing. Wow, life is quite amazing.' One of the windows was open, and I start singing and getting emotional and the curtain flew like that.''
Ms. Roger does a wave of her hand, intimating a ghostly flutter. ''I said, 'Ana, I felt she was there.' ''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2012

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 25 about the actress Elena Roger, who is starring in ''Evita'' on Broadway, referred imprecisely to Ms. Roger's experience in dance. While she once toured Europe with a tango company for three months, she is not a considered a professional tango dancer. The article also misstated the current plans for Ms. Roger's understudy, Christina DeCicco. She is scheduled to take over the role of Eva Peron during Wednesday night performances, not during matinees.

HEADLINE: Santorum Calls Romney 'Worst Republican' to Run Against Obama

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum urged Republicans in Wisconsin to consider Mitt Romney's record, particularly on the issue of health care, before making him the party's nominee to face President Obama in the general election. 

 BODY:
RACINE, Wis. - Rick Santorum urged Republicans here Sunday evening to carefully study the record of Mitt Romney, declaring: "He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama."
At the final campaign rally of a weekend trip to Wisconsin, Mr. Santorum sharpened the tenor of his argument against Mr. Romney during an appearance here at the South Hills Country Club. He offered a litany of reasons for why he said he believed Mr. Romney presented a weak contrast to Mr. Obama, particularly on health care.
"Pick any other Republican in the country," Mr. Santorum told supporters here. "He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama. Why would Wisconsin want to vote for someone like that?"
Mr. Santorum, who was criticized by Republicans last week after suggesting that there was little difference between electing Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney, grew angry after his speech when asked to expound on his comment about Mr. Romney being the "worst Republican."
"What speech did you listen to?" Mr. Santorum told The New York Times, speaking in a terse and agitated tone. "I said he was the worst Republican to run on the issue of Obamacare. That's what I was talking about."
Mr. Santorum, as he signed autographs along a rope line, continued to raise his voice and suggested the media had been "distorting my words." He used an expletive to make his point, saying again that it was Mr. Romney's health care record - not his positions in general - that make him the "worst Republican" to run against Mr. Obama.
"On the issue of health care, yes, that's what I was talking about," Mr. Santorum later told reporters. "Obamacare, as you heard me say."

HEADLINE: Anger at Goldman Still Simmers

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Just before the financial crisis began in September 2008, a prominent hedge fund appeared well positioned to take advantage of any turmoil in the markets. That fund, Copper River Partners, had made sizable bets months earlier against companies whose stocks it expected to suffer.
Within weeks, however, Copper River, once a successful $1.5 billion hedge fund, was out of business, having unexpectedly absorbed losses on the very bets it thought would be profitable. While the market turmoil contributed to its problems, Marc Cohodes, head of Copper River, says that a significant force behind the failure was Goldman Sachs, which for years had been the firm's broker.
Testifying recently in a lawsuit that is unrelated to Copper River's closing, Mr. Cohodes maintained that actions taken in the fall of 2008 by Goldman in the handling of trades for Copper River had done irreparable damage to the fund. His testimony, which has not been made public, was obtained by The New York Times.
Copper River relied on Goldman to handle its negative bets, known as short sales, in compliance with securities laws. These regulations require that before a short sale can be made, the shares must be borrowed; Mr. Cohodes said his fund had paid Goldman approximately $100 million to borrow shares over many years. 
In his testimony, Mr. Cohodes said he and his partners at Copper River had even come to wonder if Goldman had in fact borrowed the shares for the firm. Without the shares, Copper River faced losses, while Goldman could have come under regulatory scrutiny.
When asked whether Goldman had borrowed the shares, Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said: ''Mr. Cohodes is wrong. We met our obligations under applicable law.'' He added that Copper River's problems were the result of the extreme stress in the financial markets at the time.
Goldman has sought to seal the transcript of Mr. Cohodes's deposition, which is part of a case brought by Overstock.com, an Internet retailer, against two of the biggest Wall Street firms. Overstock contends that the firms -- Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch -- failed to borrow company shares that they or their clients sold short, a practice known as naked shorting. Overstock says that the firms essentially evaded rules intended to prevent stock manipulations, and that its stock came under outsize selling pressure as a result.
Both of the firms sued by Overstock have denied the company's accusations. They have requested that the judge overseeing the case seal all the documents generated in the discovery process, contending that their release would disclose trade secrets about the business, known as securities lending, which is highly profitable for the firms. The Times has joined three other media companies in asking the court to unseal the documents. Mr. Cohodes's deposition, however, is not subject to the seal.
Earlier this month, John E. Munter, the judge overseeing the case in California state court, ruled that many of the documents should be made public. The firms are expected to appeal the ruling.
Mr. Cohodes declined to comment beyond his deposition or to explain why he had not sued Goldman over his fund's losses. He has left the money management business and now raises chickens on his farm in Northern California. As an investor who often bet against companies, he drew the ire of many of his targets' executives and shareholders. That he is a straight-talking man who enjoys the combat comes through in his testimony.
Mr. Cohodes is not a party in the Overstock lawsuit and has had a longstanding adversarial relationship with the company, whose stock he bet against. When asked in the deposition if he wanted to help Overstock, he replied, ''Oh, absolutely not.''
Goldman's handling of its clients has been a hot topic since the credit bubble burst. The firm's creation of Abacus, a mortgage security that was meant to fail but was sold to the firm's clients without disclosing that fact, was the subject of a $550 million regulatory settlement and Congressional hearings.
More recently, a Goldman executive named Greg Smith resigned from the firm and wrote a scathing Op-Ed article in The Times. Mr. Smith contended in his open letter to the firm's top management that its culture had become toxic and that it had placed its own interests ahead of its customers'. Goldman denied the claims and contended that its customers came first.
Mr. Cohodes's testimony in the Overstock case provides new details of his fund's surprising demise in the market rout. At the time Copper River closed, he only alluded to his problems with Goldman. In an early October 2008 letter to investors describing the September turmoil, he said that ''counterparties did not provide the level of business support that they have in the past,'' something that exacerbated losses.
While few investors understand or care about the mechanics of securities lending, the area has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several cases in recent years accusing market participants of failing to borrow shares they or their customers had sold short, improperly creating a supply of additional stock to sell.
Along with a handful of traders at smallish firms, Goldman's securities lending unit has been cited by regulators for lapses. In 2010, the S.E.C. sued Goldman on accusations that it ''willfully'' had failed to preborrow shares as required for its short-selling clients in January 2009, shortly after Copper River went out of business. The improprieties involved 385 short sales in which the firm had not located shares for its brokerage clients to borrow.
Goldman paid $450,000 to settle the case without admitting or denying the accusations.
Failing to borrow shares on behalf of customers is illegal because of concerns about market manipulation. But it can also leave a brokerage firm's client who is short a stock dangerously exposed to an escalating price in the shares. If a stock shorted by an investor began to trade higher and the shares were not borrowed, closing out the transaction would require the fund to buy them in the open market. That could propel the already rising price of the shares even higher, adding to the costs of the trade.
Mr. Cohodes, who worked at the hedge fund for 25 years, testified in the Overstock case because his firm had placed short bets on that Internet company's shares during the mid-2000s. In 2005 Overstock sued Copper River for stock manipulation, seeking $1 billion in damages. Copper River denied the accusations but settled the matter in late 2009, paying $5 million.
In his Overstock testimony, Mr. Cohodes described Goldman's role as the primary brokerage firm used by Copper River from 2004 through October 2008. Goldman conducted many of Copper River's trades and was relied upon to locate all the shares the firm needed to borrow before it bet against companies.
According to Mr. Cohodes's deposition, Copper River often sold short shares that were hard to locate for borrowing purposes and therefore extremely costly. As such, Copper River paid Goldman handsomely to make sure its trades complied with securities laws, Mr. Cohodes testified. He was unhappy about these fees, he said, but assumed that they were the cost of doing business and that Goldman was charging the market rate for following the rules.
''I view stock loan sort of as the Mafia,'' Mr. Cohodes said in his deposition. ''It's a black box where you don't know people's inputs and costs, and it was sort of: 'Here's the rate. If you want to borrow it, this is the rate.' And it is what it is.''
As an investor, Mr. Cohodes had long expected a stock market correction to result when the overheated mortgage market finally cooled. By mid-2008 he had put on sizable bets against companies that he thought would suffer in such a rout, he testified. One was American Capital, an investment company; others were the Open Text Corporation, a company that offers intranet applications, and Jos. A. Bank, a men's clothing store.
When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed in early September 2008 and the stock market began to fall, Mr. Cohodes thought that his firm was well positioned to profit from the downturn, he recalled. His troubles began after Lehman Brothers failed; Copper River's funds at the firm were suddenly frozen. Then government regulators changed the rules governing short-selling, banning the practice altogether in shares of roughly 800 financial companies and decreasing the amount of time allowed for such trades to settle.
This caused a violent rally in these shares. But the stocks that made up Copper River's largest short positions were not on the short ban list.
Nevertheless, the stocks climbed, and Goldman began requiring Copper River to unwind its short positions by buying back the shares. This upset Mr. Cohodes, he said, because the firm's account was in compliance with its federal regulatory margin requirement. Moreover, the fund was not leveraged; it had not made its bets using borrowed money.
Instead, he said, he suspected that Goldman had never borrowed the shares for Copper River's short positions and was trying to close out the trades to eliminate the problematic naked short positions. Because Goldman had a duty to borrow the shares, it could have risked regulatory questions about compliance, under Mr. Cohodes's account.
Mr. DuVally rejected this argument. ''Significant losses and a drop in position value caused the Copper River accounts to incur risk calls in September 2008, which it did not adequately address,'' he said. ''As a result, we declared an event of default, which entitled us as prime broker to require liquidation of the account.''
Desperate to save his firm, Mr. Cohodes said he began working to transfer his account to another bank, BNP Paribas. Goldman refused to release Copper River's positions, he said.
When he discussed having another fund, Farallon Capital, take over Copper River's short positions, Goldman thwarted that transfer as well, Mr. Cohodes testified. Farallon's chief financial officer had told Copper River that an unnamed trader on Goldman's proprietary desk had warned him not to take the hedge fund's positions because it would ''be out of business in a couple of days anyway,'' the deposition said.
Greg Swart, the chief financial officer at Farallon, declined to comment.
As the stocks continued climbing, Mr. Cohodes came to believe that Goldman was buying the stocks that he was short ahead of him, driving up their prices and making Copper River's short-covering purchases even more costly, he testified.
Mr. Cohodes continued: ''The stock market was literally falling apart, going straight down. And our short positions would have benefited hugely by the market falling apart and melting down. But the stocks that we had to cover were all going straight up in violent fashions in a straight-down market.'' Someone, he said, was driving up his price.
Mr. DuVally of Goldman said in response, ''We looked into these front-running allegations, and they are not true.'' He added, ''We conducted the liquidation in a manner designed to limit, to the extent possible in an extremely volatile market, losses in Copper River's accounts.'' He declined to say why Goldman did not allow Copper River's accounts to be transferred.
It is possible, of course, that other investors knew of Copper River's short trades, figured that the fund was in distress and rushed to buy the stocks the fund was covering. But the warning call to Farallon from Goldman's proprietary desk indicated to Mr. Cohodes that the Wall Street firm was front-running Copper River, he said.
As soon as Copper River's short trades were closed out, the stocks it had focused on began plummeting, charts show. Most of the stocks peaked on Sept. 23 and started falling precipitously.
''I think Goldman Sachs is a racketeering entity that does whatever they can to make a dime without conscience, thought, foresight or care about ramifications,'' Mr. Cohodes concluded in his testimony. ''I think they are cold-blooded and could care less about the law. That's my opinion. I think I can back it up.''
Goldman said Mr. Cohodes had been a satisfied Goldman customer who changed his view only after his fund experienced losses.
Copper River closed at the end of September 2008. The stocks it had been short soon collapsed.

HEADLINE: Red Bulls Quickly Change Mood at Home

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
HARRISON, N.J. -- After a sputtering, mistake-laden start to their season in which they lost two games on the road, the Red Bulls needed a mere six minutes Sunday afternoon to turn Red Bull Arena into a nearly impregnable fortress.
Thierry Henry scored in the third minute, then sent a perfect lead pass onto the foot of his front-line running mate Kenny Cooper for the game's second goal three minutes later as the Red Bulls defeated the short-handed Colorado Rapids, 4-1, before 21,024. Henry and Cooper each added goals in the second half. 
''The difference today was no mistakes,'' Henry said. ''It was important to get the crowd going, and you saw -- it was Colorado that made the first mistake.''
In the opening minutes, Rapids midfielder Ross LaBauex, pressed into duty for the injured Pablo Mastroeni (concussion symptoms), hit a weak back pass toward goalkeeper Matt Pickens. Henry dashed in to intercept, cut around Drew Moor and hit a left-footed shot under Pickens for his first goal of the season.
Three minutes later, Rafael Marquez, playing in his first match after serving a three-game suspension that carried over from last season's playoffs, found Henry in the middle of the field, about 40 yards from the Colorado goal.
Henry quickly turned and split the defense with a perfectly weighted pass to Cooper. As Moor slid to the turf, Cooper nudged the ball to his right and then fired a right-footed shot that eluded Pickens and the diving Marvell Wynne as it rolled into the net.
''I wouldn't say this was a must-win, but almost,'' Red Bulls Coach Hans Backe said. ''Confidence-wise, the players were a little shaky, I think. We were solid offensively and defensively.''
The defense was solidified, and it fed off the play of the newly acquired the Colombian veteran Wilman Conde. Conde, in his first game since recovering from a thigh injury, used an economy of movement on the back line, but he was impressive in cutting off attacks by the Rapids and then starting breaks in the other direction, often with long, diagonal passes.
''He was massive,'' Backe said. ''He's clever, and when you're a clever center back, you don't have to run that much. I didn't know about his leadership skills, but he's very strong tactically, and I think he helped everyone back there. I just hope he can stay fresh and solid, and injury-free.''
The Rapids (2-1) were without the veteran Mastroeni and the midfield general Jeff Larentowicz, who was serving a one-game suspension for his ejection last week in Philadelphia.
Omar Cummings scored Colorado's goal, stealing the ball from Marquez in the midfield and hitting a chip from about 25 yards that looped over the head of the Red Bulls' rookie goalkeeper, Ryan Meara.
Last season, Marquez might have been booed by the home fans for the error. This season, he says he has rededicated himself to the club, and his effort showed, other than his miscue.
''Obviously, for me, it's important to continue playing like this,'' Marquez, the captain of Mexico's national team, said. ''It's important to leave everything on the field. It was really difficult coming off last season. It's been a challenge, but I think I've prepared well.''
Henry scored his second goal nine minutes into the second half, on a long free kick from Conde, and Cooper notched his second from close range in the 89th minute.
Notes
Red Bulls midfielder Joel Lindpere started his 57th consecutive game in M.L.S. dating to May 29, 2010. It is the second-longest active streak behind the 60 games of Vancouver's Sebastien Le Toux, but Le Toux also played for Seattle and Philadelphia during his streak. ... Striker Juan Agudelo, who tore the meniscus in his left knee playing for the United States under-23 national team against Cuba last Thursday, was examined by the Red Bulls' medical staff Sunday. He said that he would have surgery Monday and that he expected to miss four to six weeks. ... Red Bulls midfielder Teemu Tainio missed the match with a right ankle contusion.

HEADLINE: Industries Fear the Ripple Effects of Proposed Postal Service Cuts

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Wine wholesalers and amateur beer makers want Congress to repeal a law that makes it illegal to ship alcohol by mail.
Giant insurers like Aegon of the Netherlands want to make sure that the United States Postal Service stays out of the insurance business. And medical supply companies like Medco oppose the post office's plans to cut Saturday delivery, saying the move would delay medicines and could add to the cost of mail-order drugs.
As Congress begins work this week on legislation to shore up the finances of the debt-ridden post office, companies representing a cross-section of American business are spending millions of dollars lobbying lawmakers to oppose or support various proposals to keep the agency afloat. 
In total, lobbying disclosure records show that companies and unions with a stake in a postal overhaul have spent nearly $300 million in the last three years as the financial condition of the post office has worsened, though it is not known how much of that was spent specifically on postal issues.
The service is the backbone of a mailing and shipping industry that employs more than 8.5 million people and supports almost $1 trillion in economic activity every year. The service itself employs 574,000 people.
Nearly every business relies on the post office to deliver packages, advertise services and send out bills. This postal supply chain supports millions of American jobs in fields as diverse as banking, agriculture, media and manufacturing.
Benjamin Y. Cooper, a lobbyist with the Williams & Jensen firm in Washington, and a coordinator for the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, said the level of interest shown in post office reform is understandable, given its importance to the economy.
''It's not a stretch to say that many businesses literally depend on the Postal Service for their livelihoods,'' said Mr. Cooper, whose coalition represents some of the service's biggest customers, including FedEx, which sometimes hands off shipments to the post office at the local level.
But the service is losing a staggering $36 million a day as customers are increasingly turning to the Internet in place of letters, print publications and monthly bills that arrive by mail. Because of a Congressional mandate, the service has to pay $5.5 billion annually into a fund for its future retirees, adding $20 billion in debt since 2007.
To trim its operating costs, the service has proposed closing 3,700 post offices, mostly in rural areas; shutting more than 250 mail processing centers; cutting Saturday delivery; expanding into new lines of business; and increasing postal rates.
But many companies are deeply concerned about the sweeping proposals and say cuts in service and rate increases could have a devastating effect on their businesses.
Greeting card companies say they are especially concerned about proposals to raise the postage rates.
''We think increasing rates would be counterproductive for the Postal Service and for customers like us,'' said Rafe Morrissey, vice president for postal affairs at the Greeting Card Association, which includes Hallmark. ''The price increases would cause people to turn more to electronic mail and away from physical cards.''
Mr. Morrissey said the greeting card industry is less dependent on electronic commerce than other industries are, and about 60 percent of cards are still sent through the mail.
While rate increases and delivery are the most pressing concerns for greeting card companies, as well as magazine and newspaper publishers, some businesses are worried about the post office branching out into their lines of business.
As the service looks for new ways to raise revenue, various proposals in Congress would allow it to get into financial services or insurance, as do postal offices in European countries. And that has some insurance companies worried.
Jack Dolan, a spokesman for American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group that represents companies like Aegon, said the industry wants the post office to stay out of the insurance business.
''But, if perchance they were able to sell insurance products, we'd want to make certain that the playing field is level and they comply by the same licensing and selling standards our companies are subject to. No unfair advantage,'' Mr. Dolan said in an e-mail.
Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general, said the service had no interest in getting into the insurance business.
''We've heard people tossing around the idea of letting us get into banking or selling insurance, but we don't think that's a good fit for us,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''We want to do things that utilize our strengths, and that's mailing and shipping.''
However, the post office would like to expand into the shipping of beer and wine. Under current postal regulations, it is prohibited from shipping alcohol through the mail.
Shipping alcoholic beverages would allow the service to compete with FedEx and U.P.S. and handle packages sent by licensed wine and beer manufacturers in accordance with state laws.
Pete Johnson, a program manager for the Brewers Association, said being able to ship through the mail would lower the cost of shipping for wine and beer wholesalers who now have to depend on private shippers to send their products.
''Even hobbyists who want to ship their beer to brewery competitions would benefit,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Right now it's illegal for them to do so even though they can't sell the beer commercially.''
While beer and wine sellers see postal reform legislation as way to loosen regulations that could increase revenue for them, other businesses see proposals that could restrict their sales.
In a written statement, Medco, a drug delivery company based in Franklin Lakes, N.J., said eliminating Saturday mail delivery would delay orders for prescription drugs, creating difficulties for patients who need their medications on time.
Some lawmakers said they were concerned about the effect of the service's plans on businesses and its own future.
''Companies large and small that rely on the mail tell me that if the service deteriorates, they will conduct more business online and encourage their customers to switch to online services for bill paying and other transactions,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. ''Once they turn to other communications options and leave the mail system, they won't be coming back, and the Postal Service will be sucked into a death spiral.''

HEADLINE: Benefits of Natural Gas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Natural Born Drillers'' (column, March 16):
Despite Paul Krugman's portrayal, natural gas producers are aggressively regulated by both state and federal authorities. It is proved every day that you don't have to sacrifice environmental protection to have domestic energy, jobs and economic development. 
Natural gas producers are also major job creators. More than 600,000 jobs exist today thanks to American shale gas production. That number is expected to grow to 1.6 million by 2035. Because of the abundance of natural gas, major manufacturing companies are building new facilities here in the United States instead of overseas.
Because natural gas is a clean, abundant American resource, we see our nation's power generators using more of it, often partnering with renewable sources, cleaning the air over our cities and towns. City buses, waste trucks, and utility and delivery trucks are switching to natural gas, eliminating emissions and saving money on fuel.
Our own resource, American natural gas, is and should be a growing choice when making economic, environmental and clean energy decisions.

HEADLINE: Visions of India Dancing

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
When an illustrious Indian dance company performs in New York, as the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble did at the Joyce Theater last week, we can take both pleasure and instruction from it. Music and dance operate in thrilling proximity; the visual sensuousness is in many ways exceptional; the levels of technical achievement and stylistic polish are high. Best of all we're given a window into a culture far from our own.
New York hosts several first-rate Indian companies or dance soloists each year. From April 9 to 15, when the Indo-American Arts Council presents its annual Erasing Borders festival of Indian dance, the opening dancer will be Sujata Mohapatra. Like the Nrityagram dancers, she is a leading exemplar of the Odissi style of the eastern state of Orissa. In June Shantala Shivalingappa comes to the Joyce for a week; internationally celebrated for her work with Pina Bausch, she is an exponent of the Kuchipudi style from the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh. 
In visiting India last month my main aim was not to see dance performances but the setting from which Indian dance derives. The great temples of the southern state of Tamil Nadu and in Orissa were all I had hoped: temples as singular but multifaceted worlds, most of them still in intense daily use and studded with imagery of bodies in motion. Dance forms all over Southeast Asia stem from the Natya Shastra, the treatise on the performing arts written between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200; more than 100 of its dance positions are illustrated in a centuries-old bas relief at the temple at Chidambaram, a number of which are precisely the same as those we see in some Indian classical forms today.
When I watched the Nrityagram performance last week, many of these positions fell into place in my mind in a way they had not early in my visit to India, when I saw the same choreography in rehearsal. Henceforth it will be interesting to recognize them with other Indian dancers.
In Orissa, while the devadasis (female temple artists, both musicians and dancers) used to perform within the temples, a version of their art was also practiced outside the precincts by the gotipuas, boys who were trained to dance female Odissi roles before puberty. Most of us would assume that theirs too has become a bygone art; but no. I saw two gotipua troupes rehearse on successive days.
They grow their hair long (pulled back in ponytails when I saw them); their training brings with it board, lodging and nondance education. (A number of them stay with the Odissi art in adult life, as musicians, dancers and teachers.) Their applause-winning specialty (not evidently feminine) consists of acrobatic feats and tableaus.
What impressed me more, however, was the boys' youthful mastery of the basics of Odissi style. Hardly had they made their processional entrance, in single file, than in unison they demonstrated a tribhanga -- a celebrated Odissi S-bend position in which dancers create a series of upward curves at knee, torso and shoulder -- and contrasted it with the sculpturally square position called chowk, all amid a swaying dance of ritual invocation.
These and other features make it tempting to declare that the traditions of Indian dance are in good health. When I got off the plane in Bhubaneswar, Orissa's capital city, I was gratified to see that the main poster image for the state featured Odissi dancing. Dance and religion are still vitally connected. While in Tamil Nadu I attended the celebration of Shivaratri, the night when Shiva, god and dancer, is honored with open-air dance festivals at the temples of both Chidambaram and Thanjavur, each running for five nights. Watching the marathon of dance I felt honored to attend and in awe of a culture where dance and worship fluently interlock.
But there are ways in which it seems obvious that the virtues of Indian classical dance are threatened. Though I saw much beautiful work in rehearsal, much of it is vitiated by the practices that surround live performance, especially at the festivals. I attended four programs at three different dance festivals: many of their features were too dismaying to pass without comment.
When Indian dancers use taped music in the West, I've always assumed it is only because the economics of global travel made live music prohibitive. But at Thanjavur and at Bhubaneswar taped music was the norm. Worse, at those and at Chidambaram the music was carelessly overamplified. You don't need to know much about Indian dance to recognize that you should sometimes hear the slap of the soles of the dancers' feet on the floor and the jingling of their ankle bells. And yet it was impossible to hear any such thing.
More frustratingly, you frequently couldn't even see the feet. Why? Because it is the norm for a dozen or more photographers to be lined along the footlights, barring the general audience's view. Meanwhile it's standard for members of the audience to use cellphones during performances. Even members of the press took calls and sometimes texted while there was dancing onstage.
More problematic, there was a sense that classical dance is being adapted for tourism. Too many of the dances I saw in performances seemed to have been packaged like son-et-lumiere entertainments. Some Indian dancers later told me that they now prefer to perform abroad because the local conditions are so irksome.
Within a culture changing as drastically as that of India today, how will the Indian classical dance forms adapt? I hope to return to find out. In Chennai I visited the celebrated dance school of Kalakshetra, which specializes in Bharata Natyam, Tamil Nadu's own classical dance idiom. Five minutes of watching a second-year group class practice pure dance demonstrated to me how taxing but exhilarating it can be; a fourth-year class showed how absorbing the more expressional form, Abhinaya, can be.
A young man in the first class and a young woman in the second struck me as outstanding. Their stylistic assurance gave me the impression that Bharata Natyam was their inheritance, but I was mistaken. The man was from a Tamil Nadu folk-dancing family of a completely different idiom; the woman was American, of a family of Sri Lankan extraction. Yet here they were, dancing the style they had recently acquired as if it were in their DNA. This new generation's commitment to the classical genres of India gives hope that they are well set to endure.
The Erasing Borders festival of Indian dance runs from April 9 to 15 at locations in New York City;iacc.us.com.

HEADLINE: The Rich Get Even Richer

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner is a contributing writer for Op-Ed and a longtime Wall Street executive.

 BODY:
NEW statistics show an ever-more-startling divergence between the fortunes of the wealthy and everybody else -- and the desperate need to address this wrenching problem. Even in a country that sometimes seems inured to income inequality, these takeaways are truly stunning.
In 2010, as the nation continued to recover from the recession, a dizzying 93 percent of the additional income created in the country that year, compared to 2009 -- $288 billion -- went to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those with at least $352,000 in income. That delivered an average single-year pay increase of 11.6 percent to each of these households. 
Still more astonishing was the extent to which the super rich got rich faster than the merely rich. In 2010, 37 percent of these additional earnings went to just the top 0.01 percent, a teaspoon-size collection of about 15,000 households with average incomes of $23.8 million. These fortunate few saw their incomes rise by 21.5 percent.
The bottom 99 percent received a microscopic $80 increase in pay per person in 2010, after adjusting for inflation. The top 1 percent, whose average income is $1,019,089, had an 11.6 percent increase in income.
This new data, derived by the French economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez from American tax returns, also suggests that those at the top were more likely to earn than inherit their riches. That's not completely surprising: the rapid growth of new American industries -- from technology to financial services -- has increased the need for highly educated and skilled workers. At the same time, old industries like manufacturing are employing fewer blue-collar workers.
The result? Pay for college graduates has risen by 15.7 percent over the past 32 years (after adjustment for inflation) while the income of a worker without a high school diploma has plummeted by 25.7 percent over the same period.
Government has also played a role, particularly the George W. Bush tax cuts, which, among other things, gave the wealthy a 15 percent tax on capital gains and dividends. That's the provision that caused Warren E. Buffett's secretary to have a higher tax rate than he does.
As a result, the top 1 percent has done progressively better in each economic recovery of the past two decades. In the Clinton era expansion, 45 percent of the total income gains went to the top 11 percent; in the Bush recovery, the figure was 65 percent; now it is 93 percent.
Just as the causes of the growing inequality are becoming better known, so have the contours of solving the problem: better education and training, a fairer tax system, more aid programs for the disadvantaged to encourage the social mobility needed for them escape the bottom rung, and so on.
Government, of course, can't fully address some of the challenges, like globalization, but it can help.
By the end of the year, deadlines built into several pieces of complex legislation will force a gridlocked Congress's hand. Most significantly, all of the Bush tax cuts will expire. If Congress does not act, tax rates will return to the higher, pre-2000, Clinton-era levels. In addition, $1.2 trillion of automatic spending cuts that were set in motion by the failure of the last attempt at a deficit reduction deal will take effect.
So far, the prospects for progress are at best worrisome, at worst terrifying. Earlier this week, House Republicans unveiled an unsavory stew of highly regressive tax cuts, large but unspecified reductions in discretionary spending (a category that importantly includes education, infrastructure and research and development), and an evisceration of programs devoted to lifting those at the bottom, including unemployment insurance, food stamps, earned income tax credits and many more.
Policies of this sort would exacerbate the very problem of income inequality that most needs fixing. Next week's package from House Democrats will almost certainly be more appealing. And to his credit, President Obama has spoken eloquently about the need to address this problem. But with Democrats in the minority in the House and an election looming, passage is unlikely.
The only way to redress the income imbalance is by implementing policies that are oriented toward reversing the forces that caused it. That means letting the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy and adding money to some of the programs that House Republicans seek to cut. Allowing this disparity to continue is both bad economic policy and bad social policy. We owe those at the bottom a fairer shot at moving up.

HEADLINE: At Ailing Brooklyn Hospital, Insider Deals and Lavish Perks

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Research was contributed by Jack Begg, Sheelagh McNeill, Lisa Schwartz, Jack Styczynski and Susan Weber-Stoger.Research was contributed by Jack Begg, Sheelagh McNeill, Lisa Schwartz, Jack Styczynski and Susan Weber-Stoger.

 BODY:
In recent years, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn has often gone hat in hand to the city and state, lamenting cuts in government assistance and questioning whether officials truly understood the burden of running a nonprofit hospital in Bushwick, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
For much of that time, Wyckoff's chief executive was driving to work in a Bentley Continental GT, a $160,000 automobile, and at one point, the hospital paid thousands of dollars to insure the vehicle, according to hospital records and interviews. When the chief executive lost his license after an accident, hospital security guards chauffeured him and his wife around the clock in a Cadillac Escalade or a Lincoln Town Car.
The chief executive, Rajiv Garg, was not the only one who benefited from his ties with Wyckoff. One member of the hospital's board obtained for the pharmacy that he owned the exclusive right to market prescription drugs to hospital patients. Another board member lent $2.4 million to the ailing Wyckoff at 12 percent interest, with the hospital required to put up several of its buildings as security. 
Local politicians also joined in. Allies of United States Representative Edolphus Towns, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez and Councilman Erik Martin Dilan have landed high-level positions at the hospital, despite questionable qualifications, further weakening its management. Mr. Dilan's wife became the hospital's director of public relations.
Many hospitals in downtrodden areas of New York City and across the state are faltering, raising concerns that a wave of closings will deprive poor people of badly needed care.
A three-month investigation by The New York Times into Wyckoff, based on dozens of interviews and an examination of internal documents, offers a sobering portrait of how one such hospital has been undermined by the very people entrusted to run it.
The hospital all but defaulted on its $109 million in state-secured bonds, forcing the taxpayers to cover $10 million due to bondholders before the state agreed in May to defer the hospital's overdue payments.
Wyckoff no longer even carries malpractice insurance. Consumer Reports recently ranked Wyckoff among the worst hospitals in the New York region.
After years of decline, the hospital is also attracting the notice of the authorities. The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has begun examining its management and has presented evidence to a grand jury, according to legal documents.
Under pressure, the hospital's board recently ousted the president, Mr. Garg, who was being paid $700,000 a year. But some entrenched members of the hospital's board remain, and the hospital's doctors recently mounted an insurrection against Mr. Garg's replacement, Ramon Rodriguez. They circulated a letter saying that Mr. Rodriguez was not capable of running Wyckoff because of his ''battles with depression.''
Mr. Rodriguez called the letter ''character assassination,'' saying that the doctors felt threatened by his reforms.
Wyckoff has been so troubled for so long that even the most accomplished leadership might have been unable to turn it around. But its recent difficulties have clearly been deepened by the management turmoil.
Wyckoff, which has 324 beds, is typical of the city's distressed hospitals. Dedicated in 1899 as the German Hospital of Brooklyn, Wyckoff straddles the border with Queens in a neighborhood where poverty and unemployment have begun to fall with gentrification, but where almost one out of three people is still poor.
The hospital cares for an average of 7,000 emergency room patients a month, most of whom do not have private insurance and rely on Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs to pay.
While cultivating political officials, Wyckoff often seems to have done little to market itself to patients and improve care.
Often, officials at failing hospitals point to their impoverished clientele as the cause of their problems. But there are middle-class patients just over the border in Queens, and artists and entrepreneurs are moving into Bushwick's lofts and row houses.
Last year, a committee created by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo identified Wyckoff and five other hospitals in Brooklyn as lacking the management quality, business model and financial strength to continue operating in their current form. The panel proposed to consolidate some of the hospitals.
In Bushwick, people do not want to lose their hospital. (The next-closest one, Woodhull, is nearly two miles away.)
But local leaders said Wyckoff's management had repeatedly let them down.
''If community members feel you're an overtly politicized place, or if you're abusing hospital money, they lose faith in your ability to serve the community,'' said Theo Oshiro, deputy director of Make the Road New York, an organizing group in Bushwick.
Abundant Spending
Soon after becoming Wyckoff's chief executive in 2008, Mr. Garg took a doctor to dinner with their wives at La Grenouille on the East Side. The check was about $500, and he billed Wyckoff, according to records examined by The Times.
It was among the first of many luxuries billed to the hospital by Mr. Garg, a former banker. Wyckoff paid for numerous meals at expensive restaurants for Mr. Garg, as well as his trips to Sutton Stogies for drinks and cigars.
By his own admission, Mr. Garg spent $7,000 on a trip to London for a four-day conference.
''The optics definitely don't look right,'' Mr. Garg conceded in an interview. ''There's no intention to waste money. Sometimes it just happens.''
His attitude, he said, was that ''if you can save a couple of million here and there, and manage to spend $500 on dinner, it doesn't really matter.''
When Mr. Garg, now 52, arrived at Wyckoff, he had no experience managing a hospital, but did have connections.
An native of India who was educated in London, he moved to New York, where he was neighbors on Long Island with Dr. Addagada C. Rao, Wyckoff's chief of surgery. In April 2008, Mr. Garg and Dr. Rao bought a struggling medical school in the Caribbean and signed an affiliation agreement with Wyckoff.
Seven months later, Wyckoff's board appointed Mr. Garg as chief executive, and insider dealing became a pattern.
For example, Mr. Garg introduced hospital officials to Skyscape, a provider of mobile medical references, in which he had a financial interest. Wyckoff signed a contract with the company worth at least $38,700, hospital records show, though the deal eventually fell through.
In August 2009, Mr. Garg said, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed his Lexus into a truck. He then lost his license. Asked why in the interview, he said he was not certain, though he offered several explanations, including unpaid tickets and previous accidents.
He then used the hospital's cars -- a Lincoln Town Car and a Cadillac Escalade -- for himself and his family around the clock. They were driven by two security guards on overtime, a hospital official said.
He parked his other car, the $160,000 Bentley, at Wyckoff and had the hospital put the vehicle on its own insurance policy.
Mr. Garg said he reimbursed the hospital $10,000 for the insurance.
Last summer, the Brooklyn district attorney's office, alerted by angry hospital staff members, began investigating hospital finances. Prosecutors declined to comment.
Mr. Garg said in the interview that he suspected that the drivers of the Town Car and the Escalade were eavesdropping on his conversations. So he had the hospital purchase a used stretch limousine for about $33,000.
Just before Christmas 2011, the hospital board ousted Mr. Garg, and a few days later, the general counsel, David Hoffman, was dismissed by the new chief executive, Mr. Rodriguez.
Mr. Hoffman, who earned $370,000 a year, had renewed his contract with the hospital just two months before, entitling him to $925,000 for the remainder of his contract. Mr. Hoffman would not comment.
Mr. Garg said he agreed to resign in exchange for 15 months of severance, which came to $875,000.
He defended his tenure, saying that he had overhauled the hospital's finances.
Audit reports indicate that the hospital's cash flow improved, but a state report in November said the hospital was still ''struggling week to week to make payroll.''
''The whole credit cycle was improved by me,'' Mr. Garg said. ''Our name in the marketplace improved considerably.''
Mr. Garg said he had been pushed out because doctors were upset that he had tried to stop them from poaching hospital patients with good insurance and billing them privately. He said he also asked them to clock in so they could not sneak out on hospital time to their private practices.
''We tried to build a performance system that would reward the better doctors, but they never gave us a chance to build it,'' he said.
''There's too much glue at Wyckoff,'' Mr. Garg said. ''Everyone knows each other. You have a lot of people whose relatives work there. Partly it's the economics, partly it's the work culture. It's a free-for-all. To change that culture just didn't work.''
He brushed aside questions about the Bentley.
''You know how many guys had 500 SE Mercedes there?'' he said.
Political and Family Ties
Mason Pimsler was a rookie lawyer at a personal injury firm in Queens with an unorthodox approach to finding clients: He stole them by tapping into the answering service of a rival firm.
The rival firm caught on to what he was doing, and Mr. Pimsler was convicted of criminal impersonation in 1999 and disbarred.
But now, Mr. Pimsler has a new title and job: Dr. Pimsler of Wyckoff Hospital.
He owes this transformation in part to one of the state's most powerful Democrats, John L. Sampson of Brooklyn, the Senate Democratic leader.
Dr. Pimsler's appointment at Wyckoff points up the role of politics and connections at the hospital.
Dr. Pimsler, who did not serve jail time after his conviction, turned his life around and went to medical school in the Caribbean, graduating in 2008.
After graduation, doctors customarily serve three or more years as residents, which are essentially hospital apprenticeships. Competition for them is fierce.
In 2010, Dr. Pimsler obtained a temporary residency at Wyckoff after receiving strong recommendations from his supervisors at other hospitals.
At Wyckoff, he received positive evaluations, but he could not stay because there were no permanent openings. That year, Wyckoff had roughly 1,000 applicants for 22 residency positions.
An aide in Senator Sampson's office called Wyckoff's counsel, Mr. Hoffman, to lobby for Dr. Pimsler, who needed the approval of senior management because the residencies had already been budgeted and filled, according to hospital records.
The records were submitted to the Brooklyn district attorney's office as part of its inquiry into Wyckoff.
Mr. Hoffman approved the residency ''over the cap,'' according to the records.
Dr. Pimsler had gotten to know Senator Sampson while working on legislation that would expunge convictions to allow people like him a second chance, the document showed. Senator Sampson's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
''I think John was a reference, I do, but so what?'' Dr. Pimsler said in an interview. ''I do deserve a second chance. I've proven that.''
Other politicians also influenced Wyckoff's hiring.
Dr. Theophine Abakporo arrived at Wyckoff in 1996 from Harlem Hospital to work in emergency medicine. Originally from Nigeria, he said he found his way to the top blocked by what he believed was a clique of doctors at Wyckoff.
In 2009, according to data provided by MapLight.org, Dr. Abakporo, an American citizen, began donating money to the campaign of Representative Edolphus Towns, the Democrat who represents a nearby area. Mr. Towns, a longtime board member of Wyckoff, had by then been replaced by his chief of staff, Albert Wiltshire, on the board.
Dr. Abakporo gave $1,000 to the Towns campaign, then $750, according to election records.
With Mr. Wiltshire's support, Dr. Abakporo became chairman of emergency medical services.
In an interview, Dr. Abakporo said he had forgotten his reasons for donating. ''You ask a citizen of the United States why he is involved in the political process?'' he said.
Mr. Wiltshire said Dr. Abakporo was highly qualified, adding that he was just one vote on the search committee that promoted Dr. Abakporo. ''We've become friends since then, it's no secret,'' Mr. Wiltshire said.
In fact, hospital officials routinely circulated fund-raising invitations for their political patrons, like one for a $1,000-a-ticket event at a Yankees game in September, at which Senator Sampson was the host.
''I was told this is the way it was done,'' Mr. Garg, the former chief executive, recalled.
During the 2009-10 election cycle, physicians, executives and others associated with Wyckoff gave $17,800 to the Towns campaign, second only to Microsoft in donations associated with a single organization, according to OpenSecrets.org.
Politicians also wanted jobs from Wyckoff.
Jannitza Luna-Dilan, wife of Councilman Dilan, a Democrat whose district includes the hospital, was hired as the hospital's $75,000-a-year director of public relations.
Before that, ''I was having babies at home,'' Ms. Luna-Dilan said. She said she did not interact with government, ''more with community, school and church groups.''
It was not just political connections, but family and ethnic connections.
Consider ''the House of Arya,'' as some doctors refer to it.
Dr. Vijaypal Arya, a gastroenterologist, followed his brother, Yashpal Arya, also a gastroenterologist, to Wyckoff. They were joined by at least six other relatives.
''What I would say is that a lot of other people do the same thing,'' Dr. Vijaypal Arya said.
Low Marks for Care
Stephanie LaConte, a corrections officer with three young children, expected her hernia operation to be routine.
When she complained about pain for more than two months afterward, her doctor, Percy Erachshaw, assured her that everything was fine, she said.
Then the mesh used to repair her hernia burst while she was in the bath.
''You could hear it go fffffft,'' Ms. LaConte said. ''The tub was covered in blood. I totally freaked out.''
Ms. LaConte, now 33, said the surgery left her disfigured and unable to work. She is suing her doctor and Wyckoff for what her lawyer, Andrew Friedman, said was a raging infection.
''Wyckoff Hospital is one of the worst hospitals I've ever seen,'' Ms. LaConte said. ''The staff is disrespectful. It's dirty. It's disgusting.''
Dr. Erachshaw did not respond to requests for comment left at his home. His lawyer, Denise Buda, declined to comment.
Dr. Erachshaw is also under investigation by the State Office of Professional Medical Conduct, and the hospital has suspended his operating privileges, according to an e-mail sent to trustees by the new chief executive, Mr. Rodriguez.
Mr. Rodriguez said residents had complained that Dr. Erachshaw intimidated them into steering hospital patients to his private practice, that he signed off on operations for which he was not present and that he performed unnecessary operations.
Overall, Wyckoff ranks well below average on many measures of patient care and satisfaction. In February, Consumer Reports rated Wyckoff as the sixth-worst hospital out of 81 in the New York area for patient safety.
The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, reports that patients rate Wyckoff well below average for how well doctors and nurses communicate with patients, how helpful the staff is and how well pain is controlled.
Wyckoff ranks high in complaints to the State Health Department, with a rate of 2.1 complaints per 10,000 patient days, compared with 1.39 statewide.
In 2009, under Mr. Garg's watch, the state investigated a number of serious incidents, including at least two deaths and a pregnant woman who was improperly discharged, according to detailed reports obtained by The Times.
A man came to the emergency room with chest pain and numbness in his leg. He died after doctors missed a heart problem.
A woman in the 23rd week of pregnancy arrived with bleeding and back pain and was examined by a doctor in the first year out of medical school. The doctor sent her for a sonogram, and she delivered a baby in the toilet while waiting for the test.
Conflicts of Interest
With his solicitous manner and tailored sport jackets, Gary Goffner, a pharmacist who serves on Wyckoff's board, has long endeared himself to customers and doctors alike.
He inherited his pharmacy, Kraupner, from his father, a prominent Bushwick landlord as well as a pharmacist, who died recently. It is an old-fashioned store, crammed with supplies, the opposite of an orderly Rite Aid.
It is also a half-mile walk from Wyckoff, a disadvantage Mr. Goffner overcame through a contract that gave him exclusive access to Wyckoff patients as they were being discharged, and allowed him to keep an employee at the hospital to promote his business.
Mr. Goffner and other members of Wyckoff's board became part of a culture of self-dealing that flourished unchallenged by state regulators.
According to internal hospital documents, 13 of the hospital's 22 board members declared at least one conflict of interest.
Nonprofit experts say such conflicts of interest, while not necessarily illegal, are highly inadvisable because they call into question whether the board members are looking out for their own welfare or the hospital's.
Mr. Goffner had three conflicts, more than any board member. He had the exclusive contract to dispense drugs.
He served on an advisory committee for the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, which was founded by Assemblyman Lopez, the powerful Brooklyn Democratic leader, and sponsors a nursing home, Buena Vida, that sends many patients to Wyckoff. And Mr. Goffner was the landlord of a building being rented by the hospital.
Former and current hospital officials said Mr. Goffner was made a trustee because of his relationship with Assemblyman Lopez.
Asked who had requested that he join Wyckoff's board, Mr. Goffner said, ''To be honest with you, I don't know.''
Assemblyman Lopez said he was closer to Mr. Goffner's father. ''I have no vested support of anyone on the board,'' he said.
Another trustee, Frank Chiarello, a real estate broker, was a partner in an organization, Wyckoff Funding Associates, that lent $2.4 million to the hospital, at 12 percent interest, using some hospital buildings as security.
Yet another trustee, Andrew Boisselle, president of Cebco check cashing, provided on-site check cashing for Wyckoff employees.
Mr. Chiarello and Mr. Boisselle declined to comment.
Mr. Goffner's pharmacy contract with Wyckoff led to disputes with nearby pharmacists, including a 2009 lawsuit by a pharmacist who had a lease to run a pharmacy in the hospital lobby.
In court papers, the vice president of the lobby pharmacy, Ronald Edelstein, said hospital workers were ''steering patients away from filling their outpatient prescriptions at the Lobby, and instead were steering said patients'' to Kraupner.
Mr. Edelstein, who settled, declined to comment.
Mr. Goffner said he had received the pharmacy contract under a federal program before becoming a trustee in 2008.
''Let them take this godforsaken program and let me out of it,'' he said. ''I give great service. My customers are going to come to me either way.''
He said his relationship with Assemblyman Lopez was based on civic spirit.
''I have filled his prescriptions,'' he said. ''We are not friends. I respect him, and he seems to do good things.''
Mr. Goffner is an owner of a building at 1411 Myrtle Avenue, where the hospital is now paying $11,200 a month in rent, according to the lease.
The hospital had planned to use the building as a clinic, but for more than a year and a half it has been vacant, even though Wyckoff received a state grant to refurbish it in September 2010.
The previous tenant was a clothing and sneaker store. The store's owner, Harpal Singh, said his rent had been reduced to about $5,000 a month because the location was poor. Mr. Goffner said the rent had been cut, ''with a promise to pay the remainder once he caught up on his bills.''
In the recent shakeup at the hospital that led to the ouster of Mr. Garg as chief executive, Mr. Goffner came out on top. He is now chairman of the board.
Mr. Goffner helped find Mr. Garg's replacement, Mr. Rodriguez, a member of the panel set up by Governor Cuomo to find solutions for ailing Brooklyn hospitals.
Mr. Rodriguez, a lanky 6 feet 3 and usually dressed in a black suit and stylish glasses, has been conducting meetings with the staff, during which he has promised to clean house and sell the limousine.
''I can't come here and park my Bentley now,'' he said. ''I have a Hyundai, by the way.''
He declared that he wanted to change the inbred culture of the institution, and said he had made the recruitment of new doctors and trustees a priority. He has begun replacing some senior staff members.
He talked about making Wyckoff attractive to people over the border in Queens, and to young people like his sons, Tomas, who jams with his band in Bushwick, and Gabriel, an actor, who is looking for an apartment there.
Like Mr. Garg, he began challenging hospital doctors who were billing patients privately.
But this month, some doctors revolted.
A lawyer who said she represented the medical staff circulated a ''no confidence'' letter to the trustees. The letter said Mr. Rodriguez should be removed because, among other reasons, his LinkedIn page said he had suffered from depression and had been healed by drugs after being abruptly fired from another job as chief executive.
Mr. Rodriguez said in an interview that he had had clinical depression years ago. He called the letter outrageous and evidence that a small, disgruntled group of doctors was resisting his efforts to bring about major changes at Wyckoff.
''I am acting against some physicians who are taking advantage of a system that people did not pay attention to,'' he said.
The hospital recently sold the stretch limousine for $18,000; it had cost $33,000 eight months ago. It sold the Lincoln Town Car for $9,000 and hopes to get $18,000 for the Escalade.
Mr. Rodriguez proposed to stay at least six months, at an annualized salary of $500,000, with a guarantee of three months' severance if his contract was not extended. He promised to work to keep the hospital open and independent, in defiance of the merger plan that his own panel had endorsed last year.
To do that, he would need political support. In February, Assemblyman Lopez hosted a cocktail party in Brooklyn.
Tickets were $250, $500 and $1,000, and the borough's movers and shakers attended. Halfway through the evening, in strolled Mr. Goffner and his guest, Mr. Rodriguez.

PERSON: Irving Louis Horowitz 

HEADLINE: Irving Louis Horowitz, Sociologist and Ideological Critic, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Irving Louis Horowitz, an eminent sociologist and prolific author who started a leading journal in his field but who came to fear that his discipline risked being captured by left-wing ideologues, died on Wednesday in Princeton, N.J. He was 82.
The cause was complications of heart surgery, his wife, Mary Curtis Horowitz, said. 
Professor Horowitz, who last taught at Rutgers University, wrote about genocide, political theory and Cuban Communism, among other topics. He devised a quantitative index for measuring a nation's quality of life, weighing factors like arbitrary killings and imprisonments against the extent of civil liberties. He helped popularize the term ''third world'' for poorer nations not aligned with the Soviet Union or the United States.
Though many considered him a neoconservative, he professed no political allegiance. In a 2007 article, he argued that Fidel Castro, the Communist Cuban leader, and Francisco Franco, the conservative leader of Spain, were equivalent tyrants.
In 1962, Professor Horowitz founded the journal Trans-Action: Social Science and Modern Society, which strove to bring to sociology, economics, political science and the other social sciences the same explanatory rigor that Scientific American applied to the hard sciences. Trans-Action's name was changed to Society in 1972 as Transaction Publishers grew into a respected publisher of social science books and journals. The company sold Society and other journals to Springer, a German publishing firm, in 2007.
In his later years, Professor Horowitz worried that ''left-wing fascists'' and ''professional savages'' were subverting objective, empirical approaches to the social sciences, as he wrote in his book ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' (1993). In a journal article, he denounced leftist advocacy, writing, ''You do not get good science by being politically correct.''
But George Steinmetz, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, challenged Professor Horowitz's solution of relying on empirical, nonideological studies modeled on the hard sciences. In a 2005 article in The Michigan Quarterly Review titled ''The Cultural Contradictions of Irving Louis Horowitz,'' he maintained that ''historical, cultural and geographic'' context remained critical. Professor Horowitz was a leading expert on C. Wright Mills, who studied social stratification in the United States, most famously in ''The Power Elite'' (1956). He edited four volumes of Mills's essays and a book of essays about him; edited and published Mills's doctoral dissertation as a book; and wrote ''C. Wright Mills: An American Utopian'' (1983), which the historian Jackson Lears praised in The Journal of American History as ''a balanced, judicious intellectual biography.''
But others complained that Professor Horowitz's earlier view of Mills as a ''true reformer'' had darkened. In the biography he called Mills ''a fanatic'' and castigated his affiliation with New Left thinkers who had emerged during the Vietnam War. Mills's daughter Kathryn, speaking for his widow, his ex-wife and his two other children as well as herself, wrote in a letter to The New York Times that Mills had met Professor Horowitz only twice; she complained that his book had 50 errors of biographical fact ''in addition to misinterpretations and questionable judgments.''
Professor Horowitz only escalated his criticism, calling Mills ''a bigot.'' In ''A Postscript to a Sociological Utopian'' (1989), he wrote, ''In C. Wright Mills I was dealing with a sadly flawed individual, a human being who had biased attitudes on many issues, including minorities, Jews, women, and especially blacks.''
Irving Louis Horowitz was born in New York City -- on Wards Island in the East River -- on Sept. 25, 1929. He grew up in Harlem. In an autobiography, ''Daydreams and Nightmares'' (1990), he wrote that he was born with a cleft palate and a cleft lip and had 24 painful operations in his first 13 years. A dentist was later able to repair the hole in the top of his mouth, his wife said. The family was part of a dwindling Jewish minority in Harlem.
''It was a very heavily social environment,'' Professor Horowitz said in an interview with The Times in 1988. ''To survive, you had to know the distinction between black and white, rich and poor, Jew and gentile, religious and nonreligious, political and nonpolitical.''
He attended City College of New York and drove a cab to help with living expenses. He earned a master's degree from Columbia and a Ph.D. from the University of Buenos Aires. ''It was the end of the Peron era,'' he said, ''and I was told I could be helpful in reactivating the sociology program.''
He taught at many universities around the world and was chairman of the sociology departments at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Washington University and Rutgers. In 1979, he was awarded an endowed chair at Rutgers and chose to name it after Hannah Arendt, the political theorist. He retired from teaching in 1992 and seven years later established, with his wife, the Irving Louis Horowitz Foundation to aid social science scholars. His final book, ''Hannah Arendt: Radical Conservative,'' was published this month.
Professor Horowitz's marriages to Ruth Narowlansky and Danielle Salti ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons, Carl and David.
Professor Horowitz was nothing if not ambitious. Three weeks after Mills died in 1962, he wrote Mills's wife offering his services for ''anything from flat tires to zebra hunting to transporting widows across state lines.'' He soon hauled away cartons of Mills's papers.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Monday about the sociologist Irving Louis Horowitz referred incorrectly to Kathryn Mills, the author of a letter to The New York Times in 1984 criticizing Mr. Horowitz's biography of the sociologist C. Wright Mills. She is Mills's daughter, not his widow.

HEADLINE: Home Video Company Cashing In on British Revivals

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
Spurred on by new episodes of the British serial ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' on PBS last April, many viewers went in search of the 40-year-old original. They found it in the catalog of Acorn Media, which had released the vintage series a month earlier as a complete 21-disc DVD set.
At a retail price of $200, it quickly became the company's third-best-selling title in terms of revenue. 
Thanks in part to PBS's revitalized ''Masterpiece'' series, and its two-season hit ''Downton Abbey,'' America is having a love affair with British drama and mystery. And the privately held Acorn Media Group, which is 28 years old and based in Silver Spring, Md., has been well positioned to benefit.
While the home video business has been challenged by years of plummeting sales, Acorn continues to grow. The company said it hit $99 million in gross revenue in 2011, up 5 percent from 2010, largely because of increased sales, both in units and revenue, for the home video titles it has amassed for British mysteries and dramas, both old and new.
''We have been solidly profitable for years and years,'' said Peter Edwards, 59, Acorn's chairman, who founded the company, then known as Atlas Video, in 1984 in a spare bedroom in his home in Washington.
The early years were lean, when Atlas sold original historical documentaries on VHS through tourist gift shops. But in 1991, the company started licensing programs, and in 1994 it hit upon ''Cadfael,'' the British mysteries starring Derek Jacobi. Three years later, it got out of the documentary business, although it now releases some on its tiny Athena brand (it also has an Acacia label devoted to healthy living).
Mr. Edwards, in a telephone interview, said the company believed it was now the second-largest distributor of British programming on DVD in North America, second only to the BBC.
Acorn's business plan has shielded it from the recent economic downturn, said Jean-Philippe Randisi, executive vice president for consumer products for ITV Studios Global Entertainment, which has longstanding deals with Acorn to distribute many ITV titles.
''They are, quite frankly, a bit different from a number of other home video distributors,'' he said by phone. Unlike other companies, which are focused on selling blockbuster titles at ever-lower margins in big-box retailers, Acorn has a business model in which ''they identify a set audience, develop a relationship with that audience and develop a portfolio that's going to work with that audience,'' Mr. Randisi said. That allows the company to steer customers to new purchases with relatively little marketing.
That kind of trust between retailer and customer, he said, is closer to the book publishing model than to DVD retailing. Also adhering to a book publishing model, Acorn has successfully reissued older titles as the demand for British shows has increased. It spent eight years tracking down United States rights to the unreleased television mini-series ''Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,'' which was finally released in 2002. And its new-to-Acorn release of the 1976 BBC Television hit ''I, Claudius,'' a history of the Roman empire also starring Mr. Jacobi, comes out Tuesday.
''They've been better than a number of players in the market at relaunching, reinventing and remarketing a number of titles,'' Mr. Randisi said.
Although the company's customers tend to be more upscale than the typical DVD buyers, Acorn officials acknowledge that they may not be able to buck the DVD industry trends forever. An analyst report from IHS Screen Digest on Friday projected that online movie viewing would surpass DVD and Blu-ray use for the first time in 2012. Acorn also sells more DVDs when the shows are broadcast, and United States outlets for British programs are limited.
So Acorn has taken steps to minimize risks, while ''aggressively pursuing the opportunities,'' said Miguel Penella, the chief executive. In July, the company began a streaming service, Acorn TV. For $25 a year (no monthly options available), subscribers can watch a rotating schedule of old gems and United States premieres of new series, like the currently streaming Season 5 of the popular ''Doc Martin.''
It's unclear how the move to streaming will affect broadcast ratings of ''Doc Martin'' on public stations like KCET in Los Angeles, which is gearing up for its own splashy Season 5 start on April 5; the show has been the highest-rated regular series on public television in Los Angeles. KCET declined to comment.
So far, Acorn TV -- which had some technical flaws at introduction that the company says are now fixed -- is available online, and via iPad, Apple TV and Google TV. The number of subscribers is growing, Mr. Penella said, but he declined to be more specific. A boost is likely when Nook and Roku applications are introduced, expected toward the end of April.
In another new move, Acorn is expanding into content production. In November 2010, it bought all rights to ''Foyle's War,'' a popular British detective series that was shown for many years on ''Masterpiece Mystery!'' on PBS. Production on three new episodes will start in September.
Last month, the Acorn Media Group bought a 64 percent controlling interest in the literary estate of Agatha Christie, which includes more than 80 of her novels and plays and nearly 40 television films, with eight more in the works. Terms weren't disclosed, but Mr. Edwards said the deal was Acorn's largest, and resulted in the company's taking on some debt.
The company has ambitious plans for the titles, possibly grittier remakes of the films starring the Hercule Poirot character. But Mr. Edwards said Acorn would take a passive role in the actual production.
''We are not getting involved in things creative, not by a long shot,'' he said. ''That's the way to dusty death.''

HEADLINE: 'Hunger Games' Ticket Sales Set Record

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- ''The Hunger Games'' hit the box-office bull's-eye over the weekend, taking in a record $155 million in North America and setting up what promises to be one of the biggest film franchises of this decade.
Backed by a meticulously executed marketing campaign from Lionsgate, ''The Hunger Games'' was a gigantic No. 1 and set multiple sales records, including the strongest opening weekend total for a spring release, not accounting for inflation. The previous record holder, ''Alice in Wonderland,'' directed by Tim Burton, took in $116.1 million over its first three days in March 2010 and went on to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales at the global box office. 
Nobody is predicting that kind of worldwide total for ''The Hunger Games,'' partly because, unlike ''Alice in Wonderland,'' it was not made available in 3-D, which costs $3 to $5 more per ticket to see. But ''The Hunger Games'' could easily take in $500 million to $700 million, depending on overseas interest, box-office analysts said. Lionsgate said international ticket sales for the weekend were estimated at $59.3 million.
''It proves that distributors don't have to wait until the summer or the holiday season to release tent poles,'' said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com, using Hollywood slang for broad event films. ''If a movie looks intriguing, customers will show up, no matter what the calendar reads.''
He added: ''This opening is a passing of the baton. The end of 'Harry Potter' and the impending 'Twilight' finale resulted in a marketplace that was hungry for a new, popular franchise to cling to.'' The roughly $155 million for ''The Hunger Games'' opening weekend is the third biggest in Hollywood history, not accounting for inflation, behind only ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' and ''The Dark Knight,'' according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data.
''The Hunger Games,'' directed by Gary Ross (''Seabiscuit''), stars Jennifer Lawrence as a 16-year-old who is forced to battle other children to the death for a futuristic society's televised amusement. Lionsgate and Nina Jacobson's Color Force Productions adapted the movie from Suzanne Collins's best-selling novel of the same name for about $80 million.
Three more films, based on the remaining two books in Ms. Collins's ''Hunger Games'' trilogy, are planned. More than 24 million copies of the trilogy are in print in the United States alone, according to Scholastic, the books' publisher.
''The Hunger Games,'' rated PG-13, represents the kind of out-of-the-park successes that can transform a studio. The release represents a stunning reversal for Lionsgate, which has been struggling mightily of late, with flops over the last two years like ''Killers,''''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''Warrior.''
Lionsgate, until now mostly known for the defunct ''Saw'' franchise and for distributing Tyler Perry's movies, pursued ''The Hunger Games'' as part of a strategy -- set by its former movie chief, Joe Drake -- of taking on more ambitious films for bigger box-office payoffs. Mr. Drake, who was replaced at the studio in January but has remained to see ''The Hunger Games'' to fruition, was understandably ebullient over the weekend as ticket results trickled in.
He wrote of the Lionsgate team in an e-mail: ''I'm watching the looks on their faces as the numbers come in and they realize what they've accomplished -- the greatest joy in the business!!!''
Another Lionsgate executive who was crucial to ''The Hunger Games,'' Alli Shearmur, was also replaced in recent months, a result of the studio's acquisition of Summit Entertainment. The runaway success of ''The Hunger Games'' puts pressure on Jon Feltheimer, Lionsgate's chief executive, to prevent even more of the people responsible for the biggest success in his company's history from leaving.
Hollywood and some Wall Street investors are closely watching to see if Lionsgate can retain its chief marketing officer, Tim Palen. Mr. Palen, whose departure could prompt others to leave, has formed close ties to Ms. Collins.
''The Hunger Games'' received strong critical reaction, and audiences in exit polls gave it an A score, which means the movie will probably play well in the weekends ahead. Lionsgate said the audience was 39 percent male, which is another sign of a cultural juggernaut. In comparison, the ''Twilight'' movies have been mostly a female phenomenon; the audience for ''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I'' was only 20 percent male, for instance.
People interested in going to the movies over the weekend would have had a hard time escaping ''The Hunger Games,'' which played in 4,137 locations, including 268 Imax theaters. Greg Foster, president of Imax Filmed Entertainment, credited a ''flawless'' marketing campaign by Mr. Palen and ''an incredibly satisfying film.''
The second-biggest film in North America was ''21 Jump Street,'' which took in about $21.3 million for Sony and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, lifting its two-week total to a robust $71.1 million. ''Dr. Seuss' The Lorax'' (Universal) was third, selling about $13.1 million in tickets for a four-week total of $177.3 million. ''John Carter'' was fourth, taking in $5 million (for a four-week total of $62.3 million), while Relativity Media's ''Act of Valor'' was fifth, taking in $2.1 million (for a five-week total of $65.9 million).
Despite experiencing one of the biggest flops in memory, ''John Carter,'' which forced Disney to take a $200 million write down, Hollywood has sharply improved its performance over last year. Even before ''The Hunger Games'' arrived, attendance for the year was 18 percent higher than the same period in 2011, fueled by hits like ''The Lorax'' and ''The Vow.'' Now attendance is now up 22 percent.

HEADLINE: Obama Warns North Korea to End 'Bad Behavior'

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
PANMUNJOM, South Korea -- President Obama warned North Korea on Sunday that its threats and provocations would only deepen its international isolation and jeopardize the resumption of American food aid, and he called on the North to scrap its plans to launch a satellite next month.
Squinting through binoculars from an observation post at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, Mr. Obama got a firsthand look at North Korea. The North, with a new leader in place, briefly tantalized the United States weeks ago by raising the possibility of ending the standoff over its nuclear program, only to resume its usual defiance with the recent satellite announcement.
''They need to understand that bad behavior will not be rewarded,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference with South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, who is playing host to a nuclear security summit meeting that will include Mr. Obama and 50 other world leaders.
Mr. Lee also demanded that North Korea ''repeal'' the decision to launch the satellite, which is to be mounted on a long-range missile. Both he and Mr. Obama said it would breach North Korea's obligations, since missile launchings are barred by United Nations sanctions. 
Despite international condemnation, North Korea appears determined to press ahead with the satellite launching next month. On Sunday, the South Korean military said that North Korea had moved the main body of its Unha-3 rocket to the new launching station at Dongchang-ri in northwestern North Korea.
Mr. Obama expressed frustration that China, as the main patron of the North Korean government, had not done more to curb the North's provocative behavior. He said he would raise the issue of China's influence in a meeting on Monday with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao.
''In the same way that North Korea needs to do something new if it wants to do right by its people,'' Mr. Obama said, the Chinese must recognize that ''the approach they've taken over the last several decades hasn't led to a fundamental shift in North Korea's behavior.''
The president made his comments on a day that brought home the intractable nature of the Korean conflict, as he tramped through guard posts and bunkers that date back six decades to the Korean War.
On the far side of the demilitarized zone, beyond the watchtowers and concertina wire that separate the North from the South, a giant red-and-blue North Korean flag billowed at half-staff, marking the 100th day since the death of Kim Jong-il, who led North Korea for 17 years.
It was Mr. Obama's first visit to this heavily fortified border -- Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan all made the trip -- and it seemed both an echo of the cold war and a testament to the new dangers in an age of nuclear proliferation.
The agenda for the nuclear security summit meeting is ostensibly about preventing nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists. But the motives and ambitions of countries like North Korea and Iran are likely to dominate the discussions.
North Korea's talk of its satellite launching upended a fragile diplomatic opening to Kim Jong-il's son and successor, Kim Jong-un. Analysts say North Korea appears to be reverting to a familiar cycle of provocations, perhaps as its untested leader tries to consolidate his power.
Mr. Obama declined to speculate about the younger Mr. Kim's actions, saying, ''It's not clear exactly who's calling the shots'' in North Korea. Mr. Lee said he was disappointed because until the planned satellite launching, he expected Mr. Kim to take a path different from his father's.
In a speech at a university in Seoul on Monday, Mr. Obama aimed his words at North Korea's leaders, warning them that their provocations would lead only to ''more broken dreams'' and urging them to ''have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the North Korean people.''
During his visit to the demilitarized zone, Mr. Obama paid tribute to the soldiers who have patrolled the border, saying they made it possible for South Korea to grow into a thriving democracy with a free-market economy despite the constant threat of war.
''You guys are at freedom's frontier,'' he told the American troops in a dining hall at Camp Bonifas, an outpost of the United Nations command that oversees the zone. ''The contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom but also in terms of prosperity.''
There was time for jokes, too. Mr. Obama thanked the soldiers for giving him a ''spiffy jacket,'' and he drew laughs when he talked about how upsets in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament had made a hash of the brackets chosen by so many fans.
The president then greeted eight South Korean soldiers who keep watch at Observation Post Ouellette, one of the forward-most positions along the zone. As they waited for Mr. Obama to arrive, in a room with tightly drawn curtains and posters for target practice, the soldiers rehearsed their handshakes and barked greetings: ''Very nice to meet you, sir.''
The pleasantries completed, Mr. Obama stepped into a chilly, windswept bunker ringed by sandbags and camouflage burlap and shielded by a wall of two-inch-thick bulletproof glass, where he was handed binoculars to survey the bleak North Korean countryside.
As a military escort pointed out landmarks, Mr. Obama could be heard asking where the demarcation line was between the North and South in different directions, as well as the size of the nearby North Korean village, where the giant flag was flying.
The timing of Mr. Obama's visit was symbolic, coming a day before the second anniversary of the sinking of a South Korean Navy warship, the Cheonan. An international investigation concluded that the ship had been torpedoed by the North, a charge that the North Koreans deny.
Administration officials said the visit to the zone, where some of the 28,500 American soldiers stationed in South Korea serve alongside Korean troops, was a way to honor the loss of the Cheonan, which they said had brought South Korea and the United States closer together. Mr. Obama mentioned the Cheonan at the university on Monday.
After he had spent about an hour at the border, Mr. Obama's helicopter headed back to Seoul, where he met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for discussions, mainly about Syria.
The two leaders conferred about a plan to provide aid, like medical supplies and communications equipment, to opponents of President Bashar al-Assad's government, said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser.

HEADLINE: Debate Shifts From the Trail To the Capital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
For months, the political debate in Washington has been defined largely by the seemingly constant confrontations on the Republican presidential campaign trail. That is about to change, at least for a while.
What seemed like an eternal string of debates has ended. And primaries will no longer be a weekly affair; there are just two days in April when voters will go to the polls.
Instead, the political debate in the days ahead will shift back to Washington, where Congressional squabbling and the president's actions on the economy and foreign affairs will drive the national conversation. 
Here is a look at five issues that will return to the spotlight:
HEALTH CARE The Supreme Court's decision to hold an unprecedented three days of oral arguments about President Obama's health care law is certain to push the issue to the forefront of the political debate this week -- and probably for the rest of the spring.
The debate will be driven not by the presidential candidates but by the activists on both sides, who are gearing up for a public relations war. The goal? To define the consequences months before the justices actually make their decision this summer.
The political circus comes to Washington this week, with protests, dueling news conferences and competing Twitter messages. Mr. Obama and his allies are determined to rehabilitate the health care law in the eyes of the public. His opponents are dead set on making sure that does not happen.
THE RYAN BUDGET Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the Budget Committee, has again helped to define his party's economic agenda with another budget that outlines deep cuts in spending, no tax increases and an overhaul of Medicare.
The budget itself is likely to have little future in the Senate or the White House. But that does not mean it will be ignored. Republicans are already using it as evidence of their seriousness on tackling the nation's deficit. And Democrats are seizing on it as proof that their rivals are willing to cut programs for the poor and the middle class.
THE TRANSPORTATION BILL The haggling over an extension of the nation's primary source of road-building money has gone on for months. The Senate has passed a version, but the House is holding it up while it pushes for greater oil and gas drilling to pay for the spending.
Mr. Obama is making a new push for approval this week, before a March 31 deadline when federal authority to pay for road projects dries up.
''Construction sites will go idle,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday in his weekly address. ''Workers will have to go home. And our economy will take a hit.''
AFGHANISTAN To say that the politics of the war are getting difficult is an understatement. The killing of 16 Afghan citizens, many of them children, by an American soldier has increased the pressure on Mr. Obama to accelerate the timetable for withdrawing American troops.
Mr. Obama has publicly resisted that pressure, saying he will not be rushed out the door by such events. But the calls for a quicker exit are mounting in Afghanistan and in Washington, and that is forcing a new and more urgent discussion about the future of American involvement.
GAS PRICES With the cost of a gallon of gas easily over $4 in many parts of the country, the political debate over energy is heating up.
Mr. Obama has spent much of the last month making his case that there are no short-term fixes. He argues for an ''all of the above'' approach that includes more energy production, conservation and investment in new technology.
The Republicans are eager for the fight. They believe they have the administration on the defensive when it comes to the Solyndra bankruptcy, the Keystone XL pipeline and American angst over higher prices at the pump. And they are hoping to portray Mr. Obama as an impediment to energy independence at a time when the public is focused on the issue.

HEADLINE: Updates on the Supreme Court Hearings on the Health Care Law

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: On Monday, The Lede followed the first of three days of Supreme Court hearings on the constitutionality of the 2010 health care overhaul law. 

 BODY:
2:24 P.M. | A Tax or a Penalty, or Both?
I remember when Democrats were super pleased with themselves for recasting the mandate as a penalty rather than a tax. http://t.co/2gOSiWWD
- Ezra Klein (@ezraklein)26 Mar 12
As the argument circled around whether the individual mandate is a tax or some kind of penalty, the Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli, Jr. appeared at one point to become tripped up in his words, saying tax when he meant penalty and, elsewhere, calling it a "tax penalty."
Justice Kagan asked Mr. Verrilli whether a person who violated the individual mandate - and paid the penalty under the health care law - would be considered to have violated a federal law. He said no, explaining that paying the penalty would not be the same as failing to pay a tax.
That answer brought a fast back-and-forth between Mr. Verrilli and Justices Kagan and Breyer:
JUSTICE KAGAN: The nature of the representation you made, that the only consequence is the penalty, suppose a person does not purchase insurance, a person who is obligated to do so under the statute doesn't do it, pays the penalty instead, and that person finds herself in a position where she is asked the question, have you ever violated any federal law, would that person have violated a federal law?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. Our position is that person should give the answer "no."
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's because -
GENERAL VERRILLI: That if they don't pay the tax, they violated a federal law.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But as long as they pay the penalty -- 
GENERAL VERRILLI: If they pay the tax, then they are in compliance with the law. 
JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you keep saying tax?
GENERAL VERRILLI: If they pay the tax penalty, they're in compliance with the law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: The penalty. 
GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. That's right.
The Lede is signing off for the day, but we will return on Tuesday to continue following the hearings. Thanks for your comments.
1:54 P.M. | Reading Monday's Tea Leaves
Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, writes on The Volokh Conspiracy, a blog run by law professors, that the court appeared unlikely to accept that argument that the health law's individual mandate is a tax rather than a penalty. 
That, he writes, could have implications not just for Monday's argument about jurisdiction but also for an argument likely to be put forward by the government on Tuesday, namely that the mandate is constitutional because of Congress's power to raise taxes. "Lower courts have almost uniformly rejected this constitutional tax argument, and today's questioning suggests that the Supreme Court is unlikely to accept it either," Mr. Somin writes.
1:45 P.M. | Artist Emerges With Renderings of Monday's Hearing
Since cameras are still banned from the courtroom, we are forced to rely on the renderings of artists like William J. Hennessy Jr. In a sort of meeting of the 19th and 21st centuries, some of Mr. Hennessy's drawings of Monday's hearing were posted on Twitter a few minutes ago by Lorna Baldwin, a journalist with the PBS Newshour, who photographed them outside the court.

1:15 P.M. | Searching for the 'Parade of Horribles'
As Kevin Russell explained on the Scotusblog, Robert A. Long, the lawyer appointed to argue that the Supreme Court should not hear the case until the first penalty is paid, "faced skeptical questioning from most members of the Court, including at least five Justices who all seemed to agree that the Anti-Injunction Act does not preclude the challenge, even as they offered different theories for why that's the case. Justices Breyer and Sotomayor asked questions suggesting that the mandate and its associated penalty are not taxes within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act. Justice Scalia suggested that limitations on jurisdiction are normally construed narrowly, which likewise would press against application of the Anti-Injunction Act here. Justice Alito asked a number of questions suggesting that he did not believe the Anti-Injunction Act to be "jurisdictional," and if it is not, then the government's failure to raise the issue up to this point would forfeit any defense based on the Act."
Among the quotable moments of the first day's argument came when Justice Sotomayor challenged Mr. Long to give examples of the "parade of horribles" that could be expected if the court decided that it had jurisdiction to hear the case now.
Here is the exchange from the court transcript, in which Justice Sotomayor pressed an earlier question by Justice Alito and appeared to stump Mr. Long. Justice Scalia jumped in at the end, offering a bit of skepticism and a humorous comment about the intelligence of the federal courts:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to the question that Justice Alito asked. Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what is the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim processing rule? What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach? 
MR. LONG: Right. Well, first of all, I think you would be saying that for the refund statute, as well as for the Anti-Injunction Act - which has very similar wording, so if the Anti-Injunction Act is not jurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to the refund statute, the statute that says you have to first ask for a refund and then file, you know, within certain time - so it would be - it would be both of those statutes. And, you know, we are dealing with taxes here, if people ---
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't my question.
MR. LONG: I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My question was if we mandatory claim processing rule -
MR. LONG: Right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: - what cases do you imagine courts will reach on what grounds? Assuming the government does its job and comes in and raises the AIA as an immediate defense what 
MR. LONG: Well, that's -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: - where can a then reach the question, despite -
MR. LONG: That would certainly be class of cases, it occurs to me, where, if the Court the first government does not raise it in a timely way, it could be waived. I would think plaintiffs would see if there was some clever way they could get a suit going that wouldn't immediately be apparent that -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assumes the lack of competency of the government, which I don't, but what other types of cases?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Long, I don't think you are going to come up with any, but I think your response is you could say that about any jurisdictional rule. 
If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to happen is you're going to have an intelligent federal court deciding whether you are going to make an exception. And there will be no parade of horribles because all federal courts are intelligent. 
So it seems to me it's a question you can't answer. It's a question which asks "why should there be any jurisdictional rules?" And you think there should be.
12:46 P.M. | Audio and Transcript of Monday's Hearing Posted Online
The Supreme Court has posted audio and a transcript of Monday's hearing on its Web site.
 We've made the transcript available in a document viewer. 
Supreme Court Transcript
12:39 P.M. | Santorum Speaks Outside the Supreme Court
Outside the Court, Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential hopeful, arrived around 12 noon. He said in brief remarks about 20 minutes later that he wanted to make the health care overhaul the central issue of a general election campaign against President Obama. He noted, pointedly, that Mitt Romney, who passed a broadly similar law as governor of Massachusetts, "is not here." 
"If you really want to repeal Obamacare, there's only one person who can make that happen," Mr. Santorum said. Mr. Romney, he added "may say he wants to repeal Obamacare, but he won't have the mandate."
At the start of Mr. Santorum's remarks, protesters nearby chanted: "Healthcare Is a Right!"
12:32 P.M. | Experts Say Court Appears Unlikely to Delay Decision
Legal analysts and reporters who were present at the hearing seem to agree that the justices appear unlikely to accept the argument made today that it is too early to rule on the law.
Our colleague Adam Liptak reports:
"This case presents issues of great moment," said Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., adding that the law, the Anti-Injunction Act, "does not bar this court's consideration of the case."
The justices appeared receptive, suggesting that they will reject the argument that it is too soon to rule.
That means they may be expected to issue a decision on the merits by the end of the court's term in June, just as the presidential election heats up.
Bottom line today: Supremes not kicking the can down the road. Will give thumbs up or down on Obamacare.

12:06 P.M. | Waiting for Tickets to Tuesday's Hearing
Sandwiches arrived for a group of young people at the end of the line for Tuesday's tickets.
"Technically I should be studying," said Stephan Schneider, an undergraduate student at George Washington University and an aspiring law student, who was lying back on a white blanket on the sidewalk. He arrived at 3 a.m. on Monday morning, worried he'd be closed out, but ended up passing several opportunities for tickets for Monday. The arguments on Tuesday were more interesting, he said.
His fraternity brother, also a George Washington undergraduate, Chris Crawford, who was reading a book called 'Lyndon B. Johnson and American Liberalism," and said he opposed the individual mandate, said he had waited from last night, "to be part of history." He said he loved being in school in Washington, D.C., because he could be part of the news as it happened. He said had been shown celebrating in a number of photographs on news sites after Osama bin Laden was killed.
Around noon, more supporters continued to give speeches, a group handing out placards that warned against "Liberal Media Bias," stood by handing them out of a large cardboard box. Robyn Stiles, who was handing out placards and pins, said she would not comment on the purpose of the campaign, saying, "we have a pr firm that handles all that," referring to the abbreviation for public relations. Her colleague, Dan Joseph. said they wanted to raise consciousness about what he said was unfair media coverage of Mr. Obama's health care bill. - 
11:56 A.M. | Skeptical Questions From the Justices
In an audio update on the hearing filed a short time before it ended, Max Mallory, the deputy manager of Scotusblog, discussed several skeptical questions asked by the justices during the opening argument by the court-appointed lawyer Robert Long, who made the case that a decision on the law should be put off until the fines for individuals who do not buy insurance kick in.

Around 10 a.m., security guards led approximately 60 more people who were waiting in line from Monday morning into the court. They were being given three minutes slots to get a glimpse of the proceedings. Mary Brennan and her husband Don, who were visiting from Peoria, Ill, were among those who were allowed inside.
"The system needs to change," said Ms. Brennan, who is a nurse practitioner, but said she was here more as a tourist than a health care professional. "I've left that look at home," she said, indicating a doctor in a white lab coat who had come to support the bill. -

11:10 A.M. | First Report From the Courtroom
An Associated Press reporter has left the courtroom and provides this brief update on the proceedings:
The Supreme Court is plunging into a three-day debate on the Obama administration's overhaul of the nation's health care system. In the opening minutes, the justices are asking pointed questions about a legal issue that could derail the case.
Eight of nine justices fired two dozen questions in less than half hour at Washington attorney Robert Long. He was appointed by the justices to argue that the case has been brought prematurely because a law bars tax disputes from being heard in the courts before the taxes have been paid.
Under the new law, taxpayers who don't purchase health insurance will have to report that omission on tax returns for 2014 and will pay a penalty along with federal income tax. At issue is whether that penalty is a tax.
11:07 A.M. | Profiles of the Attorneys
Readers interested in more information on the attorneys arguing for and against the health care law can turn to Jason Zengerle's New York magazine profile of Paul Clement, a former solicitor general under George W. Bush and the Supreme Court counsel for the state attorneys general who object to the law and our colleague Ian Urbina's profile of Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the solicitor general who is defending the Obama administration's health care overhaul law.
10:54 A.M. | Many Views of What Is at Stake
As Marissa Miller explains in a useful roundup of coverage on the Scotusblog, a large, large number of pundits from the legal and political sphere have already weighed in on what is at stake in this case. 
Commentary on the issues and predictions about which course the Justices might take also continued this weekend. For arguments that the Court should hold the Act constitutional, see Bloomberg News, Bloomberg News again, The Los Angeles Times, and CNN. For commentators who believe that the Act must be struck down, see Politico, The Huffington Post, Reason, The Volokh Conspiracy, and CNN. Already, commentators at Reuters, Business Week, and The Huffington Post have predicted that the Justices will choose to uphold the law. Possible political consequences of a decision either way are explored by The Associated Press, The Washington Post, CBS News, and MSNBC.
Our colleagues at Room for Debate have assembled a panel of experts to explore the question: "Is the Court Being Thoughtful or Partisan?"
In a comment for The New Yorker last week, Jeffrey Toobin, who is in the courtroom today for what he called the legal "nerd Olympics," in a recent podcast, looked at the shifting politics behind the court's review of the Affordable Care Act.
The legal challenges to ACA, which the Supreme Court will hear next week, center on its key provision, the individual mandate. The mandate essentially requires all adults to obtain health insurance, either through their employers or by buying it themselves. (There will be subsidies for those who cannot afford it.) The idea of a health-insurance mandate first came to wide public notice in 1989, in the form of a proposal from the Heritage Foundation, one of Washington's venerable right-wing think tanks. In subsequent years, the idea was embraced by a variety of politicians, mostly conservatives, including Newt Gingrich and Orrin Hatch. In Massachusetts, of course, Governor Mitt Romney made it the centerpiece of his health-care-reform plan. For decades, no one suggested that an individual mandate was unconstitutional....
The main argument that opponents of the health-care law have come up with is that the mandate regulates economic inactivity-i.e., not buying insurance-and the Commerce Clause allows only the regulation of economic activity. In the first appellate review of the law, last summer, the Sixth Circuit demolished that argument. The court pointed out that there are two unique characteristics of the market for health care: "(1) virtually everyone requires health care services at some unpredictable point; and (2) individuals receive health care services regardless of ability to pay." Thus, there was no such thing as "inactivity" in the health-care market; everyone participates, even if he or she chooses not to buy insurance. Indeed, the choice to forgo insurance imposes a direct cost on the taxpayers, who wind up footing the bill. Those choices by consumers, especially in the aggregate, represent an economic matter that Congress may decide to regulate.
Writing on Slate, David L. Franklin observes:
Conventional wisdom says the Anti-Injunction Act won't be the surprise protagonist in this Supreme Court saga. For one thing, a decision that effectively labeled the mandate a tax, though it would harm Obama politically in the short term, would actually shore up his health reform law against an eventual constitutional challenge, since the federal power to "lay and collect taxes" is virtually unlimited. For another, health insurers and other business interests would rather not wait until after 2014 to know the legal lay of the land. And as Dahlia Lithwick points out, the conservative justices could earn themselves some wiggle room for other cases by voting to uphold the health reform act now. Finally, there's the question of why the court would schedule six hours of oral argument only to dismiss the case in the mother of all anticlimaxes.
But there is precedent for just such a passive-aggressive outcome. ... there's a decent chance that our latest brilliant but unassuming chief justice will borrow a trick from his greatest predecessor and persuade his colleagues to decide not to decide.
10:16 A.M. | Outside the Court
Shortly after 9 a.m a band appeared, marching with the law's supporters, adding several trumpets, a trombone and a drum to the chanting. 
A guard for the court walked up and back in front of the line of people waiting to get inside, holding a thick stack of red tickets, and announced that there were still some left for today. there were no takers. A man in a baseball cap who identified himself as Terry, said he was waiting for someone who wanted tomorrow's hearing, because "that's the meat and potatoes one." A guard standing near the line said the first 60 were taken in to the court shortly after 8 a.m. - 
10:12 A.M. | A Guide to the Case
Our colleague Adam Liptak is now in the courtroom, but before he stepped into the cone of silence, he wrote this guide to the three days of hearings, which explains the central issues and the scheduled arguments.
A short time ago, he reported that the proceedings are expected to get underway with something of a whimper:
The Supreme Court on Monday starts three days of hearings on the constitutionality of the 2010 health care overhaul law, an epic clash that could recast the very structure of American government. But it begins with a 90-minute argument on what a lawyer in the case has called "the most boring jurisdictional stuff one can imagine." 
Indeed, the lawyer, Paul D. Clement, who represents the 26 states challenging the law, said this month in remarks at the Georgetown University Law Center that the first day's arguments were "a kind of practical joke that the court is playing on the public."
The main event - arguments over the constitutionality of the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty - will not come until Tuesday. But early Monday morning, crowds continued to grow outside the court, as supporters and opponents gathered to demonstrate.

HEADLINE: What the Fate of One Class of 2011 Says About the Job Market

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: Some recent college graduates are still looking for value in their bachelor's degrees, according to The Times Magazine, which surveyed 226 of 309 graduates from Drew University in Madison, N.J., about their outlook on the job market. 

 BODY:
Some recent college graduates are still looking for value in their bachelor's degrees, according to The Times Magazine, which surveyed 226 of 309 graduates from Drew University in Madison, N.J., about their outlook on the job market.
The survey showed that 17 percent of graduates were unemployed, while 39 percent had full-time, paying jobs. Many students flocked to graduate school and unpaid internships when paying jobs were not an option. Of those who were employed, the highest share, 25 graduates, went into the recreation and hospitality industry; 12 chose health-related jobs, Nathaniel Penn reports.
"Though the statistics still show that a college degree correlates with both higher income and lower unemployment in the long run," Mr. Penn wrote, "diplomas didn't seem very valuable when they were handed out last May."
Graduating seniors at schools like Drew University in Madison, N.J., have felt the stresses of the job market acutely. For all its merits - including a much-admired theater department and a prestigious Wall Street internship program - Drew ranks 94th among 178 private liberal-arts colleges on U.S. News & World Report's annual list. The middle of the collegiate pack is not where you want to be when you're competing for a diminishing number of entry-level jobs.
Members of Drew's Class of '11 are typical of their peers nationally in that their success in the job market seems to have less to do with their G.P.A.'s or their persistence and more to do with their family connections, fields of study, networking skills and luck. How else to account for the unemployed Phi Beta Kappa waiting by a silent phone? Or the anthropology major who is forgoing grad school to become a dog groomer? Or the English major who can't earn enough money to make the monthly payment on her $128,000 student loan? (Drew is unusually expensive; tuition plus room and board run more than $50,000 a year.) Equals on campus, the 309 members of Drew's Class of '11 are already being divided into the 99 percent and the 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Survey Gives Glimpse Into Minds of Recent Veterans

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: A new survey from the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America found that employment, mental health, disability benefits, health care, education, suicide and families - in that order - were the top concerns of the more than 4,200 members who responded. 

 BODY:
The 2012 edition of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America's annual survey of its members came out on Monday. The largest such survey by the group to date, its results provide some interesting insights into what's on the minds of recent veterans today.
Not surprisingly, the survey found that employment, mental health, disability benefits, health care, education (including the G.I. Bill), suicide and families - in that order - were the top concerns of the more than 4,200 members who responded.
Nearly 17 percent said they were unemployed when they took the survey in January, a higher rate than was documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which put the veterans' unemployment rate for January at 9 percent.
Of those who are working, 37 percent said they worked for the government at some level, far outpacing the second largest industry listed, health care and pharmaceuticals, which tallied 8 percent. Similarly, of those looking for work, the largest group, about a quarter, said they wanted to find jobs in government.
In its summary of the survey, I.A.V.A. noted that because many local, state and federal agencies have been trimming their work forces, "the threat to veteran employment may grow."
More than one in three respondents, 37 percent, said they knew someone who had committed suicide, down slightly from last year's result. Asked if the person who committed suicide was serving or had separated from the military, respondents were almost evenly divided: 30 percent said the person had separated when the act occurred; 27 percent said the person was serving but not deployed; 25 percent said the person was serving and deployed. Another 11 percent said the person was in the National Guard and not deployed.
Two-thirds said they think troops and veterans are not getting the mental health care they need. Asked what were important factors in providing excellent mental health services, about three-quarters said that counselors should have served in the military, understand military life and culture, or have received specialized training in working with service members and veterans.
Asked about their relationships, nearly 80 percent said they were married or in a long-term relationship during a deployment. Nearly two-thirds said the deployment strained their relationships, and 6 in 10 said readjustment was difficult. Only 4 percent said their deployments had no effect on their relationships.
The vast majority - nearly 9 in 10 - said they had had no serious run-ins with law enforcement after returning from Iraq or Afghanistan. But of those who had, half said alcohol was the problem.
Of the 4,278 veterans who responded to the online survey - conducted between Jan. 1 and Jan. 16 - a little more than half submitted proof of post 9/11 service in Iraq or Afghanistan, while the rest did not.
Nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed were men, 6 in 10 were Army veterans and more than 8 in 10 had served in Iraq. Almost half, 45 percent, were 36 years or older. Nine in 10 said they were registered to vote. Asked about their place of residence, the largest group, nearly 11 percent, said they lived in California.
The survey included some intriguing opinions about government. Neither the president nor Congress scored well when the veterans were asked if those officials listen to service members or Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs did a bit better, with 42 percent answering in the affirmative.
Asked about the Department of Veterans Affairs, half said they had a somewhat to very positive opinion of the department - though nearly 7 in 10 could not correctly name Eric K. Shinseki as the secretary.
V.A. health care and educational benefits received good or very good ratings from about 6 in 10 respondents, with disability benefits falling slightly below 50 percent. The new G.I. Bill seemed particularly important to the veterans, with 29 percent saying they were using their benefits and another 37 percent saying they expected to use the benefits in the future.

HEADLINE: Crowdfunding and Social Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: TOM SZAKY


HIGHLIGHT: Entrepreneurs looking to finance socially responsible start-ups will use crowd-funding to attract capital from patient investors who want long-term results and not just a quick exit. 

 BODY:
Last week, the Senate passed the Jobs Act, which contains equity crowd-funding legislation, an idea, as I wrote in a previous post, whose time I believe has come. Having led TerraCycle through its early days and subsequent rounds of funding, I believe that crowd-funding holds real promise for early-stage social entrepreneurs.
Equity crowd-funding would allow start-ups to raise seed capital from any number of investors in small amounts through emerging equity crowd-funding platforms like Launcht in the United States and Crowdcube in the United Kingdom. These online platforms will shepherd start-ups through the process and put their businesses in front of a network of investors who want to support new companies. This is investing for the 99 percent who don't have five- to six-figure amounts to throw around and are not accredited investors (which you can become only if you have lots of money). 
Over the last several years, I have often had to balance the short-term demands of investors with the long-term needs of TerraCycle. Unfortunately, the two do not always coincide. Thus the appeal of equity crowd-funding for socially responsible businesses, which would result in a diverse spread of investors who are focused as much on the company's impact as on financial returns. This prospect is most relevant to social entrepreneurs, which much of the other coverage of this legislation has missed. I believe the long-term goals and socially responsible mindset of these investors will add stability to capital markets. Entrepreneurs looking to finance socially responsible start-ups will use crowd-funding to find capital from patient investors who want long-term results and not just a quick exit.
I know there are some who are dubious, including Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, who tweeted after the Jobs Act passed the Senate, "Now the same people who caused this horrible recession are telling us that more Wall Street deregulation will create jobs." It's worth noting the risks when people new to start-ups or investing take an equity position in a business. But as Amy Cortese, author of "Locavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How to Profit From It," wrote in an op-ed piece for The Times, the potential rewards can outweigh the risks.
Since Ms. Cortese's piece, an amendment to the Jobs Act has been included to reduce the risks posed by crowd-funding. This most recent version of the bill offers investors more protections and more information while holding start-ups as well as crowd-funding platforms accountable. The amendment was vital to getting crowd-funding right and improving the Jobs Act. Notably, Mr. Sanders voted for the crowd-funding amendment before voting against the Jobs Act.
We are about to enter a new era for start-up and small-business finance. For instance, another provision in the Jobs Act raises the private company shareholder cap to 2,000 investors from 500. This is great news for many rapidly growing small businesses that will see their number of investors begin to grow.
I will be curious to see how the Securities and Exchange Commission handles some of what I believe are the more dubious provisions of the Jobs Act. One provision specifies that any company with revenue of up to a billion dollars can be classified as an emerging growth company and thus exempted from hiring an outside auditing firm. I'm uncertain how the risks of these provisions will affect our financial markets, but they deserve close attention.
What I think is certain is that when equity crowd-funding becomes law, socially responsible and sustainable start-ups will be big winners. As the leaders of sustainable companies, we will have an advantage over our traditional counterparts. People care deeply about our core messages. When those people are empowered to invest, the potential for positive impact will be huge.

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: Captain America Returns

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: a new industrial revolution, a guide to Pinterest, why everyone lies about pricing and our boss of the week. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my business and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: A Competing Budget
House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan, introduce a budget proposal that includes cutting personal income taxes. Here are the highlights. One tax expert says it's "smoke and mirrors" and would increase the deficit. But Keith Hennessy says the Ryan budget would create lower deficits and less debt than the Obama budget. Ethan Pollack says the proposal would cost jobs. Paul Krugman says he was wrong about Paul Ryan.
The Economy: A New Industrial Revolution?
Stephen R. Kelly says there is oil under our noses, and America could become the world's leading energy producer next year. Citibank predicts that American energy businesses are going to grow so fast that they will spark a new industrial revolution. Cheap natural gas is already having a big effect. But the price of gas is the highest ever recorded in March. Did this guy really create unlimited energy? Meanwhile, Captain America returns to surprise his son.
The Economy 2: Who Creates Jobs? 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke returns to his roots. The Treasury Department says it generated a positive return of $25 billion for taxpayers. A study says that small businesses outperformed large businesses in net job creation between from 1992 and 2010, but some question whether small businesses deserve their reputation. Research suggests women-owned businesses are the leaders in job creation and revenue growth, but the bad news is that being born a woman can be a financial mistake. Economists offer a pessimistic view on manufacturing. And machine tech orders dropped significantly in January. Other than mortgage delinquencies, everything else in the economy is "typical" according to Russell Investments.
The Data: Housing Turns
Six years into the housing downturn, the worst finally seems to be over. Mark Perry agrees. Permits for home-building neared a three-and-a-half-year high in February. Housing starts declined slightly in February and existing home sales (pdf) fell. Or did they? Steven Hansen says they were up. The American Institute of Architects index remains positive for the fourth straight month. Builder confidence, however, remains unchanged. Wendy's passes Burger King. Rail continues to send cautionary signals. The Conference Board's leading economic index records its fifth consecutive month of gains. A beautiful animation proves we can't stop the pendulum.
Your People: Ban The Smartphones!
Research finds that employee performance improves if you ban smartphones. Russell Working lists eight ways to ruin employee motivation. Your incentive program might be illegal. A web seminar may help you keep negativity from infecting your workplace. No, this guy is not able to fly like a bird.

Matt Wilson explains why stand-up comedy is good for your business, and comedians are selling laughs by the download. Chief executives and government officials have fallen the most in trust according to a new report. These 15 C.E.O.s had learning disabilities. The Guardian Life Small Business Research institute identifies six steps for improving revenues. Penelope Trunk explains how to recognize poor executive function and lists five e-mails successful people don't send, including: "Never send an automated e-mail response to say you are gone for one or two days. It's annoying to people." Kirstin ODonovan says successful entrepreneurs have the right mindset: "Cultivate the habit of using failure as feedback."
Marketing: Can Yelp Help?
Jay Ehret offers an incomplete guide to Pinterest marketing for small businesses. Heidi Cohen explains what social media's seven sins mean for content marketing. Besides its new integration with Apple's Siri, how can Yelp help your small business? Groupon is now offering small businesses a free version of its Scheduler. Pawel Grabowski explains how to spot prospects that are actually worth your time and effort: "As a rule, the best prospect is the one that needs you right now or very soon." Here's a simple way to connect with silent prospects. Matthew Toren suggests seven low-budget small-business marketing ideas, including: "If you have a business that offers a unique product, consider providing smaller samples of the product to interested but hesitant prospects." Facebook plans to court minority business groups with a new head of community engagement. Rory O'Driscoll says everyone lies about pricing.
Start-Up: Another Celebrity Starts a Business
This week's celebrity start-up comes from Andy Samberg. New business start-ups declined in 2011 according to a Kauffman study. Meet 10 tech start-ups whose sizzle fizzled. Grace Nasri suggests seven tools for getting your start-up off the ground. Karen Rubin says start-ups can maintain their company culture while growing by "identifying the influencers and loudmouths and taking them out to dinner." A new report says that ice cream trucks and vans are cash-cow start-ups. Here's a start-up idea: honey! The New York Stock Exchange and three groups that work to help start-ups are introducing a program designed to help smaller companies create jobs.
Around The Country: Mysterious Booms
There are mysterious booms in Wisconsin and "hair-brained" schemes in Philadelphia. St. Louis leads in small-business job growth. Midwest manufacturing is growing much faster than the national average, but which states are the most manufacturing dependent? Growing confidence in the economy has allowed more small businesses in Ohio to expand. Some states lower their taxes for the first time in a decade. Business owners in Massachusetts have intriguing workshops coming up. The Small Business Administration is offering free conferences. A real estate company opens in New York to help business owners find commercial real estate online.
Around The World: Marmageddon!
Could Tunisia be a start-up nation? China quietly relaxes its controls on foreign capital, and Arnaldo Sehwerert says that exports can boost profits for small businesses, too. But so far, 2012 shipments and shippers to the United States are down. Marmageddon strikes New Zealand. World steel output rose 1.9 percent in February. Rio de Janeiro uses IBM's Smart Cities technology to coordinate its city services. A surge in tech hubs gives African start-ups a place to grow. In a nation of 1.2 billion, India's 100 richest people own assets equivalent to one-fourth of their gross domestic product (and the country's customer service could be better). Nicolas Leschke answers questions about the aquaponic farm his company is building on the roof of an old malthouse in Berlin.
Red Tape Update: Here Comes Health Care Reform
Two small-business owners testify before the House Committee on Small Business, outlining policy recommendations they say would foster entrepreneurship and help young companies grow. The Senate moves ahead on a small-business bill, and the House introduces a small-business tax break. The health care reform litigation mess is neatly summarized in this chart. Paul Krugman says hurray, but insurers set plans in case the mandate is quashed. Republicans open a renewed assault on the bill. Most small businesses remain uneducated on health care reform.

Boss Of The Week
Fotis Antonopoulos's struggles to start his business have made him a reluctant emblem of Greek entrepreneurship (don't even ask about the stool samples).
Technology: It's Just Math
Apple is paying dividends, but Simson L. Garfinkel says the quality of its products is slipping. Google will tell you why messages wound up in your Gmail spam folder. A woman tries to figure out the world's simplest math question. Eventbrite introduces an at-the-door card reader. A computer in a leather recliner makes a compact and comfortable workspace. Sharon Weinstein says going virtual has helped her save gas. Dropbox integrates with Facebook. Amanda DiSilvestro explains how to find the right phone system. Alicia Liu says it's good for entrepreneurs to know how to code. Mobile payments are finding adoption on the campaign trail and offering more diverse functionality. Here's how small businesses are using the cloud to get paid faster. Amelia Earhart is the subject of a new high-tech search. This comparison of online project management systems was suggested by "Paul," a reader of last week's Dashboard.
This Week's Bests
Reason to Get Involved. AnnMarie McDonald says small-business owners can and must help shape local policy: "Don't assume Republicans assist only Republicans or Democrats assist only Democrats. A good representative will never ask a constituent's party affiliation nor deny service even if he or she is an unabashed member of the opposing party. It is a small-business owner's constituency and value to his local community that makes him worthy of an elected official's time and services."
Ways To Cross-Promote With Other Small Business. Charlene Jimenez suggests seven ideas, including: "Co-office, or share valuable office space. Just as tax accountants temporarily take up residence in major grocery stores during tax season, consider sharing valuable office space with your partner, and vice versa. It doesn't matter if you set up one of your employees there permanently or you only use some space a few times a month, this is a great way to network with your target audience."

HEADLINE: The Nurture of Nuclear Power

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: While public enthusiasm for nuclear power seems to be waning, regulatory and Congressional support for it continues, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Free enterprise? States' rights? Public opinion? These concepts seem to bounce off the nuclear power industry like a pebble tossed at a reactor containment vessel.
Remember the brouhaha about $563 million in Obama administration loan guarantees to Solyndra, the solar panel manufacturer that went belly up last fall? Neither President Obama nor Republicans in Congress have voiced opposition to an expected $8.3 billion Energy Department guarantee to help the Southern Company, a utility giant, build nuclear reactors in Georgia.
Pressed to respond to the comparison, Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida and chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, explained that the loan guarantee for nuclear power plant construction was for a "proven industry that has been successful and has established a record." 
The nuclear power industry has certainly established a record - for terrifying accidents. Most recently, the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan led to the evacuation of 90,000 residents who have yet to return home and to the resignation of the prime minister. It prompted the German government to begin phasing out all nuclear generation of electricity by 2022.

Yet the industry has proved remarkably successful at garnering public support in the United States, ranging from public insurance against accident liability to loan guarantees. An article last year in The Wall Street Journal observed that subsidies per kilowatt hour during its initial stages of development far exceeded those provided to solar and wind energy technologies.
According to a detailed report published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, subsidies to the nuclear fuel cycle have often exceeded the value of the power produced. Buying power on the open market and giving it away for free would have been less costly.
Heightened concerns about safety have driven recent cost estimates even higher, scaring off most private investors. Travis Hoium, an analyst who has written extensively about the industry on the investment Web site The Motley Fool, calls nuclear power a dying business. In an article, "Warren Buffett Wants a Subsidy From You," he clearly explains recent efforts to shift risk from investors to ratepayers by allowing utilities to charge for construction in advance. 
Investor interest in nuclear-generated electricity has declined partly as a result of the boom in shale gas extraction. But energy sources that don't increase carbon emissions are also playing a major role, with wind, hydropower and other renewables projected to provide about 30 percent of expected additions to power generation capacity in the United States between 2010 and 2035. 
Meanwhile, 23 aging nuclear power plants similar in design to those that blew in Fukushima continue to operate in the United States, including Vermont Yankee, close to where I live in Western Massachusetts. Like Indian Point 2, just 24 miles north of New York City, Vermont Yankee has reached the end of its projected lifetime operation, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission favors extending its license, despite strong local opposition.
Vermont's governor and its legislature have called for a shutdown. But a federal district court ruled that Vermont's efforts were "improperly motivated" by a concern for safety, which lies under the jurisdiction of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the state appeals its case in higher court, Vermont Yankee continues to operate. 
On March 22, more than 1,000 people marched in protest to the plant, and about 130 engaging in civil disobedience were arrested, including the stalwart 93-year-old activist Frances Crowe. 
According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 44 percent of Americans favor promotion of nuclear power while 69 percent favor increasing federal funding for research on wind, solar and hydrogen energy technology. 
So why do we continue to nurture nuclear power so much more generously than safer and less costly sources of electricity? 
An earlier version of this post, as well as a previous correction, referred incorrectly to aging nuclear plants that continue to operate in the United States. There are 23 similar in design to those involved in the Fukushima disaster; they include Vermont Yankee, but not Indian Point 2 in New York.

HEADLINE: Decades-Old Housing 'Emergency' Continues, and So Does Rent Regulation

BYLINE: ELIZABETH A. HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The city's rent-regulation rules remain in place even as a potential challenge looms before the United States Supreme Court. 

 BODY:
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed a bill on Monday that extended the city's participation in rent regulation for another three years by redeclaring a state of housing emergency, even as a challenge to rent regulation laws looms in the United States Supreme Court. 
 "The Department of Housing Preservation and Development reports the vacancy rate in rental apartments to be at 3.12 percent," Mr. Bloomberg said at the bill-signing ceremony. That, he continued, is "well below the 5 percent rate at which the law requires that rent regulation be discontinued." 
The city has had a vacancy rate of less than 5 percent since the department began keeping track more than 40 years ago, which means it has been in a state of housing emergency for all that time. But critics of rent regulation argue that an emergency by definition must be temporary. 
Among them are James D. and Jeanne Harmon, who own a brownstone on the Upper West Side that has rent-stabilized apartments. The Harmons have been challenging the state's rent-regulation laws, and they have taken their battle to the Supreme Court. 
The court is expected to decide next month whether to hear their case. 
 "My family is making a last stand," Mr. Harmon said. "We believe that the Constitution gives us the freedom to decide who lives in our own home. The mayor is free to think otherwise." 
Supporters of rent regulation, however, are not convinced. They say that a dearth of low-cost housing persists, especially for the poorest New Yorkers. The New York State Legislature renewed rent regulation laws last year, increasing the ceiling for a regulated apartment from $2,000 to $2,500 per month. 
"There are not enough affordable apartments available," said State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Democrat from Manhattan, who points to the vacancy rate cited by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development as proof. "We have to keep the system we have and try to make improvements in order to keep New York an option."

HEADLINE: The Real Estate Mogul as an Artist

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN; Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
What to do when you've been accused, by various publications and Web sites, of all manner of misbehavior: money laundering, blowing $5 million on your daughter's wedding and massacring mustangs to use their skins for upholstery?
You mount an art exhibition of course.
At least that's what you do if you're Janna Bullock, 44, the glamorous Russian-born real estate developer and art scene fixture who retreated from life on the party circuit to spend nearly two years combating accusations against her and her husband in the Russian press and on some Web sites.
In that time Ms. Bullock separated from her husband, Aleksei Kuznetsov, a former Moscow bank executive and government official. She took a leave from the board of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which oversees the museum in New York and its branches abroad. She skipped some art openings and art fairs and stopped doing things like riding motorcycles from St. Petersburg to Moscow with the actors Dennis Hopper and Jeremy Irons and Thomas Krens, the former Guggenheim director. 
And now she is back, with her first exhibition of her own art, which she is staging herself in an empty Beaux-Arts mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she was going to renovate and sell before she got sidetracked. The art opening in February brought out hundreds. And this is no show of beach landscapes or still-life bananas: Ms. Bullock has taken on nothing less than the Russian power elite, from Vladimir V. Putin to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Walking through the show the other day in blood-red nail polish and black stiletto heels, the blond Ms. Bullock said the exhibition -- which features photographs of prominent Russians accompanied by opinionated text -- was her way to show solidarity with the protesters in Russia, where she no longer feels welcome.
''I was very inspired by the fact of the opposition,'' she said. ''This is the little I can do because I'm so fed up with the silence, with the injustice.''
State news media in Russia reported last year that Mr. Kuznetsov had been indicted on fraud and money laundering charges. Ms. Bullock said she had never heard that and questioned the credibility of the Russian official who released the information.
But then everything about Ms. Bullock, a former baby sitter who built a real estate business and rose to become a wealthy Upper East Side boldface name, often seems cloaked in the intrigue and intricacy of a 19th-century Russian novel. Her husband, Mr. Kuznetsov, said in an interview several years ago that he was pressured to resign from his position as a regional finance official because government regulators were reviewing his wife's Russian real estate development company, RIGroup. Ms. Bullock said he actually left for political reasons that had nothing to do with her company.
After Mr. Kuznetsov resigned, one of his political allies was shot in an apparent contract murder. (Ms. Bullock said her husband is now in Europe.)
RIGroup was taken over by a rival company called ORSI, one of whose owners was a bank belonging to President-elect Putin's former judo coach, Arkady R. Rotenberg. Ms. Bullock has characterized ORSI as a corporate raider that stripped her company of assets and drove it into bankruptcy.
Representatives of ORSI, which later served as a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver for her Russian properties, have accused the couple of corruption and Ms. Bullock of profiting from her husband's position.
This sort of accusation, which Ms. Bullock said was as baseless as the depictions of her as a money launderer, or a horse hunter, is one reason she cites for staging her counteroffensive, with the help of public-relations experts, against her bad press. (A Facebook campaign that claimed she was organizing safaris in which wealthy hunters shoot wild horses with poison appears to have been taken down.)
''My name was covered in dirt,'' she said. ''Just because I did better than others, somebody had the appetite to take it all away from me?''
Ms. Bullock says she grew up in St. Petersburg and taught Russian literature to high school students. In 1990 she moved to New York and worked as a paralegal in the office of an immigration lawyer, where she met Mr. Kuznetsov, with whom she has a daughter, Eugenia Bullock, 15. (She also has a 24-year-old daughter, Zoe Remmel, with her first husband. Ms. Remmel's 2008 wedding at a historic Russian estate drew scrutiny from the press and Web sites. Ms. Bullock said of the wedding, ''It may look expensive, but I'm extremely cost conscious with everything I do.'')
Eventually Ms. Bullock built RIGroup, which developed shopping centers, office buildings and summer homes in Russia, mostly in the Moscow region, where Mr. Kuznetsov was a finance official.
She earned an M.B.A. from Duke and began renovating Upper East Side town houses; her first Manhattan project was the former New York Observer building on East 64th Street, which she bought for $9.5 million in 2004 and sold for $18.74 million a year later.Along the way Ms. Bullock has become prominent on New York's social scene. There she is at an American Ballet Theater spring gala wearing elegant black; at a Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center spring ball in white; at a Guggenheim gala in blue.
Though Ms. Bullock assumed a lower profile over the last few years, her exhibition -- ''Allegories and Experiences,'' which runs through June 1 at 14 East 82nd Street -- is something of a coming-out party, and she has heralded it with two publicists. This month she helped host a dinner at the exhibition to celebrate International Women's Day. At long tables laden with candelabra, red tulips and yellow daffodils were the likes of fashion designer Nicole Miller, the architect Hani Rashid and the gallery owner Paul Judelson.
''I found her to be courageous to do that show,'' Mr. Rashid said later in an interview. ''Kudos to her.''
The art show uses a film theme -- its 24 images represent 24 frames per second, the standard motion picture film speed; they line the walls behind a semi-transparent membrane, like an unrolled piece of film.
''The whole history of Putin's power is a movie that we've seen before,'' Ms. Bullock said in an interview. ''It's the cult of one man. It's the power of one party. It's the search for enemies and the total stagnation of the economy.''
Each image is accompanied by a title and text in English and Russian. Mr. Gorbachev -- ''Michael the Archangel'' -- is described as ''the most unpopular politician in Russia in the last 100 years, but the most pampered abroad.''
In reviewing the show, a critic for Art in America wrote: ''The content in the exhibition reads more like propaganda than fact, and it's likewise difficult to tell whether or not Bullock has been wronged, or if she was complicit in her own downfall.''
Ms. Bullock even includes her husband in her exhibition. She calls him ''Catch of the Day'' and describes how he ''was dubbed 'an American spy,' who financed the C.I.A. for $20 billion.''
In an interview Ms. Bullock said she initially played the role of subservient wife, then came to realize she didn't need to defer to her husband anymore. ''I was convinced that he was right -- that's something particularly Russian, to listen to a man,'' she said. ''It's so easy to follow somebody. It takes much more responsibility to speak for yourself.''
As for the Guggenheim, museum officials said Ms. Bullock's term expired last June. Ms. Bullock said she was unaware of this but wouldn't want to go back on the board anyway.
''It wasn't the Guggenheim that I joined,'' she said. ''The Guggenheim that I joined was a fabulous first-rate museum. The museum that it became is a totally different institution with a total lack of leadership.''
A Guggenheim spokeswoman, Eleanor Goldhar, said, ''We won't be making any comment.''

HEADLINE: Vindication for Challenger of Health Care Law

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Congress passed legislation requiring nearly all Americans to obtain health insurance, Randy E. Barnett, a passionate libertarian who teaches law at Georgetown, argued that the bill was unconstitutional. Many of his colleagues, on both the left and the right, dismissed the idea as ridiculous -- and still do.
But over the past two years, through his prolific writings, speaking engagements and television appearances, Professor Barnett has helped drive the question of the health care law's constitutionality from the fringes of academia into the mainstream of American legal debate and right onto the agenda of the United States Supreme Court.
''He's gotten an amazing amount of attention for an argument that he created out of whole cloth,'' said one of his many critics, Douglas Laycock, a professor at the University of Virginia Law School. ''Under existing case law this is a very easy case; this is obviously constitutional. I think he's going to lose eight to one.'' 
On Monday, as the court began three days of arguments, questioning by the nine justices suggested they were ready to review the law now rather than wait until it has fully kicked in. That lays the groundwork for arguments for the challenge championed by Professor Barnett: that Congress's power to set rules for commerce does not extend to regulating ''inactivity,'' like choosing not to be insured.
Professor Barnett, who watched Monday from the spectator seats, was not the first to raise the constitutional critique of the health law, but more than any other legal academic, he is associated with it. At 60, he is a fast-talking former Chicago prosecutor who decided to become a lawyer when he was in elementary school, while watching ''The Defenders,'' a 1960s television drama.
He is a fierce advocate of economic freedom who is accustomed to being a legal underdog. In 2004, in his first (and, he says, probably his last) appearance before the Supreme Court, he argued that Congress could not criminalize the production of home-grown marijuana for personal medical use. There again, critics said he would lose 8 to 1. He did lose, but took satisfaction in the actual vote, 6 to 3.
On Friday evening, after a busy day of press interviews, a moot court hearing and a presentation at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research institution, Professor Barnett sipped a Diet Mountain Dew in his Dupont Circle row house here. If the court strikes down President Obama's health care law, he was asked, will he have an ''I told you so'' moment?
''I don't call it that,'' he insisted. ''But whatever you want to call it, it's already happened. When the Supreme Court grants six hours of oral arguments over three days, I don't have to win that case to know that my challenge is serious.''
The challenge to the individual mandate, the provision requiring nearly all Americans to obtain health insurance, has been raised before; David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey, both lawyers who served in Republican administrations, made the Commerce Clause critique in a Wall Street Journal opinion article in 1993, when Congress was debating President Bill Clinton's health care initiative, and again in the fall of 2009.
Their argument prompted an online debate. Professor Barnett joined, remembering how another law professor ''wrote a very snarky, no-serious-person-would-think-there's-a-serious-challenge-here'' post. He added, ''That just sort of got my blood flowing.''
Amid the rise of the Tea Party movement, some Republican lawmakers argued during the legislative debate that the mandate was unconstitutional. With his academic credentials, Professor Barnett helped bolster the mandate's conservative critics.
''What Randy has done is provide an intellectual and legal framework for explaining why this is not just unpopular, but also unconstitutional,'' said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and founder of a legal blog to which Professor Barnett sometimes contributes. ''You can accept or not that framework, but it is a framework that is out there that is being taken seriously in part because it was proposed by a serious guy.''
But some law professors, including some conservatives, are not persuaded. Among them is Charles Fried of Harvard, who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration and who has repeatedly debated Professor Barnett, said that at most he was giving the idea ''something approaching scholarly respectability.''
In his writings and speeches, Professor Barnett uses four words -- unprecedented, uncabined (lawyerly jargon for unlimited), unnecessary and dangerous -- to describe the individual mandate. But Professor Fried, citing a string of precedents upholding mandatory participation in government programs like Social Security and vaccination initiatives, sees Professor Barnett using an ''emotional hook,'' not compelling legal analysis.
His words ''don't make much sense,'' Professor Fried said, ''but the music is there.''
Professor Barnett says he learned early on the importance of being able to communicate with ordinary people, ''and not be a pointy-headed intellectual.'' He grew up Calumet City, Ill., a working-class city south of Chicago, where his father owned a handful of laundries.
In high school, Mr. Barnett said he was a ''William F. Buckley conservative,'' and president of the Student Council and his local Jewish youth group. Most of the town was Polish Catholic; Mr. Barnett was one of four Jews in his graduating class.
''I was sort of odd man out,'' he said, ''which does inspire people to be independent-minded.''
He discovered libertarianism as a student at Northwestern. Later, as a Harvard law student, he took a class in constitutional law from the liberal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, and found himself disenchanted with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution. (Professor Tribe remembers him as ''a very talented and creative student.'')
He became a prosecutor and later, a contracts professor. But a 1986 in invitation to speak to the Federalist Society, then a fledgling group of conservative lawyers, ignited his interest in the Constitution. He developed a specialty in the Ninth Amendment, a favorite of libertarians, which says that rights not spelled out in the Constitution are ''retained by the people.''
Professor Barnett's work on the health care law fits into a much broader intellectual project, his defense of economic freedom. He has long argued that the Supreme Court went too far in upholding New Deal economic laws -- a position that concerns his liberal critics.
Even a close friend and fellow Georgetown law professor, Lawrence B. Solum, says that Professor Barnett is aware of the ''big divide between his views and the views of lots of other people,'' and that his political philosophy is ''much more radical'' than his legal argument in the health care case. Professor Barnett, for his part, insists that if the health law is struck down, it will not ''threaten the foundation of the New Deal.'' But, he allowed, it would be ''a huge symbolic victory for limited government.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Top Legislators Near Accord on the Budget

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders were nearing a deal on Monday night on a spending plan of about $132.5 billion for New York State's next fiscal year, slightly reducing overall spending while increasing financing for schools and accelerating scores of public works projects.
As part of the budget talks, the governor and lawmakers, who are already moving to legalize casinos across the state, drew up a new state commission to oversee all forms of gambling in New York. 
But the Legislature, with a Senate controlled by Republicans and an Assembly by Democrats, was unable to agree on whether to establish a health insurance exchange to comply with the much-debated federal health overhaul championed by President Obama. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is now planning to sidestep opposition from Senate Republicans by creating an exchange via executive order, a spokesman for the governor said.
Over all, the budget process was less contentious than in many years, and lawmakers hope to vote to approve the budget before the end of the week. The state's next fiscal year begins on Sunday.
''Just as years of late budgets symbolized Albany's dysfunction, on-time budgets show that state government is working again,'' said the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican.
And the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said: ''We've been making good progress. Everybody's been cooperating. Everybody's been compromising.''
The spending plan would make only relatively modest changes to budget proposed by the governor in January. The budget does not change state income tax rates, which were overhauled in December, when lawmakers agreed to create a new top tax bracket for the highest earners.
The thorniest policy issues before the Legislature had already been resolved: this month, lawmakers approved a package of bills that put in place legislative redistricting maps and reduced pension benefits for new public workers.
As part of that earlier deal, lawmakers voted to endorse a constitutional amendment that would allow up to seven Las Vegas-style casinos across the state. The amendment would have to be approved once more by the Legislature, and then by voters, to become law.
Anticipating the expansion of gambling, the budget legislation would create a New York State Gaming Commission, which would operate the lottery, regulate bingo halls and other charitable gambling, and regulate Indian casinos, horse racing and video lottery terminals at racetracks. The commission would replace and consolidate the existing Racing and Wagering Board and the New York State Lottery Division, and would have expanded oversight powers.
The new gambling commission would have seven members -- five of them appointed by the governor, one by the Assembly speaker and one by the Senate majority leader. A similar commission was proposed by Mr. Cuomo in January.
But it remains unclear how casino licenses would be granted. The new commission would not automatically have the authority to grant them.
By early Monday night, the governor and legislative leaders had agreed on many other elements of the state budget, including legislation on transportation, economic development and environmental conservation.
In an effort to expedite public works projects, the legislative leaders agreed to set up a new panel that would coordinate construction overseen by dozens of state agencies and public authorities. Mr. Cuomo's office said the initiative would speed up the repairs of dozens of bridges and hundreds of miles of state roads, and would also create jobs.
The two largest elements of the budget -- aid to local school districts and Medicaid spending -- remained unresolved.
Mr. Cuomo's budget proposed increasing spending in those areas by about 4 percent, an amount he and legislative leaders agreed to last year. But Mr. Cuomo also wanted to disburse $250 million of the $805 million increase in school aid via a competitive grant program for school districts, while legislative leaders want most of the school money to be allocated by to the regular school financing formula.
Lawmakers agreed to Mr. Cuomo's request for authority to transfer appropriations between state agencies without legislative approval, but the language was narrowed to ensure that the governor could move money only for back-office services like human resources and information technology. And lawmakers also acceded to the governor's request to allow his administration to dole out centralized state contracts without receiving clearance from the state comptroller's office. Mr. Cuomo said the moves would improve efficiency.
The comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat, had opposed eliminating the so-called pre-audits, saying the move would undermine an important safeguard in the procurement process. On Monday, Mr. DiNapoli complained that the provision had not been removed from the spending plan, calling it ''a mistake to erode this independent oversight.''

HEADLINE: Meditations on a Borough's History, Through Booms and Bad Times

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
''It's particularly meaningful to see so many of you here tonight in light of the financial panic that has made all of our lives so terribly difficult,'' the conductor Alan Pierson said as he welcomed audience members to a Brooklyn Philharmonic concert presented at Roulette in downtown Brooklyn on Saturday evening.
Brandishing a newspaper, Mr. Pierson cited bank closings, failed businesses and neighbors beset by hardships. ''I want to take a moment and read for you all a few lines from this morning's Brooklyn Daily Eagle, written by Walt Whitman, Brooklyn's greatest living poet,'' he said. 
Come again?
From the start of Mr. Pierson's tenure as the Brooklyn Philharmonic's artistic director last year, this financially struggling but resilient organization has tried to re-evaluate what constitutes an orchestral concert and to integrate itself more closely into the borough's disparate neighborhoods.
''Brooklyn Village,'' jointly mounted with the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and Roulette, is not only the orchestra's most ambitious step toward those goals, but also its most visionary undertaking in recent memory. Conceived by Mr. Pierson and the librettist Royce Vavrek, directed by Ted Sperling and produced with Beth Morrison Projects, the concert incorporated dialogue, choreography, projected images and audience participation, all of it prompted by the notion of Brooklyn as a living community.
Every detail of the production conveyed rich nuances of Brooklyn's history, including the orchestra. During a lithe opening account of the Scherzo from Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony, a piece featured in the Philharmonic's inaugural season in 1857, the floor plan of the orchestra's original home, the Brooklyn Athenaeum, was projected on the walls around the stage.
Further works came in a near-seamless flow, melded with recitations and ambient-sound transitions, and accompanied with photographs and paintings. The winsome melodies and sophisticated harmonies of Sarah Kirkland Snider's ''Here,'' performed by an unaccompanied Brooklyn Youth Chorus, led to the moody Prelude from Copland's Symphony No. 1. Matthew Mehlan's ''Canvas,'' a quirky melting pot of avant-garde gestures, doo-wop and Broadway belting sunnily voiced by Lauren Worsham prefaced a breezy excerpt from Sufjan Stevens's ''BQE.''
Opening the program's second half, chorus members stationed throughout the space led audience members in ''Idumea,'' a shape-note hymn by Charles Wesley. That work provided the melodic germ and temperament for David T. Little's ''Am I Born,'' an elaborate, multimovement cantata also inspired by a Francis Guy painting, ''Winter Scene in Brooklyn.''
Most closely associated with small ensembles, Mr. Little demonstrated a thrilling authority in writing for larger forces, mixing orchestral movements of cinematic sweep and urgency with rich a cappella choral passages and instances of chamberlike intricacy. The soloist, the soprano Mellissa Hughes, combined classical poise with torch-song emotionalism, confirming her status as one of New York's freshest, most compelling interpreters. The young choristers rose to the occasion.
You could nitpick at this or that minor detail: a sagging French-horn episode in the Beethoven Scherzo; flaccid rhythms in ''The BQE.'' But as a whole ''Brooklyn Village'' was irresistible, suffused with conviction and ennobling warmth. To witness it was to feel a part of it.
The Brooklyn Philharmonic performs next with the New York Choral Society on April 20 at Carnegie Hall; (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org.

HEADLINE: New Ideas On Pensions: Use States

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
As growing numbers of baby boomers face retirement with inadequate savings, some state officials are considering a novel proposal to rebuild America's ailing retirement system -- having state pension funds run retirement plans for companies.
Because more companies are ditching their own pension plans or not offering retirement benefits at all, the idea would be to give companies an easy way to offer a firm pension without having to run the plan themselves.
On Monday, the labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci, who developed the proposal, held a public forum at the New School for Social Research with New York City's comptroller, John Liu. The forum explored whether companies might want to start offering pensions through a pooled system run by the Bureau of Asset Management, a unit of the comptroller's office.
Mr. Liu said he was interested because New York City was in ''the early stages of a burgeoning retirement crisis,'' where more than a third of all retirement-age households had nothing to rely on except Social Security. 
He said that more elderly people were turning up in the city's homeless shelters and that a program to make it easy for employers to offer better retirement benefits might reduce future strain. Lawmakers in Connecticut and California have introduced bills to either study or create such a program and the Pennsylvania state Treasurer has expressed interest, although he has no power to introduce legislation himself. Mr. Liu said he had talked to lawmakers, but had no firm legislative plans.
At the heart of the proposal is something called a cash-balance pension, a hybrid that combines features of a 401(k) plan with those of a traditional pension plan. Workers can watch their benefits grow each year as an account balance, but the assets that secure the benefits are held in a pooled trust.
The structure could be attractive because it would be flexible -- employers could reduce the rate of increase during recessions, saving money and reducing the chance of a runaway pension obligation. But the idea could be controversial, because the role of managing the money would fall to state pension systems, now under fire in many places for their handling of city and state workers' pensions. Republicans have tended to see the idea as one more manifestation of ''big government.''
Ms. Ghilarducci said that the survey research she commissioned showed that small business owners in particular wanted a better option. They feared taking on big legal liabilities if they ran their own retirement plans but expected to be hit with hidden fees if they gave the job to an outside vendor.
Ms. Ghilarducci said fees would be less of an issue with an existing state system and the fiduciary duty would be borne by the states, not the companies.
Not everybody sees it that way. The big public pension systems have been criticized in recent years for, among other things, underestimating the cost of providing conventional pensions and failing to anticipate market crashes that have left local taxpayers to bail out investment failures. Participating cities and taxpayers are rebelling in some places but have no legal way to drop out of state-run plans.
Giving new duties to California's giant state pension system, known as Calpers, would be ''fraught with problems,'' said Daniel Pellissier, president of California Pension Reform. ''They've been having trouble with the mission that they've been entrusted with. It would be silly to give them another job that would distract from protecting the retirees and the taxpayers.''
Ms. Ghilarducci said that if a public system like Calpers adopted her idea, the money it managed for companies would be kept separate from the money for cities and other local governments. And the benefits for workers at companies would be more affordable than the pensions public workers get because of the cash-balance design.
She developed her proposal in part by studying countries like Sweden and Latvia, where the World Bank assisted with national pension reforms. There, she found, modified cash-balance pensions were used to help keep governments from promising more retirement income than their national economies could deliver.
Not long ago, cash-balance pensions were stirring an entirely different uproar in the American workplace, setting off unionization drives, Congressional hearings and class-action lawsuits.
Companies were setting them up almost exclusively to replace older, richer pension plans that they no longer wanted to operate. The older plans had rewarded loyalty by letting workers build up the biggest part of their benefit in the final years of their careers.
The switch to a cash-balance plan snatched away those lucrative years, just as many older workers were reaching them. People complained they had been cheated out of tens of thousands of dollars. Some filed lawsuits.
The most closely watched lawsuit was a class action at I.B.M. covering about 140,000 people. The workers, who argued that the pension switch constituted illegal age discrimination, won at the trial level, lost on appeal, and were denied a review by the Supreme Court in 2007.
For about seven years, while the I.B.M. employees' complaint was before the courts, other companies shied away from cash-balance pensions because of the legal uncertainty. The painful controversy prompted many companies to give up on pensions and offer 401(k) plans instead.
''I always thought that cash-balance pensions were really good, but if you started talking about them everybody got angina,'' said Ms. Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School. Ms. Ghilarducci envisions using cash-balance pensions differently -- not as a consolation prize for the loss of a better pension plan, but as a supplement for workers whose companies offer little or no retirement benefits at all.
For them, a cash-balance pension is not a cut -- it is a significant improvement. A pooled plan offers financial efficiencies and lets workers give the job of investing their money to someone else.
The federal government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could guarantee the benefits, something it does not do for public pensions or 401(k) plans.
''All we really need is an orderly exit from single-employer pensions to another platform,'' Ms. Ghilarducci said. ''And that's either the states or the federal government, because those are the only entities designed to last in perpetuity.''
Ms. Ghilarducci floated her idea in Washington but found little interest. When she tried the states, she got a toehold, especially in states led by Democratic governors or legislatures.
In California, Senator Kevin de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said he saw the cash-balance option as offering a lifeline to millions of private sector workers who had no retirement benefits at work, ''without a cost to taxpayers.'' Bills were introduced in both houses of the Legislature and a hearing is scheduled for next month.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Fell in February

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell in February, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday.
The association said its Pending Home Sales Index for the month slipped 0.5 percent to 96.5, rather than rising 1 percent as expected by economists surveyed by Reuters. 
''The actual existing-home sales numbers still need to rise a bit in order fully to catch up, but the overall impression is one of a pause,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
Contracts signed were up 9.2 percent in the 12 months to February.
Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes fell in February, but remained the second-highest since May 2010. Other reports last week also showed declines in home building activity and new-home sales in February.
However, permits to build homes approached their highest level in about three years in February, and prices of both new and previously owned homes rose from a year ago. Some economists said the unseasonably mild winter weather had declined as a favorable factor in the housing market.
''We are seeing a diminishing lift from the weather. Even if you look at the February setback in most of these indicators, the direction is clearly still upwards,'' said Michael R. Englund, chief economist at Action economics in Boulder, Colo.
''We continue to think we hit the bottom in the housing sector about the middle of last year and that we are recovering,'' he added, ''though it is a slow recovery and prices are not going to recover until next year.''
The housing market remains hobbled by an oversupply of unsold homes, particularly foreclosures, which are pushing down prices. Stringent conditions to qualify for a home loan are also an obstacle.
About a third of contracts are canceled every month, according to the Realtors association.
''Indeed, February has been a bit of a pothole for the housing market. But with affordability high and job creation improving, there is still much opportunity for improvement in the housing sector,'' said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Contracts fell in three of the four regions last month, but jumped 6.5 percent in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Survey Suggests Domestic Demand Is Rising in Germany

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Germany's famously thrifty consumers may finally be more willing to spend, according to data released Monday, raising the prospect that domestic demand could take the place of flagging exports and help pull the rest of Europe out of recession.
The Ifo business climate index, which is considered a reliable predictor of the direction of the largest economy in Europe, rose slightly more than expected in March, to its highest level since July, the Ifo Institute in Munich said. 
Unusually, retailers accounted for the rise in the Ifo index; manufacturers and builders became a bit more pessimistic.
While it is probably early to declare a turning point, there are signs that falling unemployment and rising real estate prices are giving Germans confidence to do more shopping.
''Domestic components are holding up better now,'' said Thomas Harjes, an economist at Barclays in Frankfurt. ''We are at the beginning of seeing some rebalancing of the German economy.''
Germany's economy has traditionally been driven by exports of cars and machinery, while domestic demand has been comparatively weak. In fact, the country has been something of a graveyard for retailers. Wal-Mart gave up trying to crack the German market in 2006. Karstadt, the nation's largest chain of department stores, filed for insolvency in 2010, although it has since restructured and become profitable.
Germany has the largest trade surplus in Europe, which partly reflects the success of manufacturers like Daimler and Siemens, but also is a function of weak demand for imported goods. The rest of the euro zone, much of which is stuck in recession, would benefit if Germans bought more products and services from their neighbors.
In addition, stronger domestic demand would make Germany less susceptible to economic ups and downs in major export markets like China and the United States.
While the Ifo index pointed only to modest growth in Germany, the resiliency of German business confidence helped calm fears that the nation's economy was slowing down.
Last week, a survey of purchasing managers by the research firm Markit signaled that the broader euro zone probably slipped into recession in the first quarter of 2012. The Markit survey also showed that German manufacturers were becoming less optimistic.
Mr. Harjes of Barclays pointed out that the Ifo index surveys 7,000 companies, seven times as many as the Markit survey. The Ifo survey therefore captures more small and midsize enterprises oriented toward domestic customers, he said.
While economists generally portrayed the Ifo results as positive, some were more cautious. Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, noted that the indicator rose more slowly in March than in previous months. ''The German economy is losing some of its momentum,'' he said in a statement.
Few economists expect Germany, with its aging population, to become a nation of frenzied shoppers. But after years of stagnation, property values are rising in major cities like Berlin and Frankfurt. That tends to make homeowners feel wealthier and more confident about spending.
In addition, unemployment is near its lowest point since reunification, at 7.4 percent as measured by the Federal Employment Agency. While the rate has been falling for several years, Germans were unsettled by changes to labor laws and are only now feeling secure enough to spend, Mr. Harjes said.
''Structural reforms created a lot of uncertainty,'' Mr. Harjes said. ''People weren't confident enough to see there are also opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Awaiting Health Law Ruling, and Preparing Plan B

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
State officials and insurance executives are devising possible alternatives to the coming federal requirement that most Americans buy health insurance, even as the Supreme Court hears arguments about the constitutionality of the mandate.
The options being discussed include imposing state requirements that people get insurance, penalties for people who delay and automatic coverage enrollment. While it is unclear which way the court will rule, state officials and insurance executives say they have no choice but to prepare their options before the proposed mandate goes into effect in 2014. ''We're always working on Plan B -- always,'' said Senator Karen Keiser, a state lawmaker in Washington State who leads a group tackling the issue.
''It will be up to state legislators, that is where the power will move,'' said Ms. Keiser, a Democrat. ''We have a lot of options at the state level.''
Some Wall Street analysts predict that if the federal mandate is struck down and the rest of the law is upheld, the industry will quickly shift its focus to alternatives, particularly those that enable the states to bolster enrollment, so enough healthy people sign up and premiums do not skyrocket. ''The states are obviously not wanting the health insurance market and exchanges to spiral out of control,'' said Jason Gurda, who follows insurers for Leerink Swann. 
In Georgia, where the legislature has not yet authorized the development of an exchange to buy and sell insurance as required by the law, the state's insurance commissioner, Ralph T. Hudgens, says he knows he may have to come up with a marketplace, regardless of how the Supreme Court rules. He said he opposed the mandate, but he believed the exchange could make it easier for citizens to buy policies. ''Whether the mandate is struck down or not, Georgia is under the edict to establish an exchange,'' he said.
Although unlikely, given the political opposition and current unpopularity of the federal mandate, some states, following the example of Massachusetts, could authorize their own mandates requiring people to buy coverage or pay a penalty.
States could also make it difficult for people to enroll only when they needed care by setting limited periods when individuals could sign up or by imposing penalties on those who waited, although that could require a change to the federal law. Individuals could be also be automatically enrolled by their employer unless they opted out, although some groups are already challenging an existing provision in the law that requires employers to automatically enroll any new workers in a health plan as overly burdensome.
The law could also be modified to allow states to continue to use high-risk pools, where people with expensive medical conditions might go to get more heavily subsidized coverage. And while the current law requires insurers to cover anyone with a pre-existing condition, Congress could contemplate allowing insurers to exclude an existing medical condition if someone waited to enroll only when they needed care.
''There are alternatives to the mandate,'' said Andrew Dreyfus, the chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state most closely watched as an indication of how the federal law may play out because of its adoption of a similar law, under then-Governor Mitt Romney, now running for the Republican nomination for president.
One way Massachusetts brought down the cost of coverage for individuals, for example, was to merge that insurance market with the one for small businesses, where the premiums were lower, which other states could also do, Mr. Dreyfus said. The state also started a marketing campaign, featuring the Boston Red Sox, to try to persuade young people to enroll.
''You could have a market, but it would be a more dysfunctional market,'' Mr. Dreyfus said.
The sweeping federal health care bill known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2010 after a contentious legislative battle. It has an array of provisions -- many of them controversial -- that are intended to expand care and lower costs. Central to the law, proponents say, is the mandate. Coupled with generous subsidies for some moderate-income individuals and the creation of new state insurance exchanges, it is viewed as essential to the ability of insurers to offer coverage to everyone, regardless of their health, and avoid charging higher premiums to people who are sick. Without the mandate, they say, too few young and healthy people will enroll, driving up the cost of insurance drastically for those who do and potentially causing the market to collapse.
''If you knock off the third leg, does the stool fall down?'' asked Chris Jennings, a Democratic policy analyst in Washington. ''It's certainly a huge wobble. It's very risky.''
The addition of a tax penalty encouraged significantly more people who were younger and healthier to buy coverage, according to a 2011 analysis of the Massachusetts law in The New England Journal of Medicine. ''What we know for sure is, the law will work with the mandate,'' said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist who played a central role in developing both the federal and state laws and was one of the authors of the analysis. ''Once you get rid of the mandate, you don't really know.''
And some argue that Congress, for one, is likely to refuse to make changes to the law to develop alternatives to the mandate. ''It isn't going to get fixed,'' said Robert Laszewski, who runs a consulting firm, Health Policy and Strategy Associates, in Alexandria, Va. ''Republicans want to blow it up. They're going to be happy that the Supreme Court threw a grenade in it.''
The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June on the constitutionality of the law's requirement that people must make a purchase to avoid a penalty. If the court strikes down the mandate, it could also choose to strike down the entire law or its major provisions. The court could also delay making a decision until Americans are actually faced with paying a penalty on their 2015 taxes if they do not have insurance coverage.
Some of those who favor the mandate say, at least privately, that they do not believe it is quite the linchpin to the law's success as the heated rhetoric and flurry of legal briefs might suggest. There is no consensus about how much higher premiums might be without a mandate. ''Nobody has a crystal ball,'' said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group.
Even some people who favor the mandate say it is so modest that its absence will not be missed much. By 2016, the law imposes a maximum penalty on those who refuse to buy coverage of $695 or 2.5 percent of annual income, with some exceptions. As one insurance chief executive, Mark T. Bertolini of Aetna, told Reuters in an interview this year, ''Even as it exists today, the individual mandate is weak and still presents problems because the penalty is so low. If you get rid of it, I don't know that it makes all that much of a difference.''
As a result, many insurers and policy analysts say federal and state officials are likely to have to come up with additional ways of making it harder for people who wait until they get sick to sign up. In Massachusetts, for example, the state needed to limit the open-enrollment period to prevent people from starting and dropping coverage to suit their medical needs.
Making the law work, a spokeswoman for Aetna said, ''will take additional measures if we are to make insurance truly affordable, especially in a world without a mandate.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Unique Culture Group Stays Busy Sharing the Wealth

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- All over the world cultural organizations are tightening their budgets and paring back productions. But Danilo Miranda faces a different challenge, one that makes him the envy of his peers. As the director of the leading arts financing entity in Brazil, his budget is growing by 10 percent or more annually, and he must figure out ways to spend that bounty, which amounts to $600 million a year.
Standing at the window of his office here one afternoon late last year, Mr. Miranda pointed to one of his group's most ambitious initiatives. In the courtyard below, the avant-garde French troupe Theatre du Soleil, based in Paris and led by Ariane Mnouchkine, was erecting a giant tent where it would begin a tour of Brazil. 
Mr. Miranda's organization, SESC, a Portuguese acronym for Social Service of Commerce, is also strengthening ties with American artists. It sponsors a jazz festival in conjunction with Nublu, the New York record label; has signed an ''institutional partnership'' with the Spanish-language TeatroStageFest company; and has presented work by David Byrne, the salsa drummer Bobby Sanabria and Robert Wilson. Mr. Wilson, a director whose works include the operas ''Einstein on the Beach'' and ''the CIVIL warS,'' is discussing a long-term collaboration with SESC, as is the Globalfest showcase of world music held in New York every January.
''Our fundamental guiding principle is to use culture as a tool for education and transformation, to improve people's lives, and we're in a position to fulfill that mission, thank God,'' Mr. Miranda said. ''Over the last decade our budget has been doubling every six years or so. It's incredible, no?''
SESC owes its enviable position largely to a financing model that its leaders believe is unique in the world. A private, nonprofit entity whose role is enshrined in the national Constitution, the organization derives its budget from a 1.5 percent payroll tax imposed on and collected by Brazilian companies, so as the workforce in this nation of nearly 200 million people expands, so does the organization's budget.
In the United States and especially Europe the economic crisis that struck in 2008 has prompted severe cutbacks in government and business financing of cultural undertakings. But the Brazilian economy, now the world's sixth largest, is surging, having grown 7.5 percent in 2010 and just under 3 percent last year.
The labor force has been growing even faster. Abram Szajman, who in his capacity as the president of the Sao Paulo state chamber of commerce also oversees SESC's regional council here, estimated that receipts from the payroll tax increased 10 to 12 percent last year.
''Brazil is growing, and so our needs, and those of our workers, are also growing,'' he said. ''They want access not just to sports and health facilities but also to art, music and other cultural activities, whether from Brazil or abroad, and that's part of our charter.''
The group's big push may not have registered yet with arts consumers outside Brazil. But its emergence as a global force has not gone unnoticed either by artists or the people who pay for their work.
''The Brazilians are rolling in money,'' said Jennifer P. Goodale, director of the Trust for Mutual Understanding, which works with Eastern European and Asian countries on cultural exchange programs. ''What with the Olympics and all, it's their turn, their time.''
SESC is not the only entity making an effort to expand its activities and to raise Brazil's cultural profile internationally. The Brazilian foreign ministry and states and cities have programs to assist musicians' tours abroad and promote films and other works, and the federal government is looking at ways to strengthen a 20-year-old law that gives tax breaks to corporations that finance arts programs.
''The cultural dynamism, the monetary stability, the process of social inclusion -- all of that makes Brazilian culture a very valid pathway for the exercise of soft power, a way to make our society better known and better understood by others,'' said Celso Lafer, a former foreign minister who is also an author and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.
SESC is, however, the country's most active arts organization, operating in all 27 of Brazil's states, financing not just arts programs but also recreational activities, educational courses and health clinics. In Sao Paulo, which has 41 million people and is Brazil's most populous and prosperous state, one quarter of the group's state budget is spent on ''expansion and renovation'' of its arts and recreation centers, with another 20 percent going directly to cultural programs, and the remainder divided among other activities, Mr. Miranda said. He receives nearly as much for those cultural programs as the National Endowment for the Arts spends on the entire United States.
Today there is scarcely an area of the arts in Brazil in which SESC is not involved. The organization has its own book-publishing arm, as well as a record label and cable-TV channel, and also operates art galleries, theaters, cinemas and concert halls, often as part of larger complexes that include restaurants and sports facilities.
''The SESC model is a wonderful model that we should have all over the world,'' Nan van Houte, director of the Netherlands Theater Institute and a former president of the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts, said. ''To integrate everything, to have theaters, pool, library, restaurant, workshops and museums all together, is so very clever. It makes culture part of everyday life, not something apart.''
For artists the organization offers a respite from commercial demands and encourages experimental work. Because the SESC model is ''focused on community involvement in arts and culture,'' it ''removes marketing or promotional pressure that can come with corporate sponsorship,'' Mr. Wilson, who has been talking with the group about producing as many as half a dozen works, wrote in an e-mail.
In 2010, to cite one decidedly nonmainstream example, SESC commissioned a Greek musicologist working here to record a two-CD set of compositions, which languished in Brazilian monasteries for nearly 300 years, written for the piccolo cello, now abandoned. But the organization also releases CDs and presents shows of samba and other types of Brazilian popular music and regularly sponsors exhibitions of Brazilian naif art.
''Since we're an institution that, although private, has public commitments, we can't limit ourselves to just one tendency or style,'' Mr. Miranda said. ''We can't say, 'I'm only going to do traditional music or modern music or hip-hop or bossa nova.' ''
SESC was founded in 1946, a moment when Brazil's commercial and industrial sectors were worried that workers might be attracted to Communism. Since Brazil is the largest Roman Catholic country in the world, the Social Christian doctrine espoused in papal encyclicals like ''Rerum Novarum,'' which called for greater social solidarity and a more harmonious relationship between capital and labor, was also an important influence.
Brazil and the world have changed since then. Not only has Communism collapsed, but Brazil's economy is also larger than that of Britain, Italy or Russia. Still, Brazilian business leaders continue to see great benefit and utility in the SESC system, and none of the country's more than 20 political parties opposes it.
''Part of the payback is social, in the sense that it's important to us as businessmen that society see that we are participating,'' said Mr. Szajman, the Sao Paulo chamber of commerce president. ''But there's a practical return too: Our workers go to their jobs as better-informed citizens, with better training, and happier, which makes them more productive.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Requests Tougher Rules On Data Sales

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA and EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The government's chief consumer protection agency said on Monday that it intended to take direct aim at the vast industry that has grown up around the buying and selling of information about American consumers.
The agency, the Federal Trade Commission, called on Congress to enact legislation regulating so-called data brokers, which compile and trade a wide range of personal and financial data about millions of consumers from online and offline sources. The legislation would give consumers access to information collected about them and allow them to correct and update such data.
The agency also sent a cautionary signal to technology and advertising companies regarding a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism that allows consumers to opt out of having their online behavior monitored and shared. It warned that if companies did not voluntarily provide a satisfactory Do Not Track option, it would support additional laws that mandate it.
The recommendations, part of a sweeping set of guidelines in an F.T.C. report on Monday, represent the government's latest move to address the issue of consumer privacy. 
On one side of the debate are data brokers like Experian and Acxiom, which collect and sell information, and the huge ecosystem of technology and online advertising companies -- including Google, Microsoft and Facebook -- that target consumers based on their personal preferences.
On the other side are consumer groups and privacy advocates that are concerned about the volume of data being collected and how little control consumers have over that information.
The government's Do Not Track efforts are likely to collide with the desire of companies to continue the lucrative business of collecting, using and sharing information about the people who use their services. Although these businesses say they support limits on using this information, they generally still want to be able to collect it.
One official from a prominent technology company, who declined to be named because the discussions with the government were continuing, said that ''do not collect is basically death for online advertising.''
But the trade commission said unequivocally that it believed consumers who said they did not want to be tracked meant just that -- no tracking at all. It said it would support legislation to require it.
''Do Not Track from our perspective certainly means 'do not collect' -- not 'do not advertise back,' '' said Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the F.TC. ''If a real Do Not Track option doesn't come to fruition by the end of the year, there will be, I don't want to say a tsunami of support for Do Not Track legislation next Congress, but certainly a lot of support.''
The F.T.C. said it intended to work with the White House and the Commerce Department on proposals they unveiled last month to develop voluntary industrywide codes of conduct that the F.T.C. can enforce.
Mr. Leibowitz said the commission did not endorse any specific Congressional legislation, but he mentioned a bill introduced in the Senate in April 2011 by John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona. That bill seeks to require companies to tell consumers what data is being collected and allow them to opt out of the practice.
At least two other bills have been introduced in Congress. But none of that legislation is likely to make it into law in this Congressional session, however, given the heavy schedule of pending matters and re-election campaigns.
Many data broker companies say much of the information they collect is available from public documents like property and voter registration records. Companies can sell their data to a variety of clients, including marketers, telecommunications companies, retailers and political campaigns.
Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, the chief privacy officer for Acxiom, said the focus on data brokers in the F.T.C. report was not a surprise. ''It's not an unreasonable request to have more transparency among data brokers,'' Ms. Barrett Glasgow said. The company collects data from public records, surveys and consumer purchasing behavior both online and offline.
According to Ms. Barrett Glasgow, a little more than 15 percent of the company's overall revenue is based on data sales.
In an e-mail, Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, the director of corporate communications, said Acxiom's clients included ''seven of the top eight credit card issuers, four of the top five retail banks, six of the top 10 telecom/media companies, six of the top 10 retailers, eight of the top 10 automotive manufacturers'' and other industry leaders.
Gerry Tschopp, the senior vice president for public affairs at Experian North America, said Experian was still reviewing the report but said ''we do provide consumers with choices, we comply with all applicable laws, follow established industry self-regulatory guidelines and use a variety of processes and procedures to safeguard consumer data.''
Michael Zaneis, senior vice president and general counsel of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group, said it was important that any data broker legislation not be so broad in scope that it would include ''virtually every publisher site, advertiser, ad network, or analytics firm'' that collects or shares data with other parties. This interconnection, he said, ''makes the digital economy work. We would not want to see legislation introduced that would harm the most fundamental operations of the Internet.''
Consumer privacy advocates mostly favored the commission's final report. ''Data brokers buy, compile and sell a wealth of highly personal information about you, but there's no way to find out what they have or if it's correct,'' said John M. Simpson, the head of Consumer Watchdog, which advocates for digital privacy. ''That's why the F.T.C.'s call for legislation in this area is so important.''
Jeffrey Chester, the head of the Center for Digital Democracy, said, ''In its call for Congress to enact legislation to rein in the data broker industry, the F.T.C. has opened up an important new 'front' in the battle to protect consumer privacy.''
In its report on online privacy last month, the White House recommended that Internet companies that collect personal data and then sell or lease it to third-party brokers should ''prominently and explicitly'' tell consumers they do so and ''provide consumers with meaningful opportunities to prevent these disclosures.''
The F.T.C. suggested that the guidelines should not affect small businesses that collect online data from fewer than 5,000 people and do not sell that data to third parties. It would also loosen the guidelines for companies that collect data for the purposes consistent with the context of a user's visit to a particular Web site. For example, if a user buys something on a Web site, the company would be able to collect data on that user and would not be required to offer consumers the option to opt out of data collection.

HEADLINE: Victims of the Tight-Fisted

BYLINE: By JULIE WEED

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
Tipping for hotel concierges, bellhops and housekeepers moves up and down with the economy, but lately it has also been affected by changes in corporate, airline and hotel policies.
The airlines' checked bag fees offer a prime example. Since luggage got wheels, more travelers have been eschewing porters and taking their own bags up to their hotel rooms. But the airline fees have made things worse, said Adam Weissenberg, a vice chairman at Deloitte & Touche who leads the firm's American travel, hospitality and leisure division.
''People are packing lighter so they can bring just a carry-on and avoid the fees,'' he said. ''The other day, I was sitting in a lobby for 20 minutes, and not one business traveler used a bellman.''
The bag fees have also affected skycap tips, said Calvin Miller, who has worked as a skycap for five years at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. He said that he was paid $2.13 an hour plus tips, and that those tips had decreased by 30 percent since the airlines started charging the fees. 
''The more people have to pay for baggage fees, the less money they are going to give to skycaps,'' he said. ''It would be nice if the money could trickle down to the workers who are giving the service.''
Business decisions that hotels made when the economy was weak have also affected tips. Many upscale hotels cut their rates to attract customers and fill rooms, but the clientele they attracted was not the tipping kind, said Joseph Sundberg, porter captain at Kimpton's Hotel Monaco in Portland, Ore.
In the down economy, ''guests who come on a budget may not be able to tip as generously,'' he said, ''or maybe they don't know the customs.''
Guests may leave luggage and laptops with him for the afternoon, he said, and ask multiple times if it will be kept safe. But when they come back to collect their belongings, he said, they often do not leave a tip.
''If it is so valuable to them, isn't it worth a couple of dollars for the person who kept it secure?'' said Mr. Sundberg, who has been at the hotel for 16 years. Tips, he said, can be a significant part of a bellhop's total compensation.
He added, though, that repeat guests who travel for business tended to tip the same amount no matter what was going on in the economy. ''If their business is bad, they're not going to let it affect you,'' he said.
Greg Frutchey, who has been a bellhop with the Morgans Hotel Group in Manhattan, said he had had similar experiences with budget travelers who were not familiar with gratuity customs. They may shop for bargains in the city, he said, and then ask the bellhop to weigh their suitcases and wait while they repack them to avoid airport overweight charges, without leaving a tip.
When the American economy faltered, said Kayse Gehret, a massage therapist who works as a contractor at a number of San Francisco hotels including the Ritz-Carlton and the St. Regis, many of her American clients disappeared, but her appointments with foreign guests increased.
''That really affected my income because many of them were not aware that people in the U.S. tip for services,'' she said. Some hotels now automatically bundle the gratuity in with the service, she said.
The economic downturn also meant fewer business trips and trips of shorter duration, both of which affected housekeeping tips.
''When people just get in and out, they may not feel as obligated to tip the housekeeper, compared to when they've stayed for a longer time,'' Mr. Weissenberg said.
Some hotels leave a note saying who cleaned the room to remind guests of the service they are getting, although they are wary of making the guests feel uncomfortable if they do not leave a tip, he said. Still, housekeepers' wages are generally low, so leaving $3 to $5 a day can make a big difference to them, he said.
Freddie Floyd, a concierge at the Sanctuary Hotel, an upscale boutique hotel in Midtown Manhattan, said that tips for housekeepers were more affected by the economy than his own tips were.
''People feel more obligated to tip someone who performs a service right in front of them, like calling for a reservation,'' he said. ''But when they come back to their room and it is magically clean, they don't associate a certain person with it,'' so they may not feel as compelled to tip, he added.
Mr. Floyd said that his clients did not tip him any less during the recession, but that their requests were slightly different.
''They still asked me for restaurant suggestions so they could take their clients out for a nice meal, but some wanted a place that seemed economically prudent, rather than superluxurious,'' he said. While some guests requested the hotel's Bentley, others preferred less obviously luxurious vehicles, he said.
Corporate restrictions on travel expenses can also affect gratuities. Per-diem expense allowances have not risen with inflation at most companies, said Michael McCall, who is the chairman of the marketing and law department at Ithaca College's school of business and who studies the hospitality industry.
That kind of control on expenses, along with reduced client entertainment budgets, has affected tips for hotel restaurant servers, Mr. Weissenberg said.
''While the average tip on a dinner bill has stayed at 15 or 20 percent,'' he said, ''the total bill might be less,'' as people choose the less expensive wine for a client dinner or manage their own per-diem costs more carefully.
Concierge tips at some hotels are down for the same reason. With smaller expense accounts, ''there aren't as many people using their services to book expensive excursions like a helicopter trip in Las Vegas or last-minute show tickets in New York,'' Mr. Weissenberg said.
That has seemed to change in recent months, though.
Brandon Perkins, a concierge at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, said that he noticed a turnaround last year and that business was just about back to normal with his luxury travelers.
''The demand for high-priced services and experiences is on the rise,'' he said. ''Travelers are back to requesting top-dollar Lakers tickets, access to movie premieres and private custom tours.''
Service providers in all expense categories have reason to be optimistic.
''Based on our research, business people plan to travel more and increase their travel spending in 2012,'' Mr. Weissenberg said, and conferences and conventions are growing again.
''This should have a positive impact on tips for hotel staff members,'' he said. ''Or, as the Las Vegas taxi drivers say, 'more trips is more tips.' ''

HEADLINE: Qantas in China Venture for Budget Airline

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Qantas Airways of Australia announced Monday that it was teaming up with one of the biggest carriers in China to form a low-cost airline based in Hong Kong, the latest in a string of airline ventures in Asia as carriers race to position themselves in anticipation of a major increase in air travel.
Qantas and China Eastern Airlines, which is based in Shanghai, are investing a total of $198 million in the joint venture, which will operate short-haul routes in Asia -- including China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia -- according to a joint statement by the two airlines Monday. 
The new carrier, Jetstar Hong Kong, will take to the skies next year and operate a no-frills model of the kind that has long been established in the United States and Europe and that has now also taken root in Asia.
Full-service carriers like Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines dominate the market in large parts of Asia and remain popular among customers who expect a complete range of services.
But the low-cost model has become increasingly widespread as operators seek to draw in the millions of people who are joining the ranks of the middle classes in the region but who often cannot, as yet, afford the fares charged by traditional full-service air carriers.
Peach, a budget carrier part-owned by All Nippon Airways of Japan, began operations earlier this month. Singapore Airlines is planning a no-frills carrier, Scoot, which will fly medium- and long-haul routes beginning about the middle of this year. And the Malaysia-based AirAsia, which helped pioneer low-cost air travel in the region, has been growing rapidly since it was set up in 2001.
Qantas's low-cost Jetstar brand, meanwhile, already operates successfully in Australia and New Zealand. It has also expanded its footprint to Southeast Asia by flying out of Singapore and Vietnam.
A Japanese operation, Jetstar Japan, is due to start in July.
''Jetstar's vision is to make travel more affordable for millions of people across Asia, and the demographics of China, with its booming middle class, are a key part of that plan,'' Bruce Buchanan, chief executive of Jetstar, said in the statement.
Jetstar Hong Kong's fares will be 50 percent lower than those of existing full service carriers, he added.
Analysts said the deal was part of a larger attempt by Qantas to revive its international operations, which have been struggling amid intensifying competition from Asian and Middle Eastern competitors. High oil prices and the economic turmoil in Europe also have weighed heavily on the industry as a whole.
Qantas, for example, reported last month that its earnings in the second half of 2011 had fallen by half, compared with the same period a year earlier.
For China Eastern, which carried nearly 70 million passengers last year, the venture represents a first foray into the low-cost segment.
The move is likely to be watched closely by rival mainland Chinese carriers like China Southern and Air China, analysts at the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, a consulting firm in Sydney, wrote in a report on its Web site.
Further expansion in the low-cost sector, however, might be handicapped by Beijing's tight control of routes, as well as new competition from the country's burgeoning high-speed rail network.
Beijing ''will be cautious in allowing further new entry -- especially low-fare carriers -- that would threaten a delicately balanced market in which billions of state assets and investment are engaged,'' the consulting firm noted.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: German Leader Agrees to More Bailout Money for Euro Zone Nations

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and MELISSA EDDY; James Kanter reported from Brussels and Melissa Eddy from Berlin. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union took a big step on Monday toward building a financial firewall strong enough to prevent the spread of fiscal contagion to major economies like Spain. The move came after Germany dropped its opposition to bringing the Continent's total bailout capacity to more than 690 billion euros ( $916 billion).
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said on Monday at a news conference in Berlin that her government remained determined that a permanent European rescue fund should be capped at 500 billion euros. 
But in a big concession, she said Germany would not oppose letting that fund operate alongside a temporary fund that has aided Greece, Ireland and Portugal but still has money to lend.
German officials cautioned that many details needed to be negotiated at a two-day summit meeting of European Union finance ministers that starts on Friday in Copenhagen.
But Ms. Merkel's statement effectively gives the green light to expanding the size of the firewall, as the United States and others have been urging.
It also shows renewed determination to shore up the stability of the euro zone while the overall European economy remains fragile and concerns are mounting about the Spanish government's rising costs of borrowing.
Ms. Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, have long opposed expanding the bailout fund any further, as they seek to shield German taxpayers from higher liabilities. There is already widespread discontent among Germans about shouldering most of the cost of rescuing weaker European partners like Greece.
Germany also was hesitant to commit more money before countries that might eventually need assistance, including Italy and Spain, showed they were serious about removing barriers to competition and other impediments to growth, said Silvio Peruzzo, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
''The German strategy has been pretty clear,'' he said. ''They wanted to keep the pressure on some euro zone member states in terms of reforms.''
The money already given out in loans by the temporary bailout fund -- known as the European Financial Stability Facility -- was originally supposed to count against the lending power of the permanent fund when it goes into effect this summer.
But under the new flexibility indicated by Ms. Merkel, the temporary fund's lending program might be allowed to continue without counting against the new 500-billion-euro fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism, when it goes into operation in July.
The new fund will spread the risk more evenly among the participating nations than the temporary fund, which left German taxpayers more exposed.
Deploying unused sums from the temporary fund, and not counting its outstanding loans against the new fund would effectively bring total lending power to about 692 billion euros.
Under existing plans, the temporary fund ''will run out in the middle of next year, just as planned,'' Ms. Merkel told reporter at her party headquarters.
''But 200 billion have already been handed out there, and we could imagine that these 200 billion run in parallel to the E.S.M. until the program countries have paid it back,'' she said. ''That will take a few years and then the E.S.M. will stand alone again.''
Just how all this might work is something the finance ministers will very likely wrestle with in Copenhagen on Friday. The discussion will involve whether the two funds ''are able to run parallel to one another, what their relationship is to one another,'' said Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry.
But he said the discussion would not be about ''whether to increase the'' size of the new fund.
Mr. Peruzzo, the Royal Bank analyst, said Ms. Merkel would probably need approval from the German Parliament to move ahead with the strategy. ''In a way, it's just a political commitment,'' he said. ''It's a signaling device, which is very important at this stage for the crisis.''
The idea of allowing the two funds to run in parallel apparently emerged during a meeting last month of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Mexico City, as a way of overcoming German opposition to increasing the firewall while satisfying the demands of Germany's partners in the Union and the G-20.
Upon his return from the G-20 meeting, Mr. Schauble, the German finance minister, began discussions among leaders of Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats, as well as its sister party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, said a party official who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak about the talks. Party leaders met separately in Berlin and Munich on Monday to agree to the proposal.
Ms. Merkel emphasized that if euro zone governments reached agreement on the new strategy, it ''could be the basis'' for the International Monetary Fund to use more resources to help contain financial turmoil in Europe.
The I.M.F. has contributed to the bailouts of Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
Olli Rehn, the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said Monday in Helsinki that he expected a sufficiently strong plan to be mapped out on Friday in Copenhagen for the I.M.F. to increase its contribution to the European effort. The I.M.F. is to hold its annual meeting in late April.
''Negotiations are ongoing, and my aim is to secure that a strong enough stability fund can be created to convince our partners they should reinforce the I.M.F.'s resources,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Faster Growth Is Needed to Bolster Job Market

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a speech that sought by turns to deflate optimism and pessimism about the labor market, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday that the Fed's efforts to stimulate growth were gradually reducing unemployment, but that the scale and duration of the problem could leave lasting scars on the economy.
''Recent improvements are encouraging,'' he said. However, he continued, ''millions of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment.'' 
Mr. Bernanke said he was particularly concerned about the unusually large share of the unemployed who have been unable to find work for six months or more. More than 40 percent of the unemployed are in this category, compared with less than 25 percent after other recent recessions.
''Because of its negative effects on workers' skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy,'' Mr. Bernanke told a meeting of business economists in Virginia.
In describing the Fed's efforts to improve growth as being important and productive, Mr. Bernanke countered recent speculation that the Fed might not continue those policies until at least the end of 2014. The Fed intends to hold short-term interest rates near zero through 2014, and has been investing in government debt to further reduce long-term interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke did not say that the Fed was considering new measures, a subject of intense speculation among investors. But stock markets, the prime beneficiaries of the Fed's easy-money campaign, liked the speech all the same. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.39 percent on Monday.
''Those who are looking for a major shift in Fed policy will be disappointed,'' Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, wrote in a brief commentary on the speech. She added, however, that Mr. Bernanke ''will continue to resist and override dissenters in his own ranks to keep and perhaps even expand monetary policy accommodation.''
Ms. Swonk, who attended the speech, noted that the absence of any mention of inflation was unusual, suggesting that Mr. Bernanke remained confident that faster inflation was not an imminent threat.
Critics, including some Fed officials, argue that the central bank's policies are likely to cause inflation because the central bank is trying to stimulate growth in an economy already running near capacity.
Unemployment remains at a high level, but those concerned about inflation say that general stimulus will not help because the problems are structural, including, for example, a lack of desirable skills.
Mr. Bernanke said Monday that structural unemployment might have increased in recent years, but that high unemployment was mostly a cyclical phenomenon, the result of the general economic malaise.
''The continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant factor,'' he said. ''Consequently, the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies, by providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help, over time, to reduce long-term unemployment as well.''
Mr. Bernanke outlined several reasons for this conclusion. While employers have always preferred to hire people who have been out of work for short periods, that preference has not increased in recent years as might be expected if the long term unemployed were languishing because they lacked relevant skills. Hiring also remains weak across a range of industries, suggesting broad causes.
The Fed also faces critics who agree with this analysis and argue that it should be stimulating the economy more aggressively to reduce unemployment more quickly. Some Fed officials, and many outside economists, argue that the Fed could stimulate the economy most effectively by helping the moribund housing market by buying mortgage-backed securities.
Mr. Bernanke himself outlined the stakes in grim detail Monday, describing the toll of long-term unemployment on workers and on the economy. Studies find that people who cannot find work for extended periods suffer permanent declines in wealth, health and earnings potential. And, their skills deteriorate.

HEADLINE: Most Oppose at Least Part of Overhaul, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN, HELENE COOPER and KATE PHILLIPS; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Two-thirds of Americans want the Supreme Court to overturn some or all of the health care law, even though large majorities support a few of its major aspects, according to a poll by The New York Times and CBS News.
At the heart of the opposition is the individual mandate requiring Americans to obtain health insurance, the least popular part of the bill and a crucial piece at the center of the court arguments, which began Monday and will turn to the mandate on Tuesday.
In the latest poll, 47 percent said they oppose the law while 36 percent approve, with the rest having no opinion. The results are similar to previous surveys that have consistently found the law's detractors outnumbering its supporters.
Keeping the law intact is preferred by a mere quarter of those surveyed, largely Democrats, reflecting the deep partisan divide within the overall findings that has persisted since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act just two years ago. And a bare majority of independents, an important swing group in this presidential election cycle, have remained fairly steadfast in siding with Republicans. 
The contrast between Americans' overall view of the law and their view of its component parts suggests that opponents have had more success making their case to the public than the White House has. In recent days, the Obama administration has once again stepped up its efforts to court support for the law, sending out mailings to women in battleground states, reaching out to Hispanic voters, another critical election bloc, and enlisting ''nurses for Obama'' nationwide to advocate for the law.
The Obama administration also parses some new polls -- including a Pew Research poll that found nearly as much support for expanding the law as for repealing it -- as evidence that Americans over all do not favor gutting the entire law. On Sunday, David Plouffe, the White House adviser, told CNN that officials sensed that Americans did not want to rehash the health care battle. ''You ask people, should we go back to square one? People don't want to do that,'' Mr. Plouffe said.
But as has been the case since nearly the inception of the law, much confusion lingers over certain portions of it, underscoring Mr. Obama's struggles to win public support for his benchmark legislation. In the Times/CBS News poll, less than half say they have a good understanding of the law, probably stemming in part from the fact that the provisions attracting the most opposition -- like the mandate -- have yet to be put into effect so therefore cannot be evaluated in tangible ways.
Yet other aspects of the law attract widespread support. Asked about a provision requiring insurance companies to cover people with a pre-existing medical condition, 85 percent said they approved of that element.
Similarly, 68 percent approved of the provision allowing children to remain on their parents' policies until the age of 26, and 77 percent approved of a provision reducing the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients.
Still, the poll results echo some of the criticisms raised by Republicans on and off the campaign trail. Robert Fawcett, 49, an independent from Yakima, Wash., said in a follow-up interview to the survey that while he favored some portions, the overall legislation was too far-reaching. ''The whole way the law was brought about, the length of it, the scope of it, was a wrong step in the wrong direction,'' he said. ''I believe forcing people to buy insurance is unconstitutional; it's taking away the choice people have.''
Most Americans say they worry that the law will raise their health expenses, and a steady majority say they are somewhat or very concerned that it will limit access to care. In addition, most agree with the Republicans' contention that many businesses won't be able to afford to provide coverage to employees and will be forced to cut jobs.
Republicans have painted the legislation as a government takeover, and the poll found that a majority consider the law as injecting too much government into the health care system.
Mr. Obama's rivals -- Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum -- have repeatedly emphasized what they view as burdensome costs and government intrusion. Even though many agree that the federal law is modeled after the one passed in Massachusetts and signed into law by Mr. Romney, he has asserted that he is not in favor of a national mandate.
Those views reflect a partisan divide that is indeed gaping. Fifty-six percent of Democrats approve of the law, with support peaking among self-described liberals. But the intensity of sentiment is much deeper on the Republican side, with most strongly opposed to the law. Results are similar among those who support the Tea Party movement, with more than 8 in 10 among the very conservative in opposition.
Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, lamented the effects of a public relations offensive against the law. ''It's always easier to stoke fear in people with untruths than to communicate a positive,'' she said. ''That's exactly what's happened here, with the help of hundreds of millions of dollars in negative advertising funded by people who have a vested interest in defeating the president, not protecting health care for millions of Americans.''
Complicating efforts by Republicans and Democrats to seize political advantage on the health care law is the swirl of misunderstanding that surrounds it. Of those who say they understand the law, 45 percent approve and 51 percent oppose, including 40 percent who strongly disapprove. Republicans and independents are more apt than Democrats are to say they understand it -- just over half of Republicans and independents say so, while most Democrats find it confusing. Among the respondents who find it confusing, 45 percent disapprove while nearly even numbers support it or have no opinion.
The nationwide poll is based on telephone interviews conducted March 21-25 on land-lines and cellphones with 986 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Tens of millions of people are uninsured. In this survey, most respondents said they had insurance coverage. But about 30 percent indicated that someone in their family had had trouble paying medical bills in the last year.
And some consumers in follow-up interviews worried that the law's full effect would damage the nation's halting emergence from the recession.
Tom Osborn, 51, an independent from Birmingham, Ala., said:
''Everybody should have health care available to them, but my major concern is where are we going to get the money to do this? We're just going to pour more on?''
''I'm kind of old school: if you can't afford it, don't buy it,'' Mr. Osborn added. ''I just don't think this is a great idea at this point in time. How are we going to pay for this thing, with all the debt this country has right now? We can't even afford to fix the roads.''

HEADLINE: Shares Surge After Bernanke's Comment

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks soared to multiyear highs and recorded one of their biggest gains of the year Monday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested that the economy still needed help to quicken job growth. 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 160.90 points, or 1.23 percent, to 13,241.63, its third-best showing this year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.40 points, or 1.39 percent, to 1,416.51, its highest close since May 2008.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is closing in on a 20 percent rally for the year, climbed 54.65 points, or 1.78 percent, to 3,122.57, its best finish since November 2000.
Health care stocks led the market. The Supreme Court heard the first of three days of arguments on the constitutionality of President Obama's 2010 health care law, which will require Americans to carry insurance or pay a penalty.
Health care stocks gained 1.7 percent as a group. Aetna gained 3.1 percent, WellPoint 2.9 percent and UnitedHealth Group 2.7 percent.
The market took a mixed view of the monthly report on pending sales of previously owned homes from the National Association of Realtors, which said its index of sales agreements declined 0.5 percent last month to a reading of 96.5. January's reading of 97 was the highest since April 2010, the last month buyers could qualify for a federal home-buying tax credit. A reading of 100 or higher is considered healthy.
Increased sales agreements in recent months were among signs of a slight pickup in the housing market. Still, analysts said the decline in the February report was disappointing after the three months of gains in hiring.
''So far, stronger employment growth has not prompted significantly sturdier willingness to sign purchase contracts, despite -- or perhaps because of -- some erosion in house prices over the last few months,'' said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics. Some of the jump could also have been because money managers are diving into stocks before the first quarter ends this week. Fund managers who missed out on this quarter's rally will want to show clients they are invested for the next quarter.
As stocks rose, the price of Treasury notes fell. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 97 25/32, and the yield rose to 2.25 percent from 2.23 percent late Friday.
The price of crude oil settled at $107.03, up 16 cents, and the average price of unleaded regular gasoline hit $3.90 per gallon.
Among individual stocks, Lions Gate Entertainment climbed 4.5 percent after its movie ''The Hunger Games'' had a record-setting opening weekend.
American Express climbed 2.5 percent after announcing that it would will raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents from 18 cents.
Tenet Healthcare rose 5.5 percent after the hedge fund Glenview Capital Management disclosed that it had taken a 5.5 percent stake in the company.

HEADLINE: Despite Shared Faith, Catholic Voters Haven't Been Thronging to Santorum

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Arbutus, Md.; Susan Saulny from Mandeville, La.; and Marjorie Connelly from New York.

 BODY:
Cathy Willauer, who is Roman Catholic and a mother of four, says that her religion is important to her and that she shares the same values as Rick Santorum.
But Mrs. Willauer, 50, who lives in Annapolis, Md., has decided to support Mitt Romney in Maryland's Republican presidential primary on April 3. She said she had more confidence that Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, could better manage the economy.
Besides, she said, Mr. Romney, who is Mormon, appears more tolerant of people of other faiths.
''While my personal values may align more closely with Senator Santorum's,'' she said, ''I feel Governor Romney is more willing to tolerate different views and values, and the president of the United States has to accept and respect the right of every American to believe as they will.'' 
Mrs. Willauer, who attended a Romney event in Arbutus, Md., last week, is part of a striking pattern that has emerged during the Republican primary season: more Catholic Republicans are favoring Mr. Romney even though Mr. Santorum is Catholic.
Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, has trailed Mr. Romney among Catholics in 10 of the 12 states in which Edison Research conducted exit polls that asked about religion.
With two exceptions, he has lost the Catholic vote by a minimum of 7 percentage points (in Michigan, where Mr. Romney grew up) and by as much as 53 percentage points in Massachusetts, where Mr. Romney was governor. He has even lost among Catholics in the South, although he was nearly tied with Mr. Romney among Catholics in Tennessee and won decisively among Catholics in Louisiana.
In most of the primary contests, whether he has won or lost, Mr. Santorum has been buoyed by the support of evangelical Protestants. He has done best in states with substantial evangelical populations and they have become his most reliable base, along with some Tea Party supporters and those who call themselves very conservative.
In fact, many voters are unaware of his religion. A Pew survey this month found that only 42 percent of Catholic Republicans knew that Mr. Santorum was Catholic. At the same time, 11 percent of Catholic Republicans and 35 percent of white evangelical Republicans said they thought he was an evangelical.
''There's an intensity to his statements, and to the subjects he discusses -- the rise of secularism, the criticism of people of faith in the public square -- that's often associated with evangelicals,'' said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who studies religious voting patterns.
Analysts see many reasons for Mr. Santorum's lagging among Catholic Republican voters, the main one being that Catholics, who make up about a quarter of the total electorate, are not monolithic and are more representative of the electorate as a whole.
''There is no Catholic vote, per se,'' said Catherine E. Wilson, a political scientist at Villanova University. ''They mirror the general population, with progressives, moderates and conservatives. And Santorum is winning the conservatives.''
In 1960, Catholics voted overwhelmingly for John F. Kennedy. But in 2004, when Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts became the first Catholic nominee since Kennedy, he lost the Catholic vote to President George W. Bush, a born-again Christian.
In 2008, President Obama won the Catholic vote over the Republican candidate, John McCain. This year, Dr. Green said, Catholics appear likely to be divided again, with conservatives voting for the Republican nominee, liberals voting for Mr. Obama and the moderates ''up for grabs.''
So far, Mr. Romney, who has emphasized the economy, has been more successful in winning Catholics over than Mr. Santorum, who has emphasized social, cultural and religious issues.
An important indicator of voting preference is how often someone attends church. Those who attend at least once a week tend to be more conservative than those who attend occasionally. But only about one-third of Catholics who responded to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll said they attended church weekly.
Mr. Santorum was asked last week by Sandy Rios, a Fox News contributor hosting a program on American Family Radio, to explain why he was not winning more Catholic voters.
He said he did not understand it himself -- ''I really wish I could tell you,'' he said -- but he said he thought it might correlate with church attendance.
''With folks who do practice their religion more ardently,'' he said, ''I tend to do well.''
Joan Leon, 71, a retired nurse who voted for Mr. Santorum in Louisiana's primary, would certainly qualify as an ardent Catholic. She attends church every day. Her chief concern is abortion -- she strongly opposes it.
Mrs. Leon braved a raging storm, floods and a tornado watch last week to see Mr. Santorum when he visited Mandeville, near her home. She said he was ''the most pro-life candidate,'' though she also liked his experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee and his support for more oil drilling.
But most Catholics disagree with Mr. Santorum on various issues, according to recent New York Times/CBS News national polls. A majority have used artificial birth control and few attend weekly Mass. Most support either same-sex civil unions or marriage, and only a few would prohibit abortions altogether.
In his unsuccessful bid for re-election to the Senate in 2006, Mr. Santorum also lost the Catholic vote, by 18 percentage points. He was running against Robert P. Casey Jr., also a Catholic.
Mr. Santorum's faith-related comments have sometimes caused an uproar, as they did last month when he said he wanted to ''throw up'' after reading John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech asserting that the separation between church and state be absolute. Even Mr. Santorum, rarely one to back off a pronouncement, said he wished he had not used that language, but he stuck by his point, that people who try to express their faith in the public square are unwelcome and even persecuted. The comment may have played a role in his narrow loss in Michigan, the first state to vote after he made it.
Dr. Wilson at Villanova said that by talking about matters of faith so often, Mr. Santorum appeared to be ''more preacher than presidential contender,'' which can make Catholics, among others, uncomfortable.
''People want politicians to have faith,'' she said, ''but they don't necessarily want to be hearing about it all the time.''
A Pew study last week confirmed that view, showing that more voters than ever want less religious talk from politicians. It was the first time since Pew started asking that question a decade ago that more people said there had been too much religious expression from politicians, not too little.
When he ran for president in 2008, Mr. Romney felt compelled to address fears that the Mormon Church would guide his policies. But this year, he has barely mentioned the subject. While some evangelicals remain suspicious of Mormons, Catholics like Mrs. Willauer of Annapolis say they have no problem with it.
''Because Governor Romney is Mormon, a family man, I don't take issue with his religion,'' Mrs. Willauer said. ''I don't know how the pope would feel about that, but we're all modified Catholics these days anyhow.''

HEADLINE: New Rules Are Pending On Emissions

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and JUSTIN GILLIS; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After months of delay, the Obama administration is about to unveil the first federal standards to explicitly limit greenhouse-gas emissions from new electric power plants -- one of the chief sources of carbon dioxide emissions linked to climate change.
According to people briefed by the Environmental Protection Agency, all existing plants -- including the 300 or so coal-fired power plants that now release the highest level of these emissions and yet-to-be-built plants that have already received E.P.A. permits -- will be grandfathered in at current levels, meaning they are exempt from the new proposed rule. 
Under the new rule, expected to be announced this week, new power plants will have to emit no more than 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of energy produced. That standard permits the level of emissions achieved by natural gas-fired plants of the type generally built in the last few years, but would be too strict for almost all coal-fired power plants if they were not exempted. A new natural gas plant produces a little less than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. A coal plant produces about 1,800 pounds.
A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose details ahead of the announcement said, ''This standard provides a clear and certain path forward for industry and the important domestic energy sources they rely on, including natural gas, as well as clean coal technologies that lower carbon emissions. These sources will continue to be a part of our energy future, and what we have proposed is in line with the steps industry is already taking.''
The White House official explained that the goal of the rule is to hasten the introduction of carbon controls on new coal-fired power plants, while not causing immediate economic harm from the shutdown of existing plants. The rule is certain to face stiff challenges in Congress and the courts.
Washington insiders, environmentalists and state regulators who have followed the course of the Obama administration's stutter-step approach to greenhouse gas regulations were both pleased that a rule was about to be proposed and disappointed by its apparent lack of teeth regarding existing polluters.
Ian Bowles, the former secretary of energy and environmental affairs in Massachusetts, had a mixed reaction to the news of the rule.
''I'm glad to see President Obama moving forward in the face of critics who seem to have forgotten that the Supreme Court has ruled E.P.A. must regulate greenhouse gas emissions,'' he said, but added, ''I'm a bit surprised existing power plants are left harmless, but the reality is cheap natural gas is doing more to curtail coal use than any regulation would have in the near term.''
Some, like Paul Bledsoe, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that the regulation gave new impetus to the shift to natural gas as the electric power industry's fuel of choice. Coal plants are facing other new environmental mandates that could make them even less competitive economically, he said.
''The impact in the next decade is expected to be relatively minor,'' he said.
The coal industry, whose conservative Congressional allies have painted the E.P.A. as an overzealous regulator holding back the economy, was unhappy with the news of the proposal. They have repeatedly criticized the idea of setting limits by regulation when Congress refused to set similar limits by legislation.
But the agency had little choice after it followed the Supreme Court's directive to make a decision on whether carbon dioxide was a pollutant. In 2009, the agency declared that it should be classified as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.
On Monday night, Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said, ''The rule from our standpoint is a big mistake.'' He added, ''It is virtually calculated to drive coal, a very, very affordable generator of electricity, out of the U.S. electricity market.''
The most promising technology for controlling greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants involves isolating the carbon dioxide before it leaves the smokestack and then storing it underground -- a process known as ''carbon capture and storage.'' Carbon capture and storage is not being done on a commercial scale anywhere in the world.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges China to Restrain North Korea as He Praises South's Successes

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
SEOUL, South Korea -- President Obama took North Korea's untested new leader, Kim Jong-un, to task on Monday, demanding that China curb his belligerent behavior and declaring that South Korea's economic and democratic achievements would inevitably triumph over the failure and isolation of the North.
In a blunt, 90-minute meeting with China's president, Hu Jintao, before a nuclear security summit meeting here, Mr. Obama pressed the Chinese leader to use his influence over North Korea to stop it from proceeding with a satellite launching next month, a White House official said. 
Mr. Obama was clearly stung by the announcement of the impending satellite launching, which the United States has said will be a breach of North Korea's international obligations, and which came only 17 days after the Obama administration had tentatively agreed to send desperately needed food aid to the country.
But the president, the senior official said, was also latching on to the change in leadership in Pyongyang to try to break what Mr. Obama called a long cycle of provocations that were rewarded by countries anxious to ease tensions with an erratic nuclear-armed state.
''We need to have a serious conversation with the North Koreans where they understand that we're going to do things differently in the future,'' said the senior official, the deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes.
Mr. Hu told the president that China shared his concern about the satellite launching and had conveyed that to North Korea, Mr. Rhodes said. But Mr. Hu appeared to be surprised by the vehemence of Mr. Obama's message, senior officials said.
In that meeting, as well as an earlier one with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, Mr. Obama was trying to nudge two countries that have been the greatest impediments to more aggressive action against North Korea, Iran and Syria, where a bloody crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad against his opponents is now nearly 13 months old.
Mr. Obama's meetings had a valedictory feel. It was Mr. Medvedev's last session with him before being replaced by Russia's president-elect, Vladimir V. Putin. And it may be one of the last times Mr. Obama meets with Mr. Hu or President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, both of whose terms expire next year.
Still, the president's mind seemed most fixed on a young man whom he has never met: Kim Jong-un, the new leader of North Korea, who assumed power on the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December.
Mr. Obama, speaking to 400 students at a foreign affairs university here, challenged Mr. Kim and his subordinates to give up their belligerent behavior and ''have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea.''
The president spoke at length about a potential future reunification of the Korean Peninsula, describing the Koreans as ''one people,'' and saying that ''if just given the chance, if given their freedom, Koreans in the North are capable of great progress as well.''
Mr. Obama, who held the first nuclear security summit meeting in 2010, offered a report card on his campaign to prod countries to curb the spread of nuclear material and reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism.
But the most noteworthy elements of his speech were his admiration for South Korea and criticism of its estranged northern neighbor, which has barraged the South with threats.
Addressing Pyongyang directly, Mr. Obama said, ''Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek; they have undermined it.''
The United States, he said, bore North Korea no ''hostile intent.'' But if the country did not change course, he said, it would face ''more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.''
Drawing an analogy to the once-divided Germany, Mr. Obama spoke of his visit to the demilitarized zone on Sunday, where he peered into a country whose leaders, he said, are willing to allow their people to starve. The two Koreas, he said, will inevitably be reunified.
When they are, Mr. Obama said to applause, ''change will unfold that once seemed impossible. And checkpoints will open and watchtowers will stand empty, and families long separated will finally be reunited. And the Korean people, at long last, will be whole and free.''
Mr. Obama, who noted that he had visited Seoul three times as president -- more than any other foreign capital -- sprinkled his speech with Korean phrases and references to Korean social media services.
There was no immediate reaction from Pyongyang to Mr. Obama's remarks. The North's state-run Korea Central News Agency's Web site was monopolized Monday by dispatches about grief-stricken North Koreans participating in ceremonies observing the 100-day mourning period for Kim Jong-il.
Turning to the issue of nuclear security, Mr. Obama hailed successes like Georgia and Moldova, where authorities seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers. He praised Ukraine, which announced it had moved all highly enriched uranium out of the country.
The killing of Osama bin Laden and the crippling of Al Qaeda, the president said, meant that ''a terrorist organization that has actively sought nuclear weapons is now on the path to defeat.''
But Mr. Obama acknowledged unfinished business, notably with North Korea and Iran, with whom the West, supported by Russia and China, is preparing to hold another round of talks over its nuclear program. ''There is time to solve this diplomatically,'' he said, ''but time is short.''
The president said he remained committed to the goal he set in a speech in Prague in 2009: A world without nuclear weapons. The United States, he added, had a ''unique responsibility to act.''
''I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side.''

HEADLINE: Bosman and the Champions League: Win-Win

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new study concludes that the Bosman ruling in the mid-1990s has helped transform the UEFA Champions League into one of the most, if not the most, compelling soccer tournaments in the world. 

 BODY:
On Dec. 15, 1995, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the Belgian player Jean Marc Bosman, by all accounts of journeyman of little previous note, had been unlawfully barred from changing teams when his contract with R.F.C. Lige in the Belgian first division expired after the 1990 season. The court's ruling unleashed a kind of free agency for European Union players that had been unknown previously under a system that was somewhat akin to baseball's reserve clause.
The decision also barred European Union clubs, and UEFA, from imposing quotas on players from other E.U. countries. At the time, UEFA barred clubs in its top continental competitions from fielding teams with more than three nondomestic players. From that point on, quotas could only apply to players from outside E.U. countries.
Contrary to so many predictions, and the insistence even now that the Bosman ruling has skewed power to top clubs like Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and others, the study entitled "The Effects of the Bosman Ruling on National and Club Teams in Europe," which was published by the Journal of Sports Economics (the complete report is available for download free until April 30), found those assertions to be unfounded. The authors did, however, discover that the biggest impact of Bosman has been to turn the Champions League "into a master competition watched around the world," Binder said.
While the authors discuss -- and generally debunk -- Bosman myths having to do with the dominance of a few clubs in their domestic leagues and the effects on national teams, they assert that the ruling's biggest effect has been on the Champions League -- and that the effect has been nothing but positive.
"The Champions League has been dominated by a few clubs, that is clear in our data, and might be clear to the naked eye," Binder, a fan of all soccer in Germany, especially Bayern Munich, said in a telephone interview. "It definitely shows up dramatically. Post-Bosman there's been a creation of super teams -- the Chelseas, Barcelonas, Real Madrids -- and it's not just the 11 on the field, but the 20 guys on the roster are all top-flight players drawn from all over the world.
"Pre-Bosman, with the old nationality restrictions at the club level, that couldn't happen. It's what sports economics call competitive balance, and yes, at the top of the Champions League, a small number of clubs have dominated."
"Is that necessarily bad?" he said. "It's what has made the Champions League this master competition watched around the world. It's sold soccer in Asia and North America, a World Cup at the club level every year. It's the highest form of the art being shown with the best players from around the world.
"You have to take it all together. Oh in my country, the national team got weaker, so Bosman is bad. But the Champions League got stronger and it has been good for soccer in many ways. It's been a very, very good thing for soccer. It's been great for growth of game."
Some of the other key findings (the study's findings are based on data through 2007):
 Binder said: "There are a lot of people in Europe who might have thought Bosman is destroying soccer. But there's been no dramatic effect on national teams or domestic leagues in any form. We don't think there's been a really bad negative effect as been predicted."
 Why all the negativity? Binder said: "A lot of it stems from England; they have a particular sort of monkey on their backs. It's no lie they gave the world the game, but only won one World Cup. But the idea their national team has been hurt just isn't borne out by all the results. Only in results from the big games."
 On the impact on other national teams, Binder said: "The country most impacted, looking at the data, was Sweden. But when you look at single countries, it could be anything. A great generation, like in Hungary in the 1950s. A resurgent Germany because of its technical program. Great players in Spain. There's little bit of randomness in the world."
There is a lot more in the report, especially as it pertains to the notion of stratification in some of Europe's top domestic leagues. And while most fans are familiar with the lament that England's Premier League is dominated by four or five clubs, the report states that "in England, most teams have improved by adding foreign players since the Bosman ruling, not just the teams at the top, and therefore the poor have not necessarily gotten poorer."
From the report's conclusion:
"Imported players have gone to a variety of clubs, not just the top teams, largely preserving the competitiveness of the various leagues. The clubs have become more stratified across countries with teams from the Big Six (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands) more heavily dominating the Champions League, since the decision in Bosman. The free flow of players has, however, turned the Champions League, and some domestic leagues, into virtual super leagues, showcasing a number of all-star teams, which also has greatly increased interest in the game worldwide."
Lots of food for thought. Take a look at the complete report. It is an eye-opener. Academics and soccer ... perfect together!

HEADLINE: Kazakhstan's Capital, Outside and In

BYLINE: KERRI MACDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: "Astana's Winter Urbanscape" juxtaposes the frosty exterior of Kazakhstan's capital city with an alternate seasonal reality indoors. 

 BODY:
Astana, Kazakhstan's young and gleaming capital, has quickly become known for its space-age look: vibrant, toylike buildings pop against the frosty landscape. It is, as Rowan Moore wrote for The Observer in Britain, "a rare but persistent type, the capital from zero."
The photographer Ikuru Kuwajima, who moved to Kazakhstan in late 2010, saw something else in the city, a remote and frigid town on the northern steppe. (He felt it, too: Astana is the world's second-coldest capital city.)
His project, "Astana's Winter Urbanscape," juxtaposes the city's frosty exterior with an alternate seasonal reality he found indoors.
Kazakhstan's leader Nursultan Nazarbayev moved the country's capital in the late 1990s to Astana, formerly called Akmola (and before that, Tselinograd) from its largest city, Almaty. Already, the city is adorned with new buildings, mostly on the left side of the river. "On the right side of the river," Mr. Kuwajima said, "you see lots of Soviet apartments."
Yet it is the new development in all of its Jetsons-like splendor that caught his eye. Like Bayterek Tower, a structure built to resemble a poplar tree more than 300 feet tall and topped with a mythological egg, designed by Nazarbayev (). Or Khan Shatyr, which holds shopping and entertainment sites, including an indoor beach ().
Mr. Kuwajima sought to contrast the plastic newness of the capital - into which the government is putting money and time, investing in new construction, new heating systems - with the cold reality of outdoor Astana. "If you go inside, you see lots of summer things - summer-themed," Mr. Kuwajima said. "You can see that they are wishing for warm beach resort in Thailand or India."
Mr. Kuwajima, 27, grew up in Japan and has been based in Kazakhstan, an oil-rich former Soviet republic, since he moved there in late 2010. He studied in Missouri before moving to Romania, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. "I think Kazakhstan is really similar to Ukraine," he said, referring to the similarities between the two former Soviet countries.
He focuses his personal work on Central Asia. Since June 2011, he has also been working on "In the Solitude of Horizons," a story about an anti-rocket missile testing range halfway between Almaty, where he lives, and Astana. Known as the Sary-Shagan Polygon, it was once host to Soviet military personnel and their families. Most residents left after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, abandoning homes and buildings and leaving a trail of economic and infrastructural difficulties.
"The area was once the last hope of the Soviet Union," Mr. Kuwajima wrote, "but now it is surrounded by quiet horizons and abandoned buildings scattered around in the desolate steppe."

HEADLINE: Baby Boomers' Confidence Dented by Recession

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: People born from 1946 to 1964 are much less optimistic about their financial future, a survey has found. 

 BODY:
The last five years have been tough on Americans' financial confidence, particularly among baby boomers thought of as upbeat and affluent, a new survey has found.
Roughly half of people born from 1946 to 1964, known as baby boomers, say they are optimistic about the country's financial future, down from about two-thirds in 2007, a survey from the financial services firm Ameriprise found. And just 17 percent say they are "very optimistic" about their personal financial future, down from 39 percent five years ago. 
Ameriprise commissioned the research company GfK to do the survey, which was conducted by telephone in December and included 1,006 affluent people born in the 18-year period, as well as 300 parents and 300 adult children of the group. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points, and 6 percentage points for the survey of the boomers' parents and children.
The first version of the survey was done in the spring of 2007, when, Ameriprise noted, the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent. It was 8.5 percent in December, when the latest survey was conducted.
The group born from 1946 to 1964 reported significant drops in their confidence in a number of areas, including their ability to assure a secure future for themselves and their family, to continue their current lifestyle in retirement, to help their children or grandchildren pay for college and to support a charity that's important to them.
Their children also indicated that they were less confident about their financial future. A quarter, for instance, said they were very confident that they can help their children pay for their education, down from almost half five years ago.

HEADLINE: A Counterfeiting Conspiracy?

BYLINE: BEN TARNOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A Philadelphia shopkeeper causes problems for the Confederacy. 

 BODY:
In March 1862, an unusual ad began appearing in Northern newspapers. Among the shops selling pianos and patent medicines, sheet music and sewing machines, this one stood out: it promised "perfect fac-similes" of Confederate currency. There were seven kinds of notes for sale, and testimonials from The New York Tribune and others praising the replicas for their high quality and low prices. Five cents bought you one. Two dollars bought a hundred. Fifteen dollars bought a thousand. The word "counterfeits" never appeared. These were "Mementos of the Rebellion," sold by a Philadelphia shopkeeper named Samuel Curtis Upham. 
Upham didn't look like a counterfeiter. He didn't hide out in the woods or perform daring jailbreaks. He didn't run from the police. He was a respectable small-business owner and devoted Northern patriot. He ran a store that sold stationery, newspapers and cosmetics. But he was also an entrepreneur with an eye for easy profit, and the Civil War offered the business opportunity of a lifetime: the ability to forge money without breaking the law. Confederate currency, issued by a government that was emphatically not recognized by the Union, had no legal status in the North, which meant Upham could sell his "fac-similes" with impunity. 
Over the next 18 months he built the most notorious counterfeiting enterprise of the Civil War - one that also happened to be perfectly legal. His forgeries flooded the South, undermining the value of the Confederate dollar and provoking enraged responses from Southern leaders. He waged war on the enemy's currency, serving his pocketbook and his country at the same time.
Upham first got the idea the month before, on Feb. 24, 1862. That day, customers kept coming into his shop to buy The Philadelphia Inquirer. Puzzled, he asked one of them what made that particular edition so popular. The answer was on the front page: the Inquirer's editors had printed a copy of a five-dollar Confederate note. Philadelphians had never seen Rebel money before and were fascinated by it. 
Upham saw a chance to cash in. He raced to the Inquirer's offices, bought the plate of the note, and printed 3,000 copies on French letter paper. They sold extremely well. Along the bottom of each bill, he included a thin strip that read, in small print, "Fac-simile Confederate Note," with his name and address. The tags could easily be clipped off, transforming the "fac-simile" into an excellent counterfeit.
After his first print run, Upham rapidly expanded his inventory. He took out ads in newspapers, promising to pay in gold for more specimens of Southern money. At first, it seemed possible that he sincerely thought of his reproductions as souvenirs. In early 1862, most Northerners still expected the war to be brief and glorious. They wanted "mementos of the Rebellion" before the Union crushed it. By the time Upham launched his publicity campaign in March, however, his business had clearly evolved from a modest retail operation into a high-volume wholesaling enterprise. No one needed 1,000 souvenirs: people were clearly using his products for a less innocent purpose. 
By April, Upham's fakes began appearing in Richmond, the Confederate capital. They caused a sensation at the Confederate Treasury Department, and a Treasury officer persuaded the editors of the Richmond Daily Dispatch to inform the public about the new threat. "This note is well calculated to deceive, and in nearly every particular is a fac-simile of the original," they wrote, condemning the forgeries as "Yankee scoundrelism." In May, the Dispatch discovered one of Upham's notes with the margin bearing his name and address still attached. "Who is this man Upham?" they asked. "A knave swindler, and forger of the most depraved and despicable sort."
By then, Upham had grown his business considerably. In an advertisement published in late May, he claimed to have sold half a million notes in the past three months. He now offered 14 varieties of Confederate notes, postage stamps, and "shinplasters" - fractional bills worth anywhere from 5 to 15 cents - and printed his fakes on real banknote paper. Ingeniously, he even fulfilled orders through the mail. For 50 cents, plus 18 cents for postage, customers throughout the Union could have a hundred of Upham's notes delivered. 
Southerners responded with outrage. They became convinced that Upham belonged to a covert Union plot to devalue the Confederate dollar. For the Philadelphia shopkeeper to be able to advertise his counterfeits openly and send them through the mail meant the authorities must have given him permission or, possibly, material support. Moreover, Union troops spent counterfeit Confederate cash in large quantities - evidence of "a deep laid scheme on the part of the thieving, counterfeiting North to undermine the Confederate currency," in the eyes of the Daily Richmond Examiner. 
In the summer of 1862, Upham's notes inundated northern Virginia, brought by Union forces marching south from Washington. A Southern journalist observed men "fortified with exhaustless quantities of Philadelphia Confederate notes," which they used to buy everything from horses to sugar to tobacco. When one of the soldiers ended up a prisoner in Richmond, the Confederates found one of Upham's advertisements on him. The shopkeeper's counterfeits appeared "wherever an execrable Yankee soldier polluted the soil with his cloven foot," fumed the Richmond Daily Dispatch. 
By the summer of 1862, as fake cash flowed across the border in ever greater quantities, the Confederate leadership took notice. On Aug. 18, President Jefferson Davis discussed the threat in a message to the Confederate Congress. Counterfeit Confederate notes were "publicly advertised for sale" and furnished to "the soldiers of the invading army" with the full "complicity" of the Union government, Davis declared. Later that day, Confederate Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger submitted a report to the House of Representatives that reiterated Davis's concerns and singled out Upham's role in the crisis: "[P]rinted advertisements have been found stating that the counterfeit notes, in any quantity, will be forwarded by mail from Chestnut street, in Philadelphia." By then, forged bills had been found far from the Union border, in Atlanta, Savannah, Montgomery and other cities of the Deep South. There was "no means of knowing to what extent they have been circulated," the Richmond Daily Dispatch warned.
Hamstrung by a disorganized government and mounting logistical challenges, the Confederacy couldn't stanch the surge of counterfeit currency. Despite Southern claims, however, it's unlikely that the Union government ever actively promoted the forging of Confederate money. Federal authorities most likely found it easier to ignore the forging of Southern bills than to take a position either for or against it. They certainly never interfered with Upham, who freely continued forging Confederate cash until August 1863. By that time, the value of the Southern dollar had fallen so low that it was hardly worth counterfeiting. During the 18 months that Upham operated his venture, the purchasing power of the Confederate dollar disintegrated. Between February 1862 and August 1863, the value of Confederate paper money fell by ninety percent.
Upham wasn't the only reason behind this collapse. Fake cash plagued the Confederacy from the beginning, supplied by Northern and Southern counterfeiting gangs. Gross mismanagement of Southern finances led to runaway inflation, which posed an even greater danger to the Confederate dollar. But Upham's impact was significant. He later estimated that he had produced $15 million worth of Confederate bills. If all of that ended up in the South, it would have made up almost 3 percent of the total money supply - a large amount for a single counterfeiter. In March 1862, his business had only just begun. Over the next year and a half, he would become one of the strangest success stories of the Civil War: a legal counterfeiter, driven by patriotism and personal gain, who struck at the financial heart of the Confederacy from the safety of downtown Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Britain's Experience in Raising the Top Tax Rate

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: When Britain raised the income tax rate on the wealthy, it produced less revenue than had been anticipated, as people shifted income in anticipation of the changes, but how such a step might play in the United States is uncertain, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The British government announced last week that it was reducing the top income tax rate to 45 percent from 50 percent, effective April 1, 2013. The top rate was raised to 50 percent from 40 percent two years ago, but failed to raise nearly as much revenue as expected. The experience may shed some light on the possible effects of raising the top rate in the United States.
In November 2008, the Labor government announced plans to raise the top rate to 45 percent beginning in April 2011 from 40 percent, where it had been for 20 years. In its 2009 budget, the government announced an increase in the top rate to 50 percent, effective April 6, 2010.
The higher rate affected taxpayers with incomes above 150,000 (about $238,000), which is roughly the top 1 percent, or about 300,000 individuals. The increase was expected to yield about 2.5 billion a year of net additional revenue and raise the share of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent to 27.7 percent from 25 percent.

The original revenue estimate included an assumption that about two-thirds of the gross revenue yield would be lost because of behavioral effects. That is, the amount of revenue that would be collected with no change in behavior, like reducing hours worked or engaging in additional tax avoidance, would be two-thirds larger.
In May 2010, there was a general election in Britain, and a coalition government led by the Conservative Party took control. In its 2011 budget, the government announced that the Treasury would study the impact of the new higher tax rate before recommending changes, and that study was published last week.
The study concluded that the behavioral effect of raising the top rate was much more powerful than anticipated. Two factors in particular had a large effect on revenues.
There was a timing effect. People moved income that they anticipated receiving forward so it would be taxed before the new higher rate took effect. They also postponed the receipt of income into the future in anticipation of a change in the tax rate after the election of a new government.
Also, because the British top rate had increased above that in all other major countries except Japan, many Britons relocated in reaction. For example, 1,379 people in high-income occupations moved to Switzerland in 2010, a 29 percent increase over the previous year.
Keep in mind that while the United States taxes its citizens and resident aliens wherever they live, the British are taxed only in the country where they are living.
Taking account of the much greater behavioral impact from the higher top rate than anticipated, Treasury economists concluded that the cost of reducing the top rate to 45 percent from 50 percent was negligible in terms of revenue - about 100 million a year.
Note that the behavioral response is positive when rates are reduced. All the effects that reduce revenue when tax rates are raised are reversed, thus recoupling revenue lost from the rate reduction. British Treasury economists estimate that 97 percent of the static revenue loss will be recouped. In short, this appears to be a case in which a tax cut literally pays for itself.
It's important to remember that this experience may be exceptional. In particular, because of the importance of income-shifting, the short-term effect of tax-rate changes may have been much larger than the long-term effect, exaggerating the behavioral response.
We saw this in the United States in 1992, when many taxpayers anticipated an increase in rates by the Clinton administration and brought forward income from 1993. For example, on Dec. 2, 1992, The New York Times reported that senior executives of Disney sold $200 million in stock, citing "the strong likelihood of impending tax legislation" for their actions.
However, in the longer term, the 1993 tax increase in the United States, which raised the top rate to 39.6 percent from 31 percent, did raise substantial additional revenue. It's possible that had the higher British tax rate been allowed to continue, it, too, would have raised more revenue than the estimates shown in the table.
It is difficult to say to what extent the recent British experience is relevant to the United States. The Congressional Budget Office projects that raising the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, and other tax increases scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 under current law, will raise federal revenues as a share of the gross domestic product to 20 percent over the next five years from 17.7 percent if current tax cuts are extended.
But a March 20 analysis from Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that implementation of the so-called Buffett rule, which would require those making $1 million or more a year to pay an effective federal income tax rate of at least 30 percent, would raise only $46.7 billion over the next 10 years. That's a drop in the bucket compared with the $41.2 trillion in federal revenues expected to be collected under current law.
It may well be that raising the top income tax rate is not the best way to raise additional revenue from the wealthy, although recent estimates show that the revenue-maximizing top rate in the United States might be as high as 83 percent. Limiting tax deductions for the wealthy might be more effective.
Whatever we do, we should try to learn as much as possible from the experience of other nations. The research in the British Treasury study would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Mandate's Impact May Be Limited, Report Says

BYLINE: KEVIN SACK


HIGHLIGHT: If the insurance requirement in the health care act is upheld, only 7 percent of the nonelderly population would be forced to purchase new coverage or pay a penalty, according to new research. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - In legal terms, the issue before the Supreme Court on Tuesday could not be more momentous. The court's ruling on the constitutionality of the health care law's requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance may define the boundaries of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce for generations.
But if upheld, the insurance requirement's impact on average citizens may be surprisingly limited, according to new research by the Urban Institute for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The study found that if put in place today, the insurance mandate would force only 18.2 million Americans - 7 percent of the nonelderly population - to buy new health coverage (or pay an income tax penalty for noncompliance). The other 93 percent either already have health insurance or would fall under various exemptions included in the law.
"In short, the vast majority of those potentially subject to the individual mandate have coverage today and will not obtain a different type of coverage post-reform," the study concluded.
The report is a snapshot in time and does not account for steadily declining rates of private insurance in recent years or potential changes in eligibility for cash-strapped government insurance programs like Medicare.

Using a simulation model based on 2011 data, the researchers concluded that a third of the United States population under 65 would be exempt from the law's provisions, primarily because they fall beneath income thresholds. Other exemptions are available for Native Americans, those with religious objections and those who can demonstrate economic hardship. Nearly three-fourths of those who would be exempt already have health coverage of some kind, according to the study
Of the remaining 181 million nonelderly Americans (the elderly are almost universally covered by Medicare), 86 percent are estimated to have health coverage now. Almost all would be expected to continue to have coverage once the health care act is fully carried out in 2014, when the insurance mandate takes effect.
Of the 18.2 million uninsured people who would be required to buy coverage under the mandate, nearly 11 million would be eligible for subsidized premiums offered through health insurance exchanges that would be established in 2014. That would leave 7.3 million people - 3 percent of the nonelderly population - who would be required by the mandate to buy coverage at full cost or pay a penalty.

HEADLINE: Arbitron Agrees to Improve How It Counts Minority Radio Listeners

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: To settle a lawsuit in California, the company said it would change how it recruited the people whose listening habits determine radio ratings. 

 BODY:
Arbitron, the largest radio ratings service, has settled a lawsuit in California over how it measures minority audiences, agreeing to pay $400,000 and to abide by certain research methods in tracking black and Latino radio listeners.
The agreement, announced on Monday, settles a suit filed last week by the attorney general of California, who was joined by the city attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The suit contended that Arbitron undercounted minority audiences in how it recruited people to use its Portable People Meter, an electronic device that it introduced in 2008 to measure radio listening habits.
Recalling an earlier lawsuit in New York and New Jersey, the California suit asserted that Arbitron's method of relying on landline telephones to find users of its metering devices left out many minority households and that stations serving blacks and Latinos suffered lower ratings as a result. 
Arbitron agreed in the settlement to reach listeners by address and make other steps to represent minority groups. It will also pay $150,000 each to the State of California and the City of Los Angeles, and $100,000 to the City and County of San Francisco.
"This settlement ensures that California's diverse audiences will be fully counted by Arbitron's ratings systems and that broadcasters serving these communities will have the opportunity to compete fairly in the marketplace," Kamala D. Harris, the California attorney general, said in a statement.
Arbitron said in a statement that "the agreement is not an admission of fault or concession of liability or wrongdoing."
In the New York and New Jersey case, filed in late 2008 and settled in early 2009, several minority-oriented radio stations made similar complaints that the Personal People Meter did not adequately count young black and Hispanic audiences.

HEADLINE: March 27, 1958 | Nikita Khrushchev Consolidates Power and Becomes Soviet Premier

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On March 27, 1958, Nikita Khrushchev became Soviet premier in addition to First Secretary of the Communist Party. 

 BODY:
On March 27, 1958, Nikita Khrushchev became Soviet premier in addition to First Secretary of the Communist Party. The March 28 New York Times wrote, "Mr. Khrushchev has now succeeded to the posts that Stalin had formally combined. He is not only the acknowledged architect of all Soviet foreign and domestic policies but the leader of the disciplined party ranks and the extensive ministerial apparatus that administers and enforces the policies."
Khrushchev, a former metalworker, Red Army commissar, First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party and member of Josef Stalin's Presidium, became First Secretary in 1953, following a six-month power struggle after Stalin's death. In 1956, he denounced Stalin and his totalitarian rule in a secret speech before the party congress. Copies of the speech soon spread through the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc, contributing to anti-Soviet unrest in Poland and Hungary.
The speech ignited anti-Khrushchev sentiment within the Presidium, the term used for the Politiburo, the executive committee that controlled the Soviet government. Three members of the Presidium, Vyacheslav Molotov, Georgi M. Malenkov and Lazar Kaganovich, were nearly able to remove Khrushchev from power in 1957, but Khrushchev, with the help of Georgy Zhukov, the minister of defense, managed to turn the tables and have the three men removed from the Presidium. Khrushchev then had Zhukov dismissed from power and had Nikolai Bulganin, his hand-picked premier, resign so that he could become premier.
Khrushchev remained in power until 1964. During that time, he implemented a campaign of de-Stalinization to make the Soviet Union a less repressive society. He allowed for greater freedom of speech and artistic expression, and freed prisoners of Stalin's reign. He attempted to improve the lives of Soviet citizens through the increased production of consumer goods -- as opposed to Stalin's focus on military production and heavy industry -- and greater cultivation of food, though his agricultural policies were misguided and ineffective.
In contrast with the violent revolutions of Lenin and Stalin, Khrushchev sought to reduce hostility between the Soviet Union and the West. He attempted to promote Communism by displaying the superiority of Soviet technology, like its space program, which put the first satellite and the first man into orbit. However, despite the policy of "peaceful coexistence," Khrushchev also oversaw the buildup of nuclear weapons and had several major incidents with the United States.
In 1960, the Soviets shot down a U.S. spy plane and took the pilot prisoner, prompting a 21-month conflict. Khrushchev scored a propaganda victory by getting President Dwight D. Eisenhower to lie publicly about the spy plane. In 1962, Khrushchev ordered nuclear weapons to Communist Cuba, which initiated the Cuban Missile Crisis, a two-week standoff between Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy. Khrushchev eventually backed down and removed the weapons from Cuba.
The embarrassment of the Cuban Missile Crisis, along with the failures of the agricultural policies and other issues, led to Khrushchev's removal from power in 1964. He spent the rest of his life in obscurity, dying in 1971 of a heart attack.

HEADLINE: Karen Mills, S.B.A. Chief, Takes Reader Questions

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Mills talks microlending, budget cuts, the big banks, and the S.B.A.'s turnaround time. 

 BODY:
Much has changed since Karen Mills, the administrator for the Small Business Administration, first sat down with us back in the fall of 2009. The economy is improving, unemployment is falling, and S.B.A. lending is back to pre-recession levels. Ms. Mills's agency, however, still faces pressing challenges. Fewer S.B.A. loans are reaching the smallest, underserved businesses. And both the agency and the Obama administration are under intense pressure to show that they are creating jobs, even as the White House proposes new cuts to the S.B.A. budget.
Last week, The Agenda sat down with Ms. Mills once more to discuss some of these issues - and to ask her questions submitted by You're the Boss readers. What follows is a condensed version of that conversation. Special thanks to the readers who submitted questions.
Q.
A.
 Our role is to provide access and opportunity. Let's say you are a really good small business, and the banks says the last two years have been a little tough, you don't quite meet my standards, but I'd like to give you the loan. That's when they use the S.B.A. guarantee. And these loans actually perform really well. Our loss rate is really 2 percentage points higher than the average of all losses. So for the risk we are taking, these are people who should get credit but the market is not functioning perfectly. And that is where we step in.
Q.
A.
 We have a streamlined loan application now really for everyone - we want everybody to be able to do it well. That is why we have Score representatives, that is why we have Small Business Development Centers, and we can help a small business who may not have the experience to prepare a banking package.
Q.
A.
 Our turnaround time for loans is 10 days. The paperwork is actually not very much -- and we have taken it down. Our CapLines program -- which we just redid -- had 46 forms. Now it has eight, and they are optional. What takes the time is the small business preparing the application, answering questions. And that is why I say, go first to one of our counselors -- remember they're free. Spend the time getting yourself ready.
Q.
A.
 I don't think that would be substantiated overall. Banks are working with mostly their own documents. There is not a major set of incremental documents for the S.B.A.
Q.
A.
 Absolutely. For example, in the height of the crisis, when a lot of people were getting turned down by their banks, our North Carolina Small Business Technical Development Center said, "Everybody who's rejected, you come to us, and we will work with you on the bank package." They got 70 percent of them creditworthy. And then when they got before the banker, they had success.
Q.
A.
 We have 120-odd active microlenders all over the country. We put capital into these microlenders and they lend it and they relend it. We give them a very good rate - one, one-and-a-quarter percent - that's a discount off the market rates. They then pick the rate that they make the microloan at, and they set the timing. And the amount of money microlenders have to lend went from around $120 million in 2008 to $340 million now. But in microlending, it's not just the money. They provide an enormous amount of technical assistance. Failure rates for start-ups are high, and the more we can reduce the failure rate, the more jobs we have.
Q.
A.
 What we have done is instead of a silo - like microlending technical assistance only going to microloans - we have created an entire network of our women's centers, which are in these same communities; our Small Business Development Centers; our Score representatives all now linked, leveraged, and aligned on the ground. A small business needs to have seamless access. We want them to walk through any door, whether it's an S.B.A. door, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and find their way to our loan program, find their way to a counselor who can solve the kinds of questions, needs and frustrations that your readers have. So looking at numbers in silos does not necessarily give you the best bang for the taxpayer's buck.
Q.
A.
 That's a great question, because S.B.A. had a record year. We are back to above the 2008 levels of lending in dollars, but there's still a gap, as you point out. Small-dollar loans to under-served communities are not back. The big banks, which made a very large number of the small loans in 2005, 2006, and 2007, withdrew from the market. And now we have to bring them back into the market, and we have to reach into other really viable lenders who will be more in touch with some of these underserved communities. So that is why we gave every partner that we've got on-the-ground access to the S.B.A. guarantees through a program we have called Community Advantage.
Q.
A.
 No. We know why lenders are not making these loans. They pulled back from the small loan market in large numbers during the crisis, because of the risk. And now coming back in, it's just as costly to make a small loan as a big loan. They're coming back in for the big loans first, which are more profitable, and we have pushed them to come back to the small loan market.
Q.
A.
 Well, Congress has worked through a number of these parameters. I wouldn't want you to think that, whatever the parameters in this particular bill, they are going to be the same as they are going to have at the S.B.A. on other things. But a lot of the cost of an I.P.O. is associated with some of the reporting. Small businesses clearly don't have that free cash flow and staff, and there is a fair bit of consensus around the notion of an on-ramp, a middle ground that you can stage these requirements and still give investors adequate information flow.
This works on the very, very high-growth companies. The data shows that some of these high-growth companies add most of their employees after they go public. Instead now, there is a lot of academic documentation about how these same companies are getting bought, and that they don't then grow as individual entities. You have to make sure the door is open for a very, very accelerated growth rate. And that's a public market.

HEADLINE: What Do You Hope to Be Doing the Year After You Graduate From College?

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN

In "Hello, Cruel World," Nathaniel Penn writes:
Graduating seniors at schools like Drew University in Madison, N.J., have felt the stresses of the job market acutely. For all its merits - including a much-admired theater department and a prestigious Wall Street internship program - Drew ranks 94th among 178 national liberal-arts colleges on U.S. News & World Report's annual list. The middle of the collegiate pack is not where you want to be when you're competing for a diminishing number of entry-level jobs.
Members of Drew's Class of '11 are typical of their peers nationally in that their success in the job market seems to have less to do with their G.P.A.'s or their persistence and more to do with their family connections, fields of study, networking skills and luck. How else to account for the unemployed Phi Beta Kappa waiting by a silent phone? Or the anthropology major who is forgoing grad school to become a dog groomer? Or the English major who can't earn enough money to make the monthly payment on her $128,000 student loan? (Drew is unusually expensive; tuition plus room and board run more than $50,000 a year.) Equals on campus, the 309 members of Drew's Class of '11 are already being divided into the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Seven months after graduation, The Times Magazine spoke with 226 of them about their rough journey into the real world. 
17% of our sample of Drew University's Class of 2011 is unemployed. 39% have full-time jobs, including six who have both full- and part-time jobs. 35% of students who are employed part time have two or more jobs. 74% of students who are interning are unpaid. 22% of students are in graduate school. 34% of jobs involve food service, retail, customer service, clerical or unskilled work.
Students: Read what many of the graduates profiled here are doing, then tell us where you hope to be the year after you leave college. Though you should feel free to dream a bit (you can pretend the economy will be much stronger), try to think realistically: what would be a good first job, or role, for you that year? Why? How will it nurture or challenge you, or help you achieve bigger dreams later in your life? What limitations might you have? How do you picture your post-collegiate life in general? For example, where will you live, and with whom?

HEADLINE: Bernanke, the Anti-Garbo

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Ben S. Bernanke's predecessors as head of the Federal Reserve gave speeches and appeared before Congress, but otherwise spoke very little in public. Mr. Bernanke has broken cleanly with that tradition. 

 BODY:
Investors are said to hang on every word spoken by the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, must be testing their patience.
So far this week, Mr. Bernanke has delivered a major address on unemployment and lectured students at George Washington University on the Fed's response to the financial crisis. He is on the cover of the current issue of The Atlantic magazine. An interview with Mr. Bernanke will be broadcast Tuesday night on ABC World News. 
Last week he delivered lectures at George Washington about the history of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday and Thursday, testified before Congress about the European crisis on Wednesday, and gave a brief speech Friday at a conference on central banking.
Previous Fed chairmen gave speeches and appeared before Congress, but otherwise spoke very little in public. Mr. Bernanke has broken cleanly with that tradition, seeking to explain the Fed's mission and methods through a variety of means, including town hall meetings, television interviews and press conferences.
But even by his evolving standards, the last seven days have been extraordinary.

HEADLINE: Quietly, a Budget Deal Is Reached in Albany

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The final spending plan reflected only modest changes from that proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in January. Overall spending will fall for the second straight year, the first time that has happened in at least three decades, according to the governor's office. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - No flash. No sizzle. No last-minute protests, and no late-night dramatics.
This is not how Albany ordinarily works.
But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said that they had agreed to a $132.6 billion budget for the state's next fiscal year, and that they expected lawmakers would formally enact it on Friday, two days before the next fiscal year begins.
The budget is a back-to-basics document at a time when the weak economy has slowed the growth of state revenues.
Mr. Cuomo argued that a plan to expedite repairs to highways and bridges would create jobs in the construction industry. The Senate Republicans were pleased that the budget reduced overall spending and imposed no new taxes. And the Assembly Democrats were happy that it increased state financing for community colleges and housing programs. 
Each side lost some arguments as well. Most notably, Mr. Cuomo was unable to persuade Senate Republicans to support a state health insurance exchange to comply with the health care overhaul championed by President Obama, which is now being challenged in the Supreme Court. Mr. Cuomo said he would seek to resolve the issue with an executive order.
Given the constraints created by a divided Legislature and a down economy, Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers seemed content simply to have come up with a balanced budget without the usual Albany brinkmanship.
The agreed-upon spending plan reflected only modest changes from Mr. Cuomo's proposal in January. It added about $100 million in spending, but it still came out a hair smaller than the budget approved last year, and the governor's office said it had been at least 30 years since the state had reduced overall spending two years in a row.
At a briefing with his cabinet and the news media, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, praised lawmakers for agreeing to "put the politics aside" and approve the budget ahead of schedule. He described it as a "very honest, straightforward document that exhibits the fiscal discipline, fiscal integrity, that we've been talking about."
"What we said to the people of this state 15 months ago was, we're going to bring competence, we're going to bring integrity and we're going to make the government perform," Mr. Cuomo added. "We did last year, and with this budget, we did once again."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had been sharply critical of the way the state budget treated New York City last year, praised this spending plan. He said the city would save nearly $1 billion over the next five years because of a budget provision that would start to shift the burden of increasing Medicaid expenses from county governments and New York City to the state.
"City taxpayers are winners today in Albany," Mr. Bloomberg said. "The components of the budget agreement announced today, taken together with the landmark pension-reform overhaul announced two weeks ago, herald the best legislative session for the city in a decade."
The deal followed an occasionally unseemly but productive period at the Capitol. Two weeks ago, lawmakers approved legislative redistricting maps and a reduction of pension benefits for future public workers. In December, they approved a new top tax bracket for the state's highest earners, nearly halving the projected budget gap.
Of course, Albany being Albany, there were some problems. The legislative process has often taken place in the middle of the night and with little consideration of public input, to the dismay of government watchdog groups and lawmakers in the Legislature's minority caucuses.
But with the budget agreement, officials vowed to be more transparent. They began printing budget bills over the weekend, and, in a break from usual practice, legislative leaders said they would not sidestep a constitutionally mandated three-day waiting period before voting on the bills, to give lawmakers and the public time to read them.
As local governments across New York confront perilous balance sheets, the new budget would leave Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature with a projected gap of about $950 million to address next year - a small amount by Albany standards.
"It's Year 2 of a major turnaround," said Elizabeth Lynam, vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group. The governor, she added, "said going in that the budget was straightforward, and it appears to be where they ended up."
Mr. Cuomo had significant leverage over lawmakers. As he did last year, he effectively told them to accept his budget as proposed or he would impose it using emergency spending bills. He also benefited from the political calendar, as all of the state's legislative seats will be in contention in November, and many incumbents are eager to campaign on a platform that includes being part of a functioning, peaceful, productive state capital.
In statements on Tuesday, legislative leaders were eager to trumpet getting something done. The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said, "We have turned the corner in Albany." And the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said, "By working together, we have made real progress in continuing to rebuild New York's economy."
The budget process was helped along by the fact that the most contentious elements of the state's finances had been addressed before negotiations began. The tax deal in December, which cut rates for the middle class and created the new top bracket, had resolved the most obvious sticking point. And the two largest areas of state spending, education and health care, were given increases of about 4 percent in the new budget under a deal made a year ago when Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature cut spending in those areas.
Mr. Cuomo did not get everything he wanted in the agreement. Lawmakers blocked his plan to shift some of the costs of special education for preschoolers to local school districts. He also agreed to drop a proposal to delay until next year's budget part of a scheduled increase in welfare payments to poor New Yorkers.
The governor had also sought to allocate $250 million of an $805 million increase in education financing through competitive grants; as part of the deal announced on Tuesday, he agreed to halve that sum to $125 million, with the balance to be distributed using a more traditional school-aid formula.

MF Global's Top Lawyer to Break Her Silence | MF Global's top lawyer is expected to break her five-month silence on Wednesday to tell Congress that she was unaware of a gaping shortfall in customer money until hours before the brokerage firm filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31.
Laurie Ferber, MF Global's general counsel, is expected to tell a House panel that she "had no reason to believe" the firm had raided customer accounts to meet its own obligations, according to a copy of her prepared testimony. While Ms. Ferber learned of a shortfall in customer money in the afternoon of Oct. 30, she said she believed it to be an accounting error.
"My impression throughout the afternoon and late into the evening was that the apparent deficit was a reconciliation issue and did not represent an actual shortfall in customer funds," she is expected to tell the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee.
Ms. Ferber, who previously worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Goldman Sachs, is a central figure in the collapse of MF Global and the ensuing hunt for more than $1 billion in missing client money. As legal counsel, she helped oversee attempts to sell MF Global as it careened toward failure, and advised the firm on a dispute over a crucial transfer of money to JPMorgan Chase. DealBook

 DEAL NOTES
Private Jets, Buffett and Taxes | Get this: Uncle Sam is suing Warren E. Buffett's company over taxes, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
The United States government, in a little-followed case in Ohio, filed a lawsuit this month against a unit of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, seeking $366 million in taxes and penalties. The Berkshire division at the center of the suit is NetJets, the private-aircraft company that caters to the nation's wealthiest -- the people Mr. Buffett says should pay more in taxes.
The case is a remarkable window into the nation's byzantine tax code. It is an arcane dispute that raises questions about the Internal Revenue Service's interpretation and enforcement of its own tax rules. And it shows why even someone like Mr. Buffett would seek to challenge them. DealBook

HEADLINE: Before the Law: Understanding the Supreme Court Case on the Affordable Care Act

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Developing a news-style show designed to explain to peers the Supreme Court hearings on the Obama health care law. 

 BODY:
Overview | What are the issues at stake in the Supreme Court challenges to President Obama's health care law? In this lesson, students create a television news segment to inform their school's community about the questions regarding Affordable Health Care Act that are being considered by the Supreme Court. 
Materials | Masking tape, computers with Internet access, projector.
Warm-Up | Before class, lay a piece of masking tape in a line across the classroom floor. 
On the board or on a large piece of paper at one end of the line, post the following statement: "To increase safety and reduce the cost to taxpayers of supporting fire departments, laws should exist mandating that all homeowners own working smoke detectors." At the other end, post the statement: "It is an imposition on individual freedom for the government to require citizens to purchase a product, including smoke detectors. Individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices." 
Inform students that the two statements at either end of the line are opposing arguments. Have students consider the extent to which they agree with one statement or the other, and pick a point on the line that indicates the extent of their agreement. Standing all the way on one end of the line indicates complete agreement with the statement at that end; standing in the middle indicates indecision or the ability to see both sides of the issue. 
Alternatively, to keep students' views private, have them write in their journals about where they fall on the continuum between the two statements, and why.
Ask for volunteers representing different viewpoints to share why they chose to stand where they did, or invite them to offer reasons why people might support one or the other statement or fall somewhere in the middle, regardless of their own views.
Next, ask whether anyone feels convinced by the arguments offered to move elsewhere on the line, or shift where they placed themselves on the continuum. 
Then ask students what it would mean if laws about fire safety reflected the values represented on one side of the line or the other. What would either side mean for fire fighters, for homeowners, for smoke detector manufacturers, for the agencies tasked with enforcing the law, for citizens and for the government? How might these various parties, and others, be affected by how the laws are written and enforced? Brainstorm ideas as a class, taking into account factors like rights and freedoms, politics, costs and more.
Following this activity, inform students that there is a historic case being heard by the Supreme Court that engages with the tension between communal good and individual freedoms. To introduce students to this case, read aloud the first three paragraphs of the Times Topics page on Health Care Reform and the Supreme Court. 
Instead or in addition, show the episode of TimesCast that describes the partisan divide over the health care bill's individual mandate. Invite students to summarize the arguments on both sides and voice questions they have.
Then, lead a brief discussion with the whole group focused on the following questions: What parallels, if any, can you draw between the questions being heard by the court and the questions that we just discussed relating to smoke detectors? How are these cases similar? How are they different? Why is this case important and historic? To what extent are we in control of our own health and safety, and to what extent do we rely on each other and on the law? What are the different views on these questions and on the role of government
Related | In the article "For Justices, a Matter of Framing the Core Issue on Health Care," Adam Liptak - a lawyer who is The New York Times's Supreme Court correspondent - provides an overview of the issues involved in the case being argued in the court on Mr. Obama's health care law:
The Supreme Court on Tuesday is hearing arguments on the central question in the constitutional challenges to President Obama's health care overhaul law. How it answers the question depends in large part on how the justices decide to frame the core issue. 
The law's challengers - 26 states led by Florida, the National Federation of Independent Business and several individuals - present the central question as one of individual liberty. May the federal government, they ask, compel individuals not engaged in commerce to buy a product, here health insurance, from private companies?
The Obama administration, by contrast, urges the court to answer a different question. May Congress decide, in fashioning a comprehensive response to a national crisis in the health care market, to regulate how people pay for the health care they will almost inevitably need?
However the questions are ultimately framed, the Supreme Court's answers will be grounded in the text of two provisions of the Constitution and in the precedents interpreting them. 
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
What are the ways the two sides in the case are framing the core issue at stake?
        
In what texts will the Supreme Court's response to the arguments be based?
        
What is the commerce clause of the Constitution?
        
What were the main arguments made by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., representing the federal government, and Paul D. Clement, representing 26 states challenging the law?
        
After reading this article, what more do you need to know before you can make a decision about whether the health care law should be upheld or struck down by the Supreme Court? 
Activity | Explain to the students that they will be creating an episode of a television news show designed to inform their school community about the Supreme Court challenge to Mr. Obama's health care law. 
Split the class into five groups, and assign each group one segment of the show to develop. (If desired and if the necessary technology is available, you might actually produce and film the show, as well as show it to the school audience.) 
Here is a suggested breakdown for the show's segments.
Segment 1: Introduction and overview

        
Introduce the show.
        
Provide a brief history of Mr. Obama's health care law, including its main provisions, reasons why people support and oppose it, and what most Americans think about it.
        
Introduce the Supreme Court case about the act.
        
Explain why the court case is historic and important.
Segment 2: Is it too early to consider this case? 

        
Introduce this question being heard by the court.
        
Present the arguments on both sides of the question of whether it is too early to consider the case.
        
Explain how the court will decide on this question: the laws, precedents and constitutional provisions that are at issue.
        
Explain what happens next depending on which side wins this argument.
Segment 3: Is the individual mandate unconstitutional? 

        
Introduce this central question being heard by the court.
        
Explain the individual mandate, or the minimum coverage provision, and its history.
        
Present the arguments on both sides of the question of whether the individual mandate is constitutional. 
        
Explain how the court will decide on this question: the laws, precedents and constitutional provisions that are at issue.
        
Explain what happens next depending on which side wins this argument.
Segment 4: Can the mandate be separated from the rest of the health law?

        
Introduce this question being heard by the court.
        
Explain why this question matters so much for what happens next.
        
Explain the arguments of all three responses to this question that are being argued before the court: the government, opponents of the law and the court-appointed lawyer.
        
Explain what happens next depending on which position wins out in court.
Segment 5: Conclusion

        
Briefly enumerate other questions being considered by the court, like this one: Is the law's expansion of the Medicaid program constitutional?
        
Summarize the questions being considered by the court and what is at stake as it considers these questions.
        
Explain the larger questions about the United States Constitution and the role of government that are brought up by this court challenge.
        
What will legal and political fallout be if the court decides one way or the other, including the potential impact on the 2012 presidential election?
        
What should we look for in the weeks and months ahead?
Group members should use reliable resources to develop an informative segment, using the suggested guidelines above, but amending as needed to meet curricular goals.

Please note that this is a continuing story, and there will be more resources from The Times and other sources as it continues to develop. 
When research is complete, groups should develop their segments, designed to be limited to a certain amount of time, like six minutes each, for a half-hour show overall. They should develop a realistic television segment, with each student in the group taking on a specific role. These roles might include news anchor, correspondent, citizens who support and oppose the law, legal expert, health care worker, insurance company executive, small business owner, politician running for office and political analyst or commentator.
Going Further | Groups complete their segments and, if desired and feasible, film and edit them. The completed news show can then be shown to the school or larger community. After a showing of the news video, students might sit on a panel and answer viewers' questions. 
You might also invite a constitutional scholar or law professor to class to explain more about the legal issues involved in the case.

HEADLINE: Magic Johnson Group Wins Bid for Dodgers

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
In a quick, dramatic end to the year-long financial crisis of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team's owner, Frank McCourt, agreed to sell the team Tuesday night for $2.15 billion to a group headed by Magic Johnson, the Lakers' Hall of Famer.
The Johnson group's deal, financed largely by Guggenheim Partners, a Chicago-based financial services firm, includes $2 billion for the team (minus $412 million in debt) and $150 million to create a joint venture with McCourt on the parking lots and land surrounding Dodger Stadium. The deal is valued at $2.3 billion. 
If the all-cash deal is approved by the judge overseeing the Dodgers' bankruptcy, the price will be the most ever paid for a professional sports team.
The most ever paid for a franchise is at least $1.4 billion for Manchester United. The Miami Dolphins were sold for $1.15 billion and the Chicago Cubs were acquired for $845 million. McCourt, who bought the team in 2004 for $421 million, had resisted selling the real estate, preferring to rent the lots for $14 million a year to the team's new owner. But the Johnson group suggested the joint venture on the land, said a person briefed on the sale but not authorized to speak publicly.
The deal will let McCourt repay a $150 million loan made to the team last year by Major League Baseball and his $130 million divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Jamie.
The winning bid defeated one by Stan Kroenke, the billionaire owner of the St. Louis Rams, Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets, and a second from two other billionaires: Steven A. Cohen, the hedge-fund manager who recently bought a small share of the Mets, and Patrick Soon-Shiong, who made his money in pharmaceuticals.
The final steps in the process came rapidly. McCourt's investment banker, Blackstone, asked each bidder to raise their offers Monday night.
Baseball owners approved all three bidders Tuesday afternoon and later in the evening McCourt selected on the Johnson group. An announcement was made shortly after 11 p.m. eastern.
In addition to Johnson and Guggenheim Partners, the winning group includes Stan Kasten, the former president of the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals, and Peter Guber, the film producer and head of Mandalay Entertainment.
The agreement to sell the Dodgers to Johnson's group appears to end an extraordinary year for the team. It filed for bankruptcy last June after Selig blocked a new, long-term billion-dollar cable TV deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports. Selig had sharply criticized McCourt's management of the team -- in particular his use of team money for his and his ex-wife's personal use -- and installed a monitor to oversee the team's operations. McCourt called that a hostile takeover.
In rejecting the deal with Fox Sports, Selig said that too much of the upfront payment would go to McCourt personally in part to fund his divorce.
Now, the Johnson group is poised to make a new TV deal that could be one of the most lucrative in baseball. The group can extend the team's deal with Fox Sports-owned Prime Ticket during exclusive negotiations later this year, or can field offers from a bevy of possible suitors, including Time Warner Cable, which created two regional sports networks for the Lakers.
Such a deal could result in the creation of a regional channel dedicated to the Dodgers and guarantee rights fees that dwarf what Prime currently pays.

HEADLINE: Without Usual Hubbub, State Budget Deal Is Reached

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY - No flash. No sizzle. No last-minute protests, and no late-night dramatics.
This is not how Albany ordinarily works.
But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said that they had agreed to a $132.6 billion budget for the state's next fiscal year, and that they expected lawmakers would formally enact it on Friday, two days before the next fiscal year begins.
The budget is a back-to-basics document at a time when the weak economy has slowed the growth of state revenues. 
Mr. Cuomo argued that a plan to expedite repairs to highways and bridges would create jobs in the construction industry. The Senate Republicans were pleased that the budget reduced overall spending and imposed no new taxes. And the Assembly Democrats were happy that it increased state financing for community colleges and housing programs.
Each side lost some arguments as well. Most notably, Mr. Cuomo was unable to persuade Senate Republicans to support a state health insurance exchange to comply with the health care overhaul championed by President Obama, which is now being challenged in the Supreme Court. Mr. Cuomo said he would seek to resolve the issue with an executive order.
Given the constraints created by a divided Legislature and a down economy, Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers seemed content simply to have come up with a balanced budget without the usual Albany brinkmanship.
The agreed-upon spending plan reflected only modest changes from Mr. Cuomo's proposal in January. It added about $100 million in spending, but it still came out a hair smaller than the budget approved last year, and the governor's office said it had been at least 30 years since the state had reduced overall spending two years in a row.
At a briefing with his cabinet and the news media, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, praised lawmakers for agreeing to ''put the politics aside'' and approve the budget ahead of schedule. He described it as a ''very honest, straightforward document that exhibits the fiscal discipline, fiscal integrity, that we've been talking about.''
''What we said to the people of this state 15 months ago was, we're going to bring competence, we're going to bring integrity and we're going to make the government perform,'' Mr. Cuomo added. ''We did last year, and with this budget, we did once again.''
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had been sharply critical of the way the state budget treated New York City last year, praised this spending plan. He said the city would save nearly $1 billion over the next five years because of a budget provision that would start to shift the burden of increasing Medicaid expenses from county governments and New York City to the state.
''City taxpayers are winners today in Albany,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''The components of the budget agreement announced today, taken together with the landmark pension-reform overhaul announced two weeks ago, herald the best legislative session for the city in a decade.''
The deal followed an occasionally unseemly but productive period at the Capitol. Two weeks ago, lawmakers approved legislative redistricting maps and a reduction of pension benefits for future public workers. In December, they approved a new top tax bracket for the state's highest earners, nearly halving the projected budget gap.
Of course, Albany being Albany, there were some problems. The legislative process has often taken place in the middle of the night and with little consideration of public input, to the dismay of government watchdog groups and lawmakers in the Legislature's minority caucuses.
But with the budget agreement, officials vowed to be more transparent. They began printing budget bills over the weekend, and, in a break from usual practice, legislative leaders said they would not sidestep a constitutionally mandated three-day waiting period before voting on the bills, to give lawmakers and the public time to read them.
As local governments across New York confront perilous balance sheets, the new budget would leave Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature with a projected gap of about $950 million to address next year - a small amount by Albany standards.
''It's Year 2 of a major turnaround,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group. The governor, she added, ''said going in that the budget was straightforward, and it appears to be where they ended up.''
Mr. Cuomo had significant leverage over lawmakers. As he did last year, he effectively told them to accept his budget as proposed or he would impose it using emergency spending bills. He also benefited from the political calendar, as all of the state's legislative seats will be in contention in November, and many incumbents are eager to campaign on a platform that includes being part of a functioning, peaceful, productive state capital.
In statements on Tuesday, legislative leaders were eager to trumpet getting something done. The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said, ''We have turned the corner in Albany.'' And the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said, ''By working together, we have made real progress in continuing to rebuild New York's economy.''
The budget process was helped along by the fact that the most contentious elements of the state's finances had been addressed before negotiations began. The tax deal in December, which cut rates for the middle class and created the new top bracket, had resolved the most obvious sticking point. And the two largest areas of state spending, education and health care, were given increases of about 4 percent in the new budget under a deal made a year ago when Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature cut spending in those areas.
Mr. Cuomo did not get everything he wanted in the agreement. Lawmakers blocked his plan to shift some of the costs of special education for preschoolers to local school districts. He also agreed to drop a proposal to delay until next year's budget part of a scheduled increase in welfare payments to poor New Yorkers.
The governor had also sought to allocate $250 million of an $805 million increase in education financing through competitive grants; as part of the deal announced on Tuesday, he agreed to halve that sum to $125 million, with the balance to be distributed using a more traditional school-aid formula.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Fall Again In an Index of Major Cities

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Home prices fell in January for a fifth straight month in most major cities, a new report disclosed Tuesday, but another report said Americans maintained a positive outlook on the nation's economy. 
The housing data, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, showed that prices dropped in January compared with December in 16 of 19 cities tracked.
The steepest declines were in San Francisco, Atlanta and Portland, Ore. Prices increased in Miami, Phoenix and Washington. The declines partly reflect typical offseason sales. The month-over-month data is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
Prices fell in 17 of the 20 cities in January compared with January 2011 (when one fewer city was tracked). The group's nationwide index of prices has fallen 34 percent since the housing bust and is now at 2002 levels.
The continued drop in prices suggested the housing market remained weak, even after the best winter for home sales in five years and steady improvement in the job market.
Eight cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Las Vegas, New York, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla., are now back at 2000 levels or earlier. Only Denver, Detroit and Phoenix posted year-over-year increases.
Analysts noted that prices were expected to rise modestly throughout much of 2012.
''It's going to be tempting to look at home price declines and see a still-faltering housing recovery, but that's just not the case,'' said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the housing Web site Zillow.com. ''The reality is that home prices and home sales will be moving'' higher.
In another report released Tuesday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index edged down in March after hitting the highest level in a year in February.
Yet Americans remained upbeat over all in March despite mixed economic signs. The stock market is up, but so are gas prices. Unemployment is falling, but home prices are declining.
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said consumers ''feel the economy is not losing momentum.''
The Conference Board, a private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell slightly to 70.2 from a revised 71.6 in February, the highest level it has been since the same month in 2011.
Consumer confidence has made a recovery since it fell to its low of 25.3 in February 2009. But the March reading is below the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy.
The index has not been near 90 since December 2007.
Economists watch consumer confidence closely because spending on everything from clothing to health care accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity.
One gauge of the Consumer Confidence index, which measures how shoppers feel now about the economy, rose to 51, from 46.4 in the previous month. That measure now stands at the highest level in more than three years. But the other barometer, which assesses shoppers' six-month outlook, declined to 83 from 88.4 in February.

HEADLINE: Resetting the Table

BYLINE: By JEFF GORDINIER

 BODY:
FOR a lot of people who spent the Clinton years eating in and around Midtown Manhattan, 1996 was all about the crackling pork shank.
Crispy, sweet, glistening and gigantic enough to make you wonder whether you had accidentally ordered a shinbone of brontosaurus, it embodied the bright, go-go gestalt of that late-20th-century moment when it seemed as if your 401(k) was just going to keep growing fatter and sweeter by the week. Ruth Reichl hailed it that year as ''original and delicious'' in her New York Times review of Maloney & Porcelli, a sprawling new chophouse and hangout on East 50th Street, where the shank was the signature dish.
''There are some things like that that can become a restaurant maker,'' said Alan Stillman, the legendary New York entrepreneur who opened the place. ''The next thing you know, the whole world is descending upon that item. That doesn't happen very often.''
Nor does it last forever. The Midtown pinstripes crowd has never stopped dropping by Maloney & Porcelli for that ''great ball of meat,'' as Ms. Reichl described it, or for the restaurant's other signature dish, the ''angry'' lobster, both of which were conceived by the now-famous chef David Burke. 
But there is no denying that that buzz of newness eventually did what buzz tends to do, especially in New York. It moved on, and on -- most recently to David Chang and his crispy, sweet, glistening bo ssam. To the warmly smiling emissaries of the Danny Meyer empire. To speakeasies, sushi bars and sandwich shops. Even, of course, to Brooklyn.
Alan and Michael Stillman -- the father-and-son team that runs Maloney & Porcelli and other spots in their Fourth Wall Restaurants group -- are savvy enough to realize this, which is why they are putting the 16-year-old Midtown joint through a head-to-tail renovation (while leaving that shank alone).
In some ways, the project would make an engrossing case study at the Harvard Business School: Can any restaurant that has passed through the heat of its adolescence -- much less one born in the days before Facebook, Twitter and the vogue for artisanal pickles -- adapt enough to enjoy a prosperous adulthood in the flux of the New York dining scene, where what's seen as old and square is routinely plowed under to make way for the new and hip?
Maloney & Porcelli is working every angle. By early next week, it will have a new menu, new awnings and lighting and cocktails, new art on the walls, new music on the sound system, new uniforms for its servers, even new matchbooks and toothpicks. In essence, the restaurant seems to be upgrading its aesthetic and culinary consciousness, offering retro-clubby delights (from fried-herb versions of Tater Tots to a roaming martini cart) and a tongue-in-cheek TBWA/Chiat/Day advertising campaign that will suggest it's in sync with the way New Yorkers eat and drink now.
Plenty of spots have done the makeover mambo over the years -- the Rainbow Room, the Russian Tea Room, the Waverly Inn, the Monkey Bar -- sometimes repeatedly, and not always to applause. The trick of going more contemporary, of course, is that you have to start by publicly admitting that you're not.
Scores of chefs and dining establishments have altered the conversation in the years since 1996, and the restaurant needs to adjust ''to what the crowd has developed into,'' said Michael Stillman, 32, a Brown University graduate who is overseeing each element of the transformation.
''We almost have to catch up with that,'' he said. ''We'd like the restaurant to work for another 25 years.''
But in his view, catching up and sticking around both hinge on going back: The new decor and dishes at Maloney & Porcelli are meant to reinforce the feeling that it's the youngest member of the city's beloved ''old clubhouse'' club. The idea is not to reinvent the culinary wheel, but to ''re-excite our core base,'' he said.
Even that will take effort, of course. If nothing else, the Maloney makeover, which borrows liberally from classic and of-the-moment trends in cooking and mixology, speaks volumes about how food consciousness has expanded and evolved in just a generation. Today, when even the mainstream diner can expound on the provenance of sea urchin and wild ramps, it takes even more attention to detail to hold on to that Midtown regular who not long ago might have settled for a plate of creamed spinach.
With that in mind, what Maloney & Porcelli is undertaking ''is really logical,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant who shuttles between New York and the West Coast, and who is not involved in the project.
Name recognition is crucial in the restaurant world, he said, but it's also ''a double-edged sword,'' because it requires constant evolution to maintain standards. ''When you go back to a place you know, it has to be the way you remember it fondly -- not necessarily the way it was,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''So it essentially has to be better. Which requires constant small improvements, most of them invisible, but felt.
''Anybody who is lucky enough to still be around is considering an upgrade right now,'' he said.
But Michael Whiteman, the president of Baum & Whiteman International Restaurant Consultants, wondered whether Maloney's team should have overhauled the restaurant's name, too.
''If I were the investor in meat-centric, guy-centric M & P, I wouldn't build a new-old steakhouse in a city that's full of them,'' he said ''I'd want something with broader appeal -- sexual and gastronomic -- in the hope of ramping up my business. Looks like they're trying to have their cake and eat it by salvaging the name, which, to coin another cliche, strikes me as new wine in an old bottle.''
It's safe to say that the Stillmans know more than a little about navigating the new and the old.
Alan Stillman, 75, has built a career on a sixth sense for where cultural winds are blowing. In 1965, just as the sexual revolution was starting to crest on the coasts, he hatched a casual spot on First Avenue that was meant to give single women a mellow place to hang out.
''My business plan was to meet women, which I accomplished,'' he said.
Although it's hard to imagine now, that spot, which he christened T.G.I. Friday's and which would eventually metastasize into a nationwide chain, quickly turned into the Age of Aquarius version of the Dutch or Roberta's, with a line out the door and young swingers panting to get in.
''People will tell my father, 'I remember Friday's from back in the day' -- it was such a different thing,'' Michael Stillman said. ''They'll say, 'I met my first wife at Friday's.' They invented the fast casual market -- that business didn't exist.''
He parted ways with the brand in 1975. But two years later lightning struck again, just as the United States was gearing up for the cigars-and-power-ties bluster of the Reagan years, when Alan Stillman and some business comrades decided that Manhattan could really use a fresh spin on a classic steakhouse. Their creation, which got its moniker after Mr. Stillman plucked two names at random from a city phone book, also went on to leave a lasting imprint on the American landscape: You can now spot the green-and-white Smith & Wollensky facade in cities like Chicago, Las Vegas and Miami Beach.
Maloney & Porcelli got its title in similarly spontaneous fashion: Mr. Stillman decided to name the place after the lawyers who had helped shepherd him through the legal brambles. But nothing else about the restaurant was random. From the start, Maloney was engineered to be an anti-steakhouse -- clubby, sure, but not conventional. A steakhouse, you might say, that wasn't afraid of its feminine side.
''We wanted to build a restaurant where you could walk in and order things other than steak,'' Alan Stillman said. ''At the time, as far as I remember, there were no quote, unquote, modern steakhouses. There was nothing like the current crop.''
''Now it's developed so much over the past 15 years.'' said Michael Stillman, who has proven skillful, with enterprises like Quality Meats and the Hurricane Club, at gauging what Midtown diners (and revelers) are hungry for.
But as they are the first to admit, the past three or four years have not been easy for Maloney & Porcelli.
The recession was bad enough, putting many Midtown customers out of work and shrinking budgets for expense-account feasts. Then the restaurant was confronted by an epic and messy Metropolitan Transportation Authority construction project -- ''basically they've been putting this enormous tunnel directly under the building,'' Michael Stillman said -- that cluttered the front sidewalk and sometimes created the impression that the place was closed. Being out of sight is one problem; being out of the spotlight is another. Lately Maloney & Porcelli has found itself in a sort of medium-well zone where it neither qualifies as one of the city's crusty porterhouse landmarks (like Peter Luger or Keens) nor feels as sleek and vibrant as the latest meat-hawking trailblazers (like St. Anselm and Minetta Tavern).
''It became sort of an in-between, where you weren't sure what the sensibility of the restaurant was anymore,'' Michael Stillman said.
To give that sensibility a vigorous restart, he is reaching both backward and forward for inspiration. He's been studying old stalwarts -- from the ''21'' Club in Manhattan to Dan Tana's in Los Angeles to the Connaught Bar in London -- to capture the factors that make a restaurant feel like an essential part of the local landscape.
At the same time, as a young New Yorker who is fond of restaurants that are ''taking old-school, mom-and-pop ideas and then sophisticating them,'' Michael Stillman is culturally aware enough to borrow and tweak a range of contemporary hits.
The new Maloney menu, which pops with sharp red-and-black lettering, was still in the works this week, but the Stillman team is considering items that Michael Stillman refers to as ''mashups'' -- a couple of populist favorites from the comfort-food canon that are welded together for maximum impact: fried clams casino, Wellington Rossini, lobster thermidor potpie, beef short-rib stroganoff. At the bar, which will now be bathed in amber light from new fixtures, Maloney plans to offer a vast selection of whiskeys and bourbons, and fresh variations on the mint julep, the gimlet and the salty dog.
Michael Stillman is clearly scooping up inspiration from a few nongastronomic wells, too. The imagery on Maloney's new coasters and matchbooks calls to mind the swizzle-stick vamping of ''Mad Men,'' which is apt, since the restaurant has long been a haunt for operatives from nearby Madison Avenue ad agencies. Mr. Stillman wants to amp up the restaurant's old-school feel -- ''we'll have all that old, classic men's gear: cigar boxes, shoehorns, matchboxes,'' he said -- in a way that might make both Roger Sterling and his Silicon Alley grandson feel at home.
Which is to say that a restaurant founded in 1996 is -- in 2012 -- going to feel a little more 1965. With a dash of 1988 thrown in for good measure.
One afternoon in early March, Michael Stillman and several members of his team convened at a round table toward the back of the restaurant to dig into a medley of dishes proposed for the new menu. The theme of the repast might have been ''crowd-pleasers from a century of American food.'' There would be Gruyere souffle, a braised Colorado lamb shank, those house-made Tater Tots with a dunking cup of malt-vinegar mayo. There would be a blinding parade of desserts: individual red velvet cakes, a four-layer creme brulee, a grasshopper pie blanketed with Bailey's-spiked cream.
And there would be the Bronson Pinchot.
James Jermyn, Maloney's chef for the last five years, wheeled a cart up to the table. There, armed with a beaker of Cognac and tender slabs of beef, he cooked up a distant cousin of steak au poivre that happens to be named (in that spontaneous fashion that seems to be a signature flourish for the Stillman family) after Mr. Pinchot, the star of the 1980s sitcom ''Perfect Strangers.''
''I'm a big 'Perfect Strangers' fan,'' Michael Stillman said. ''On the menu at Dan Tana's, they have a nod to Dabney Coleman, so we wanted to have a nod to one of our favorite '80s actors.''
The chef got the steak ready. ''Then we finish it with our signature Pinchot sauce,'' he said.
''It's funny every time,'' said Allison Good, a partner and marketing director with Fourth Wall.
Michael Stillman gave it a taste: ''It's definitely saucy, and if anything, Bronson Pinchot is a very saucy actor.''
Will it work? Can a demi-glace of irony get people lining up for a steak? As that crackling pork shank taught us back in 1996, you never know where the next legend will come from.

HEADLINE: With Lopsided Vote, Food Co-op Rejects Effort to Boycott Israeli-Made Products

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE and GERSH KUNTZMAN

 BODY:
Members of the Park Slope Food Co-op voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday night against a motion that would have moved the organization closer to joining an international boycott against products made in Israel. The vote settled a debate that had embroiled the venerable neighborhood institution for many months and divided its membership.
The vote, conducted by paper ballot, came during the Brooklyn co-op's monthly general meeting, with 1,005 people voting against the motion to hold a referendum on a boycott, and 653 in favor. 
''A boycott should be by consensus, and there is obviously not that,'' Jeff Prant, a co-op member, said after the vote. While the arguments for the boycott had merits, he said, they were ''outweighed by the divisiveness.''
Tensions at the co-op, on Union Street, had been climbing to a breaking point in recent weeks as the members, numbering about 16,300, weighed the matter. Reporters and television trucks had become a common site outside the co-op's doors. Advocates passed leaflets with increasing urgency. Politicians and pundits weighed in. And emotions, in at least one instance, spilled over into fisticuffs.
The boycott lobby is part of an international movement -- called Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or B.D.S. -- that is trying to compel the Israeli government to change its policies toward Palestinians, and withdraw from Palestinian territories.
''The vote tonight has shown us that we still have a lot of work ahead in the fight to end Israeli oppression of Palestinians,'' said Liz Roberts, a member of the pro-boycott lobby. ''However, despite our loss in tonight's vote, we have succeeded in one of our goals: B.D.S. has entered into the consciousness of thousands of co-op members and has even made it into mainstream conversations.''
The start of the meeting was delayed by 45 minutes as hundreds of members filed into a large auditorium at Brooklyn Technical High School. The meeting had been moved from its usual setting in a local synagogue to accommodate the turnout of more than 1,600, a record for the organization.
Over nearly 90 minutes, about four dozen speakers stepped to the microphone and made their arguments.
Advocates for the boycott criticized Israeli military action in Gaza and the West Bank, and argued that a ban would be an important symbol in the fight against injustice.
Dennis James, who pushed for the boycott, recalled a visit to Gaza in 2009. ''I viewed the results of the 22-day bombardment,'' he said. ''I saw apartment blocks blown apart. The American school flattened. The hospital shot full of holes.''
But many opponents of the boycott said the store was no place to adjudicate the politics of the Middle East. Some questioned the motives of the B.D.S. movement.
Aaron Dobbs occupied something of a middle ground, saying he was ''100 percent against'' the B.D.S. movement but ''100 percent in favor'' of the referendum in order to give the greatest number of members a chance to participate in the vote.
The anti-boycott lobby received a boost on Monday, when several of the city's top politicians expressed their opposition to the ban, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said he would encourage New Yorkers to do more business with Israel, not less.
Irina Ivanova, a boycott supporter, said those officials' statements were ''a little disappointing,'' but added, ''I can't say I'm surprised.''
She said the Park Slope Food Co-op Members that support the B.D.S. group had received endorsements from a range of activists and social justice organizations, including the writer Alice Walker, the antiwar group Code Pink and Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian politician.
Boycott supporters had asked even those opposed to a boycott to support the call for a referendum, arguing that a referendum, which would involve a mail-in ballot, would give members more time to vote, thus allowing greater participation.
But some members simply wanted the issue to go away as quickly as possible for fear that further debate would foment more divisiveness and damage the organization, which was founded 39 years ago.
''These people are insidious, and they destroy communities,'' said Peter Raskin, a co-op member speaking about the boycott lobby. ''If they have a problem with Israel, let them go to the State Department.''
A boycott would have been largely symbolic; the store carries only a few Israeli-made products, among them a seltzer-water maker, organic paprika, two styles of kosher marshmallows and three varieties of tapenade and pesto, said a store founder, Joe Holtz.
One of the product manufacturers is PeaceWorks, a company that seeks to encourage peace among rivals through economic cooperation. Its line of tapenades and pestos uses olives grown in Palestinian villages, glass jars made in Egypt and sun-dried tomatoes from Turkey.
''The key to resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is greater understanding of each other, not greater polarization,'' Joshua Scherz, president of PeaceWorks Foods, said in a statement.
Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian human rights advocate and co-founder of the B.D.S. movement, said that regardless of the outcome, the fact that the debate had reached Park Slope reflected the momentum the cause had gained.
''We are fast reaching our South Africa moment,'' he said in a statement from East Jerusalem.
In recent weeks, advocates carrying leaflets have been a common sight on the sidewalk outside the Union Street store. While civility has generally prevailed, two people who apparently hold opposing views on the matter scuffled in front of the store over the weekend.
''That makes me very unhappy,'' Mr. Holtz said. ''I'm hoping that's the end of that.''

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Increase Firewall to a Trillion Euros

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and MELISSA EDDY; James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union should increase its financial firewall to about 1 trillion euros to restore market confidence in the euro zone and prevent the spread of fiscal contagion, the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Angel Gurria, said on Tuesday. 
Mr. Gurria's comments came a day after Germany dropped its opposition to increasing the Continent's total bailout capacity to more than 690 billion euros, or about $920 billion. That could help stop the spread of the crisis to large economies like Spain's.
''The mother of all firewalls should be in place,'' Mr. Gurria said at a news conference in Brussels. But he also said the current level of political commitment to the funds was not enough.
He called for a more ambitious program of changes in product and labor markets, tax systems and education, and said many such changes would stimulate growth in the short term.
''Decisive action to restore confidence and support demand is needed now,'' Mr. Gurria said in a statement issued before his presentation of an O.E.C.D. survey of the euro area in Brussels. ''Europe is stalling. It needs to get out of first gear and make growth the No. 1 priority.''
Olli Rehn, the European economic and monetary affairs commissioner, who was seated beside Mr. Gurria at the news conference, was optimistic that an agreement on a firewall could be reached Friday, when European finance ministers gather in Copenhagen for a two-day meeting.
But Mr. Rehn declined to comment on how big that permanent firewall should be because the talks were continuing.
The meeting in Copenhagen should ''help us to remove any possibly remaining doubts about the euro area's commitment to overcome the crisis,'' Mr. Rehn said. ''We will find a confidence-building compromise,'' he said.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said Monday in Berlin that her government remained determined in its belief that a permanent European rescue fund should be capped at 500 billion euros.
But in a big concession, she said Germany would not oppose letting that fund operate alongside a temporary fund that has aided Greece, Ireland and Portugal but still has money to lend. Ms. Merkel's statement effectively gives the green light to expanding the firewall, as the United States and others have urged.
It also shows renewed determination to shore up the stability of the euro zone as concerns mount about the Spanish government's rising costs of borrowing.
Mr. Rehn said Monday in Helsinki, Finland, that he expected a plan to be mapped out Friday in Copenhagen that would be strong enough to persuade the International Monetary Fund to increase its contribution to the European effort. The fund is to hold its annual meeting in late April.

HEADLINE: Group Allied With Cuomo Tops Albany Spending List

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Highlighting a shift in the way money is spent to influence government, the group that spent the most on lobbying in New York last year was a coalition of business leaders allied with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, according to a report released on Tuesday by the state's Joint Commission on Public Ethics.
The group, the Committee to Save New York, spent nearly $12 million on lobbying last year, almost twice as much as the next biggest spender, a coalition financed by a health workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U., and the Greater New York Hospital Association. 
''It's definitely a big change from what we've seen in years past,'' said Bill Mahoney, the research coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''Historically, the groups that spent the most in any given year were working in opposition to the governor's proposals. This year, many of the groups in the top 10 actually were working in alliance with the governor.''
Over all, a record $220 million was spent on lobbying in New York last year, a $7 million increase from 2010. Lobbying expenses have grown or stayed the same every year but one over the past two decades, according to the report.
''It appears that lobbying is recession-proof,'' Ellen N. Biben, the executive director of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, said after releasing the results of the report.
The Committee to Save New York, formed after Mr. Cuomo was elected, is led by three prominent New York City business leaders: Rob Speyer, the president of the real estate firm Tishman Speyer; Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of Partnership for New York City, a business network; and Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
The organization, which promotes lower taxes and reduced state spending, has strongly supported Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo and the committee have long insisted that they do not coordinate with each other, though the committee has almost uniformly supported the governor's positions.
The home page of its Web site on Tuesday had a 32-second video clip promoting Mr. Cuomo's budget, the details of which were agreed upon by legislative leaders that afternoon.
''This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to fight for reforms in Albany, and to ensure the progress continues,'' Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the committee, said in a statement about the lobbying report. ''The special interests have dominated for so long in Albany, it takes a real effort to bring change and put the people first.''
Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest union of New York State workers, disputed the committee's claim that it fought for the people. ''We refer to it as the Committee to Scam New York,'' he said, adding that he believed the committee was clearly an ''arm of the governor's political supporters, made up of the 1 percent.''
Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, which is made up of labor unions and community organizations, said business interests had not always prevailed. He cited the creation last year of a new tax bracket for the state's highest earners.
''That was an interesting illustration of money power versus people power,'' Mr. Kink said.
Some interests that spent substantial sums on lobbying have been at odds with Mr. Cuomo on some issues but supported him on others. Labor unions, traditionally among the biggest spenders in Albany, lost battles with the governor over pension reductions and wage concessions, but allied with him in other areas. The health workers union, 1199, for example, was represented alongside the hospital association on Mr. Cuomo's Medicaid Redesign Team last year.
''A part of it has just been the governor's ability to get many of the state's top special interests on the same page as him,'' Mr. Mahoney said.

HEADLINE: The Case For Raising Top Tax Rates

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
The wealthy are feeling defensive about their taxes. Most Americans may think the rich pay too little but, not surprisingly, only 30 percent of the rich agree. More than two-thirds of families earning a quarter of a million dollars a year or more tell Gallup's pollsters that their taxes are too high.
It is true that high-income Americans carry the biggest tax burden. While fewer than 1 in 20 families make more than $200,000, they pay almost half of all federal taxes.
However they feel about the tax man, there is a case to be made that they can pay much more. The reason has nothing to do with fairness, justice or ideology. It is about economics and math. 
The math is easy: the federal budget over the next decade cannot be made to square without raising a lot more money. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that if we stay on our current path, federal debt held by the public will grow from about two-thirds of gross domestic product today to roughly 100 percent in a decade and twice that much by 2040. It is unlikely that even the most committed Republicans could reverse the trend without higher taxes.
But an equally compelling reason relies on a new understanding of the economics of taxation. For 30 years, any proposal to raise taxes had to overcome an unshakable belief that higher taxes inevitably led to less growth. The belief survived the Clinton administration, when taxes rose and the economy surged. It survived George W. Bush's administration, when taxes were cut yet growth sagged.
But now, a growing body of research suggests not only that the government could raise much more revenue by sharply raising the top tax rates paid by the richest Americans, but it could do so without slowing economic growth. Top tax rates could go as high as 80 percent or more.
Admittedly, it seems inconceivable that our political system could stomach a tax increase that big. Today, the richest 1 percent of Americans pay a top federal rate of 29 percent, according to Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. That's because almost a third of their income derives from capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a 15 percent rate -- while the rest is ordinary income taxed at a top marginal rate of 35 percent.
Nonetheless, the research suggests there is much more money available to close the budget deficit than we previously thought, if only we were willing to raise tax rates to where they were back in the early '70s, in the administration of Richard M. Nixon.
Taxpayers always want to pay less to the tax man. Still, there's nothing inevitable about low taxes. In the early 1950s, coming out of World War II, the top federal income tax rate exceeded 90 percent. In 1980, the top marginal rate was 70 percent for families making more than $215,400 -- about $587,000 in current dollars. And these families pocketed a much smaller share of the nation's income than they do now. Today, people earning over $200,000 a year capture more than a third of national income.
How we got from that country to this one -- where President Obama's attempt to raise the top federal rate to 39.6 percent from 36 percent sets off partisan warfare -- had less to do with changing beliefs about fairness than with politics. By the mid-1970s, the Republican Party concluded it was probably more effective to counter Democrats' Big Government platform as the party of low taxes than as the party of budget discipline.
Economics helped them make their case. The sharp fall in tax rates that brought us to where we are today was buttressed by an economic proposition that has guided policy ever since: that raising taxes could backfire and harm the economy along the way.
Legend has it the idea entered the political mainstream during a meeting in Washington in 1974 in which the economist Arthur Laffer demonstrated the principle to Donald Rumsfeld, chief of staff to then-President Gerald Ford, and Dick Cheney, an assistant to the president. He drew a curve on a cocktail napkin -- now known as the Laffer curve -- to illustrate how tax revenues would increase less and less as tax rates rose until they reached a point where any future increase reduced the amount of money raised.
If taxes were too high, Mr. Laffer argued, people would come up with ways to avoid or evade them. They might postpone or cancel investments if the government were to tax away a large share of the rewards. They might work less, or put less effort into it. In this way, high taxes could reduce the total tax haul. More worryingly, this behavior would ultimately slow economic growth.
Economists today broadly accept this understanding of people's actions. This belief has supported big declines in tax rates around the developed world, from Japan to Britain and the United States to Sweden.
But something got lost in the rush to cut: the proposition does not support low taxes all the time, for everybody and at all costs. While raising tax rates beyond a certain threshold can reduce tax revenue, we don't know where the peak is. After decades of tax cuts, it is not unreasonable to think we are way below it. And though raising taxes will change taxpayers' behaviors in a way that could reduce economic growth, we don't know precisely how much. It turns out the impact of raising tax rates on the rich may be smaller than we thought.
The British went out of their way to shield income from the taxes after the Labour government raised the top income tax rate to 50 percent from 40 percent in 2010. High fliers asked for accelerated bonuses to get the money before the new tax rate went into effect. Then, they postponed income, hoping Labour would be kicked out of office. More than a thousand people moved to Switzerland.
This month, the new Liberal-Conservative government concluded that the tax increase had brought in too little new money and cut the top rate to 45 percent. Yet while the experience confirmed that taxpayers will do their best to avoid taxes, many of these tactics work only in the short term. Eventually, they'll have to pay what they owe.
There are severalstudies that suggest top rates paid by high-income taxpayers above a certain threshold of earnings could be substantially higher. A study published last November by Mr. Saez and Peter Diamond, the economics Nobel laureate from M.I.T., made the biggest splash.
Their study suggested the federal government could raise the top marginal rate to 76 percent without losing revenue if it closed all the loopholes to prevent taxpayers from reclassifying income on their tax returns just to pay less. The top tax rate could rise to 48 percent even if we kept the loopholes we have today, they found.
Perhaps the most controversial conclusion, made by Mr. Saez and two colleagues in another study published last December, is that while the rich would respond to a big tax increase by shielding income from the tax man and maybe working less, this would not slow the economy at all. That's because a lot of what the rich do does not, in fact, generate economic growth. So if they reduced their effort in response to higher taxes, the economy wouldn't suffer.
These arguments are not the mainstream view. Some economists really dislike them. And they are not absolutely airtight. The calculations rely on estimates about how higher tax rates would discourage the rich from working or investing over a couple of years at most. But we know little about how they might affect long-term decisions, like whether to become a brain surgeon or a hedge fund manager. We do know that in countries with higher tax rates, like France, people work fewer hours than in the United States.
But the new line of research has the potential to overturn contemporary thinking about government finances. And in one respect, it seems indisputable: three decades of tax cuts may have gilded the pockets of the rich, but they didn't provide much economic juice. Among developed nations, incomes per person grew no faster in countries like the United States and Britain that slashed their top tax rates than in countries like Spain, Germany or Denmark, which did not. If taxes didn't juice the engine of growth on the way down, there is little reason to fear they will stall it on the way back up.
American tax politics have not changed. Republicans act as if cutting is the only legitimate thing to do with taxes. Their proposals to address the budget deficit thus rely on a mix of ambiguous commitments to close unspecified loopholes and the fairly radical assumption that voters won't mind losing a big chunk of what the government does. And Republican arguments to the contrary, President Obama's plan to raise $2.1 trillion in new taxes over the coming decade -- mostly from high-income taxpayers -- is comparatively modest.
Raising the top tax rates on the richest Americans could go a long way toward balancing the federal budget. Mr. Saez estimated that raising the top tax rate on the top 1 percent of earners to 67 percent would raise about $4 trillion over a decade. That's a start.

HEADLINE: In Paradise, And Closer Than Ever To Disaster

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
For many of us who live in temperate zones, inland regions and the industrialized West, global warming is a source of anxiety -- even terror -- and something of an abstraction. The mildness of this past winter on the Eastern Seaboard might have seemed ominous, yes, but it was also pleasant, and much of the time other social, economic and political problems have a way of seeming more urgent than human survival.
There is also a noisy subculture of obfuscation and denial that has pulled an already contentious conversation about climate change and the environment down into the fever swamp of American ideological animus. It's a hoax! It's a liberal conspiracy! It's a scheme on the part of greedy scientists and power-hungry international organizations to shame us out of our S.U.V.'s and our plastic grocery bags! 
In other parts of the world, though, the issue has a lethal, terrifying urgency. ''The Island President,'' a new documentary by Jon Shenk (''The Lost Boys of Sudan''), visits one such place, the Maldives. That archipelago of roughly 1,200 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, of which about 200 are inhabited, is described as ''paradise crossed with paradise,'' and its soft sand beaches and blue waters have made it a haven for wealthy tourists. Though the film includes spectacular aerial and underwater footage of the Maldives' beauty, it concentrates its attention on uglier realities.
For 30 years the country was ruled by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, a dictator with the usual authoritarian habit of imprisoning, torturing and terrorizing his opponents. Among them was Mohamed Nasheed, who after years as a pro-democracy activist and a political prisoner was elected president at 41 in 2008.
As soon as he took office, Mr. Nasheed faced an environmental crisis of existential dimensions. The steady rise in ocean levels caused by melting polar ice and increasing global temperatures had already caused serious erosion on some islands, and the eventual catastrophic inundation of this small, vulnerable nation was starting to look inevitable, rather than just frighteningly plausible.
Mr. Shenk and his crew were given extraordinary access to Mr. Nasheed during his first year in power, and ''The Island President'' moves with the sometimes manic energy of a young, ambitious leader throwing himself at enormous challenges. Informative, revealing one-on-one interviews with Mr. Nasheed, his advisers and his wife are interspersed with scenes from the hectic, peripatetic life of a postmodern politician. Mr. Nasheed confers with members of his cabinet and British environmental advisers, takes part in the filming of public service announcements (including one in which he pretends to hold a meeting underwater in scuba gear), takes cigarette breaks and travels to a series of conferences on climate change.
The last of these, the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit, provides the film with its climax, as Mr. Nasheed becomes a crucial player in a series of complex negotiations that he hopes will lead to a strong international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the film provides a reasonably clear account of the technical issues involved -- there is much discussion about acceptable degrees of warming, centimeters of ocean rise and parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air -- it also sheds light on some of the 21st-century rituals of power and diplomacy. There are pomp, pragmatism, high principle and brazen manipulation, and it is sometimes hard to tell which is which.
Mr. Nasheed, handsome and earnest, well dressed and well educated, seems at home in this world of global high politics, even as he is often exasperated by its dysfunctional aspects. He is an agile, civil debater with a strong camera presence and a manner that combines boyishness with technocratic self-confidence.
In Copenhagen -- and a few months earlier at a United Nations session in New York -- he tries to use his moral authority as the leader of a small, imperiled nation to bring some of his more skeptical and cautious counterparts from the developing world over to his side. The geopolitical complexities are daunting, and the structural impediments to change seem overwhelming.
Mr. Nasheed also faces difficulties back home, though these, apart from the rising seas, are fairly peripheral to ''The Island President.'' Until, that is, a post-script tersely informs us, in white type on a black screen, that he was forced out of office last month, more than two years after the action of the film concludes. Another note relates that in that time, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have continued to rise.
It is in the nature of political leaders, especially in democracies, to be optimistic, to insist that solutions can be found to even the most intractable problems. Topical, politically engaged documentaries, particularly those made by American filmmakers, share in this tendency, offering implicit reassurance even as they deliver bad news about the state of the world. Awareness will be raised. Progress will be made. To doubt this is to court cynicism and despair.
''The Island President'' is buoyant and spirited enough to keep those demons temporarily at bay. It is impossible, while watching it, to root against Mr. Nasheed or to believe that he will fail. But the hope that infuses this movie makes it all the more upsetting to walk out of the theater and contemplate a looming disaster that the world's leaders seem unable to prevent.
The Island President
Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.
Directed by Jon Shenk; director of photography, Mr. Shenk; edited by Pedro Kos; music by Radiohead and Stars of the Lid; produced by Richard Berge and Bonni Cohen; released by Samuel Goldwyn Films.

HEADLINE: Wines of Europe Look to Asia to Offset Slowdown at Home

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
VERONA, Italy -- Long gone are the days when French soldiers or Italian farmhands were issued their daily ration of a liter of wine. Even the three-hour Parisian lunch, accompanied by a few glasses of red, white or sparkling, is threatened by the ravages of globalization.
Across much of Europe, wine consumption is flat or sinking. The United States is only slightly more buoyant. To stay in the game, the industry is trying hard to develop new markets, especially in Asia. 
In China, perhaps the most promising Asian country for European producers, France has been the main beneficiary of growing consumer interest in wine. Now Italy is trying to catch up.
This week at the Vinitaly wine fair in Verona, which bills itself as the largest wine gathering in the world, with more than 4,500 producers represented and more than 150,000 visitors expected, the organizers announced a partnership with the Hong Kong International Wine and Spirits Fair, under which they will promote each other's activities.
Among other things, Vinitaly will encourage Italian producers to exhibit their wines at the Hong Kong event -- an important promotional tool for a highly fragmented industry.
Over all, Italian wine exports rose 13 percent last year, to 4.4 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, according to Vinitaly. But in Asia, Italy has some ground to make up. In the first six months of last year, France exported 5.5 million cases of wine to China, accounting for 48 percent of total imports, according to Chinese customs data. Italy, with fewer than one million cases, claimed a mere 8.3 percent of Chinese imports, putting it in third place, behind Australia.
''We need to do more to educate consumers,'' said Lamberto Vallarino Gancia, president of Federvini, a trade group. ''Asian consumers are very brand-conscious.''
Italy's late start in Asia contrasts with its consistent strength in the United States, where it is the biggest foreign producer. In 2010, it supplied 30 percent of total American wine imports by value, according to the Commerce Department, compared with 24 percent provided by France.
Cultural ties have helped Italian winemakers in the United States, where French producers are still recovering from anti-French sentiment after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, which the French government opposed.
In China, on the other hand, French wines have benefited from a perceived association with luxury and status. Wine from Bordeaux houses like Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton Rothschild and Latour have soared in price in recent years, in part because of Chinese demand, wine dealers say. Chinese investors have even bought several historic Bordeaux chateaus.
Now there are signs that the Chinese enthusiasm for high-end Bordeaux may be waning slightly, with the price of Lafite-Rothschild easing from the highs recorded a year or two ago.
Is this the opening that the Italians needed? Italy has some noted wines, like Sassicaia from Tuscany and those produced by the house of Gaja in Piedmont, but few of them fetch the four-digit prices that are not uncommon for top Bordeaux in great vintages.
To try to strengthen the link in consumers' minds between Italian wines and other examples of the finer things in life, the country's wine industry has recruited the Altagamma Foundation, which represents Italian fashion houses and luxury goods producers, as another partner.
Santo Versace, brother of the fashion designer Donatella Versace and president of Altagamma, said at a news conference during Vinitaly that members of the group would feature Italian wines at fashion shows and other events around the world.
''Fashion, design, jewelry, food, hospitality -- they all give shape to the way in which Italy is identified abroad, being at the same time the true engine of our economy,'' Mr. Versace said in prepared remarks. He also said that promoting ''synergy'' among these industries could be beneficial.
To promote the association with fashion, Vinitaly organized an unusual tasting in which more than 100 of the best winemakers in Italy poured their wines to an invitation-only crowd -- including a handful of Asian critics, bloggers and buyers.
Coordinated action like this is often lacking in the European wine industry, which celebrates the diversity of its producers, geographical origins and wine styles.
Thierry Desseauve, a French wine critic who has promoted French wines in Asia, said European vintners should look beyond old rivalries that have divided wine regions and countries, and work together to promote their products in growing Asian markets.
''We think there is not one country in the wine world, but one civilization, mostly a European civilization, and we need to develop this civilization in Asia,'' he said at Vinitaly, which continues through Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Contingency Plans Are Few if Court Strikes Down Insurance Requirement

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After a day punctuated by seeming skepticism from Supreme Court conservatives about the constitutionality of requiring Americans to buy health insurance, the justices will turn their attention on Wednesday to how much of the 2010 health care law might survive if they strike down that mandate.
If the court invalidates the insurance requirement, the White House and a divided Congress would be left to pick up the pieces. Their first steps toward finding alternatives to reduce the number of uninsured in the country -- nearly 50 million, or one in six Americans -- would depend heavily on how far the Supreme Court goes, and on the balance of power in Washington after the November elections. 
Lower courts that have ruled against the insurance mandate have adopted a spectrum of positions. Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., who first ruled in the case now before the Supreme Court, invalidated the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, writing that the insurance mandate could not be legally separated from the rest of the expansive law. He stayed that judgment until the law could be reviewed by higher courts.
The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta upheld Judge Vinson's invalidation of the insurance mandate. But it significantly scaled back the impact by concluding that only the mandate itself would die.
The Obama administration will argue on Wednesday for a middle ground that is driven by economic assumptions as well as legal analysis. If the mandate falls, the Justice Department has said, two politically popular provisions must die naturally with it -- those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage or charging higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions.
The economic argument is that it would be unreasonable to expect health insurers to cover the sickest Americans if the healthiest ones are not required to pay for coverage and broaden the actuarial pool. ''If you are told that you can buy insurance anytime, you would wait until you got sick and buy it en route to the hospital,'' said Neal K. Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, who argued the health care case before the 11th Circuit.
But there also is a clear political component to linking the insurance mandate to the insurance regulations. A poll taken this month by The New York Times and CBS News found that while more Americans disapprove than approve of the law's insurance requirement, the abolition of pre-existing condition exclusions is wildly popular, with 85 percent saying they supported it.
The health care law began requiring that insurers cover children regardless of their health in September 2010, but the ban would not apply to adults until 2014.
In court on Wednesday, the challengers to the law will argue that the entire act must fall along with the mandate. The court has appointed an outside lawyer, H. Bartow Farr III, to argue the 11th Circuit's position, that the mandate could fall alone.
White House officials said that they remain confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the law, and that they have done no planning for the possibility of its full or partial demise.
Congressional leaders in both parties also said there had been no significant contingency planning.
''I think the law is going to be found constitutional, and if not we'll have to deal with it then,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat.
Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his party would continue to press for repeal of the law and substantial changes to government insurance programs.
So long as the court does not invalidate the entire law, many other components -- and the taxes to pay for them -- could remain in place even if the mandate and related insurance regulations are struck down. They include a vast expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the establishment of health insurance exchanges, offering subsidized coverage to those with low incomes, both scheduled to start in 2014.
Other provisions that might survive include increased prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients, requirements that insurers cover preventive services like cancer screening, incentives for doctors to adopt electronic records, and grant programs aimed at disease prevention and restructuring the medical payment system.
Some health care experts have suggested that there might be ways to replace the insurance mandate by using market incentives to encourage the uninsured to gain coverage.
The government could, for instance, give consumers limited enrollment periods to buy insurance so they could not wait until they were ill. Or it could tell them that if they did not buy a policy during a defined period they also would not be eligible for benefits, like subsidized coverage.
But supporters of the health care law contend that such measures would insure only a fraction of the 30 million estimated to gain coverage with the mandate in place.
''There are alternatives to the mandate, but none of them are considered as effective,'' said Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now heads the Center for American Progress.
Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research group, said that without the mandate the number of uninsured and the premiums paid for coverage would almost certainly rise.
He said that the partisan divide in Washington, where Republicans have vowed to repeal the health care act, makes it difficult to imagine Congress seeking any kind of repair.
''States may be forced to stitch together a variety of imperfect state-specific approaches if the mandate falls,'' Dr. Altman said. ''It is useful to remember that we have averaged 19 years between national health reform debates, and only passed national health reform legislation once.''

HEADLINE: At Edge of Paris, A Housing Project Becomes a Beacon

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- Hard by the noisy highway, overlooking a cemetery and a former garbage dump, La Tour Bois-le-Pretre glimmers on a spring morning. Sheathed in a fresh cloak of glass balconies and corrugated aluminum panels, it rises on the edge of this city amid a landscape of decaying cement-and-brick housing blocks.
This half-century-old tower used to be one of those blocks. Its makeover, by a creative team of local architects -- Frederic Druot, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal -- is a case study in architectural ingenuity and civic rejuvenation. It's a challenge to urban innovators, too. Instead of replacing the old tower with an entirely new building, the designers saw what was worthwhile about the existing architecture and added to it.
Retrofitting, it's called. Preservationists in America have argued for a long time about the benefits of reusing obsolete structures. Since some 80 percent of what's been built in the United States has been constructed during the last 50 years, reuse seems like the inevitable wave of the future. The practice is not common when it comes to large public housing projects. But there have been a few successful attempts. This one is the latest. 
Poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of Paris and in the city's inner-ring suburbs are, as in many cities, dominated by these much-maligned projects from the 1960s and '70s. Not long ago I visited Sevran, one of the poorest Paris suburbs, where the rioting that spread across France in 2005 started. Unemployment now hovers around 40 percent among the young there. Violence has gone up in the last couple of years. There was a shooting not long ago in a kindergarten.
Sevran is full of housing towers. French policy, similar to the American approach that has reshaped the inner cities of Chicago, Pittsburgh, Louisville and elsewhere, favors demolishing these projects and moving out tenants. Several towers have come down in Sevran, replaced by community gardens, sports fields, some new housing and a new school. More towers stand empty, awaiting destruction.
President Nicolas Sarkozy has proposed a vast extension of the Paris subway system that would link the city center with dozens of alienated suburbs like Sevran, along with new exurban commercial districts. Employment and growth depend on improved access to public transit.
Stephane Gatignon, Sevran's mayor, told me: ''Urban renovation alone can't solve our problems of unemployment and drugs. But it at least gives us the opportunity to live with more dignity.'' Architecture has its natural and obvious limits, in other words. But it is powerful as well.
So it is with La Tour Bois-le-Pretre, which sits on the farthest edge of the 17th arrondissement, a mixed district with persistent pockets of poverty, where a Metro extension would also go. The tower was a natural candidate for the French wrecking ball after decades of neglect and decay, but tenants didn't want to lose their homes. So an unusual question arose: might the building become a candidate for a different approach?
A competition was organized by Paris Habitat, the Paris Office for Public Housing, in 2005 to renovate the building. The challenge: to repair the tower's crumbling infrastructure, upgrade its common spaces and its exterior, and -- this was the most radical part -- add more light and square footage to dark, cramped apartments, without changing the footprint of the building, which couldn't be extended.
Oh, yes, and to spend less money for all this than the cost of tearing the building down and then rebuilding.
Designed by Raymond Lopez and opened in 1961, the 16-story prefabricated concrete tower had already undergone an ugly, claustrophobic update during the 1980s. Various competitors proposed leaving the shell basically intact but gutting the interior. Ms. Lacaton, Mr. Vassal and Mr. Druot won the competition with a novel approach.
They would work from the inside out to improve light and space, giving the tower a fresh, larger skin by creating a shell to envelop the building. This would extend the apartment floor slabs to add winter gardens, or solariums, and balconies that would bring in abundant light and increase the size of all 96 apartments.
The proposal included a new lobby; new elevators, kitchens and bathrooms; and many new floor plans. It promised, unlike the other proposals, that the tenants wouldn't need to move out for months on end, or years. This last part was crucial, because people removed from their homes for long stretches tend not to want to return. Ms. Lacaton, Mr. Vassal and Mr. Druot would displace them only for relatively short stints, and the retrofit would take less than two years.
The new winter gardens and balconies would be added using prefabricated modules erected like scaffolding around the outside. Punching through the old facade to connect these modules to the apartments would take only one day per apartment. Residents who left for work in the morning would return in the evening to find an entirely new, much larger home, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors opening onto glassed-in winter gardens that gave way to balconies with panoramas of the distant Eiffel Tower and La Defense.
Word started to spread about the tower before it was finished. The design was featured in a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2010. Construction, which began in 2009, was completed a few months ago.
The bill?
Little more than half of what demolition and rebuilding would have cost: $15 million, compared with $26 million.
I went to the tower with Ms. Lacaton the other day, to see how it looked and talk with tenants.
It seemed elegant and airy. One tenant griped about the broken elevator, another about the ''shady'' kids who gather in the newly painted bright green hallways, now full of light and large windows. The halls have become more attractive places for them, and there's no security to kick them out. Ms. Lacaton listened politely.
''No,'' Sister Ann-Marie Mevellec, a decade-long resident, said when I asked her whether she liked the changes to her apartment. She smiled beneficently. The kitchen was too small, she said; the winter garden was too cold in winter, too hard to keep clean. She missed her old loggia, where she grew vegetables.
Unheated winter gardens and balconies often go unused in modern apartment towers. Many of the ones I saw functioned like closets. But they added light and space. Sister Ann-Marie conceded that the building was on the whole better. Energy costs have been cut by 60 percent. The tower has new sunny common spaces.
Marie-Jean Benjamin, a retired hairdresser who raised seven children in the apartment she has occupied for 47 years, told me she remembered the building when it had just opened as a dark, cramped place in a terrible neighborhood making way for the ring road. Back then, interior plumbing was a luxury for a poor family looking for a decent home. She showed me her new bathrooms and kitchen and the winter gardens onto which she had moved her bar, some tomato plants and an exercise bike.
''I'm proud of the building,'' she said.
The corrugated plastic windows the architects chose for some of the winter gardens look smart, lowered costs and provide privacy for tenants from the outside. But they also obscure views from the inside.
Those shimmering corrugated aluminum panels that cover parts of the facade refract light. They change color with the hours and the seasons, like budget titanium, dissolving the mass of the building. But they're hard are to keep clean. No matter how energy-efficient, economical and handsome a work of architecture may be, it still depends on upkeep and security. Ms. Lacaton said she was rethinking the materials she would use for a similar, much larger retrofitting in Bordeaux.
Jeanine Gaillard, 81, in scarf and loafers, a resident in the tower for 21 years, was at that moment dragging her wheeled canvas shopping basket outside the tower toward the highway. She lamented that the nearest grocery story was on the other side of the ring road, blocks away.
''It depends how you ask the question,'' Ms. Lacaton responded when asked whether the building ended up as she had hoped. Architects couldn't fix the neighborhood or provide 24-hour security guards, she said. But they could make something pleasing whose appearance derived from the narrow range of material options available, within a tight budget.
''The aesthetics arose purely from the decisions about the quality of space,'' Ms. Lacaton insisted. ''We could have done something playful and fashionable on the outside, to look better, if we had put just a few balconies here and there. But our priority was improving the living conditions for everyone.''
They've done that, adding an exemplary landmark to the Paris skyline.

HEADLINE: In Real World, Mandate Stirs Some Dissent

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Wayde Lodor is part of the 2 percent: the roughly 120,000 residents of Massachusetts who lack health insurance despite the state's landmark 2006 law requiring almost every adult in the state to have it. He is likely to face a penalty this year, having made enough money under the state's guidelines to afford a health plan. But Mr. Lodor, an independent product development consultant from Leominster, remains defiant.
''I'm in good shape, I don't eat meat, I don't drink excessively, I've never smoked,'' said Mr. Lodor, 53, who estimates he would have to spend at least $1,200 a month to cover himself and his college-age daughter. ''The last thing I'm going to do is not pay my rent because I have to pay for some state-mandated health coverage that I don't think I need.''
As the Supreme Court hears arguments this week on the constitutionality of the national health care law and its requirement that most Americans be insured or pay a penalty, Massachusetts offers a real-world laboratory of how such a mandate might work. 
Roughly 48,000 people in the state were subject to penalties for not having coverage in 2009, the latest year for which figures are available, down from 67,000 in 2007. The maximum penalties range from $228 to $1,212 a year, depending largely on income. (Anyone with an annual income of less than 150% of the federal poverty line pays no penalty.) The penalties are paid on state tax returns.
Massachusetts health officials say the shrinking number of violators is a sign that the law is succeeding. ''I think the individual mandate in Massachusetts has been accepted by our population, understood, and broadly judged as fair,'' said Glen Shor, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state agency that helps residents find insurance coverage. Had Mr. Lodor purchased insurance through the agency, he could have found a policy that was significantly cheaper.
But for the relatively small universe of people who resist buying coverage, the mandate is a bitter pill. Teofilo Cuevas, 51, who earns about $40,000 a year as a meat cutter at a grocery store, said he had decided to drop his employer-provided coverage because even with insurance, he could not afford his out-of-pocket costs. He said he avoided going to the doctor.
''A lot of people cannot pay this,'' Mr. Cuevas, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, said through an interpreter.
For individuals facing penalties, who are often young, male and healthy, the state appears to have been generous in granting one-year waivers. From 2007 through 2010, the state approved 65 percent of the appeals filed by people who had been given penalties, or 7,163 out of 10,992, according to the Health Connector. State officials said appeals were granted based on proof of financial hardship, which might involve unemployment, a foreclosure or period of homelessness, or having to make the choice between paying for insurance or for heat and electricity.
''It's a very humane and fair appeals process that gives people the opportunity to tell their story in full,'' Mr. Shor said.
But some small business owners also feel unfairly targeted by the law, which requires employers with the equivalent of 11 or more full-time employees to offer coverage or pay a penalty of $295 per employee. Mr. Cuevas's employer, Ronn Garry Jr., owner of Tropical Foods, a grocery store in the Roxbury section of Boston, is facing nearly $30,000 in penalties because not enough of his 70 employees signed up for his employer-provided plan over an 18-month period, he said. ''It's frustrating,'' Mr. Garry said of the law, ''because I support it but I also feel victimized by it.''
He added, ''Most people want to have coverage but they have to make dollars-and-cents decisions.''
Over all, 4.6 percent of the employers who are required to offer coverage, or about 1,000, were penalized for noncompliance in 2010, according to the state. The state's Division of Unemployment Assistance enforces the rule; compliance improved to about 95 percent from about 88 percent from 2007 to 2010. Money from the penalties helps offset the cost of state-subsidized health insurance.
William Fields, a consultant in Boston who helps employers comply with the law, said restaurants and stores often struggled to avoid penalties, known in state parlance as ''fair share contributions.''
''You have some of those who are truly bad guys and should be fined,'' Mr. Fields said. ''But the ones that are personal to me are the $50,000 fine that puts my client out of business.''
Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard, said that while the individual mandate had more or less succeeded in Massachusetts, it would have a much harder road to acceptance in states where more of the population is uninsured. Even before the 2006 law, Massachusetts had more residents with health insurance than most other states.
''Everybody says, 'Well if they're happy with it here, won't they be happy with it in Texas?' '' Dr. Blendon said. ''I don't think you can get from one to the other because the numbers of uninsured are so much larger.''
Polls suggest that most people here like the state law, although fewer support the individual mandate specifically. A statewide poll last year by the Harvard School of Public Health and The Boston Globe found that 63 percent of residents supported the overall law, while 51 percent supported the individual mandate.
But while the Massachusetts law is popular for now -- an effort to get a question on the ballot this fall asking voters to repeal the individual mandate failed to collect enough signatures -- it could lose support if health care costs, already prohibitively expensive here, continue to rise. Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has called for reining in costs by changing the way doctors and hospitals are paid, but the legislature has not taken action.
Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of Health Care for All, an advocacy group here, said the federal health care law would help by extending subsidized coverage to some people who do not qualify for it under the Massachusetts law. Many such people, she said, are currently ''right on the margin, trying to live with the mandate and it's just a strain on their budget.''
Because it is not a federal statute, the Massachusetts law would survive even if the Supreme Court finds the national mandate unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Mr. Lodor said he was eager for the justices to strike the federal law down.
Mr. Lodor, who is divorced and pays for his daughter to be insured through a plan her college offers, acknowledged that he was ''rolling the dice'' by forgoing insurance. He is not against buying catastrophic coverage, he said, but that alone would not meet the state's ''minimum creditable coverage'' requirement.
''I really feel strongly this isn't something that should be foisted on me,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on March 28 about the requirement that most Massachusetts residents have health insurance gave an incomplete account of the options that Wayde Lodor, an independent consultant from Leominster, had for buying health coverage. While Mr. Lodor, after researching several plans, estimated he would have to spend at least $1,200 a month to insure himself and his daughter, he could in fact have bought coverage through the state's insurance exchange for significantly less.

HEADLINE: Final Approval by House Sends Jobs Bill to President for Signature

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House gave overwhelming final approval on Tuesday to a package of measures intended to ease access to capital and investments for entrepreneurs, sending the bipartisan legislation to President Obama, who has said he will sign it.
The 380-to-41 House vote added a final exclamation point for the JOBS Act, which passed the House overwhelmingly early this month and easily passed the Senate last Thursday. Because the Senate amended the House version to add some investor protections, the House had to take it back up for a vote before sending it to the White House. 
''The bipartisan JOBS Act represents an increasingly rare legislative victory in Washington where both sides seized the opportunity to work together, improved the bill and passed it with strong bipartisan support,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader and the primary architect of the package.
The JOBS Act started as a cluster of minor bills that had bipartisan support and little opposition. Many of them originated at the White House out of the recommendations of Mr. Obama's jobs council, a group of business and labor leaders whose final report made few waves.
But with the economy still looming large in the 2012 campaign, Republicans and Democrats -- Mr. Obama among them -- found it advantageous to pump up those modest measures into legislation promoted as a significant effort to hasten the recovery of the labor market.
''As the clock moves relentlessly toward November, people are going to have to show results,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a supporter of the measure.
The JOBS Act would designate a new category of ''emerging growth'' companies that could conduct initial public offerings of stock while being exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years. It would also provide a new form of financing to small companies. Through crowd-funding, or the sale of small amounts of stock to many individuals, companies could solicit equity investments through the Internet or elsewhere, raising up to $1 million annually without being required to register the shares for public trading with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Supporters see it as a breakthrough for entrepreneurs who hope to build an enterprise around sometimes offbeat ideas without having to sell them to larger companies.
But a few detractors worry that the measure will bring back the ''boiler rooms'' of the 1990s Internet stock bubble, where hucksters peddle stock tips to unwitting amateur investors. Pension funds, the lobby for older Americans AARP and the chairwoman of the securities commission had opposed aspects of the bill.
Amy Borrus, a spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, an investor watchdog group, said small companies -- the focus of the new bill's relaxed regulations -- are particularly prone to fraud and accounting scandals. Senators did add some investor protections, but not enough, she said.
''We may rue the day this bill passed,'' Ms. Borrus said Tuesday.
Under the JOBS bill, companies with up to $1 billion in annual revenue would be free to ignore -- for their first five years as a public company -- regulations that were put in place after the end of the dot-com bubble and the collapse of Enron.
Among them are requirements to hire an independent outside auditor to attest to a company's internal financial controls and restrictions on how financial analysts interact with investment bankers in promoting a company's stock.
The bill also allows some companies to advertise for investors in almost any medium, a provision that skeptical regulators contend will mainly benefit the sale of worthless securities by brokerage firms.
Senate Democrats did add some investor protections that were ratified Tuesday by the House. Senators added a provision to ensure that any company using crowd-funding methods must still file some basic information with the securities commission, including the names of directors, officers and holders of more than 20 percent of the company's shares, plus a description of the business and its financial condition.
Companies seeking to raise $100,000 or less must also provide tax returns and a financial statement certified by a company principal; those raising up to $500,000 must provide financial statements that are reviewed by an independent public accountant.
The Senate also inserted requirements that intermediaries seeking to help companies raise money through crowd-funding must register with the commission, make sure investors are advised of the risks they are taking, and take measures to prevent fraud.

HEADLINE: Sharp Questions in Court On Health Law Mandate

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the fate of President Obama's health care law hanging in the balance, a lawyer for the administration faced a barrage of skeptical questions on Tuesday from four of the Supreme Court's more conservative justices, suggesting that a 5-to-4 decision to strike down the law was a live possibility.
Predicting the result in any Supreme Court case, much less one that will define the legacies of a president and a chief justice, is nothing like a science, and the case could still turn in various directions. But the available evidence indicated that the heart of the Affordable Care Act is in peril.
The court's decision is expected by June, and much may change as the justices deliberate and exchange draft opinions in the coming months. 
If the indications from Tuesday's arguments are correct, though, the ruling may undo parts or all of the overhaul of the health insurance system, deal Mr. Obama a political blow in the midst of the presidential election season, and revise the constitutional relationship between the federal government and the states.
The tone on Tuesday made a question to be addressed in the third and final day of arguments on Wednesday all the more important: If the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty fell, what other parts of the law would fall along with it?
On Tuesday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's swing justice, asked a host of questions indicating discomfort with the law.
''Can you create commerce in order to regulate it?'' Justice Kennedy asked the administration's lawyer, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., only minutes into the argument. He later told Mr. Verrilli that the federal government faced ''a heavy burden of justification'' and pressed him to articulate ''some limits on the commerce clause'' of the Constitution.
''You are,'' Justice Kennedy said, ''changing the relationship of the individual to the government.''
Justice Kennedy's questioning is often hard to read, and near the end of the argument he noted that ''most questions in life are matters of degree.'' But his questioning was, on balance, skeptical.
Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. were consistently hostile to the law. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was a little less so.
The conventional view is that the administration will need one of those four votes to win, and it was not clear that it had captured one.
The court's four more liberal members -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- indicated that they supported the law, as expected. Justice Clarence Thomas, who asked no questions, is thought likely to vote to strike down the law.
Everything about Tuesday's argument was outsize. It was, at two hours, twice the usual length. The questioning was, even for the garrulous current court, unusually intense and pointed. And the atmosphere in the courtroom, which is generally subdued, was electric.
Mr. Verrilli seemed taken aback by the hostile reception from the court's conservatives. He got off to a rocky start and never seemed to quite find his footing during his hour at the Supreme Court lectern.
Paul D. Clement, representing the 26 states challenging the law, and Michael A. Carvin, representing private challengers, were more assured, perhaps encouraged by the first part of the argument. Mr. Clement is a particularly fluid and conversational advocate, and he seemed eager to parry questions from the court's liberal wing.
Wednesday's argument about the other elements of the law may provide further clues about the fate of the mandate. It is one thing, after all, to ask questions about a hypothetical ruling striking down the mandate and another to seek practical advice about the consequences of such a decision.
The central legal question for the justices on Tuesday was whether Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce in enacting the insurance mandate.
Mr. Verrilli argued that the law was a valid response to a crisis in the market for health care. The individual mandate, he said, merely regulates how people pay for services they are virtually certain to use at some point in their lives and is well within the authority granted to the federal government by the Constitution.
Justice Ginsburg seemed to agree, saying the mandate was a response to the fact that uninsured people receive free health care that ends up being paid for by others. ''The problem is that they are making the rest of us pay,'' she said.
Justice Sotomayor said Americans would not stand for a system in which children in danger of dying were turned away from emergency rooms.
But several of the more conservative justices seemed unpersuaded that a ruling to uphold the law could be a limited one. Justice Alito said the market for burial services had features similar to the one for health care. Chief Justice Roberts asked why the government could not require people to buy cellphones to use to call emergency service providers.
Justice Scalia discussed the universal need to eat.
''Everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food,'' he said. ''Therefore, everybody is in the market. Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.''
Justice Alito asked Mr. Verrilli to ''express your limiting principle as succinctly as you possibly can.''
Instead of a brisk summary of why a ruling upholding law would not have intolerably broad consequences, Mr. Verrilli gave a convoluted answer. First of all, he said, Congress has the authority to enact a comprehensive response to a national economic crisis, and the mandate should be sustained as part of that response.
He added: ''Congress can regulate the method of payment by imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time in which the service is consumed when the class to which that requirement applies either is or virtually most certain to be in that market when the timing of one's entry into that market and what you will need when you enter that market is uncertain and when you will get the care in that market, whether you can afford to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market participants.''
The Supreme Court has read the commerce clause broadly, saying it allows Congress to limit how much wheat may be grown on a family farm and to punish the cultivation of homegrown marijuana.
There have been only two modern exceptions to that broad interpretation. In 1995, the court struck down a federal law regulating guns near schools. In 2000, it struck down a federal law allowing suits over violence against women. In both cases, the court said the activity sought to be regulated was local and noncommercial.
Justice Breyer said those precedents and others demonstrated that Congress was free to address problems in the delivery of health care.
''I look back into history,'' he said, ''and I see it seems pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on interstate commerce, Congress can act.'' An example, he said, was ''the national bank, which was created out of nothing to create other commerce out of nothing.''
Mr. Clement, representing the 26 states in the case, Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida, No. 11-398, said it was one thing to establish a bank and another ''to force the citizenry to put all of their money in the bank.'' The second sort of law, he suggested, would be analogous to the individual mandate.
Justice Breyer asked whether people entered the health care market simply by being born.
Mr. Carvin, the lawyer for the private challengers, said that ''if being born is entering the market,'' then ''that literally means they can regulate every human activity from cradle to grave.''

HEADLINE: The Supreme Court's Momentous Test

 BODY:
In ruling on the constitutionality of requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, the Supreme Court faces a central test: whether it will recognize limits on its own authority to overturn well-founded acts of Congress. 
The skepticism in the questions from the conservative justices suggests that they have adopted the language and approach of the insurance mandate's challengers. But the arguments against the mandate, the core of the health care reform law, willfully reject both the reality of the national health care market and established constitutional principles that have been upheld for generations.
The Obama administration persuasively argues that the mandate is central to solving the crisis in America's health care system, which leaves 50 million people uninsured and accounts for 17.6 percent of the national economy. The challengers contend that the law is an unlimited -- and, therefore, unconstitutional -- use of federal authority to force individuals to buy insurance, or pay a penalty.
That view wrongly frames the mechanism created by this law. The insurance mandate is nothing like requiring people to buy broccoli -- a comparison Justice Antonin Scalia suggested in his exasperated questioning of Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. Congress has no interest in requiring broccoli purchases because the failure to buy broccoli does not push that cost onto others in the system.
Congress has indisputable authority to regulate national markets and provide for the general welfare through its broad power to tax. Nothing about the mandate falls outside those clearly delineated powers.
In fact, Justice Scalia has, in the recent past, declared Congress's broad authority under the commerce clause to regulate activities with far less direct economic impact. In a 2005 case upholding a federal law prohibiting the growing of medical marijuana for personal use, he wrote that Congress may regulate even intrastate activities ''that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce.''
The skepticism of Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justices Scalia and Samuel Alito Jr. was also troubling because it seemed to accept an odd distinction of timing made by the opponents of the law.
Those critics concede that the mandate would be constitutional if it went into effect at the moment an individual actually needed health care. In other words, Congress could require the sick and dying to pay for insurance or for medical services when they show up in the emergency room, but it cannot require precoverage of medical costs through insurance.
The court has no authority under the Constitution to judge the merits or effectiveness of the health care law. That is Congress's job.
Yet, as Justice Stephen Breyer remarked about the points made by a lawyer for the opponents: ''All that sounds like you're debating the merits of the bill.'' To counter the challengers' claims of alarm over a novel policy, he offered several examples in American history where the court has strongly backed new solutions to major problems, like the creation of a national bank in the early 19th century.
If the Supreme Court hews to established law, the only question it must answer in this case is modest: Did Congress have a rational basis for concluding that the economic effects of a broken health care system warranted a national solution? The answer is incontrovertibly yes.

HEADLINE: Health Ruling Hinges on How Justices Frame the Core Issue

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday is hearing arguments on the central question in the constitutional challenges to President Obama's health care overhaul law. How it answers the question depends in large part on how the justices decide to frame the core issue.
The law's challengers -- 26 states led by Florida, the National Federation of Independent Business and several individuals -- present the central question as one of individual liberty. May the federal government, they ask, compel individuals not engaged in commerce to buy a product, here health insurance, from private companies? 
The Obama administration, by contrast, urges the court to answer a different question. May Congress decide, in fashioning a comprehensive response to a national crisis in the health care market, to regulate how people pay for the health care they will almost inevitably need?
However the questions are ultimately framed, the Supreme Court's answers will be grounded in the text of two provisions of the Constitution and in the precedents interpreting them.
The Constitution grants the federal government specified powers, reserving the rest to the states and to the people. The two powers at issue in the case, set out in Article I, Section 8, concern the regulation of interstate commerce and the imposition of taxes.
The administration's primary argument is that the law is authorized by the commerce clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce ''among the several states.'' The Supreme Court has read the clause broadly, saying it allows Congress to limit how much wheat may be grown on a family farm and to punish the cultivation of home-grown marijuana.
There have been only two modern exceptions to that broad interpretation. In 1995, the court struck down a federal law regulating guns near schools. In 2000, it struck down a federal law allowing suits over violence against women. In both cases, the court said the activity sought to be regulated was local and noncommercial.
The decision under review, from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, said the health care law overstepped the limits imposed by the commerce clause by regulating inactivity and forcing people into the marketplace.
In his main brief, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. urged the justices to look at the bigger picture.
''The minimum coverage provision,'' he wrote, using the law's name for what most people call the individual mandate, ''is within Congress's power to enact not only because it is a necessary component of a broader scheme of interstate regulation, but also because, within that scheme, the provision itself regulates economic conduct with a substantial effect on interstate commerce, namely the way in which individuals finance their participation in the health care market.''
Uninsured Americans each year use $43 billion of health care they cannot pay for, effectively transferring those costs to other American families to the tune of about $1,000 per year, Mr. Verrilli said.
In response, Paul D. Clement, representing 26 states challenging the law, said this conception of federal power amounts to ''a revolution in the relationship between the central government and the governed.''
''If this is to remain a system of limited and enumerated federal powers that respects individual liberty, accountability and the residual dignity and sovereignty of the states, the individual mandate cannot stand.''
The federal government also argued that the mandate is separately authorized by Congress's power to levy taxes. The penalty that people who fail to obtain insurance must pay is calculated as a percentage of their income and is paid to the Internal Revenue Service along with income and other taxes each April.
Mr. Clement responded that the challenge is to the mandate, which applies to almost all Americans, rather than the penalty, which applies to a subset of them. In any event, he said, a penalty is not a tax.

HEADLINE: Cuban Official Rules Out Reforms Urged by Pope

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and RACHEL DONADIO; Victoria Burnett contributed reporting from Santiago de Cuba.

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Just after Pope Benedict XVI prayed at a revered shrine in Cuba on Tuesday, calling for the country to move forward ''along the way of renewal and hope,'' a top government minister made clear that the sweeping economic changes under way here would not be accompanied by political reforms that the pope has urged.
The comments from the minister, Marino Murillo, the vice president of the Council of Ministers and the official overseeing the steps toward a freer market, amounted to a rebuttal of sorts to the pope, who in recent days has portrayed the political system here as unworkable and has laced his comments since arriving on Monday with calls for increased liberties.
''We are updating our economic model, but we are not talking about political reform,'' Mr. Murillo told reporters at a hotel in Havana, as television screens to his side showed images of the pope leaving Santiago de Cuba en route to the capital. 
While Mr. Murillo was explicit in his remarks, Vatican officials were more circumspect, unwilling to engage in a rhetorical duel with their hosts while hinting that Benedict would expand on his messages at a Mass here on Wednesday and, later, in his remarks before leaving for Rome.
After Benedict met privately Tuesday evening for just over 40 minutes with President Raul Castro, the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that he had not heard the comments but that the pope knew change in Cuba would come gradually. While he said it was not the church's role to inject itself into legal or political affairs, he saw the church as an important change agent addressing Cuba with ''realism and humility,'' aware of its ''complex history.''
The only direct request Father Lombardi said Benedict had made of Mr. Castro was for Good Friday to be declared a legal national holiday, as the government had done for Christmas Day after Pope John Paul II's visit in 1998.
Father Lombardi said the pope had received messages from a range of people who raised humanitarian concerns, but he declined to be specific, leaving unclear if those issues involved Alan Gross, an imprisoned American government contractor. State Department officials had hoped the pope would advocate his release. Benedict has no plans to meet with dissidents, Father Lombardi said, but has received their messages.
The pope did not meet Fidel Castro, but Father Lombardi said such an encounter was possible on Wednesday, when Benedict gives a Mass in Revolution Plaza. Late Tuesday, Fidel Castro announced in a short opinion piece posted on the government's Web site that he will ''happily'' meet with the pope, The Associated Press reported.
Benedict has used carefully chosen words on this trip. On the plane to the region last week, he explicitly criticized political systems based on Marxism, saying the ''ideology as it was conceived no longer corresponds to reality.'' Even after he landed in Cuba on Monday, the pope told Cubans to ''strive to build a renewed and open society, a better society, one more worthy of humanity, and which better reflects the goodness of God.''
On Tuesday, the pope began the day near Santiago de Cuba with a visit to the shrine of the Virgin of El Cobre, Cuba's patron saint and a figure worshiped by people of many faiths because of the belief that she brings good fortune. There, Benedict once again touched on freedoms that go beyond the broad opening to religious practice that has occurred here in the past two decades, which he has celebrated.
He prayed, he said, ''for the needs of those who suffer, of those who are deprived of freedom, those who are separated from their loved ones or who are undergoing times of difficulty.''
How hard the pope will press for an expansion of political freedoms is a central question in his visit to Cuba. The Roman Catholic Church here has played a central role in securing the release of Cuban political prisoners in recent years, but it has also been criticized by dissidents as being too cozy with the government.
Cuba has begun allowing some private enterprise, with small businesses selling pizza, trinkets and other simple goods. The government has also allowed Cubans to buy and sell real estate and cars, lifting or relaxing prohibitions that were decades old, as it seeks to shed thousands of workers from state payrolls and revive a moribund economy.
Benedict, often in the shadow of a predecessor remembered for his connection with the faithful, has reached for the common touch throughout this trip, which included three days in Mexico.
He referred to the Virgin of El Cobre as the ''Mambisa,'' a popular term that evokes her association with Cuba's struggle for independence from Spanish rule. As is the custom, he left an offering -- a golden rose.
His visit cast a spotlight on the virgin. According to Catholic belief, the virgin, a foot-tall wooden statue, was found floating in the sea 400 years ago in a ray of sunlight off eastern Cuba by two fishermen, her robes dry. Lina Ruz, the mother of Fidel and Raul Castro, visited the shrine as her sons fought in the Cuban revolution.
The virgin is also worshiped by practitioners of Santeria, a religion blending Catholic and African-derived elements, which considers her the goddess of love.
''She is in the blood of all of us who live in this town,'' said Maria Cristina Garcia, a 43-year-old hospital worker who was dressed from head to toe in yellow, the color associated with the virgin.
Cuba's priests have pinned their hopes of expanding their small flock on the outpouring of popular faith that surged around the virgin last year as she was taken on a tour of the island to mark her 400th anniversary.
''The pilgrimage of the virgin was a revelation for us,'' said Jose Miguel Gonzalez Martin, rector of the Seminary of San Carlos and San Ambrosio in Havana. ''One of our great challenges is to convert people who are baptized but who don't live in a way consistent with Christian principles.''
It is a shift for a church that dismisses folk devotion as unstructured animism but has to compete for souls among Cuba's large population of Santeria devotees, and evangelical churches, which have gained enormous ground on the island since Pope John Paul's 1998 visit opened the door to greater religious freedom.
It is a concession, in particular, for Benedict, who as the Vatican's doctrinal enforcer, has been strictly opposed to the commingling of Catholicism with local practice. But in recent years, the pope has made a point of visiting shrines to the Virgin Mary. These sites of folk devotion, which were dear to his predecessor, speak to a more ground-up spirituality that has sometimes seemed at odds with his own intellectual strain.

HEADLINE: Shares Slip as Big Quarter Approaches Finish Line

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks retreated on Tuesday, but a batch of large-cap shares touched new highs with the help of portfolio managers buying top performers near the end of the quarter.
With the first quarter ending on Friday, portfolio managers adjusted holdings by buying some of the best performers to dress up their portfolios. A total of 175 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange reached 52-week highs on Tuesday, including the Dow components Home Depot and I.B.M., along with high-end retailers.
''As long as the economy continues to improve, the market will continue to go up, and that's what's happened,'' said Bryant Evans, an investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Ill. 
The moves follow three months of big gains, putting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on track for its best quarter since the third quarter of 2009. It follows a similarly strong run in the fourth quarter of 2011, with gains for the last six months totaling 25 percent.
On Monday, the three major stock indexes rallied more than 1 percent after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled that supportive monetary policy would remain in place.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said in an ABC News interview, when asked about the potential for more stimulus action, that the Fed was not taking any options off the table.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 43.90 points, or 0.33 percent, to 13,197.73, on Tuesday. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 3.99 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,412.52. The Nasdaq composite index was down 2.22 points, or 0.07 percent, at 3,120.35.
Apple touched another record high of $616.28 and closed with a market capitalization of $572.92 billion. The stock closed at $614.48, still up 1.2 percent for the day.
Among Dow components hitting 52-week highs, I.B.M. climbed to $208.56 and then slipped slightly to close 0.3 percent lower, at $207.18.
Walt Disney shares rose to a 52-week high of $44.50, only to slip to $44.15, off 0.5 percent. Home Depot stock reached a 52-week high at $50.34, then gave up some of that gain to end at $50.04, off 0.2 percent for the day.
Among market sectors, the S.& P. technology and financial indexes led quarterly gains, with technology up 22.1 percent and financials up 22 percent for the quarter so far.
Among top-performing stocks, Bank of America, the second-best performing S.& P. 500 stock for the quarter, is up 75 percent; Sears is No. 1, up 130 percent.
''You'll see fund mangers continue to rotate, and the technical bias is up right now, so that bodes well for quarterly window dressing,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
Some investors say further gains will be difficult since the rally has lasted months without a major correction.
The market's sharp gains have followed improving economic data in the United States, as well as accommodative measures by central banks around the world.
In the latest economic report, the consumer confidence index dipped in March to 70.2, just below the median forecast, while Americans ratcheted up inflation expectations to the highest level in 10 months, according to the Conference Board, a private industry group.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 18/32, to 98 11/32, and the yield fell to 2.19 percent from 2.25 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: On Street, Crowd Gives Louder Side Of Argument

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The arguments inside the Supreme Court building on Tuesday may have been about the finer points of law, but on the sidewalk outside, they were pure politics, delivered bluntly with megaphones, microphones and a lot of shouting.
There were college students and retirees, homemakers and homeless people. Doctors and nurses came. So did real estate agents and writers. Flag bandannas were in abundant supply. The crowd formed two opposing sides, each taking turns in a marathon standoff over the Affordable Care Act that turned one slender block between the marble steps of the court and First Street into a cross section of American politics. 
''It's like 'Dueling Banjos,' '' said Robert Green, 22, from Long Island, who cringed as a throng of supporters of the law pressed in to him, shouting in hoarse voices, ''We love Obamacare.'' Behind him, opponents of the law yelled their own chant: ''Hey, hey, ho, ho, Obamacare has got to go.''
The opinions broke down into a familiar pattern. Opponents of the law tended to dislike President Obama and believe that it gives too much power to a government that is not to be trusted. Supporters mostly liked Mr. Obama and saw government as a good thing.
But for both sides, the law and the challenge to it seem to have prompted bigger thoughts about a rapidly changing country whose direction is uncertain.
''I am very sad,'' said Rebecca Otto, 61, a writer from Sonoma, Calif., who supports the law. ''I don't understand this America. I knew the America I grew up in. But I don't recognize this America.''
Sometimes conversations happened across the divide. Ms. Otto found herself walking up to a woman from Mississippi, an opponent of the law, and asking if she believed in contraception. They talked, but not for long, with the woman declaring that Ms. Otto's assertions -- that abortion clinics were closing because of conservative political actions -- were ''lies,'' and walking away after saying, ''I actually read the bill, and I suggest you read it, too.''
Linda Ensor, a former newspaper editor from Summerville, S.C., and an opponent of the law who came to the rally with her local Tea Party chapter, also felt nostalgic for the past.
''This is not the America we grew up in,'' she said, holding a handmade sign that read, ''Give us back our America.'' Among the changes she lamented were teachings about global warming in school textbooks, large amounts of new government regulations -- and the pledging of allegiance, she said, to the earth, not America.
Mr. Obama has encouraged outsourcing, Ms. Ensor asserted, going so far as ''doing away with light bulbs, so now they all come from China.''
She added: ''We have a president who genuinely does not believe in America.''
The atmosphere at the protest was ''electrifying,'' Ms. Ensor said. ''Listen to this,'' she said, smiling in sunglasses and a blue T-shirt, as a crowd of opponents of the law chanted into microphones behind her. ''This is America. Not those cheapskates with handouts who don't work.''
Janice Chester, a psychiatrist, who said she was a ''recovering member of the American Medical Association,'' condemned the health care law from a podium as ''relying on cookbook medicine.'' She finished by saying, ''In psychiatry, entitlement is a symptom -- think about that.'' That prompted one woman to mutter, ''I just don't understand them.''
Perhaps the happiest member of the crowd on Tuesday was Charles Medley, 54, an unemployed construction worker who had been earning $5 an hour since Sunday night for saving a spot in line. He said he had found out about the job at the homeless shelter where he lives, and had come, with about 30 other homeless men and women, to earn some money.
Mr. Medley had been awake since Sunday night, and his exhaustion was matched only by his excitement at the prospect of returning to his bed at the shelter. ''I'm going to go home and make love to my mattress,'' he said, packing up his belongings, which included a metal folding chair.

HEADLINE: For New Generation of Power Plants, a New Emission Rule From the E.P.A.

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Obama administration's proposed rule to control greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants -- the first ever -- could go far toward closing out the era of old-fashioned coal-burning power generation.
The draft rule, unveiled on Tuesday by Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, would limit carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour. 
Recently built power plants fired by natural gas already easily meet the new standards, so the rule presents little obstacle for new gas plants. But coal-fired plants face a far greater challenge, since no easily accessible technology can bring their emissions under the limit. Coal-fired plants are a major source of emissions associated with global warming. The new rules do not apply to existing plants.
The coal industry is an economic mainstay of many local economies, and the rule was denounced from West Virginia to Wyoming and on the Republican presidential campaign trail on Tuesday.
''This E.P.A. is fully engaging in a war on coal, even though this country will continue to rely on coal as an affordable, stable and abundant energy source for decades to come,'' said Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat and former governor. ''This approach relies totally on cheap natural gas, and we've seen that bubble burst before.''
The declining price of natural gas has made it the fuel of choice in recent years for companies planning new plants. The E.P.A.'s move follows a shift that is already unfolding in the electric power market.
The proposed rule is rooted in a 2007 directive from the Supreme Court instructing the E.P.A. to decide whether carbon dioxide was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. In late 2009, the agency declared that it was, and so had to be regulated.
It took more than two years for the agency to work out the regulatory details.
To open an avenue to companies still planning to build coal plants, for example, the E.P.A. said it would allow new ones to begin operating with higher levels of emissions as long as the average annual emissions over a period of 30 years met the standard.
In a statement, Ms. Jackson called the proposed rules ''a common-sense step to reduce pollution in the air, protect the planet for our children and move us into a new era of American energy.''
Environmental groups generally applauded the standards, although some expressed disappointment with the agency's decision not to regulate existing power plants for the moment.
''This Environmental Protection Agency action means any new coal plants built in America must use modern, state-of-the-art carbon pollution controls,'' Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. ''The logical next step is to improve the aging fleet of existing coal-fired power plants, which remain the major source of industrial carbon pollution in our country.''
In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Jackson said that if such action were to be taken in the future, the agency would thoroughly consult with the industry and all others affected.
Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential contender and a coal industry supporter, derided the proposed rule.
''President Obama's environmental agenda kills American jobs, creates higher energy prices and weakens our nation's security,'' he said. ''America is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and we could create our own energy if the government would let us. Instead, Barack Obama would rather pick winners and losers in the energy field.''
At Peabody Energy, the largest coal mining company in the United States, Vic Svec, a spokesman, questioned the legality of the standard, arguing that the E.P.A. was supposed to set standards based on existing technology and that technology was not ready.
A standard of 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour for coal plants would ''require something that doesn't exist as a commercial technology,'' he said.
But the lack of a commercial technology for carbon capture is one reason that the E.P.A. could not realistically impose such a requirement on existing plants and decided to push the challenge into the future.
Carbon capture has so far proved too expensive to be practical because the chemical work of separating carbon dioxide from the other components of exhaust gas requires large amounts of energy.
By some estimates, what is today a 1,000-megawatt coal plant might yield only 700 megawatts after some of its energy went into a carbon capture plant in the form of steam and electricity. And sequestering the gas underground could prove difficult.
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in an interview that ending coal-fired generation as it now exists should be the whole point. ''It's a rule that follows the marketplace,'' he said, adding: ''Right now, next to no coal plants are being built. This basically means that new coal plants are going extinct.''
As for coal plants built in the 1970s or earlier, he said, ''we can put them in our rear-view mirror.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a rule proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency that would limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants misstated the amount they would be allowed to emit. The limit would be 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour of energy produced, not 1,000 tons.

HEADLINE: Team of Action Figure Designers Soldiers On

BYLINE: GREGORY SCHMIDT


HIGHLIGHT: The good news is they have one big client. The bad news is they have one big client. 

 BODY:
Last week, we published a case study that looked at a team of four toy designers - Chris Dahlberg, H. Eric Mayse, Jim Preziosi and Eric Treadaway - faced with a quandary: how to expand their business so that they are not so dependent on their one big client, Mattel. Their company, the Four Horsemen Toy Design Studio, has revenue of more than $500,000 a year, most of it from its contract work for Mattel. They have a staff of three to help with sculpting, painting and shipping in their workshop in Butler, N.J.
They want to design and sell their own collectible action figures, but their work for Mattel leaves them with little time to focus on their own toy lines. They have created four lines so far, but to be successful, they believe the lines need a back story supported by content from movies, TV or comic books. 
In 2008, the Horsemen met with a production company, 4Kids Entertainment, about creating an animated television series, but the financial crisis hit, and the deal fell apart. They would still like to pursue an animated series but have been looking for smaller ways to build their concepts, like through comic books and graphic novels. To help develop story concepts, they are putting together a style guide. To get some marketing advice, they are seeking representation with a brand developer.
Hoping to appeal to the nostalgia of their adult collectors, they licensed the Outer Space Men, a line of action figures produced by Colorforms in the late '60s. The first four figures, with a production run of 300 each, came out in July 2010 and sold quickly for $10 apiece. That was followed by three more production runs and four new figures last summer. The men were invited organize a gallery show in February in Manhattan, where they displayed current and coming figures and coaxed the creator of the Outer Space Men, Mel Birnkrant, to meet with fans.
Overall, the men say they realize that the market for collectible action figures can be difficult. When the cost of toys goes up, adults tend to spend less on themselves. "Parents will always buy toys for their kids," Mr. Dahlberg said. "But if adults have a choice to buy a Superman figure or pay rent, they are going to pay rent."
Q.
"It's kind of like the little unknown line that could," Mr. Mayse said. "It was a distant nostalgic memory. We revived it and gave it new life. We are selling more and more with each release and are looking into acquiring other old misfit licenses."
"It has given us the taste for picking up a license; it's something we would do in the future," Mr. Dahlberg said. "We are able to take a line that's 45 years old and bring it back to collectors' collective consciousness. We are proud of the fact that we were able to bring a little bit of action figure history back."
Q.
"There's just no need to renegotiate; the relationship we have with them is fantastic," Mr. Dahlberg said. "We have our roots here. We are close to New York Comic Con and Toy Fair and Toy Tokyo, where we do our gallery show. There are a lot of resources out here."
Q.
"The DAVE School in Orlando, Fla., did one for us three years ago, in 2009," Mr. Mayse said. "They put it up on their site. What they had done is to ask us to allow them to use our characters to allow their students to create a 'movie trailer,' so to speak."
"The idea behind it was a mutually beneficial project," Mr. Dahlbeg said. "They were creating something new. They were able to bring our name to it to utilize that. They had a great product at the end, and we were able to use that as well. Everyone won at the end of it."
Q.
"In reality, we did a Kickstarter campaign when we sold the original 7th Kingdom figures," Mr. Preziosi said. "We can revisit that concept and possibly tweak that into different offerings."
"We've really come to understand how important the fan base is to us, how important their dedication is," Mr. Dahlberg said. "That's part of the direction we are looking into to find ways to get fans more involved again. It's so important to the success of these lines."

HEADLINE: On the Road to Recovery? Analyzing Economic Indicators

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER, HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Investigating and charting the state of the United States economy to develop a sense of how economists and politicians identify recoveries. 

 BODY:
Overview | How do we know when the economy is recovering? What key indicators do economists and politicians use to judge the health of our economic system? In this lesson, students use New York Times resources to investigate and chart the current state of key economic indicators like household income and unemployment. By researching and analyzing each indicator and sharing their results, students develop a sense of how we identify economic recoveries. 
Materials | Student journals, computers with Internet access, scientific or graphing calculators, graph paper.
Warm-Up | Tell students to write down in their journals some examples of how they can tell when economic times are tough. Ideas might include closed stores in their neighborhoods, higher prices for things they want or need or friends or relatives who are out of work or struggling to find jobs. 
Next, tell them to write down some ways they can tell when the economy is getting better. These could include new stores opening, friends and relatives finding jobs, new family outings and the like.
Invite students to share ideas, and write them on the board. Ask: What signs do you think economists and politicians look for in order to identify an economic recovery? Show students the infographic "Where the Comeback Has and Hasn't Taken Hold," which displays data on key economic indicators like household income, net worth, employment, consumer confidence and housing prices. Have the students compare their personal observations with these broad economic indicators and classify those personal indicators with the appropriate economic indicator.
Ask: Which of these key indicators do you think are most important in determining if our economy is improving? Do you believe we are currently in recovery? Explain that today they will explore these questions more deeply by conducting research and analyzing these key economic indicators.
 Related | The Bucks blog post "Americans Split Over Whether Recovery Will Endure" summarizes a recent survey about Americans' attitudes toward the current economic upswing:
Despite recent improvements in the economy, Americans are divided about whether the upswing will continue for the rest of this year, In fact, Americans are split about evenly, a new survey shows.
About half of those surveyed are confident that the recovery will last through 2012, and half are not, according to Bankrate's Financial Security Index survey for March.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below. 
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
According to the survey, what kinds of people generally feel better off about their levels of savings and debt? What kinds of people generally feel worse about their levels of savings and debt?
        
What percentage of retirees consider their current financial situation worse than a year ago?
        
Which key economic indicators are mentioned in this survey?
        
What percentage of Americans feel less secure about their jobs than a year ago?
        
Do you and your family feel better or worse about the economy than a year ago?
Activity | Have small groups of students each select a key economic indicator, like those described in the infographic they looked at during the warm-up activity: household income, household net worth, employment, consumer confidence and housing prices. Additionally, groups might choose other indicators, like stock price indices, average employee workweek or poverty rates. 
Have each group use New York Times resources like the Times Topics pages on the U.S. economy, unemployment and housing, and Times blogs like Economix and Bucks, to research their chosen economic indicator. 
Have each group find and analyze up-to-date data about their chosen indicator and other related indicators, including the personal indicators produced by the class in the warm-up activity. Have each group put together a short presentation-including graphs and analysis--on what that indicator says about the current state of the United States economy.
For example, the group that chooses unemployment can look first at the raw employment data, and then drill down deeper to look at which sectors of the economy are gaining or losing jobs, see what is happening with public sector jobs, and explore how private companies of various sizes are hiring and firing in the current economy. 
Or the group looking at stock prices could chart the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other important indices like the S.&P. 500. In addition, they could look at how different sectors, like technology and manufacturing, are performing in the market.
Have groups look at secondary economic indicators related to their choice, as suggested in the "comeback" infographic. For example, students researching unemployment could also look at average hourly wages for American workers, and those looking at household income could also research credit card defaults or average credit card debt.
Have each group put together a short presentation on their primary and secondary economic indicators. With the charts and data obtained from The Times or other resources, have them create compatible representations of their key data - graphs that span the same time frame, that are scaled appropriately and that agree with their analysis. 
When research and graphs are complete, have each group present their findings, ultimately trying to answer the question "Does this indicator suggest that the economy is in recovery?"
After each group has presented, hold a class discussion to consider the big picture. Examine all of the charts and analyses for all the major economic indicators, and discuss questions like these: Which indicator is most important in determining whether we are in recovery? and What other information would we like to know in order to evaluate the health of the current economy? 
Invite students to make predictions about where each of these key economic indicators is headed, and, going forward, follow up with Times stories and infographics to see if their predictions hold.
Going Further | Students look at other recessionary periods in United States history and compare the performance of key economic indicators then and now. Are current economic patterns consistent with historical patterns the led to recovery?
Instead of looking at national numbers, students can also examine economic indicators at a local level. Students can explore unemployment at the state level, housing prices at the city and state level and consumer confidence state by state. How do these local views on the United States economy compare with the overall picture? 
Alternatively or additionally, students look at the Magazine's feature "Hello, Cruel World," which contains personal stories of 2011 college graduates who are trying to enter the workforce. How do current economic factors affect a young person's job search? What strategies can help a recent graduate through these tough times? 
Finally, they might consider how the recent recovery may be much better for the top 1 percent than for the 99 percent. Do students see evidence of the rich getting richer through this recession and recovery? Or do they think everyone is equally affected? 
Standards | This lesson is correlated to McREL's national standards (it can also be aligned to the new Common Core State Standards):

6. Understands and applies basic and advanced concepts of statistics.
9. Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics.

HEADLINE: The Enduring Consequences of Unemployment

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A wave of research about the impact of unemployment on individuals and the broader economy has produced disheartening findings. 

 BODY:
Our economic malaise has spurred a wave of research about the impact of unemployment on individuals and the broader economy. The findings are disheartening. The consequences are both devastating and enduring.
People who lose jobs, even if they eventually find new ones, suffer lasting damage to their earnings potential, their health and the prospects of their children. And the longer it takes to find a new job, the deeper the damage appears to be.
Not since the Great Depression have so many Americans been unable to find work for so long. But researchers have turned to the next-worst period, the early 1980s, to seek a better understanding of the likely damage.
A 2009 study, to cite one recent example, found that workers who lost jobs during the recession of the early 1980s were making 20 percent less than their peers two decades later. The study focused on mass layoffs to limit the possibility that the results reflected the selective firings of inferior workers.

Losing a job also is literally bad for your health. A 2009 study found life expectancy was reduced for Pennsylvania workers who lost jobs during that same period. A worker laid off at age 40 could expect to die at least a year sooner than his peers.
And a particularly depressing paper, published in 2008, reported that children also suffer permanent damage when parents lose jobs. The study followed the earnings of 39,000 Canadian fathers and sons over 30 years beginning in the late 1970s. The study found the sons of men who lost their jobs eventually earned about 9 percent less than the sons of otherwise comparable workers.
These studies, however, generally do not consider the duration of unemployment: whether the damage is greater after a year without a job than after three months.
Part of the answer is obvious: each day without work is a day without income, a drain on savings, an increased chance of default on debts.
Studies show that people who can't find work become more likely as time marches on to suffer from depression and other health problems, according to a 2005 literature review by professors at Oregon State University.
A 2010 Pew survey on the experience of long-term unemployment was aptly entitled, "Lost Income, Lost Friends - and Loss of Self-Respect."
Moreover, the odds of finding a new job diminish with time. Among workers in their first month of unemployment, 34 percent found a job over the next month, according to a study of 30 years of data published in 2010 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Among workers in their seventh month of unemployment, the study reported only 19 percent found work in the next month.
The leading experts on unemployment caution that the significance of this pattern is unclear. It is possible that less-qualified workers simply languish longer, and that the state of unemployment is not itself worsening their prospects.
"It is difficult to establish whether this is because the duration itself worsens labor market prospects, or because those workers facing the strongest challenges in the labor market take longer to find a new job," Till von Wachter, a professor of economics at Columbia University, told Congress in 2010.
The importance of the distinction should not be overstated, however. It is the difference between a problem that accumulates and a problem that accelerates.
And there is some evidence that unemployment itself makes it harder to find new work, because unused knowledge and skills tend to atrophy.
Economists have struggled to quantify the loss of skills, generally asserting its existence on the basis of circumstantial evidence. One exception, however, is a 2008 Swedish study that frames the issue in rather striking terms.
The study found that unemployed people gradually lost the ability to read. If a person had stronger reading skills than 30 percent of Swedes when they lost their job, one year later their skills were stronger than just 25 percent of Swedes. Their reading comprehension score dropped by about five percentiles.

HEADLINE: Reaction to the Final Hearing on the Health Law

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: A sampling from around the Web of analysis of the Supreme Court session. 

 BODY:
Reaction to Wednesday morning's Supreme Court hearing on the health care overhaul was more varied than reaction to Tuesday's hearing. Adam Liptak covered the hearing for The Times. A sampling of other analysis and reaction follows.
Reuters: The Supreme Court struggled on Wednesday over what to do about President Barack Obama's entire health care overhaul should the nine justices decide to strike down as unconstitutional the insurance requirement underpinning the law. At the end of a 90-minute session, no clear consensus emerged for the fate of the entire law should the justices decide to void its key provision - the mandate that most Americans obtain medical insurance by 2014 or face a penalty.
Lyle Denniston, ScotusBlog: The Supreme Court spent 91 minutes Wednesday operating on the assumption that it would strike down the key feature of the new health care law, but may have convinced itself in the end not to do that because of just how hard it would be to decide what to do after that. A common reaction, across the bench, was that the justices themselves did not want the onerous task of going through the remainder of the entire 2,700 pages of the law and deciding what to keep and what to throw out, and most seemed to think that should be left to Congress. They could not come together, however, on just what task they would send across the street for the lawmakers to perform. The net effect may well have shored up support for the individual insurance mandate itself.

Josh Voorhees and AnkitaRao, Slate: Unlike Tuesday, when most observers appeared in agreement on what to make of the proceedings (flashback: it didn't look good for the president's landmark achievement), Wednesday's action appeared much less clear cut.
Sarah Kliff, The Washington Post: Those in the courtroom describe the justices as wary of overturning the entire law, but torn on how, exactly, they could pick and choose which parts of the law would fall should they strike the mandate.
Philip Klein, The Washington Examiner: Though it was difficult to get a clear read on their thinking as they asked tough questions of all sides, the Court seemed open to the possibility of overturning the entire law.
Tom Goldstein, ScotusBlog: The court is really struggling with severability. Generally speaking, the more conservative the member the more likely they were to believe that more would have to be invalidated.
Jonathan Cohn, The New Republic (on Twitter): First impression: Tough questions to both sides, still hard to predict final verdict, but not out of question SCOTUS throws out entire law

Now that the conventional wisdom on the health-care hearing has shifted-from a 6-3 or even 7-2 ruling in favor of the individual mandate's constitutionality to a 5-4 ruling against-the Democrats have to be thinking, if nothing else, about a public relations plan.
Cue James Carville, the veteran Democratic strategist, who told CNN's Wolf Blitzer yesterday that overturning the mandate "will be the best thing that ever happened to the Democratic party because health care costs are gonna escalate unbelievably."

He added: "You know what the Democrats are going to say - and it is completely justified: 'We tried, we did something, go see a 5-4 Supreme Court majority' the Republican Party will own the health care system for the foreseeable future."
That's spin-even though Mr. Carville said twice that it wasn't. It's a purely political and cynical way of understanding policy; if health care costs "escalate unbelievably" that's not good for anyone. (It's comparable to Republicans thinking a stalled economic recovery is good for their party because it's bad for the president's chances at re-election.)
It is true, however, that if the Supreme Court strikes down all or part of the Affordable Care Act, the burden of figuring out how fix the American health care system should by rights shift to the Republican Party.
Nearly 50 million people, or one in six Americans, do not have health insurance, and premiums for those who do are climbing ever higher. The classic liberal solution to that problem is single-payer, and that's certainly the most cost-effective way to make sure everyone has access to basic care. But during the legislative debates a couple of years ago it wasn't considered politically feasible, so the Democrats compromised with the individual mandate.
The Democrats, as Mr. Carville said, have tried. Do the Republicans plan to try, too, or do they expect Americans to accept the grossly inadequate status quo?

HEADLINE: A Clarion Call on the Food Supply

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: An influential commission calls for an ambitious new program to tackle the problems of food supply, food waste and sustainability all at once. 

 BODY:
For anyone who thought the run-up in food prices in recent years was a fluke or a short-term blip, it might be time to reconsider. 
We have certainly seen intermittent price dips in between the spikes of the last few years, but prices are still at pretty high levels over all. There has been no return to the era of slowly falling food prices that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s. Sober forecasters like those at the United States Agriculture Department now expect the era of higher prices to extend into the foreseeable future.
Underlying the price jump is a tight balance between supply and demand, and it has come to a head at a time when people are becoming more aware of the challenges that climate change will pose to food production. As I have reported before, planetary warming seems to be a factor already in limiting supply and therefore raising prices, and many groups expect the challenge to grow.
Now comes some detailed new advice on what we ought to do about it.
A report released Wednesday morning by the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change calls for an ambitious new program to tackle the problems of food supply, food waste and sustainability - all at once.

The commission reports to the worldwide networkof agricultural centers that undertake frontline research on the problems of food production. The report is being released at a major conference in London called Planet Under Pressure that concerns global sustainability. The commissioners include some major heavyweights in global agriculture, so I would expect the recommendations to get a serious hearing. 
The group calls, as others have in the past, for stepped-up investments in agricultural research, but with specific ends in mind. For instance, while the report maintains that world food production must be increased to meet demand, it also recognizes that food waste, overeating and other poor eating habits are a major part of the problem.
And the intensification of farming that is needed, especially in poor countries where agricultural productivity is low, must be achieved while doing as little extra harm to the environment as possible, the report says. It calls for a particular focus on the greenhouse gases from agriculture, a sector that is one the biggest sources of such emissions. 
"Food insecurity and climate change are already inhibiting human well-being and economic growth throughout the world," the report says, "and these problems are poised to accelerate."
This page offers the report itself as well as links to background material, and here's a video.

HEADLINE: Four New (Very Old) Landmarks

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Some of New York's oldest homes are finally designated landmarks. 

 BODY:
New York City's newest landmarks are among its oldest.
On Tuesday, the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated three abutting row houses from the early 1800s on Dominick Street, between Hudson and Varick Streets, and another house from the same era - now the Anchor nightclub - at 310 Spring Street, between Greenwich and Renwick Streets.
Only one of them, 32 Dominick Street, might ordinarily warrant a second glance. It still looks very much like a Federal-style house: two and a half stories high, with a steeply pitched roof and two stout dormers. A more discerning eye is needed to imagine the other three structures as cozy brick homes for a city that was just beginning to burst forth from the tip of Manhattan. Though they retain distinctive Flemish-bond brickwork courses - short, long, short, long - they were each increased to three full stories in the decades after they were first constructed. And the two on Dominick Street, No. 34 and No. 36, were given Italianate cornices and other embellishments after the Civil War.
Nonetheless, Robert B. Tierney, the chairman of the landmarks commission, said in a statement: "These four rare, Federal-era buildings are significant reminders of the beginning of New York City's evolution into a major urban center." [The news release as a PDF.]
New York's booming economy was by no means benign in every respect. As the commission noted in its designation report on 310 Spring Street, "Much of the city's growth during this period was fueled by trade with Southern cities in goods produced by American slaves, especially cotton." Capt. Dennison Wood, who lived at No. 310, profited from the trade as the owner and skipper of ships that sailed between New York and Savannah, Ga., in the 1830s.
Landmark designation, which is subject to ratification by the City Council, restricts what changes owners may make to the exteriors of their properties, imposing what many owners consider to be expensive and excessive regulation. In the case of 34 Dominick Street, the owner, Robert Neborak, said designation would force him to "bear the entire financial brunt" of caring for a property that did not warrant landmark status in the first place. "Thirty-four Dominick Street is not a notable architectural example of anything other than a well-maintained old building," he said in testimony prepared for the commission.
The owner of 36 Dominick Street also registered opposition to designation. The owner of 310 Spring Street took no public position, according to the commission. And there was no testimony from the owner of 32 Dominick Street, which served for 95 years as the rectory of Our Lady of Vilnius Roman Catholic Church, a Lithuanian parish. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York closed the church in 2007.
The commission originally considered 38 Dominick Street, a position that was supported by several private preservationist groups and opposed by the owners, but concluded that the facade had been too greatly altered to warrant landmark status.

HEADLINE: New York Police Dept. Is Sued Over Stops in Private Buildings

BYLINE: AL BAKER and AIDAN GARDINER


HIGHLIGHT: The lawsuit accuses the New York Police Department of carrying out tens of thousands of unjustified stops in privately owned buildings throughout the city. 

 BODY:
A civil rights group filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday accusing the New York Police Department of illegally stopping tens of thousands of people in privately owned buildings across the city where officers had been given permission to enter by landlords. 
Police officers routinely arrest people on criminal-trespass charges with no justification, the suit says, creating what some residents describe as a police state in which they feel compelled to carry identification while performing mundane tasks like picking up mail or doing laundry.
 And the practice has isolated many residents because friends and relatives are leery of visiting for fear of being stopped by the police, the suit says.
The suit, which seeks class-action status, mirrors arguments in a separate federal lawsuit filed in 2010 against the police and the New York City Housing Authority claiming that public-housing tenants and their visitors are subject to baseless trespassing arrests. 
The latest suit, filed on behalf of 13 plaintiffs by the New York Civil Liberties Union in Manhattan Federal Court, claims that residents and their guests are subject to arbitrary enforcement practices that violate antidiscrimination provisions of the federal Fair Housing Act, as well as their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.
In one instance cited in the suit, a 17-year-old boy who lives in the Bronx described being stopped by the police and questioned after returning from buying ketchup for dinner. His mother, Jaenean Ligon, was asked by officers to go to the lobby to identify her son, who she initially feared was dead or hurt.
Abdullah Turner, 24, was arrested on a trespassing charge as he waited on the sidewalk outside a building in the Bronx where a friend had stopped to drop off a sweater, the suit said. He never entered the lobby, the suit says.
"I don't come out at night - not because I'm afraid of getting hurt, but because of the police," Fawn Bracy, 50, a plaintiff and a resident of the Bronx, said on Wednesday at a news conference in Manhattan. 
The Police Department has come under intense criticism for its stop-and-frisk policy, which detractors say unfairly and overwhelmingly targets blacks and Latinos and yields a limited number of guns and other weapons. The department argues that its tactics have contributed to a sharp reduction in crime.
Police officials cast their efforts along economic lines. They say that officers who challenge uninvited people at privately owned buildings and in public-housing projects provide a layer of security that residents of buildings with doormen take for granted.
"I will suspect that, probably, the attorneys involved in this case live in buildings with doormen, and they have a level of safety that people who live in tenements, which is most of what these buildings are, don't have," Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said on Wednesday when asked about the lawsuit. "That is the service that is being provided." 
Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, dismissed the Police Department's assertion that stop-and-frisk policies kept the public safe as an argument "spun by the spin masters at 1 Police Plaza."
The lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Ms. Lieberman added, "puts a human face on what it's like to live under siege of aggressive policing tactics."
Though the suit lists 13 plaintiffs, their lawyers said the police practice had ensnared a larger number of people who live in the estimated 16,000 privately owned buildings in the city that participate in theClean Halls program, in which landlords provide the police written permission to enter and patrol their buildings.
Though the program began in the early 1990s as a crime-fighting tool, critics contend that it has produced a wave of unlawful stops and trespassing arrests that has paralleled the overall surge in the number of street stops in the city. 
Civil rights lawyers say that officers view the invitation to enter a building - denoted by a metal sign outside - as a license to roam hallways, laundry rooms and stairwells questioning people and making arrests. Officers have also extended this practice to sidewalks, the lawyers said. 
As a result, the suit said, "residents of some Clean Halls buildings warn their friends, family members and others not to visit them for fear that they will be stopped, questioned, searched and issued summonses or arrested for trespassing by N.Y.P.D. officers. Consequently, residents of Clean Halls buildings are restricted in their ability to maintain familial ties, friendships and other relationships with individuals of their choosing."

HEADLINE: Tortilla Factory Owner Arrested Over Business Practices

BYLINE: KIRK SEMPLE


HIGHLIGHT: The 2011 death of a worker at his Brooklyn factory sullied the reputation of Erasmo Ponce, who had become a symbol of immigrant success within the city's Mexican population. 

 BODY:
 The owner of a Brooklyn tortilla factory where a worker died after falling into a mixing machine has been arrested on charges of underpaying employees, falsifying business records and violating workers' compensation and unemployment insurance laws, the authorities said on Wednesday.
 The owner, Erasmo Ponce, faces 26 felony counts and 23 misdemeanor counts, according to a complaint filed in Brooklyn Criminal Court by Eric T. Schneiderman, the state's attorney general. Mr. Ponce surrendered to the authorities on Tuesday and was arraigned and released without bail, his lawyer said.
 Mr. Ponce, a Mexican immigrant, declined to comment on the charges, but his lawyer, Manuel Portela, said he did not think the case merited criminal prosecution.
 "We've been trying to resolve this case on an administrative level," Mr. Portela said, adding that his client "wants to resolve it and move forward in a way that is fair and equitable." 
 Mr. Ponce's company, Tortilleria Chinantla, has been operating under the investigative glare of state and federal officials since Jan. 24, 2011, when Juan Baten, a Guatemalan worker at his tortilla factory in Bushwick, died after falling into a large machine used to mix tortilla dough. Mr. Baten was crushed in the machine's churning mechanism.
 Several days later, state officials shut down the factoryafter discovering that the company had been operating without workers' compensation insurance for nearly a year. 
 The state eventually allowed the factory to reopen, but in July 2011, the federal government cited the company for workplace safety violations carrying fines of more than $62,000. The most serious violation, deemed "willful," involved the failure of the company to install a barrier on the mixer to prevent employees from coming into contact with its fast-moving machinery. 
 Ted Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which conducted that investigation, said Wednesday that the tortilla company had contested the citations and penalties and that the case was still pending.
 Mr. Baten's death and the ensuing investigations have darkened the reputation of Mr. Ponce, whose life had followed the classic trajectory of the striving, up-by-the-bootstraps immigrant. 
 Mr. Ponce was poor when he moved to the United States from Mexico in 1989 and, after a few years of doing manual labor and saving money, he started a small tortilla-making vending business in New York. Within a decade the company grew into a national enterprise with revenue of several million dollars a year.
 His success made him one of the wealthiest and most influential members of the city's growing Mexican diaspora, and he burnished his reputation by donating to various social and political causes in the New York region and in Mexico.
 While he declined to speak on Wednesday about the new set of charges against him, Mr. Ponce chatted enthusiastically about a ceremony he was hosting on Saturday to christen a new mural on his factory's facade. It depicts a workers laboring in a cornfield, he said, and has been popular with the neighbors. 
 "I am working well with the community," he said.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Chief's Pay Jumps to $8.1 Million

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Brian T. Moynihan's 2011 pay was significantly higher than the $1.9 million payout he received in 2010. But some other executives at Bank of America made more than he did. 

 BODY:
Brian T. Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America, earned $8.1 million in 2011, a sharp increase from the $1.9 million payout he received in 2010.
Last year was a turbulent transition for the bank, the second-largest in the United States after JPMorgan Chase, with Bank of America shares dropping below the psychologically important $5 level at one point. During his second year leading the bank, Mr. Moynihan aggressively sold off noncore assets and built up capital levels. Investors have rewarded the strategy more recently, with the stock up sharply in 2012, currently trading at just under $10 a share.
Mr. Moynihan was not the highest paid executive cited in a proxy filing from the bank on Wednesday. Tom Montag, co-chief operating officer of the company and the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, earned more than $14 million. Bruce Thompson, the chief financial officer and a close ally of Mr. Moynihan's, made more than $11 million.
Most of Mr. Moynihan's pay -- $6.1 million -- was in the form of stock grants that vest only if the company meets performance yardsticks over the next three years. Another $950,000 comes in the form of cash compensation, in addition to $420,524 in other pay, including for flights on company aircraft. In addition, $604,698 in pay stemmed from an increase in the value of pension assets.
Bank of America shares have rallied partly on optimism about the outlook for the United States economy, as well as in the wake of the bank's passing the recently completed stress tests ordered by the Federal Reserve. Unlike other competitors, like Citigroup, Bank of America did not try to raise its dividend or buyback stock, preferring to retain capital as part of Mr. Moynihan's call to build a "fortress balance sheet."

HEADLINE: Rexnord Prices Its I.P.O. at $18, at Bottom of Expected Range

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: At the I.P.O. price, Rexnord, a maker of industrial parts based in Milwaukee, will raise $426.6 million and be valued at $1.6 billion. 

 BODY:
The Rexnord Corporation, an industrial parts maker owned by Apollo Global Management, priced its initial public offering at $18 a share, at the bottom of an expected range.
At that price, Rexnord will raise $426.6 million. The offering will value the company, based in Milwaukee, at about $1.6 billion.
Rexnord plans to use its proceeds from the stock sale to pay down some of its bonds due in 2016, as well as to pay Apollo a $15 million fee.
The offering will finally return Rexnord to the public markets, after a number of aborted attempts. It first filed for an I.P.O. in 2006, but was instead sold to Apollo for $1.8 billion. Apollo sought to take the company public in 2008, but was forced to shelve those plans as the financial crisis upended the stock markets.
Apollo purchased Rexnord from the Carlyle Group, which in turn had bought the company from Invensys of Britain.
Private equity firms have been lining up to take their portfolio companies public over the last year, driven by a need to generate realized investment gains for themselves and their investors. 
Rexnord's I.P.O. was led by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Barclays.

HEADLINE: Hawker Beechcraft Is Said to Be Preparing for Bankruptcy Filing

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The business jet maker says it has obtained $120 million in additional loans to buy it time to fix its balance sheet. 

 BODY:
The business jet maker Hawker Beechcraft is readying a bankruptcy filing, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, dealing a blow to its private equity owners, Goldman Sachs and Onex Partners. 
Hawker, which is based in Wichita, Kan., said on Tuesday that it had obtained $120 million in additional loans to buy it time to fix its balance sheet. In exchange, a majority of the company's debt holders agreed to defer some interest payments and grant relief from loan covenants.
One of the options Hawker and its advisers are considering is a prearranged Chapter 11 filing that has the consent of those lenders, principally a number of hedge funds, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among them are the hedge funds Centerbridge Partners and Angelo Gordon.
 A Hawker bankruptcy would be put an end to a 2007 private equity deal that was troubled almost from the start. The company was formed when Goldman and Onex, the largest private equity firm in Canada, bought Raytheon's private jet unit for $3.3 billion, hoping to seize on the fervor for private jets. 
Hawker hit rough times soon afterward, as a recession wiped out many discretionary expenditures like private jets. The company laid off about 2,500 employees, and lost billions of dollars as customers like NetJets canceled orders for new aircraft.
Within two years of the leveraged buyout, Goldman's buyout arm told investors that it had written down the value of the company by 85 percent.
As of Sept. 30, Hawker had more than $2 billion in long-term debt and $146.7 million in cash and short-term investments. It posted an $88.6 million loss for the third quarter of last year, its seventh in a row as its revenue slid to $518.8 million.
A representative for Hawker Beechcraft declined to comment. News of a potential bankruptcy filing was reported earlier by Reuters.
Hawker has made several efforts to fix its business, including by hiring the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Last month, Hawker named Robert S. Miller, the former head of Delphi Automotive and a restructuring specialist, as its chief executive. 
Mr. Miller said in a statement on Tuesday that while the company had taken steps to improve its operations, its debt load is weighing heavily on its turnaround effort. 
"We believe this agreement will stabilize the company's current financial position and ensure Hawker Beechcraft continues manufacturing the best airplanes for our customers and providing first-class service and support," he said. 
A bankruptcy filing of Hawker would be another loss for Goldman's buyout arm, which is contending with a number of troubled investments. Chief among them is Energy Future Holdings, the Texas utility giant formerly known as TXU, whose value has plummeted along with the price of natural gas. Goldman's real estate private equity funds have also struggled. 
The unit's own future is uncertain, given new financial regulations to restrict a bank's ownership of investment operations like private equity.

HEADLINE: Moral Arguments

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Three days of debate at the Supreme Court prompt Brooks and Collins to discuss Justice Kennedy, the social contract, emergency rooms and the constitution. 

 BODY:
David: Oh my, my. We spend years arguing about Obamacare (now its official bipartisan name) and after all that muss and fuss it may be struck down. That's certainly how it looks as the oral arguments come to a close. The view among people who know about this stuff was that the lawyer for the opponents of the law, Paul Clement, was like LeBron James on a fast break while the Solicitor General, Donald Verrilli, was like, well, me on a fast break. Somehow less than impressive.
Gail: David, I am so worried about how this is going to play out that I can't even enjoy a good basketball metaphor. I can't believe this might be overturned. How can this law not be constitutional? The other alternatives are forcing taxpayers to cover the cost of the care in emergency rooms for people who don't want to pay for their insurance, even if they can, or letting human beings just die on the side of the road. I can't believe fiscal conservatives think either of those options is a good idea.
Really, I have my hands over my ears. Not listening.
David: Let's take this in stages. First, on the constitutional level, I can see why the individual mandate might be struck down. It's one thing to regulate activity, it's another thing to force people to do something so you can regulate it. Here's a quotation from Justice Anthony Kennedy making that essential point. The fact that it is Kennedy making this case should be worrying to the law's defenders:
The reason this is concerning is because it requires the individual to do an affirmative act. In the law of torts, our tradition, our law, has been that you don't have the duty to rescue someone if that person is in danger. The blind man is walking in front of a car and you do not have a duty to stop him absent some relation between you. And there is some severe moral criticisms of that rule but that's generally the rule. And here, the government is saying that the federal government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act, and that is different from what we have in previous cases, and that changes the relationship of the federal government to the individual in a very fundamental way.
Gail: You're right about Kennedy. Worst possible person to be making such a fundamental criticism. And I'll bet you most Americans wouldn't agree with his premise, either. Do you think the Constitution really protects Americans' freedom not to stop a blind man from walking in front of a car?
David: Now let's go to the philosophical level. While I think the individual mandate is constitutionally suspect, I think it's philosophically acceptable.
Gail: If there is anything the Roberts court has taught us, it's that constitutionality is in the eye of the beholder. And I am pretty sure the founding fathers wouldn't have let that blind guy get run over.
David: The individual mandate was actually the subject of a big debate several years ago on the right. Many conservatives were fine with it then. The argument was that if you crash your Porsche, society is under no obligation to repair your Porsche. But there is a social obligation to save you if you are dying from injuries sustained by the crash. In that sense, health care is different from other goods. The social compact commands us to save one another's lives. The libertarians disagreed with this position and said that society had no absolute obligation to pay for this, though of course it would be virtuous to do so.
I was for the individual mandate then and remain for it philosophically while I may be against it constitutionally. On this issue, I may be the only person on the planet whose philosophic preference differs from his constitutional position.
Gail: This is why I like arguing with you. You appreciate the real fight here. People don't actually have the choice of being left to die on the side of the road. And I must say that it's ironic that the same people who are calling on the government to stop women from ending even a pregnancy that's just a few hours old are making the implicit argument that it'd be perfectly fine to hospitalize only the car crash victims who can show ability to pay.
David: Now let's get down to politics. If the law is struck down, who benefits? I think Obama benefits. Republicans were going to make health care a main plank of their campaign. They may not be able to run on the economy, but Obamacare was the centerpiece of their argument that this election is fundamentally about small government versus big government. Without Obamacare as exhibit A, they can still make that case but it is weaker. Republicans will be deprived of their core issue, this unpopular law.
Of course if it is struck down, Republicans could say, "We told you so." But nobody ever got elected on the basis of "We told you so."
Gail: You may be right, but there are things more important than the election. We've been struggling over health care for how long? Since Clinton? Johnson? Teddy Roosevelt? This isn't just crucial to our having a better society - it's crucial to getting a handle on health care costs, and without doing that, we'll never get the deficit under control.
On the plus side, I do totally believe that in the long run, if the law is struck down, eventually we'll stop messing around with a choice between half-baked plans and just have the government cover everyone the way it does in most sensible countries. On the minus, it probably won't happen in my lifetime.
David: If I had more gumption, I'd go back and find all the arguments Obama used in the primary campaign against the individual mandate when he was against it and Clinton was for it. Odd that his signature achievement might be struck down for a provision that he opposed.
Gail: Totally true. Hillary Clinton kept pointing out that if you didn't make everybody join in, the private-insurance version of universal health care wouldn't work. She was right. He finally admitted it.
David: The final interesting question is where we go from here.
Gail: I'm O.K. with going back to the Hillary point. The alternative to making everybody have private health insurance is to go to government-sponsored health care for all.
David: I'm just beginning to investigate this, but I'm beginning to think the Swiss health care system may be one that both parties could live with, a compromise between universal coverage and market mechanisms. Of course I'm pretending that we live in a country where the two parties try to seek common ground, which is absurd.
Gail: This already was one big compromise, David. It was basically a Republican idea to begin with, and look what happened. If this is thrown out in court, compromise will never get any traction again. Single payer! Single payer! Maybe you could have wooed me into the middle a few years ago, but no more. No more. Next time around we stop talking about complicated reforms and just go with Medicare for everybody.

HEADLINE: The Lighter Side of Destroying Jobs

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: On Wednesday, Mitt Romney joked about the time his father shut down a Michigan auto plant. 

 BODY:
Another candidate might have stayed away from a joke about closing auto plants. Considering that Mitt Romney's private equity company forced thousands of layoffs at companies it purchased, and that he opposed a bailout of the auto industry that saved hundreds of thousands of jobs, it's a subject he would be well-advised to avoid.
But Mr. Romney doesn't seem to have the internal warning signal granted to most politicians. And so, in a conference call with Wisconsin supporters on Wednesday, Mr. Romney made another unforced error, jesting about a fateful decision by his father, the president of American Motors, that left a deep scar on Detroit.

Preparing for the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, he told several thousand voters on the call that "one of the most humorous" connections he had to the state came when his father, George Romney, closed an auto plant in Michigan and moved it to Wisconsin. When the elder Mr. Romney later ran for governor of Michigan, the son recalled, the plant closure became a rather sensitive subject, especially when a school band played the Wisconsin fight song at a parade.
According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Mr. Romney laughed as he told the story yesterday. "So every time they would start playing 'On, Wisconsin, On, Wisconsin,' my dad's political people would jump up and down and try to get them to stop," Mr. Romney said, "because they didn't want people in Michigan to be reminded that my dad had moved production to Wisconsin."
Nearly six decades later, the hard edges of that moment have worn down to the point where Mr. Romney didn't seem to give it much thought. But in fact, the closure of that plant was just as painful for its workers back then as layoffs are now.
The plant in question produced cars for Hudson Motors, which at its peak in 1950 employed more than 25,000 workers in Detroit. The company was absorbed into the newly formed American Motors in 1954, which struggled against the Big 3 automakers and soon began merging plants and laying off workers. Under Mr. Romney, Hudson production was moved to Kenosha, Wisc., beginning in 1954, one of the first companies to walk out on Detroit.
The plant was closed a few years later after being converted to military contracts, but the thousands of people who lost their jobs didn't forget. In 1955, the wife of a laid-off worker received a flyer from American Motors urging Detroit workers to buy American Motors cars. As recounted in the book "Storied Independent Automakers: Nash, Hudson, and American Motors," by Charles K. Hyde, she erupted in anger in a letter to the company:
What a colossal nerve you have. After laying off your employees, you have the audacity to mail your old employees a leaflet, to come & view your appliances & cars. May I be so bold as to ask, what would they use for money? These men have been out of work for four months. Still, their mortgages, utilities, taxes & etc, go on just the same. I really cannot say just what I am thinking of you, but your shell-like ears would burn to a crisp, if I ever met you in person.
It's the kind of letter that could still be written to a company with a tin ear. Or to a politician who doesn't understand that plant closings are never a laughing matter.

HEADLINE: When the World Tackled an Environmental Threat, and Won

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A film documentary explores how nations are trying to repair the hole in the ozone layer -- and how, in a far cry from today's status quo, American politicians unite on the issue. 

 BODY:
In 1974, Dr. Sherwood Rowland, a young research scientist, warned the world that chlorofluorocarbons, man-made chemicals found in aerosol sprays and refrigerators, were damaging the earth's ozone layer. It took 13 years of bitter debate among governments, business leaders, scientists and concerned citizens before the world accepted his findings and moved to ban these chemicals through an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, in 1987. 
Dr. Rowland died this month at age 84. Many of the articles about his life have recounted the success of the Montreal Protocol and ruminated on what lessons might be applied in seeking action on climate change.
"Shattered Sky," a new documentary by the independent filmmakers Steve Dorst and Dan Evans that had its premiere last week at the Environmental Film Festival in Washington (see the trailer above), explores how the United States led the way in seeking a solution to the ozone problem. The film tells its story through archival news footage and interviews with 18 prominent figures, including Dr. Rowland and his fellow researcher Mario Molina as well as administration officials from the late 1980s like George P. Shultz, then secretary of state, and Lee Thomas, then the Environmental Protection Agency administrator .
Mr. Dorst responded to questions about the film via e-mail. Here are some excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity.
Q.
In solving the ozone crisis, who were the champions, and what lessons can be applied to today's climate change debate?
A.
In both climate and ozone you have a lot of parallels: an invisible substance threatens Earth's life-support systems; scientific debate; business bitterly opposed to change; and a powerful citizen voice. Ultimately, the difference on ozone is that our leaders acted in good conscience. E.P.A. Administrator Lee Thomas stands out for me as a bridge between President Reagan, big business and the environmental community. 
Thomas told me that in Reagan's cabinet, they weren't debating the science - they were debating risk-management decisions. So for me, "Shattered Sky" is not about the science. It's about what a responsible leader does when there's a good chance the science is right. It's important to remember that the first draft of the ozone treaty wasn't perfect. It was a first step. It showed the world that America was committed to lead - and that made all the difference.
Q.
But isn't climate change a much more difficult problem to solve because it ultimately involves transforming our energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels? 
A.
Yes, climate change is complex. But before the ozone treaty, the ozone crisis was considered an extraordinarily complicated issue. Business had billions of dollars invested internationally in chlorofluorocarbons in air conditioning, solvents and refrigeration. Regulation would create economic winners and losers -- just like a price on carbon pollution would today. But almost as soon as America led the world to a treaty, DuPont started mass-producing a chlorofluorocarbon replacement. So there's a strong link between federal regulation and innovation. 
Q.
Was the ozone threat more tangible for people compared with climate change because of personal safety concerns like skin cancer and cataracts?
A.
In 1985 we learned that the ozone hole over Antarctica was the size of North America, so it provoked a real sense of urgency. And it was well recognized that a depleted ozone layer would lead to more skin cancer. People also say that since President Reagan battled with skin cancer, this made a difference at the top.
Q.
Based on your discussions with Dr. Rowland, what was his view on the role of scientists in bringing about political solutions to environmental challenges?
A.
I interviewed Dr. Rowland twice for the film, in June 2007 and in February 2009. He was a strong proponent that if scientists believe in their findings, they should speak out on what society should do - that it's important to play a role as a citizen.
Q.
What do you want people to do after watching the film?
A.
People tell me they like "Shattered Sky" because it is a rare success story, and it's bipartisan. I want people to stop debating the science already. If there's a 50-50 chance the science is right, then let's take the example of the ozone crisis and start considering fundamental solutions. I'm hearing from younger viewers that they didn't know President Reagan supported strong ozone regulation or that President Nixon passed the initial Clean Air Act or that acid rain regulations came during the first President Bush's term. The real message of "Shattered Sky" is that taking responsibility for issues that affect our environment and economy is not partisan.

HEADLINE: If Health Law Is Overturned, What Will Liberals Do?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: For many progressive activists and voters, the decision by the court in June could reopen a debate that they thought they lost two years ago. 

 BODY:
If the Supreme Court strikes down all or part of President Obama's health care law, it will have unraveled a legislative compromise that many liberals had viewed with suspicion from the beginning.
In one of the ironies of recent politics, Mr. Obama was a late convert to the merits of the individual mandate that now appears to be in danger of being declared unconstitutional.
But the president's embrace of the mandate - and his willingness to abandon a so-called public option to get a health care deal - was a hard pill to swallow for many of his Democratic supporters.
The Affordable Care Act promises to provide health insurance to millions who lacked it. But it also stops far short of the idea that health care is a basic right for everyone living in the country. And it embraces the market-based system of private health care delivery that has long existed in America.
For many progressive activists and voters, the decision by the court in June could reopen a debate that they thought they had lost two years ago. Rather than be dismayed if the court overturns the health care law, some liberals may see it as an unexpected opportunity.
Politically, there is almost no chance of a new effort to achieve universal health care coverage before the election in the fall. But if the current law is overturned, eventually there would be a new push from Democrats to achieve the goals they have pursued for decades.
Still, it's far from clear how progressives might regroup if the court rules against the mandate, as Tuesday's questions from the justices suggested they might.
Here are three possibilities:
SALVAGE: If the justices invalidate the individual mandate but stop short of declaring the entire law unconstitutional, progressives could try to fix it through other means. 
Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has suggested a couple of options. Mr. Gruber was an adviser to both Mitt Romney on his health care plan in Massachusetts and to Mr. Obama.
In a paper written last year for the Center for American Progress, a research and advocacy group, he said the mandate could be replaced by a requirement that people "auto-enroll" in health insurance but with the ability to opt out if they wanted to.
Or, he said, people could be encouraged to buy insurance, and fined a penalty if they signed up after a deadline. That might encourage more participation in the health insurance market by young, healthy people.
But Mr. Gruber concluded that neither would be particularly effective, saying that "both alternatives significantly erode the gains in public health and insurance affordability made possible by the Affordable Care Act."
EXPAND: If the court declares large parts of the health care law unconstitutional, another option for liberals would be a return to advocating other methods to expand the number of people covered by insurance.
They could push for an expansion of Medicare to include coverage of people at an earlier age. And they could seek to include more people in government-run health care programs that cover children and the poor.
Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, said she remained hopeful that the court would uphold the health care law. But if it doesn't, she said she remained skeptical about other proposals.
"There is no proposal that I am aware of that operates without an individual mandate that gets you to that level of coverage," she said in an interview with The Caucus on Tuesday.
Congress would be unwilling to act on expansions of government health care programs if the current law is invalidated.
"We are a long way away," from another successful legislative effort on health care, she said. "It would be decades, and may not be in my lifetime."
SINGLE PAYER: If Democrats make little progress on alternatives, some purists might decide it's best to just renew the case for a single-payer system in which all Americans receive health care paid for by the government.
Sidney M. Wolfe, the director of the Health Research Group at Public Citizen, an advocacy group, has been pushing for government-run health care for decades. 
In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Wolfe said a ruling against the current law could help start a renewed drive for a system that essentially expanded Medicare into a program for everyone, not just the elderly.
"If this is what happens, it may offer more incentive to say let's decide once and for all that health care is a right," Mr. Wolfe said. "It will certainly present an opportunity to a number of people."
But it's not clear where the support for such a change would come from, especially after the bruising fight over Mr. Obama's health care plan two years ago. Ms. Tanden said that she did not believe the country would support such a change.
"I am not holding my breath for the Medicare-for-all option. Most people in America feel comfortable with the health insurance they have," she said. "I would say to my progressive allies: the reason we have all been supporting the individual mandate is because it is the way in which we can get to near-universal coverage in my lifetime."
"They may look at this as an opportunity to carry that torch again," she added. "I don't think the Congressional response is to look at single-payer as the option."

HEADLINE: New Polls Show Worries Over Gas Prices

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: Surveys in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- and nationally -- show that economic woes are on voters' minds. 

 BODY:
New national and state polls show that the Republican candidates are still struggling to capture the attention and backing of voters, and while the public sees President Obama more favorably, he continues to face serious challenges to his re-election, particularly with the economy, gas prices and Afghanistan.
Surveys conducted by Quinnipiac University showed Mr. Obama leading both Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in the two critical swing states, Ohio and Florida, by 6 to 13 percentage points, and with a narrower lead in Pennsylvania.
 But voters in all three states were divided over whether or not the president deserves re-election.
About two-thirds of voters in each state think the economy is still in a recession, but majorities also say the economy is beginning to recover. Voters in these swing states are divided over whether Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will do a better job on the economy, but fewer think Mr. Santorum will do a better job compared to Mr. Obama.
On higher gas prices, voters are also more likely to allocate blame on oil-producing countries and oil companies than on Mr. Obama, but a majority in each state say that environmental regulations deserve some or a great deal of blame for recent increases in the cost of gasoline.
About two-thirds of voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania say the United States should not be involved in Afghanistan right now, and just over half approve of the way Mr. Obama is handling the situation there. At least a third in each state say troops are not being removed quickly enough, and less than half say the removal of troops is being handled about right.
In Florida, where Mr. Romney won the state's Republican primary decisively at the end of January, support for Mr. Obama has grown in the last few months. He now leads Mr. Romney by 7 percentage points, and Mr. Santorum by 13 points. 
In late January, voters were divided 45-45 over Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, and in earlier polls from November, December and early January, Mr. Romney had a 3 point edge over Mr. Obama. And while men are evenly divided for Mr. Obama, women went for Mr. Obama over Mr. Romney by 14 points. 
In Ohio, where Mr. Romney eked out a narrow win over Mr. Santorum in the state's Republican primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Obama has a 6-point lead over Mr. Romney, and a 7 point advantage over Mr. Santorum. Again, strength for the president came from women voters, as well as younger voters, Hispanics, and those with a college degree. 
 In Pennsylvania, the Republican primary is now less than a month away, and Mr. Obama has 45 percent of support to Mr. Romney's 42 percent - two weeks ago, Mr. Obama led Mr. Romney, 46 to 40 percent. Against Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama leads, 48 to 41 percent. 
A national McClatchy-Marist Poll showed that Americans are divided over the state of the economy, with 49 percent say the worst is behind us and 45 percent saying there is more bad news ahead, a more positive outlook than in November, when 53 percent say the worst was still to come.
About three-quarters of Americans say increasing gas prices are putting a moderate or great deal of strain on their family budget. About a third blamed unrest in the Middle East, a third said oil companies were the problem, and about one in 10 said the president and Democrats in Congress were at fault. 
A new nationwide ABC News/Washington Post poll found just 34 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of Mr. Romney, the a record low for any leading presidential candidate in a primary season in ABC/Post survey data since 1984. Only two other candidates have had lower favorability scores in 28 years of ABC/Post polling: Newt Gingrich this year and Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008.
Mr. Obama has a favorable rating of 53 percent, the third consecutive month in which 50 percent or more of Americans have viewed him favorably. His lowest rating of his presidency, 47 percent, was in September. The president has stronger favorability among independents than Mr. Romney, 50 percent to 35 percent, and among moderates, 61 percent to 35 percent - both key groups of voters in November. 
From March 20 to 26, Quinnipiac University conducted a telephone survey of 1,228 Florida voters, 1,246 Ohio voters, and 1,232 Pennsylvania voters; all had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent. The ABC News/Washington Post telephone poll was conducted March 21-25, among 1,016 adults nationwide, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The McClatchy-Marist telephone survey of 1,080 adults nationwide was conducted March 20-22 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Passage to India

BYLINE: NIKHILA GILL


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs holds its board meeting in India for the first time. The meeting may be among the last for John H. Bryan, Goldman's lead director, who recently turned 75 and may have to step down. 

 BODY:
10:36 a.m. | Updated 
NEW DELHI - Nestled in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city here sits the Leela Palace hotel. This week, its ninth floor has been home to the board of Goldman Sachs.
This is the first time the firm's directors have gathered in India and one of only a handful of times they have met outside of the United States. This meeting is viewed as a nod to India's growing importance, both to Goldman and to the American economy. Goldman and other banks are increasingly looking overseas for business to offset a slowdown at home. Also this week, leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are meeting here for their 2012 summit meeting. 
Goldman directors are required a key card to enter their meeting area, but hotel staff also let visitors up without one. Directors, most of whom were dressed casually, some in polo shirts and jeans, were tight-lipped about the agenda for the meeting when approached by DealBook. But there is certainly no shortage of topics for discussion.
It has been a rough few months for the big bank. Goldman, along with the rest of Wall Street, struggled with lackluster earnings in 2011, and it recently faced conflict-of-interest allegations from a Delaware judge, who criticized Goldman over the multiple roles it played in brokering an energy deal. 
Then, earlier this month, a Goldman employee, Greg Smith, sent shock waves through Wall Street when he quit the firm and announced his resignation in an opinion article in The New York Times, criticizing the firm for putting its own interests first and "ripping off clients."
This week, Goldman directors are expected to review the bank's first quarter results, which are scheduled to be released on April 17. So far, 2012 is looking better financially than last year. 
Financial analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are predicting that Goldman will earn a profit of $3.25 a share, which is up from estimates just a month ago when they were forecasting a profit of $2.94 a share. Estimates are likely to continue to trend up in the weeks leading up to earnings. In the first quarter of 2011, Goldman reported a per-share profit of $3.39. 
This meeting may also be one of the last for John H. Bryan, Goldman's lead director. Mr. Bryan, a former chief executive and chairman of Sara Lee, has been on the board since 1999, the year Goldman went public. He recently turned 75, which will prompt his mandatory retirement from the board unless directors ask him to stick around. 
Goldman directors are arriving in New Delhi to be welcomed at the hotel by decorative sandstone elephants. The ninth floor of the hotel is the royal club floor, which displays some of India's most renowned contemporary artists including Satish Gujral, Paresh Maity, and Dimpy Mennon, according the hotel's representatives. 
There is also a large, brightly lit conference room and a long, narrow, carpeted corridor with rooms on either side, some of which were converted into temporary offices for the board members.
The hotel itself is loaded with after-hours options for directors, including the restaurants like Le Cirque, which bills itself as an "institution known for its clubby atmosphere and comfort food for billionaires." Rooms start at roughly $200 a night.

HEADLINE: A Critical Test of the Health Care Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Sharp Questions in Court on Health Law Mandate'' (front page, March 28):
The comparisons conservative justices made between health care and other consumer products and services, including cellphones, burial services and food, were disappointing insofar as they reflect a refusal to accept the full dimensions of the health care crisis.
None of the examples cited are in any way equivalent to health care in their effects on the economy and the public obligation to serve as the provider of last resort. None have costs spiraling out of control or such enormous consequences for public health and welfare. 
The suggestion that mandating the choice of a vegetable can be equated with mandating participation in the health care system (or pay a penalty) is offensive. Such comparisons are precisely the sort of clever sophistry that undermines public confidence in the judiciary.
ALAN MILLER Rockville, Md., March 28, 2012
To the Editor:
How different is our health mandate from compulsory education, seat belt laws and the long list of government programs that have traded some of our civil liberties for the quality of life that benefits us all as Americans?
LIZ HAWKINS TAHAWI Piedmont, Calif., March 28, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''The Supreme Court's Momentous Test'' (editorial, March 28):
Part of me, as a liberal who perceives our health care system to be broken, would like to believe the Supreme Court will approve the individual mandate. But the most basic issue in this case prevents me from hoping for such a ruling. That issue is to what extent government can intrude on a person's sovereignty.
Government can mandate automobile insurance because no one is forced to buy a car. But we all have a body and a life, and since the founders were clear that individuals retain all rights not expressly yielded by legislation, the burden should be on government to prove that such a serious incursion into some of our most personal liberties (how one treats one's life and body) is warranted.
Part of this burden is to assert that there is no better solution than forcing individuals to buy a commercial product. In fact, a universal, government-sponsored plan would better suit our purposes than would the setting of a treacherous precedent. The Declaration of Independence promises us life and liberty. Surely health is inseparable from life and is important enough to remove from the private sector, which pursues profit, and place in the public sector, which exists to secure our liberties.
THOMAS HEIDEN Stratford, Conn., March 28, 2012
To the Editor:
In discussing the mandate to buy health insurance, one justice compared it to purchasing broccoli. But there is a far closer comparison. The Social Security law for decades has mandated contributions during citizens' younger years for their benefit in old age. The two laws seem parallel to me.
ANNORA KARR Toledo, Ohio, March 28, 2012
To the Editor:
In the 1930s the Supreme Court, for a time, used the Constitution to negate legislative efforts to lift the country out of what today we would call a third-world economy.
Mandated health insurance is redistributive -- let us be candid about that because that is the nature of insurance, social and otherwise -- but without this mild redistributive effect, the United States will continue its fall to third-world ranking.
MICHAEL A. WOLFF St. Louis, March 28, 2012
The writer is a professor of law at Saint Louis University and a former judge on the Supreme Court of Missouri.
To the Editor:
Re ''In Real World, Mandate Stirs Some Dissent'' (front page, March 28):
You quote a Massachusetts resident, Wayde Lodor, as saying, ''I really feel strongly this isn't something that should be foisted on me.'' Well, Mr. Lodor, neither is a heart attack.
But, even someone like Mr. Lodor who claims, as I did, ''I'm in good shape, I don't eat meat, I don't drink excessively, I've never smoked,'' can, at 53, get a medical surprise that he won't be able to pay for. I know. It happened to me.
Only I was 47, had no health insurance and ended up spending over $20,000 for my three-day stay in the hospital, part of it in intensive care.
Whether you live here in Massachusetts (where health insurance is a mandate) or anywhere else in this country (where it is not), regardless of your life style, the need for health care may be only one heart attack away.
PETER MILLER Carlisle, Mass., March 28, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Step to the Center,'' by David Brooks (column, March 27):
It is fine in the abstract to pose questions about ''centralization,'' but in the day-to-day world, the real question is, Who controls decisions about one's health care and coverage? As someone who has been denied coverage for a pre-existing condition (10 years back with no recurrence), and subsequently found insurance at exorbitant rates accompanied by high deductibles, I think the issue is not one of government centralization. It is one of providing adequate health care coverage at affordable rates to all of our citizens.
This is a perfect example of where, when the private sector acts in ways contrary to the public good, the government needs to step in. The Affordable Care Act provides both the coverage and the protections that too many Americans are denied under the current system. I, for one, am glad that my government is there watching out for me and others like me.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Court Reverses Foreign Maids' Residency Ruling

BYLINE: By KEVIN DREW

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court on Wednesday overturned a ruling from last year that would have allowed foreign-born domestic workers to apply for permanent residency, the latest decision in a closely watched case. 
Chief Judge Andrew Cheung, writing for the three-member panel of the High Court, said that an immigration ordinance restricting residency rights for domestic workers was constitutional, a decision that strikes down a local court ruling from September.
Mark Daly, a lawyer for Evangeline Banao Vallejos, the Philippine-born domestic worker at the center of the case, said an appeal of Wednesday's ruling to the Court of Final Appeal, Hong Kong's highest court is probable, but a decision had not yet been made.
Many foreign-born residents are eligible to apply for permanent residency after living in Hong Kong for seven consecutive years, a status that grants greater rights, like being allowed to live in the territory without a visa, and access to benefits including public housing and social security.
Ms. Vallejos, a domestic worker who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 25 years, challenged the immigration department ordinance and won a ruling last Sept. 30, when a judge called the department's ruling a violation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's effective constitution since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Domestic workers who look after children and perform household chores form the majority of non-Chinese residents in this territory of seven million. They are generally given room and board, work six days a week and earn a minimum wage of 3,740 Hong Kong dollars, or $480, a month, below that set for other workers.
Rights advocates said that Hong Kong's guaranteed one day off a week and minimum wage are standards for domestic workers that exceed those of other Asian economies. But they called Wednesday's ruling a missed opportunity for the territory to promote the rights of workers across the region.
''This is an example of where Hong Kong could have sent an example,'' said Nisha Varia, a senior researcher in New York for Human Rights Watch. ''When workers are on temporary contracts, usually they are at higher risk for discrimination or abuse.''
In its ruling on Wednesday, the three-judge panel said the Basic Law does allow the exclusion of foreign domestic workers from consideration for permanent residency.
''It is a category of exclusion not different in kind, but only in degree, from the pre-existing categories of excluded persons, for instance, Vietnamese refugees and imprisoned or detained persons,'' Judge Cheung wrote in the opinion.
Polls late last year showed broad public concern that granting domestic workers the right to seek permanent resident status could raise the costs of welfare and medical benefits.
An estimated 285,000 foreign domestic workers, most from Indonesia and the Philippines, were living in Hong Kong at the end of 2010, 117,000 of whom had resided in the territory for at least seven years, according to last September's court ruling, which cited government figures.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Levies Large Fines In Freight Price-Fixing Case

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The participants in a freight cartel were caught not so much red-handed as green-fingered.
Seeking to conceal their price-fixing activities, employees from freight companies like United Parcel Service and Kuehne & Nagel used nicknames like Head Planter, Gardener, Cat Weasel and Horticulturalist, the European Commission said Wednesday. 
They also shared an unusually strong interest in asparagus, ''marrows'' and ''baby courgettes,'' which they discussed in e-mails and during meetings in pubs and restaurants including a traditional Italian establishment near Heathrow Airport.
But rather than sharing tips on gardening, the participants were using the names of vegetables as code words for surcharges on important trade routes between Europe and the United States.
''These participants in these cartels were fully aware of the illegal nature of their activities, and they often took specific measures to try to conceal their behavior,'' said Joaquin Almunia, the European Union competition commissioner. ''Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result.''
The horticultural terminology was used in one of four cartels, known as the Gardening Club. The other cartels, which combined many of the same companies, were also involved in fixing prices of various freight forwarding charges during periods from 2002 to 2007, the commission said.
Mr. Almunia announced total fines in the case of 169 million euros ($225 million). Kuehne & Nagel, a Swiss company involved in all four cartels, was fined 53.7 million euros, the largest amount.
Karl Gernandt, the chairman of Kuehne & Nagel, said his company was considering bringing an appeal because it was ''of the opinion that the commission has not correctly investigated the facts'' and had ''drawn significantly incorrect factual and legal conclusions.''
Panalpina World Transport, also based in Switzerland and involved in three of the cartels, including a ''Breakfast Meetings'' cartel that met in Hong Kong and fixed surcharges on routes between Europe and China, was fined 46.5 million euros. Panalpina said it might appeal the decision, adding that its position was ''supported by independent economic evidence, that the infringements likely did not affect prices paid by Panalpina's customers.''
Deutsche Bahn, and its Schenker and Bax units, and Yusen Air and Sea Service of Japan, were among companies that received reductions in their fines for cooperating with regulators.
U.P.S., based in the United States and involved in three of the cartels, was fined 9.8 million euros.
DHL, which was involved in all four cartels, and Exel -- both subsidiaries of Deutsche Post -- were not fined because they had alerted the antitrust agencies to the cartels.

HEADLINE: Shares Dip Lower, Led by Oil Prices

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The Wall Street rally of 2012 lost some steam on Wednesday as commodity prices fell, sending stocks lower as investors weighed the possibility that the time had come for the market to pull back.
The three main stock indexes were down as much as 1 percent in afternoon trading, though they regained some ground by the end of the session. The Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index all closed down 0.5 percent.
The losses were far from steep enough to put a dent in what has been a strong first-quarter gain in stocks this year, but the depth and speed of the day's declines recalled the much more volatile trading of 2011. 
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said that after the strong push in the first three months of the year, many traders were bracing for the possibility of a correction.
''We have got an investor mind-set that is already jittery by how far and how fast this market has come,'' he said.
Analysts said several factors were likely to have depressed trading Wednesday. Mr. Paulsen said one catalyst was probably the decline in oil prices.
Crude prices fell after news agency reports that the United States might release some of its strategic oil stocks and that it was in talks with France and Britain about the possible step, aimed at pushing down oil prices.
In addition, the Energy Information Administration reported that United States crude inventories posted their largest weekly climb since July 2010.
The decline in crude oil also brought down gold prices, analysts said. Crude oil for May delivery fell $1.92 to $105.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold spot prices were down by more than 1 percent to $1,662 an ounce.
For the day, the S.& P. 500 lost 6.98 points to 1,405.54, while the Dow dropped 71.52 points to 13,126.21. The Nasdaq shed 15.39 points to 3,104.96.
Still, the S.& P. 500, a broad measure of the market, is up more than 11 percent this year, while the Dow industrials are ahead more than 7 percent. The Nasdaq is up more than 19 percent, mostly helped by Apple.
But with first-quarter earnings reports ready to come out in April, and mixed economic data continuing to trickle out, investors are slightly on edge.
''You can sense the climate changing,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''We are facing earnings season right around the corner. Any catalyst today could have done this.''
Among other factors that weighed on commodity prices was a Goldman Sachs report that the economic environment for the second quarter was likely to soften for commodities, although tension in the Middle East could change that.
And signs emerged of a slowdown in private sector lending in Europe, analysts said. The European Central Bank said Wednesday that the growth of such loans had slowed to an annual rate of 1.1 percent from 1.5 percent in January, raising issues of liquidity, other analysts said.
The Commerce Department reported that that orders for durable goods rose 2.2 percent in February. The report suggested good news for manufacturing, but the gain was below analysts' forecasts of 3 percent.
''Over all, the numbers weighed on sentiment as they indicated that the economic recovery may not be as strong as initially anticipated,'' said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for FOREX.com.
Energy and materials shares were down 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. Financial stocks declined slightly. Exxon Mobil was down 0.88 percent at $85.86, and Halliburton was down more than 1 percent at $32.48. Materials shares fell the hardest. Freeport McMoran Copper was down 3.59 percent at $37.36. Alcoa dropped 2.29 percent to $9.83 and United States Steel was down 1.77 percent at $28.81.
The trading day on Wall Street started out on a negative note passed on by overseas markets. European markets were lower, with the DAX index in Frankfurt and the CAC 40 in Paris both down 1.1 percent.
Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist for Merlin Securities, said, ''When you see oil starts the day down strongly, it is no surprise to see gold get knocked down along with other commodities.''
Mr. Bensignor said, however, that the modest decline in the indexes at the close of trading belied what had at times been a volatile session of profit-taking. For example the VIX, or the CBOE volatility index, an indicator of future volatility, spiked about 6 percent during the session, before falling back to 15.47, not far from its 52-week low of 13.66.
''People took today's negative news along with some technical resistance that has been showing up in the market to do a little trimming, and that steamrolled a bit during the day,'' Mr. Bensignor said. In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury fell 4/32, to 98 7/32, pushing its yield up to 2.20 percent, from 2.19 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Family Visits Rights Lawyer Held in China

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Gao Zhisheng, the Chinese human rights lawyer whose whereabouts and well-being have been something of a mystery for the past two years, is alive and in good health, according to relatives who visited him in prison last weekend. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Gao's wife, Geng He, said her father and Mr. Gao's brother had been allowed a half-hour visit with him at a prison in the far western region of Xinjiang.
''He was very pale, like someone who hasn't been in the sunlight for years, but otherwise he seemed healthy,'' Ms. Geng said, speaking from California, where she lives in exile with the couple's two children. ''After hearing the news from my family, I slept well for the first time in a long while.''
A widely known dissident here, Mr. Gao, 47, was a celebrated lawyer until he ran afoul of the government by taking on politically delicate cases and exposing shortcomings in the legal system. His clients included victims of medical malpractice and farmers who had lost their land to development, but also persecuted Christians and adherents of Falun Gong, the outlawed spiritual movement. In 2005, he renounced his Communist Party membership and scathingly criticized the government in letters he sent to Chinese leaders.
He was stripped of his law license and taken into custody a year later, in the first of several detentions. He was convicted of inciting subversion of state power. Released on probation, he was largely kept under house arrest, and his family was subjected to constant surveillance. During interrogations, he said, he had been pistol-whipped, prodded with electric batons and lanced with bamboo sticks.
In 2009, his wife and children made a dramatic overland escape from Beijing to Thailand with the help of a Christian organization. They were later granted asylum in the United States.
Mr. Gao's case has drawn scrutiny from the White House, the United Nations and the European Union, which have urged the Chinese government to explain his whereabouts and release him from custody. During the past two years, Ms. Geng said she wondered whether he was alive.
Last December, the state news media issued a terse statement saying Mr. Gao had been returned to jail for three years because he had violated the terms of his probation. Human rights advocates questioned the ruling, given that Mr. Gao had been continuously in police custody. In January, his brother, Gao Zhiyi, said he had been informed that Mr. Gao was in a prison in Shaya County, in Xinjiang. But until this week, the authorities had not allowed relatives to visit him.
Ms. Geng said that the brief visit on Saturday was closely supervised by the police and that the conversation, via telephone through thick glass, was highly circumscribed. ''He couldn't speak about what had happened to him, but my father didn't really care,'' she said. ''He was just thrilled to find him alive.''

HEADLINE: Head of the S.B.A. Talks of Banks, Loans and Turnaround Time

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Much has changed since Karen Mills, the administrator for the Small Business Administration, first sat down with us back in the fall of 2009. The economy is improving, unemployment is falling, and S.B.A. lending is back to pre-recession levels. Ms. Mills's agency, however, still faces pressing challenges. Fewer S.B.A. loans are reaching the smallest, underserved businesses. And both the agency and the Obama administration are under intense pressure to show that they are creating jobs, even as the White House proposes new cuts to the S.B.A. budget.
Last week, The Agenda sat down with Ms. Mills once more to discuss some of these issues - and to ask her questions submitted by You're the Boss readers. What follows is a condensed version of that conversation. Special thanks to the readers who submitted questions.
Q. 
John Cooper wrote to share his suspicions of guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses: ''It goes without saying that if a commercial bank loan needs an S.B.A. guarantee, then it must not be too creditworthy to begin with.'' What is the S.B.A.'s mission in lending?
A.
Our role is to provide access and opportunity. Let's say you are a really good small business, and the banks says the last two years have been a little tough, you don't quite meet my standards, but I'd like to give you the loan. That's when they use the S.B.A. guarantee. And these loans actually perform really well. Our loss rate is really 2 percentage points higher than the average of all losses. So for the risk we are taking, these are people who should get credit but the market is not functioning perfectly. And that is where we step in.
Q.
Michael J. Knight, an accountant in Fairfield, Conn., asks, ''Why isn't there a streamlined application for businesses that invest in getting it right -- such as by meeting regularly with accountants, preparing monthly financial statements, establishing internal controls? They don't get any more consideration by the S.B.A. than the guy who has no books and uses Score to prepare his loan application.''
A.
We have a streamlined loan application now really for everyone - we want everybody to be able to do it well. That is why we have Score representatives, that is why we have Small Business Development Centers, and we can help a small business who may not have the experience to prepare a banking package.
Q.
Everybody complains about the paperwork on S.B.A. loans - why does the process take so long?
A.
Our turnaround time for loans is 10 days. The paperwork is actually not very much -- and we have taken it down. Our CapLines program -- which we just redid -- had 46 forms. Now it has eight, and they are optional. What takes the time is the small business preparing the application, answering questions. And that is why I say, go first to one of our counselors -- remember they're free. Spend the time getting yourself ready.
Q.
But you hear these stories - one loan broker told us that if he takes a client for an S.B.A. loan, it takes at least 11 weeks to close. But if he takes a client to a community bank, it's four weeks.
A.
I don't think that would be substantiated overall. Banks are working with mostly their own documents. There is not a major set of incremental documents for the S.B.A.
Q.
Will counselors really help you with the loan documents?
A.
Absolutely. For example, in the height of the crisis, when a lot of people were getting turned down by their banks, our North Carolina Small Business Technical Development Center said, ''Everybody who's rejected, you come to us, and we will work with you on the bank package.'' They got 70 percent of them creditworthy. And then when they got before the banker, they had success.
Q.
Ryan Austad tweeted a question on microlending - he'd like to know about average terms, rates, and requirements, and length of time typical for the process.
A.
We have 120-odd active microlenders all over the country. We put capital into these microlenders and they lend it and they relend it. We give them a very good rate - one, one-and-a-quarter percent - that's a discount off the market rates. They then pick the rate that they make the microloan at, and they set the timing. And the amount of money microlenders have to lend went from around $120 million in 2008 to $340 million now. But in microlending, it's not just the money. They provide an enormous amount of technical assistance. Failure rates for start-ups are high, and the more we can reduce the failure rate, the more jobs we have.
Q.
Why then is the Obama administration proposing to cut technical assistance for microlending by about 20 percent from 2010, especially if the pool of capital has grown?
A.
What we have done is instead of a silo - like microlending technical assistance only going to microloans - we have created an entire network of our women's centers, which are in these same communities; our Small Business Development Centers; our Score representatives all now linked, leveraged, and aligned on the ground. A small business needs to have seamless access. We want them to walk through any door, whether it's an S.B.A. door, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and find their way to our loan program, find their way to a counselor who can solve the kinds of questions, needs and frustrations that your readers have. So looking at numbers in silos does not necessarily give you the best bang for the taxpayer's buck.
Q.
Why is the S.B.A. making fewer small 7(a) loans than in years past and why is the average loan size bigger?
A.
That's a great question, because S.B.A. had a record year. We are back to above the 2008 levels of lending in dollars, but there's still a gap, as you point out. Small-dollar loans to under-served communities are not back. The big banks, which made a very large number of the small loans in 2005, 2006, and 2007, withdrew from the market. And now we have to bring them back into the market, and we have to reach into other really viable lenders who will be more in touch with some of these underserved communities. So that is why we gave every partner that we've got on-the-ground access to the S.B.A. guarantees through a program we have called Community Advantage.
Q.
You don't think it's because of the way Congress and the S.B.A. have ratcheted up the size standards for small companies, making bigger companies eligible for the loans?
A.
No. We know why lenders are not making these loans. They pulled back from the small loan market in large numbers during the crisis, because of the risk. And now coming back in, it's just as costly to make a small loan as a big loan. They're coming back in for the big loans first, which are more profitable, and we have pushed them to come back to the small loan market.
Q.
Everybody calls the new JOBS Act, which has the enthusiastic backing of President Obama, a small-business bill, but its main provision is designed to help companies with up to $1 billion in revenue. How is a billion-dollar company small?
A.
Well, Congress has worked through a number of these parameters. I wouldn't want you to think that, whatever the parameters in this particular bill, they are going to be the same as they are going to have at the S.B.A. on other things. But a lot of the cost of an I.P.O. is associated with some of the reporting. Small businesses clearly don't have that free cash flow and staff, and there is a fair bit of consensus around the notion of an on-ramp, a middle ground that you can stage these requirements and still give investors adequate information flow.
This works on the very, very high-growth companies. The data shows that some of these high-growth companies add most of their employees after they go public. Instead now, there is a lot of academic documentation about how these same companies are getting bought, and that they don't then grow as individual entities. You have to make sure the door is open for a very, very accelerated growth rate. And that's a public market.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Toy Designers Soldier On

BYLINE: By GREGORY SCHMIDT

 BODY:
Last week, we published a case study that looked at a team of four toy designers - Chris Dahlberg, H. Eric Mayse, Jim Preziosi and Eric Treadaway - faced with a quandary: how to expand their business so that they are not so dependent on their one big client, Mattel. Their company, the Four Horsemen Toy Design Studio, has revenue of more than $500,000 a year, most of it from its contract work for Mattel. They have a staff of three to help with sculpting, painting and shipping in their workshop in Butler, N.J.
They want to design and sell their own collectible action figures, but their work for Mattel leaves them with little time to focus on their own toy lines. They have created four lines so far, but to be successful, they believe the lines need a back story supported by content from movies, TV or comic books. 
In 2008, the Horsemen met with a production company, 4Kids Entertainment, about creating an animated television series, but the financial crisis hit, and the deal fell apart. They would still like to pursue an animated series but have been looking for smaller ways to build their concepts, like through comic books and graphic novels. To help develop story concepts, they are putting together a style guide. To get some marketing advice, they are seeking representation with a brand developer.
Hoping to appeal to the nostalgia of their adult collectors, they licensed the Outer Space Men, a line of action figures produced by Colorforms in the late '60s. The first four figures, with a production run of 300 each, came out in July 2010 and sold quickly for $10 apiece. That was followed by three more production runs and four new figures last summer. The men were invited organize a gallery show in February in Manhattan, where they displayed current and coming figures and coaxed the creator of the Outer Space Men, Mel Birnkrant, to meet with fans.
Overall, the men say they realize that the market for collectible action figures can be difficult. When the cost of toys goes up, adults tend to spend less on themselves. ''Parents will always buy toys for their kids,'' Mr. Dahlberg said. ''But if adults have a choice to buy a Superman figure or pay rent, they are going to pay rent.''
Q.
What success have you had with the Outer Space Men?
''It's kind of like the little unknown line that could,'' Mr. Mayse said. ''It was a distant nostalgic memory. We revived it and gave it new life. We are selling more and more with each release and are looking into acquiring other old misfit licenses.''
''It has given us the taste for picking up a license; it's something we would do in the future,'' Mr. Dahlberg said. ''We are able to take a line that's 45 years old and bring it back to collectors' collective consciousness. We are proud of the fact that we were able to bring a little bit of action figure history back.''
Q.
Would you consider renegotiating your contract with Mattel or moving the company to California, as a reader suggested on the blog?
''There's just no need to renegotiate; the relationship we have with them is fantastic,'' Mr. Dahlberg said. ''We have our roots here. We are close to New York Comic Con and Toy Fair and Toy Tokyo, where we do our gallery show. There are a lot of resources out here.''
Q.
How do you feel about having an outside team develop an animated series for TV or the Web?
''The DAVE School in Orlando, Fla., did one for us three years ago, in 2009,'' Mr. Mayse said. ''They put it up on their site. What they had done is to ask us to allow them to use our characters to allow their students to create a 'movie trailer,' so to speak.''
''The idea behind it was a mutually beneficial project,'' Mr. Dahlbeg said. ''They were creating something new. They were able to bring our name to it to utilize that. They had a great product at the end, and we were able to use that as well. Everyone won at the end of it.''
Q.
Your fan base is very loyal. What do you think about tapping that as a source of investment financing with a crowdfunding site like Kickstarter?
''In reality, we did a Kickstarter campaign when we sold the original 7th Kingdom figures,'' Mr. Preziosi said. ''We can revisit that concept and possibly tweak that into different offerings.''
''We've really come to understand how important the fan base is to us, how important their dedication is,'' Mr. Dahlberg said. ''That's part of the direction we are looking into to find ways to get fans more involved again. It's so important to the success of these lines.''

HEADLINE: Opening Fifth Season of 'Mad Men' With a Script Straight From Page One

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
The opening scenes of the Season 5 premiere of ''Mad Men,'' set in 1966, depicted a sort of knucklehead-racism at work, when young men from the advertising agency Young & Rubicam dropped bags filled with water on protesters picketing on the Madison Avenue sidewalk below. Wet and angry, several protesters came upstairs to demand to know who at the firm had dropped the water bombs.
One protester said in disgust, ''And they call us savages.'' 
Some critics found the scene, broadcast on Sunday, a bit too on-the-nose. ''It's a terrible line that should have been red-penciled,'' wrote Matt Zoller Seitz for New York magazine. Mike Hale of The New York Times called it ''unfortunately ham-handed.''
But no writer is to blame.
Everything in the scene really happened, written almost verbatim from an article on Page 1 of The Times on May 28, 1966.
''Poverty Pickets Get Paper-Bag Dousing on Madison Avenue,'' the headline read. The article described more than 300 people picketing the Office of Economic Opportunity, between East 40th and 41st Streets, the day before, chanting, ''O-E-O, we've got the poverty, where's the dough?'' Executives upstairs at Young & Rubicam, half a block from the building, shouted at the protesters and hung up signs saying, ''If you want money, get yourself a job.''
And then, the article said: ''A container of water was pitched out of one of the windows of the building, splashing two spectators. Later, two demonstrators were hit by water-filled paper bags thrown from the building.''
A 9-year-old boy was struck. Several women in the protest, including the boy's mother, hurried up to the advertising agency's sixth-floor offices and confronted a secretary about the water throwing.
''This is the executive floor,'' the secretary said. ''That's utterly ridiculous.''
''Don't you call us ridiculous,'' a protester shouted. ''Is this what Madison Avenue represents?''
''And they call us savages,'' a protester named Vivian Harris said.
Somewhere in the room was John Kifner, a cub reporter for The Times who had been hired as a copyboy three years earlier.
''Kif,'' as he is still known in the newsroom, would go on to cover more or less every armed conflict on planet Earth in the decades that followed, but on this day in 1966, he was on Madison Avenue.
Forty-five years later, Allison Mann, head of research for the writers of ''Mad Men,'' came across Kif's clip while scanning front pages from that time and gave it to Matthew Weiner, the show's creator.
''I was blown away,'' Mr. Weiner said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''I just loved the level of outrage from the participants in the protest. It was so eloquently said, and it struck to the heart of the conflict. They were being lampooned. This was a very serious issue for them and a joke to everyone else.''
He quickly decided to keep Mr. Kifner's dialogue. ''His story was such that I thought it inviolable,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''The way that quote-unquote 'average person' got to the heart of it was way better than any writer could have made up. If I had concocted the story, I would have never written that. It was a great capturing of the lack of respect, which is to me what a lot of the show is about.''
He toyed with the idea of having characters from his fictional firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce dropping the water, but chose to keep the action at Young & Rubicam. ''It was not a slight at Y&R at all,'' he said. ''It's something I thought our agency would be amused by.''
David Sable, the present-day chief executive of Y&R, was not amused.
''Part of that story is sad but true -- a few idiots dropped water balloons on protesters some 50 years ago,'' he said in a statement on Tuesday. ''What I don't know was whether or not they were fired. I certainly hope they were. Needless to say, their behavior was completely repulsive and not in line with the values of our company.''
The critics, informed that the scene that seemed to them to be wooden was in fact born of flesh and blood, stood their ground.
Mr. Hale: ''There is no connection between the fact that it actually happened and the scene was taken from a New York Times article and whether the scene was any good or not.''
Of the ''savages'' quote, he said, ''When she said that, it just rings so false.''
Mr. Seitz: ''It's good to know that all that actually happened, but it's still a terrible line in context of the scene, because it's an editorial summing-up that tells us all how to feel.''
Mr. Kifner, 70, has no recollection of that day.
''There was a lot of poverty and racial stuff,'' he said. ''I had the poverty beat. It's so long ago, and so many stories. I can't remember.''
Mr. Kifner does not watch ''Mad Men'' -- ''My sister watches it,'' he said -- but when told he basically wrote a key scene for the hit show, he said: ''No kidding! That's great.''
There is a reporter in the background of the ''Mad Men'' scene, scribbling notes, a fictional Kif. ''He knew that he had stumbled into a way better story than what he had shown up for,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''He is the poster for why somebody would want to be a journalist when they grow up. The whole thing smacks of adventure and intellect.''

 An article about a protest in Midtown Manhattan, published on May 28, 1966, in The New York Times, was the source for the opening scenes of the Season 5 premiere of ''Mad Men.'' The show's creator, Matthew Weiner, even used dialogue from the article in the episode.

PERSON: Adrienne Rich 

HEADLINE: A Poet of Unswerving Vision At the Forefront of Feminism

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX; Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Adrienne Rich, a poet of towering reputation and towering rage, whose work -- distinguished by an unswerving progressive vision and a dazzling, empathic ferocity -- brought the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse and kept it there for nearly a half-century, died on Tuesday at her home in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 82.
The cause was complications of rheumatoid arthritis, with which she had lived for most of her adult life, her family said.
Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed and widely taught, Ms. Rich was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose; the poetry alone has sold nearly 800,000 copies, according to W. W. Norton & Company, her publisher since the mid-1960s. 
Triply marginalized -- as a woman, a lesbian and a Jew -- Ms. Rich was concerned in her poetry, and in her many essays, with identity politics long before the term was coined.
She accomplished in verse what Betty Friedan, author of ''The Feminine Mystique,'' did in prose. In describing the stifling minutiae that had defined women's lives for generations, both argued persuasively that women's disenfranchisement at the hands of men must end.
For Ms. Rich, the personal, the political and the poetical were indissolubly linked; her body of work can be read as a series of urgent dispatches from the front. While some critics called her poetry polemical, she remained celebrated for the unflagging intensity of her vision, and for the constant formal reinvention that kept her verse -- often jagged and colloquial, sometimes purposefully shocking, always controlled in tone, diction and pacing -- sounding like that of few other poets.
All this helped ensure Ms. Rich's continued relevance long after she burst genteelly onto the scene as a Radcliffe senior in the early 1950s.
Her constellation of honors includes a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant in 1994 and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for ''Diving Into the Wreck.'' That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork.
In the title poem, Ms. Rich uses the metaphor of a dive into dark, unfathomable waters to plumb the depths of women's experience:
I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair streams black, the merman in his armored body We circle silently about the wreck we dive into the hold. ... We are, I am, you are by cowardice or courage the one who find our way back to the scene carrying a knife, a camera a book of myths in which our names do not appear.
Ms. Rich was far too seasoned a campaigner to think that verse alone could change entrenched social institutions. ''Poetry is not a healing lotion, an emotional massage, a kind of linguistic aromatherapy,'' she said in an acceptance speech to the National Book Foundation in 2006, on receiving its medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. ''Neither is it a blueprint, nor an instruction manual, nor a billboard.''
But at the same time, as she made resoundingly clear in interviews, in public lectures and in her work, Ms. Rich saw poetry as a keen-edged beacon by which women's lives -- and women's consciousness -- could be illuminated.
She was never supposed to have turned out as she did.
Adrienne Cecile Rich was born in Baltimore on May 16, 1929. Her father, Arnold Rice Rich, a doctor and assimilated Jew, was an authority on tuberculosis who taught at Johns Hopkins University. Her mother, Helen Gravely Jones Rich, a Christian, was a pianist and composer who, cleaving to social norms of the day, forsook her career to marry and have children. Adrienne was baptized and confirmed in the Episcopal Church.
Theirs was a bookish household, and Adrienne, as she said afterward, was groomed by her father to be a literary prodigy. He encouraged her to write poetry when she was still a child, and she steeped herself in the poets in his library -- all men, she later ruefully observed. But those men gave her the formalist grounding that let her make her mark when she was still very young.
When Ms. Rich was in her last year at Radcliffe (she received a bachelor's degree in English there in 1951), W. H. Auden chose her first collection, ''A Change of World,'' for publication in the Yale Younger Poets series, a signal honor. Released in 1951, the book, with its sober mien, dutiful meter and scrupulous rhymes, was praised by reviewers for its impeccable command of form.
She had learned the lessons of her father's library well, or so it seemed. For even in this volume Ms. Rich had begun, with subtle subversion, to push against a time-honored thematic constraint -- the proscription on making poetry out of the soul-numbing dailiness of women's lives.
A poem in the collection, ''Aunt Jennifer's Tigers,'' depicting a woman at her needlework and reprinted here in full, is concerned with precisely this:
Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen, Bright topaz denizens of a world of green. They do not fear the men beneath the tree; They pace in sleek chivalric certainty. Aunt Jennifer's fingers fluttering through her wool Find even the ivory needle hard to pull. The massive weight of Uncle's wedding band Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand. When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by. The tigers in the panel that she made Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.
Once mastered, poetry's formalist rigors gave Ms. Rich something to rebel against, and by her third collection, ''Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law,'' published by Harper & Row, she had pretty well exploded them. That volume appeared in 1963, a watershed moment in women's letters: ''The Feminine Mystique'' was also published that year.
In the collection's title poem, Ms. Rich chronicles the pulverizing onus of traditional married life. It opens this way:
You, once a belle in Shreveport, with henna-colored hair, skin like a peachbud, still have your dresses copied from that time. ... Your mind now, mouldering like wedding-cake, heavy with useless experience, rich with suspicion, rumor, fantasy, crumbling to pieces under the knife-edge of mere fact.
Though the book horrified some critics, it sealed Ms. Rich's national reputation.
She knew the strain of domestic duty firsthand. In 1953 Ms. Rich had married a Harvard economist, Alfred Haskell Conrad, and by the time she was 30 she was the mother of three small boys. When Professor Conrad took a job at the City College of New York, the family moved to New York City, where Ms. Rich became active in the civil rights and antiwar movements.
By 1970, partly because she had begun, inwardly, to acknowledge her erotic love of women, Ms. Rich and her husband had grown estranged. That autumn, he died of a gunshot wound to the head; the death was ruled a suicide. To the end of her life, Ms. Rich rarely spoke of it.
Ms. Rich effectively came out as a lesbian in 1976, with the publication of ''Twenty-One Love Poems,'' whose subject matter -- sexual love between women -- was still considered disarming and dangerous. In the years that followed her poetry and prose ranged over her increasing self-identification as a Jewish woman, the Holocaust and the struggles of black women.
Ms. Rich's other volumes of poetry include ''The Dream of a Common Language'' (1978), ''A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far'' (1981), ''The Fact of a Doorframe'' (1984), ''An Atlas of the Difficult World'' (1991) and, most recently, ''Tonight No Poetry Will Serve,'' published last year.
Her prose includes the essay collections ''On Lies, Secrets, and Silence'' (1979); ''Blood, Bread, and Poetry'' (1986); an influential essay, ''Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,'' published as a slender volume in 1981; and the nonfiction book ''Of Woman Born'' (1976), which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct.
For Ms. Rich, the getting of literary awards was itself a political act to be reckoned with. On sharing the National Book Award for poetry in 1974 (the other recipient that year was Allen Ginsberg), she declined to accept it on her own behalf. Instead, she appeared onstage with two of that year's finalists, the poets Audre Lorde and Alice Walker; the three of them accepted the award on behalf of all women.
In 1997, in a widely reported act, Ms. Rich declined the National Medal of Arts, the United States government's highest award bestowed upon artists. In a letter to Jane Alexander, then chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, which administers the award, she expressed her dismay, amid the ''increasingly brutal impact of racial and economic injustice,'' that the government had chosen to honor ''a few token artists while the people at large are so dishonored.''
Art, Ms. Rich added, ''means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of power which holds it hostage.''
Ms. Rich's other laurels -- and these she did accept -- include the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the Academy of American Poets Fellowship and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.
She taught widely, including at Columbia, Brandeis, Rutgers, Cornell and Stanford Universities.
Ms. Rich's survivors include her partner of more than 30 years, the writer Michelle Cliff; three sons, David, Pablo and Jacob, from her marriage to Professor Conrad; a sister, Cynthia Rich; and two grandchildren.
For all her verbal prowess, for all her prolific output, Ms. Rich retained a dexterous command of the plain, pithy utterance. In a 1984 speech she summed up her reason for writing -- and, by loud unspoken implication, her reason for being -- in just seven words.
What she and her sisters-in-arms were fighting to achieve, she said, was simply this: ''the creation of a society without domination.''

HEADLINE: A Team's Huge Price Tag Is Tied to a TV Windfall

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR; Ken Belson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
By agreeing to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion, the group led by Magic Johnson is paying nearly two and a half times the $845 million paid to acquire the Chicago Cubs in 2009. The price tag is so big that it eclipses by around 50 percent what Malcolm Glazer and his family paid for the soccer giant Manchester United in 2005.
Can Johnson's group justify such a price? After all, the winning bid dwarfed the nearly $1.4 billion offered by an alliance of two billionaires, Steven A. Cohen and Patrick Soon-Shiong, and the $1.5 billion offered by Stan Kroenke, the owner of the St. Louis Rams.
Mark Walter, chief executive of Guggenheim Partners, the financial-services firm that is providing most of the money for Johnson's group, did not have a direct answer on Wednesday. 
''It was the cost of owning one of baseball's most storied franchises,'' he said in a telephone interview and added: ''I don't want to realize a return on investment on buying the Dodgers. I want to have a multi-generational relationship that changes my life, Magic's life, Magic's grandchildren's lives and all of our lives.''
But at some point, sports team owners do want a return on their money. Johnson and Walter are betting on reviving the Dodgers' fortunes now that the Frank McCourt era is over. More important, the sale price is enormous because the buyers anticipate a huge windfall from a new cable TV deal that would go into effect after the 2013 season.
Walter said: ''It will be substantial.''
It will have to be. To get the most money, the Dodgers will probably be the centerpiece of a regional sports channel that will funnel enormous annual rights fees to the team and amass monthly subscriber fees from the cable, satellite and telephone companies that will carry its games.
A bevy of media companies are likely to line up to give the Dodgers the most lucrative deal, which could couple ownership of a channel with huge yearly rights payments. Time Warner Cable, for instance, is creating two networks, one in English, one in Spanish, with Johnson's old team, the Los Angeles Lakers, at their core. The Lakers are expected to ultimately realize huge profits from the deal.
''The marketplace continues to escalate for valuable sports rights and they're in the second-biggest sports market with one of the biggest sports brands in the world,'' Chris Bevilacqua, a sports media investor and adviser, said of the Dodgers. He added that the bidders for the TV deal with the Dodgers could include News Corporation, which now televises Dodgers games on Prime Ticket; Time Warner Cable; Microsoft; Apple; Google; Hulu and Netflix.
But will the anticipated television windfall be enough to justify the $2.15 billion price?
''It's a ridiculous price that will take them years to recover,'' said Marc Ganis, a sports-industry analyst. ''Looking down the road, with a stadium naming-rights deal and a lot of cable money, you do sniff that number. Over time, five or 10 years, it might get to that value if they implement things properly.''
McCourt was fortunate to sell the team when he did. He did not want to let go of the Dodgers initially and he staged a battle for control against Commissioner Bud Selig that reached its height when McCourt put the team into bankruptcy.
But timing and circumstances helped McCourt fetch far more than the Cubs did in 2009.
For one thing, the economy has improved. And the Ricketts family, which now owns the Cubs, could not look forward to a huge influx of new TV money when it bought the team and thus could not justify paying more than $845 million.
Interestingly, the Johnson group is making the $2.15 billion purchase without adding any debt to the $412 million it is assuming from McCourt. In contrast, when McCourt bought the Dodgers in 2004, he financed the purchase entirely with borrowed money.
In a statement on Wednesday, Selig did not cite McCourt, but did thank ''the great Dodger fans for their loyalty and patience'' as the ownership change played out. And Selig had to be pleased with the final sale price.
''When he became commissioner,'' said Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball, ''Bud Selig stated that he should be judged on asset values, and I think the purchase price of the Dodgers is an indication of the overall financial health of the industry.''
The effect of the precedent-setting bid will be scrutinized for what it will mean to the values of other major league teams. Some sports bankers believe that the $2.15 billion paid for the Dodgers will boost what other big-market teams are worth and that the Yankees could now sell for well more than $3 billion.
And with a new benchmark set, what would the Mets be worth if Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz sold their control of the franchise? It might be tempting for them to test the waters, considering the financial duress they have endured in recent years. They have just concluded the sale of 48 percent of the team to various investors for $240 million, with 25 percent of the money coming from family members.
''If I'm Fred, I'm selling tomorrow before everyone finds out these numbers don't work,'' said one banker. But Wilpon, through all his troubles, has made it clear how much he wants ownership of the team to stay in his family and he is unlikely to easily let go, even if the team's value will now be lifted by the Dodgers sale.
Although the marquee names in the Dodgers' purchase are Johnson and Stan Kasten, the former president of the Washington Nationals and Atlanta Braves, Guggenheim -- an insurance, investment advisory and securities trading business -- is the key partner in the sale. To finance the Dodgers purchase, it is using money from its companies, partners and clients, Walter said.
Walter, Johnson and Kasten wanted the Dodgers badly enough to overcome McCourt's resistance to selling the Dodger Stadium land, with its parking lots. They agreed to pay $150 million for a half-interest.
And sometime Monday night, they raised their bid for the team by about $400 million, said two people briefed on the process but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The other two bidders expected a three-way auction to start Wednesday, run by Blackstone Advisory Partners, one of the Dodgers' investment bankers. But the blowout bid by the Johnson group led McCourt to stop the process.
He did not ask the others to match or exceed $2.15 billion.
Now, the rebuilding of the Dodgers franchise will begin, assuming the deal gets bankruptcy court approval, which is expected by April 30. ''I'll be at the stadium daily,'' Johnson said on the telephone Thursday, ''making sure the outreach to the community is going well, making sure players who want to talk to me can talk to me.''
He and Kasten will own minority shares in the team. ''Fans know what I stand for,'' Johnson added. ''They're getting a local owner who's going to work to make the fan experience the greatest of their lives.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Reportedly In the Works For Jet Maker

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The business jet maker Hawker Beechcraft is readying a bankruptcy filing, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, dealing a blow to its private equity owners, Goldman Sachs and Onex Partners. 
Hawker, which is based in Wichita, Kan., said on Tuesday that it had obtained $120 million in additional loans to buy it time to fix its balance sheet. In exchange, a majority of the company's debt holders agreed to defer some interest payments and grant relief from loan covenants.
One of the options Hawker and its advisers are considering is a prearranged Chapter 11 filing that has the consent of those lenders, principally a number of hedge funds, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among them are the hedge funds Centerbridge Partners and Angelo Gordon.
A Hawker bankruptcy would be put an end to a 2007 private equity deal that was troubled almost from the start. The company was formed when Goldman and Onex, the largest private equity firm in Canada, bought Raytheon's private jet unit for $3.3 billion, hoping to seize on the fervor for private jets.
Hawker hit rough times soon afterward, as a recession wiped out many discretionary expenditures like private jets. The company laid off about 2,500 employees, and lost billions of dollars as customers like NetJets canceled orders for new aircraft.
Within two years of the leveraged buyout, Goldman's buyout arm told investors that it had written down the value of the company by 85 percent.
As of Sept. 30, Hawker had more than $2 billion in long-term debt and $146.7 million in cash and short-term investments. It posted an $88.6 million loss for the third quarter of last year, its seventh in a row as its revenue slid to $518.8 million.
A representative for Hawker Beechcraft declined to comment. News of a potential bankruptcy filing was reported earlier by Reuters.
Hawker has made several efforts to fix its business, including by hiring the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Last month, Hawker named Robert S. Miller, the former head of Delphi Automotive and a restructuring specialist, as its chief executive.
Mr. Miller said in a statement on Tuesday that while the company had taken steps to improve its operations, its debt load is weighing heavily on its turnaround effort.
''We believe this agreement will stabilize the company's current financial position and ensure Hawker Beechcraft continues manufacturing the best airplanes for our customers and providing first-class service and support,'' he said.
A bankruptcy filing of Hawker would be another loss for Goldman's buyout arm, which is contending with a number of troubled investments. Chief among them is Energy Future Holdings, the Texas utility giant formerly known as TXU, whose value has plummeted along with the price of natural gas. Goldman's real estate private equity funds have also struggled.
The unit's own future is uncertain, given new financial regulations to restrict a bank's ownership of investment operations like private equity.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: When Stealing Isn't Stealing

BYLINE: By STUART P. GREEN. 
Stuart P. Green is a professor at Rutgers Law School in Newark and author of the forthcoming ''13 Ways to Steal a Bicycle: Theft Law in the Information Age.''

 BODY:
THE Justice Department is building its case against Megaupload, the hugely popular file-sharing site that was indicted earlier this year on multiple counts of copyright infringement and related crimes. The company's servers have been shut down, its assets seized and top employees arrested. And, as is usual in such cases, prosecutors and their allies in the music and movie industries have sought to invoke the language of ''theft'' and ''stealing'' to frame the prosecutions and, presumably, obtain the moral high ground.
Whatever wrongs Megaupload has committed, though, it's doubtful that theft is among them. 
From its earliest days, the crime of theft has been understood to involve the misappropriation of things real and tangible. For Caveman Bob to ''steal'' from Caveman Joe meant that Bob had taken something of value from Joe -- say, his favorite club -- and that Joe, crucially, no longer had it. Everyone recognized, at least intuitively, that theft constituted what can loosely be defined as a zero-sum game: what Bob gained, Joe lost.
When Industrial Age Bob and Joe started inventing less tangible things, like electricity, stocks, bonds and licenses, however, things got more complicated. What Bob took, Joe, in some sense, still had. So the law adjusted in ad hoc and at times inconsistent ways. Specialized doctrines were developed to cover the misappropriation of services (like a ride on a train), semi-tangibles (like the gas for streetlights) and true intangibles (like business goodwill).
In the middle of the 20th century, criminal law reformers were sufficiently annoyed by all of this specialization and ad hoc-ness that they decided to do something about it.
In 1962, the prestigious American Law Institute issued the Model Penal Code, resulting in the confused state of theft law we're still dealing with today.
In a radical departure from prior law, the code defined ''property'' to refer to ''anything of value.'' Henceforth, it would no longer matter whether the property misappropriated was tangible or intangible, real or personal, a good or a service. All of these things were now to be treated uniformly.
Before long, the code would inform the criminal law that virtually every law student in the country was learning. And when these new lawyers went to work on Capitol Hill, at the Justice Department and elsewhere, they had that approach to theft in mind.
Then technology caught up.
With intangible assets like information, patents and copyrighted material playing an increasingly important role in the economy, lawyers and lobbyists for the movie and music industries, and their allies in Congress and at the Justice Department, sought to push the concept of theft beyond the basic principle of zero sum-ness. Earlier this year, for example, they proposed two major pieces of legislation premised on the notion that illegal downloading is stealing: the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).
The same rhetorical strategy was used with only slightly more success by the movie industry in its memorably irritating advertising campaign designed to persuade (particularly) young people that illegal downloading is stealing. Appearing before the program content on countless DVDs, the Motion Picture Association of America's much-parodied ad featured a pounding soundtrack and superficially logical reasoning:
You wouldn't steal a car.
You wouldn't steal a handbag.
You wouldn't steal a mobile phone.
You wouldn't steal a DVD.
Downloading pirated films is stealing.
Stealing is against the law.
Piracy: It's a crime.
The problem is that most people simply don't buy the claim that illegally downloading a song or video from the Internet really is like stealing a car. According to a range of empirical studies, including one conducted by me and my social psychologist collaborator, Matthew Kugler, lay observers draw a sharp moral distinction between file sharing and genuine theft, even when the value of the property is the same.
If Cyber Bob illegally downloads Digital Joe's song from the Internet, it's crucial to recognize that, in most cases, Joe hasn't lost anything. Yes, one might try to argue that people who use intellectual property without paying for it steal the money they would have owed had they bought it lawfully. But there are two basic problems with this contention. First, we ordinarily can't know whether the downloader would have paid the purchase price had he not misappropriated the property. Second, the argument assumes the conclusion that is being argued for -- that it is theft.
So what are the lessons in all this? For starters, we should stop trying to shoehorn the 21st-century problem of illegal downloading into a moral and legal regime that was developed with a pre- or mid-20th-century economy in mind. Second, we should recognize that the criminal law is least effective -- and least legitimate -- when it is at odds with widely held moral intuitions.
Illegal downloading is, of course, a real problem. People who work hard to produce creative works are entitled to enjoy legal protection to reap the benefits of their labors. And if others want to enjoy those creative works, it's reasonable to make them pay for the privilege. But framing illegal downloading as a form of stealing doesn't, and probably never will, work. We would do better to consider a range of legal concepts that fit the problem more appropriately: concepts like unauthorized use, trespass, conversion and misappropriation.
This is not merely a question of nomenclature. The label we apply to criminal acts matters crucially in terms of how we conceive of and stigmatize them. What we choose to call a given type of crime ultimately determines how it's formulated and classified and, perhaps most important, how it will be punished. Treating different forms of property deprivation as different crimes may seem untidy, but that is the nature of criminal law.

HEADLINE: Charges for Owner of Tortilla Factory Where Worker Died

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
-The owner of a Brooklyn tortilla factory where a worker died after falling into a mixing machine has been arrested on charges of underpaying employees, falsifying business records and violating workers' compensation and unemployment insurance laws, the authorities said on Wednesday. 
-The owner, Erasmo Ponce, faces 26 felony counts and 23 misdemeanor counts, according to a complaint filed in Brooklyn Criminal Court by Eric T. Schneiderman, the state's attorney general. Mr. Ponce surrendered to the authorities on Tuesday and was arraigned and released without bail, his lawyer said.
-Mr. Ponce, a Mexican immigrant, declined to comment on the charges, but his lawyer, Manuel Portela, said he did not think the case merited criminal prosecution.
-''We've been trying to resolve this case on an administrative level,'' Mr. Portela said, adding that his client ''wants to resolve it and move forward in a way that is fair and equitable.''
-Mr. Ponce's company, Tortilleria Chinantla, has been operating under the investigative glare of state and federal officials since Jan. 24, 2011, when Juan Baten, a Guatemalan worker at his tortilla factory in Bushwick, died after falling into a large machine used to mix tortilla dough. Mr. Baten was crushed in the machine's churning mechanism.
-Several days later, state officials shut down the factory after discovering that the company had been operating without workers' compensation insurance for nearly a year.
-The state eventually allowed the factory to reopen, but in July 2011, the federal government cited the company for workplace safety violations carrying fines of more than $62,000. The most serious violation, deemed ''willful,'' involved the failure of the company to install a barrier on the mixer to prevent employees from coming into contact with its fast-moving machinery.
-Ted Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which conducted that investigation, said Wednesday that the tortilla company had contested the citations and penalties and that the case was still pending.
-Mr. Baten's death and the ensuing investigations have darkened the reputation of Mr. Ponce, whose life had followed the classic trajectory of the striving, up-by-the-bootstraps immigrant.
-Mr. Ponce was poor when he moved to the United States from Mexico in 1989 and, after a few years of doing manual labor and saving money, he started a small tortilla-making vending business in New York. Within a decade the company grew into a national enterprise with revenue of several million dollars a year.
-His success made him one of the wealthiest and most influential members of the city's growing Mexican diaspora, and he burnished his reputation by donating to various social and political causes in the New York region and in Mexico.
-While he declined to speak on Wednesday about the new set of charges against him, Mr. Ponce chatted enthusiastically about a ceremony he was hosting on Saturday to christen a new mural on his factory's facade. It depicts a workers laboring in a cornfield, he said, and has been popular with the neighbors.
-''I am working well with the community,'' he said.

HEADLINE: $7 Billion Public-Private Plan in Chicago Aims to Fix Transit, Schools and Parks

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Chicago is embarking on a $7 billion plan to transform the city's infrastructure from the skies above to the pipes underground.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel is planning to announce the initiative Thursday. It includes projects to expand the city's largest airport and improve its streets, water system, schools, community colleges, parks and commuter rail network. The city estimates that these initiatives will create 30,000 jobs over the next three years.
At a time when the nation is only beginning to pull itself painfully and delicately out of a deep recession, and when cities and states are cutting essential services and wondering how to keep the courthouses open and the lights on, an infrastructure proposal for a single city with an estimated cost in the billions -- with a ''b'' -- is audacious. Mr. Emanuel, in an interview, suggested that nothing less than this ''integrated, comprehensive approach'' will do for what he calls ''building a new Chicago.''
With the plan, Chicago is taking a leading role among cities and states struggling to keep their infrastructure from crumbling further but frustrated with legislative gridlock in Washington, said Robert Puentes, director of the metropolitan infrastructure initiative at the Brookings Institution. 
''There is tremendous interest in doing something different -- people aren't waiting for the federal government to raise the gasoline tax or pass the carbon tax and have money raining down,'' he said. He cited successful campaigns in ''can-do states'' that include Colorado, Washington, Arizona and Virginia to finance economic development projects with public-private partnerships, and Los Angeles' vote in support of a major transportation referendum in 2008.
Mr. Emanuel, who served in the White House in two administrations and as a member of Congress, said ''I will not tie this city's future to the dysfunction in Washington and Springfield.''
In the speech, to be delivered at the Chicagoland Laborers' Training and Apprentice Center, Mr. Emanuel will describe the financing for the sprawling plan. Some of it will come from the newly created Chicago Infrastructure Trust, an initiative announced this month by Mayor Emanuel and former President Bill Clinton, who has long had an interest in infrastructure and energy efficiency. The fund, a nonprofit corporation, pools outside investment and applies it to a wide range of possible projects.
Other funds will come from cost cutting, some from the savings in energy and water use from retrofitting buildings, and some from user fees, but ''none of these funds will come from an increase in property or sales taxes,'' according to the speech. A copy was provided to The New York Times through the mayor's office. Depending on the project, some of the investment would be paid back through interest on loans, others through profit sharing.
Still, economic development efforts in the past have tended to disappoint, Mr. Puentes noted, because they tended to pay businesses to relocate or threw money into projects like stadiums. Some public-private partnership projects have been criticized as giveaways to the private businesses that take them over -- including two prominent cases in Chicago itself, the privatized Chicago Skyway and the city's parking meter system, which obligate the city to leases that span generations. Mr. Emanuel says that the city has learned an important lesson, and that ''I am not leasing anything,'' or selling off the city's assets, he said in an interview. ''I'm using private capital to improve a public entity that stays public.''
The investments, by any measure, are enormous, and they are intended to tackle enormous problems for this aging city. ''You can't have a 21st-century economy on a 20th-century foundation without holding yourself back,'' Mr. Emanuel said. The projects include $1 billion for the Chicago Transit Authority to renovate more than 100 stations and eliminate ''slow zones'' that cost riders an estimated 11,000 hours of delays every day. O'Hare International Airport will receive $1.4 billion over the next three years to expand capacity.
Underground, the city will take on the challenge of fixing its water system, which suffered 3,800 leaks last year. That means replacing 900 miles of pipe that is more than 100 years old and replacing or relining 750 miles of sewer lines, among other projects estimated at $1.4 billion. Projects would be coordinated so that a street dug up to repair pipes could get broadband cables and other work done at the same time so that the streets would not be resurfaced only to be dug up again soon after.
Mr. Emanuel is also planning to spend nearly $300 million to buy 180 acres of new parkland and to build playgrounds, basketball courts and sports fields, as well as nature trails and bike and running paths.
Jorge Ramirez, the president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, said he applauds the plan as an official concerned with jobs, but also as an investor in the trust through union pension funds. Instead of investing pension funds outside the city, ''you bring it back here,'' creating jobs locally and getting a good rate of return. ''Smart,'' he said.
Some suggest that the initiative will have to prove itself to overcome the skepticism that comes naturally to longtime observers of the Chicago political scene. ''It's totally within reason for Chicagoans to be skeptical,'' said Celeste Meiffren, field director for Illinois PIRG, an advocacy organization. ''That being said, it does seem that a lot of these projects are pretty worthwhile. If the mayor provides a lot of information to us as residents and taxpayers, gives us an opportunity to weigh in on these projects and involves our aldermen too -- and makes sure we receive a fair value -- it'll address a lot of the concerns we have here.''
In his speech, Mr. Emanuel evokes the Great Fire of 1871, which left 100,000 people homeless, and which led to what he calls the city's ''second birth'': $50 million in new buildings completed a year after the fire and a building boom that put the city back on the map and saw it host a Republican National Convention just nine years later.
''Chicago's identity was not forged by the Great Fire,'' he said, ''but by the great fortitude of its people in its aftermath.'' Rebuilding now, he suggested in an interview, is just as important: ''The decisions we make in the next two or three years determine what Chicago will look like in the next 20 or 30 years.''
And not just Chicago, said Mr. Puentes of Brookings. If the program is successful, it will be imitated, he said; ''This is not just a Chicago story.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Health Care Mandate

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
After Massachusetts, California came calling. So did Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, Oregon, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
They all wanted Jonathan Gruber, a numbers wizard at M.I.T., to help them figure out how to fix their health care systems, just as he had helped Mitt Romney overhaul health insurance when he was the Massachusetts governor.
Then came the call in 2008 from President-elect Obama's transition team, the one that officially turned this stay-at-home economics professor into Mr. Mandate.
Mr. Gruber has spent decades modeling the intricacies of the health care ecosystem, which involves making predictions about how new laws will play out based on past experience and economic theory. It is his research that convinced the Obama administration that health care reform could not work without requiring everyone to buy insurance. 
And it is his work that explains why President Obama has so much riding on the three days of United States Supreme Court hearings, which ended Wednesday, about the constitutionality of the mandate. Questioning by the court's conservative justices has suggested deep skepticism about the mandate, setting off waves of worry among its backers -- Mr. Gruber included.
''As soon as I started reading the dispatches my stomach started churning,'' Mr. Gruber said of the arguments on Tuesday, while taking a break from quizzing his son for a biology test. ''Losing the mandate means continuing with our unfair individual insurance markets in a world where employer-based insurance is rapidly disappearing.''
Mr. Gruber, 46, hates traveling without his wife and three children, so he is tracking the case from his home in Lexington, Mass. There he crunches numbers and advises other states on health care, in between headbanging at Van Halen concerts with his 15-year-old son and cuddling with the family's eight parrots. (His wife, Andrea, volunteers at a bird rescue center.)
If the court rules against the mandate, Mr. Gruber says he believes the number of newly insured Americans could fall to eight million from the projected 32 million. He insists that without a mandate, the law will result in a terrible spiral: only relatively sick Americans will choose to get insurance, leading premium prices to rise and causing the healthier of even those sick people to drop their insurance, sending prices higher and higher.
Some other economists quibble, though, with Mr. Gruber's pessimistic assessment.
''My general thought about the mandate is if insurance is affordable and accessible, most people will buy it anyway,'' said David Cutler, an economist at Harvard and longtime collaborator of Mr. Gruber's.
Others, like Paul Starr, a Princeton sociologist, say they believe Mr. Gruber's work does not account for how hard it will be to enforce the mandate.
''There is this groupthink about how important the mandate is,'' Mr. Starr says. ''Most people don't understand or won't acknowledge how weak the enforcement mechanism is.''
Mr. Starr said he thought Mr. Gruber in particular was overstating the effectiveness of the mandate because ''it's his baby.''
That said, it is difficult for too many other experts to categorically refute Mr. Gruber's work, since he has nearly cornered the market on the technical science behind these sorts of predictions. Other models exist -- built by nonprofits like the RAND Corporation or private consultancies like the Lewin Group -- but they all use Mr. Gruber's work as a benchmark, according to Jean Abraham, a health economist at the University of Minnesota and former senior economist in both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations.
''He's brought a level of science to an issue that would otherwise be just opinion,'' Mr. Cutler says. ''He's really the only person who has been doing all this careful modeling for so long. He's the only person you can go to for that kind of thing, which is why the White House reached out to him in the first place.''
Mr. Obama had made health care reform a cornerstone of his campaign, and wanted to announce a credible proposal quickly after taking office. But members of the Obama administration's transition team said they had inherited an executive branch that had vastly underinvested in modeling research on health care, especially compared to the technical modeling that had been done in areas like tax policy.
''Creating a good model from scratch would have taken months, maybe years,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who was the director of President Obama's National Economic Council and had advised Mr. Gruber on his dissertation when they were at Harvard.
Mr. Gruber had already spent years researching government mandates, starting with his 1991 dissertation about how mandated employer benefits cut into workers' wages.
He also did similar analyses, on a broader range of public policies for the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration from 1997-98. He was recruited by Mr. Summers, who was then deputy secretary of Treasury.
Then in 2001, after returning to M.I.T., Mr. Gruber received an e-mail from Amy Lischko, who was then an assistant commissioner in the Massachusetts healthy policy department under then-Gov. Jane M. Swift, a Republican.
She was familiar with his work, and contracted him to model some potential ways that Massachusetts could expand health insurance coverage.
''He certainly wasn't as well known then as he is now in the health care arena,'' said Ms. Lischko, now a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. ''We couldn't exactly kick the tires on these kinds of models back then, but we knew he had done work on simulations before.''
Mr. Gruber calls himself a ''card-carrying Democrat.'' He and his wife host a ''great quadrennial Democratic victory party'' whether or not the Democratic candidate wins, he said. But given his reputation and relatively rare expertise, he still ended up working for two Republican governors in Massachusetts.
When Mr. Romney succeeded Ms. Swift in 2003, he proposed using an individual mandate to help the state achieve universal health care coverage. Mr. Gruber was again brought in to analyze the idea, which he had not formally modeled before.
''Romney saw it as a traditional Republican moral issue of personal responsibility, getting rid of the free riders in the system, not as much of an economic issue,'' Mr. Gruber said. ''Not only were the Republicans for it, the liberals hated it. People forget that.''
Mr. Obama had vehemently opposed an individual mandate before his election in 2008.
After the Massachusetts plan passed in 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican governor of California, invited Mr. Gruber to Sacramento to help model a similar proposal.
''That was awesome,'' Mr. Gruber says, his eyes widening at the memory. ''I got to see the sword from Conan the Barbarian.''
The California proposal fell apart, but soon Mr. Gruber had a little cottage industry helping states model potential health system changes. He also serves on the Massachusetts board that oversees the state's new health care exchanges.
Along with these credentials, Mr. Gruber's position as an adviser to the influential Congressional Budget Office also left him perfectly positioned to advise the White House on health reform.
''The most important arbiter of everything was the C.B.O.,'' said Neera Tanden, who was a senior adviser for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services.
The C.B.O.'s assessment of a bill's efficacy and costs strongly influences political debate, but the office does not publicly reveal how it calculates those numbers.
''We knew the numbers he gave us would be close to where the C.B.O. was likely to come out,'' Ms. Tanden said. She was right.
After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation.
This assignment primarily involved asking his graduate student researchers to tweak his model's software code. It was also almost entirely conducted from his home office, while his children were at school and then after they had gone to bed.
''If I wanted to be in Washington, I'd have taken a job in Washington,'' he said. ''I wanted to be around for my family.''
Even though he was brought in by the White House, Congressional staff members from both parties trusted him because he was seen as an econometric wonk, not a political agent. But soon his very involvement with the bill caused questions about his objectivity to be raised in the news media.
During and after the bill's slog through Congress, he frequently spoke with reporters and wrote opinion pieces supporting the Affordable Care Act but did not always mention his role in helping to devise it.
He says he regrets not being more upfront about his involvement with the administration. But he does not apologize for publicly advocating for the legislation, and continuing to do so -- including through a comic book he wrote to explain the law.
''Yes, I want the public to be informed by an objective expert,'' he says. ''But the thing is, I know more about this law than any other economist.''

HEADLINE: Council Passes Wage Bill And Condemns a Killing

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The City Council approved a measure on Wednesday that would require higher wages for some private-sector blue-collar workers, taking a step long advocated by labor unions but opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the business community.
The measure was one of three pieces of legislation addressing salaries and benefits for low-wage workers that have vexed the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, as she prepares to run for mayor next year. The bills -- mandating a so-called living wage, requiring paid sick leave and imposing a prevailing wage for some workers in some buildings -- have come to symbolize the challenge Ms. Quinn faces as she seeks to retain her traditional supporters in the labor movement while also courting business leaders. 
The measure approved on Wednesday was the prevailing wage bill, which would require building owners to pay higher wages to janitors, cleaners, security guards and other workers in structures that the city subsidizes or where it leases space.
Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union had promoted the bill. It would require the building owners to pay building service workers at least the same amount that government contractors are required to pay their employees.
A majority of commercial buildings in New York City already pay building service workers prevailing wages, according to union officials, so the bill is likely to affect only a small number of workers. Nonetheless, Ms. Quinn and Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill, described it as a major step.
''It's going to make a real difference at the end of the day in the lives of many, many people, service workers, in particular, and their families,'' Ms. Mark-Viverito said.
And Mike Fishman, the president of Local 32BJ, said in a statement, ''New York City taxpayers expect their economic development dollars to go toward creating good jobs and a broadly shared prosperity.''
Mr. Bloomberg has said he will veto it. On Tuesday, he called it ''terrible legislation.''
But Ms. Quinn said Wednesday that the Council had more than enough votes to override a veto.
The city comptroller, John C. Liu, whose office sets prevailing wage rates, praised the bill, saying in a statement that it would help ''to ensure shared prosperity and reverse the widening wealth gap in the city.''
Ms. Quinn has blocked another bill that would require businesses to provide paid sick leave. She has said that she worries it would hurt small businesses.
But she said Wednesday that she expected to ask the Council next month to vote on a compromise living wage bill that would require developers or companies that receive subsidies from the city to pay a set wage, higher than the minimum wage, to their employees. The compromise measure does not include a provision that would require retailers in those developments also to pay the ''living wage.''
Also Wednesday, the Council passed a resolution condemning the killing of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was shot last month in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Trayvon was unarmed, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and carrying a bag of Skittles and an iced tea.
Before their meeting, two dozen council members, including Ms. Quinn, gathered on the steps of City Hall wearing hooded sweatshirts and holding bags of Skittles as they demanded a ''full and impartial'' investigation into Trayvon's death.
''Trayvon Martin is all of our brother, is all of our sons, is all of our nephews,'' said Ms. Quinn, who was wearing a red sweatshirt along with her gray dress and snakeskin-patterned heels.
During the protest, some council members, including Letitia James of Brooklyn, sought to link Trayvon's death to the New York Police Department's controversial stop-and-frisk practice, which many African-American and Latino politicians say is racially biased.
Speaking of the suspicion that led the Hispanic volunteer, George Zimmerman, to follow and shoot Trayvon, Ms. James said, ''It's that same fear and it's that same perpetuation of stereotypes about black men which cause members of the N.Y.P.D. to stop men of color in this city at an increasing and an alarming rate.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Official Cites April 13 as Date for Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LONDON -- A senior Iranian official was quoted on Wednesday as saying that long-awaited talks with world powers on his country's disputed nuclear program would begin on April 13 and he hoped the venue would be Istanbul.
The comments by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi represented one more step in a tortuous diplomatic minuet over the proposed nuclear talks that is playing out against a backdrop of speculation about a possible military strike by Israel on Iran's nuclear facilities. 
Iran is also caught in a tightening noose of economic and diplomatic penalties ordered by United States, the United Nations and the European Union, including an embargo on purchases of Iranian oil set to come into force on July 1.
Mr. Salehi named the date as he welcomed Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Tehran.
The encounter between officials of the two disparate neighbors underscored Turkey's efforts to project regional power on issues including Iran's nuclear ambitions and the yearlong uprising in Syria. Istanbul is currently the host city for unity talks among exiled Syrian opposition groups and is set to be the venue for a gathering of the so-called Friends of Syria, including Western and Arab countries and organizations seeking a solution to the crisis.
Mr. Erdogan arrived in Tehran from a nuclear security summit in South Korea, where he met with President Obama. He plans to spend two days in talks with Iranian leaders, Iranian state media said.
According to Iranian state media, Mr. Salehi said Iran and representatives of the six powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- would be held on April 13.
''Istanbul has expressed its readiness to host these talks and is still one of the probable options for hosting these negotiations,'' Mr. Salehi said. ''I personally believe that Istanbul is the better option for hosting the negotiations.''
''We hope the venue for the talks will be determined within the next few days,'' he said.
The last time the world powers met with Iranian officials was in January 2011, when talks in Istanbul ended in failure. Western leaders say they suspect Iran is seeking the capability to construct nuclear weapons, but Tehran says its program is for peaceful purposes.
Earlier this month, the negotiating powers said they were ready to resume face-to-face negotiations.
''I have offered to resume talks with Iran on the nuclear issue,'' said Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, who represents the six powers in dealings with Iran. '''We hope that Iran will now enter into a sustained process of constructive dialogue which will deliver real progress.''
The resumption of negotiations could relieve pressure from Israel to use military force against Iran. But the decision is not without risks. Direct talks could allow Iranian negotiators to exploit various nations' differences, effectively playing for time while Tehran's scientists press ahead with nuclear ambitions. Failure could offer a rationale for military strikes.
Press TV, the Iranian state satellite broadcaster, said Tehran was ready to resume the talks ''based on common grounds.'' However, Iran has repeatedly made clear that it will not negotiate on any of its nuclear rights. ''Iran maintains that, as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has every right to acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful objectives,'' Press TV said.
Mr. Salehi's statement came after the United States added an Iranian cargo airline, three officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and a Nigerian trading agent to its sanctions blacklist on Tuesday, citing evidence they had conspired to funnel illicit weapons shipments to Syria and Africa disguised as humanitarian aid and building materials.
The Treasury Department in Washington said the airline, Yas Air, had tried to transport AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns, mortar shells and ammunition to Syria as part of Iran's support for Damascus, which is also subject to American sanctions. David S. Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the Treasury's action ''exposes Iran's malign influence in the Middle East, Africa and beyond.'' Iran has denied sending weapons to Syria.

HEADLINE: New Rules for New Power Plants

 BODY:
Power plants account for about 40 percent of America's global warming emissions -- with the bulk of that coming from coal-fired plants. On Tuesday, the Obama administration took another important step for public health and the environment, proposing the first nationwide limits on carbon dioxide from new power plants. If approved, the new limits will accelerate the shift from coal to natural gas and cleaner alternative fuels. 
The proposed rule says that any new power plant cannot emit more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity produced. The average coal plant emits about 1,600 pounds, while the average natural gas plant emits about 800 pounds. The rule would seem to doom any new coal-fired power that lacks the costly technology (now in its infancy) to trap carbon dioxide before it leaves the smokestack and bury it. Gas-fired plants now on the drawing boards can easily meet the new standards.
In 2005, forecasters at the Energy Information Administration predicted an inexorable 37 percent increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2025. All they could see was more sport-utility vehicles driven more miles and more electricity produced by more coal. Arresting that trend seemed impossible when Congress threw in the towel on climate legislation in 2010, leaving the task of reducing emissions almost entirely to the states and the E.P.A.'s regulatory apparatus.
Now the Energy Information Administration is predicting that emissions in 2025 will be 6 percent below what they were in 2005. Some of that is obviously because of the economic slowdown. But some is because of market forces that have encouraged the switch to cleaner fuels, and some to smart policy choices. Over the last year, for instance, the Obama administration has proposed fuel economy standards that are intended to reduce carbon dioxide from cars and light trucks by nearly half by 2025. California and a few other states been pushing their utilities to buy more power from alternative sources.
The announcement on new carbon dioxide limits for power plants continues this encouraging trend. But it is only a proposal. The coal and power industries, and the climate-change deniers, will try to derail it, in Congress or the courts. The administration must stand its ground.

HEADLINE: For Group of 5 Nations, Acronym Is Easy, but Common Ground Is Hard

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- As the shock waves of the global recession convulsed Europe and the United States three years ago, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China gathered for a meeting that seemed to signal a new era. They had global buzz as rising economic powers, a catchy acronym, BRIC, and an ambitious agenda to remake an international monetary system long dominated by the West.
The new BRIC era has yet to arrive.
When the group's leaders meet in New Delhi on Thursday, their biggest achievement will have been adding an S: they took on South Africa last year. The five BRICS nations still rank among the fastest-growing economies in the world, and, even if growth has slowed, individually, their global influence continues to rise. But they have struggled to find the common ground necessary to act as a unified geopolitical alliance. 
''The real issue for them is to come up with agreed objectives, and also agree on common actions,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a foreign affairs analyst with the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''That is a tough nut.''
The BRICS are still a new group, and some analysts argue that with time they could become a more cohesive alliance. But for now, they are troubled by internal rivalries and contradictions that have stymied the group's ability to take any significant action toward a primary goal: reforming Western-dominated international financial institutions.
Since its inception, the group has discussed creating a development bank to rival the World Bank, and on Wednesday a Chinese official expressed hope that a breakthrough might come this week. Yet to date the proposal has been stalled, partly over worries that China would dominate the new institution.
Last year, the five countries could not agree on a new leader for the International Monetary Fund. Nor have they endorsed a candidate to replace Robert B. Zoellick as head of the World Bank. (President Obama recently proposed Jim Yong Kim, president of Dartmouth College.)
In other spheres, the group has been splintered. National security and terrorism are common concerns, yet the members are not always in alignment, the most recent division being Iran's nuclear ambitions. (Reports in the Indian news media this week indicated that the group might try to carve out a joint position on Syria.) India is actively lobbying for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, a move China has resisted endorsing.
''It's not a policy bloc at all,'' said Yasheng Huang, a professor of global economics and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's really a photo op. It is really this idea that the West is no longer or should no longer be viewed as the only center of gravity.''
Deep internal political and economic differences complicate the prospects for unity. India, Brazil and South Africa are democracies and have already used their own separate trilateral group, IBSA, as a primary platform for coordinating positions on several major diplomatic issues.
Russia, however, has drifted away from democracy toward strongman rule under Vladimir V. Putin. China is the world's largest authoritarian state and has by far the largest and most powerful economy in BRICS, which creates a complicated dynamic. China is the heavyweight, and thus the natural leader of the group, except that it is the political outlier.
As such, distrust is high between India and China, whose border dispute, which goes back decades, is fueling a quiet military buildup on both sides. The two countries differ sharply on Pakistan and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. Trade is growing rapidly, but India complains that China has done too little to open its market to Indian firms. China, meanwhile, is suspicious that India is pursuing a containment policy, in league with the United States, through its diplomatic outreach to East Asian nations like South Korea, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.
''The real story is there is a contradiction between China and India,'' said C. Raja Mohan, a leading strategic affairs analyst in New Delhi. ''As long as you don't solve that, what collective rhetoric you talk about will have limited value.''
The BRICS alliance has existed as a concept since 2001, when Jim O'Neill, a Goldman Sachs economist, identified Brazil, Russia, India and China as rising economic powers and argued that they should play larger roles in global economic policymaking, perhaps by joining the established Group of 7. Earlier, in the 1990s, Russia had already organized a triangular group with India and China -- known as RIC -- but the attention generated by Mr. O'Neill's formulation apparently prompted these three to add Brazil and create a new political club.
The first BRIC summit meeting was held in Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2009, amid the uncertainty of the global economic downturn, with subsequent meetings held in Brazil and China. Last November, Mr. O'Neill predicted that the group's combined economies, now worth almost $13 trillion, would double in the coming decade, eventually surpassing the size of the economies of both the United States and the European Union.
A consistent theme has been to push for changes in the monetary system, including advocating an alternate global reserve currency to reduce the dominance of the dollar. China in particular has used the group as a platform to promote its currency, the renminbi, as an international currency.
After arriving on Wednesday, leaders of the five nations held bilateral talks before attending a state dinner. At Thursday's summit meeting, they are expected to announce agreements that would enable the nations to extend each other credit in local currencies while conducting trade, sidestepping the dollar, a substantive move if not yet the kind of game-changing action once expected from BRICS.
Sreeram Chaulia, an international affairs analyst in India, said many smaller, poorer developing countries, especially in Africa, are watching to see if the five nations can evolve into true advocates for non-Western interests or if BRICS merely becomes a platform for the interests of a new elite.
''At the end of the day, they will have to get into coordinating their positions on international security and global political issues,'' said Mr. Chaulia, who teaches at the Jindal School of International Affairs in Sonipat, India. He said many developing countries want a multipolar world, rather than one dominated by the United States ''or, for that matter, by China.''
Indeed, some analysts see BRICS mostly as an annual meeting between China and its most important suppliers. Brazil, Russia and South Africa all sell rising amounts of commodities to China. China lobbied aggressively to include South Africa in the group at a time when state-owned Chinese firms were buying up raw materials across Africa.
''I see BRICS as more about China trying to have more ready access to commodities in Brazil and South Africa,'' said Mr. Huang, the M.I.T. economist, adding that the other countries were then trying to use the group ''to exercise influence on China.''
Finally, even though the group was conceived as an alternative to American power, none of the five member nations are eager for confrontation with the United States. As their leaders, including President Hu Jintao of China, gather in New Delhi, the United States is also quietly in town. Commerce Secretary John Bryson spoke at a business round table on Tuesday, bringing along an American trade group to visit the vast industrial corridor under construction between Mumbai and New Delhi.
''For all five of the BRICS countries,'' said Mr. Chellaney, ''their most important relationship is with the United States.''

HEADLINE: Pope Calls for a Freer Rein, and Not Just by Cuba

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and RACHEL DONADIO; Randal C. Archibold contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HAVANA -- In the heart of Revolution Square in Cuba, with towering images of guerrilla heroes staring back at him, Pope Benedict XVI called Wednesday for ''authentic freedom'' in one of the world's most authoritarian states.
But reflecting an effort to stay in the good graces of his hosts and usher in even more religious freedom on the island, he also denounced the American economic embargo that Cuba has long blamed for most of its troubles.
And so Benedict, a critic of Marxism in general and totalitarian regimes in particular, walked the tightrope that spans the old and new Cuba, with a visit that lasted just over 48 hours and that harked back to the first papal trip here by his predecessor 14 years ago.
In his speeches and before boarding his plane for Rome, the pope pushed for more liberties, sometimes obliquely, while presenting the Roman Catholic Church as being in solidarity with the Cuban people. At the same time, he sought to assure his hosts that he was not explicitly taking sides in one of the most politically complex countries he has visited in his seven years as pope. 
''The truth is a desire of the human person, the search for which always supposes the exercise of authentic freedom,'' Benedict said in his homily at an outdoor Mass here, eliciting smiles from some in the crowd. ''Many, however, prefer shortcuts, trying to avoid this task.''
He warned of ''those who wrongly interpret this search for truth, leading them to irrationality and fanaticism. They close themselves up in 'their truth' and try to impose it on others.''
Later, Benedict met privately with Fidel Castro for what the Vatican called an ''animated dialogue'' in which they exchanged jokes about old age -- Mr. Castro is 85, and the pope will turn 85 next month -- and Mr. Castro asked for books and an explanation of what a pope does.
Afterward, Benedict reiterated the church's longstanding opposition to the five-decade economic embargo, a rebuke the Cuban government had been waiting for.
While Cubans should use God's strength in ''building a society of broad vision, renewed and reconciled,'' the pope said, they should not be hampered by limitations on ''basic freedoms'' or ''a lack of material resources, a situation which is worsened when restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people.''
In a move that no doubt pleased the government, Benedict refused to meet with dissidents who had pressed him for an audience and made no public statement on the case of Alan Gross, an American government contractor imprisoned in Cuba for trying to bring satellite telephone equipment into the country to aid Jewish groups. The State Department had urged the pope to raise the matter during his meeting with President Raul Castro, but the Vatican spokesman, Federico Lombardi, declined to provide details on what humanitarian issues the pope had brought up.
In short, both President Castro and Benedict seemed to come close to what they wanted for now, leaving scrutiny for real gains like more tolerance of dissent or a holiday for Good Friday to the ensuing months.
President Castro ''hopes that the visit can bestow some sorely needed legitimacy on the Cuban regime and give some credit to the economic reform process now under way,'' said Ted Henken, a sociologist at Baruch College who studies Cuba and its culture.
For the church, he said, ''its cordial behavior and civility toward the government will surely buy it more space in which to develop its religious and pastoral activities.''
Benedict asked that Good Friday be declared a holiday, as Christmas was after Pope John Paul II visited in 1998, and for the church to have its own schools and broadcast outlets.
Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, director of North American affairs in the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview that the holiday request would be ''analyzed,'' possibly for this year or next, but she cast doubt on the idea of Catholic schools, suggesting it would require a change to the Constitution. She said that the church already had magazines and newsletters, but that the request for broadcasts would be studied.
She reiterated the government's position that political reform would not follow Benedict's visit. ''I don't see the reason for that,'' she said, defending a decision to detain several dissidents before and during the visit, calling them foils financed by outside groups bent on disrupting the country's internal affairs.
''I don't know any country that would not have done the same if there were outside interests meddling in their internal affairs,'' she said.
Still, with church attendance in Cuba flagging even as the Vatican mediates for the release of political prisoners and supports economic reform, Benedict focused much of his visit on the spiritual and pastoral.
''It must be said with joy that in Cuba, steps have been taken to enable the church to carry out her essential mission of expressing her faith openly and publicly,'' he said. ''Nonetheless, this must continue forward, and I wish to encourage the country's government authorities to strengthen what has already been achieved and advance along this path of genuine service to the true good of Cuban society as a whole.''
Religious freedom, he suggested, can foster other freedoms. ''This is why the church seeks to give witness by her preaching and teaching, both in catechesis and in schools and universities,'' he said at the Mass, celebrated at an altar beneath a giant statue of Jose Marti, the 19th-century Cuban poet and revolutionary.
Julia Rios, 34, an unemployed cook in the crowd, said she hoped the pope's remarks would encourage more Catholics to become more observant. ''It is important for my faith to express my faith with our spiritual leader,'' Ms. Rios said. ''This will bring others to the church and make more people go to Mass.''
But after the Mass, some in the crowd said they had been taken aback by the pope's homily and comments that they interpreted as barbs at the leadership here.
''That part I don't want to talk about,'' one woman said as she scurried away, afraid to discuss the issue publicly.
The crowd in the square, while sizable, was not nearly as large as the carefully orchestrated political demonstrations regularly held there. After the pope spoke, the response was muted, with no applause ringing out.

HEADLINE: Taking Heed of Criticism, Santorum Tones Down His Attacks on Romney

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
LA CROSSE, Wis. -- Rick Santorum has eased up on using phrases like ''worst Republican in the country'' when tearing into Mitt Romney. And he is no longer saying that a vote for Mr. Romney would be basically the same thing as a vote for President Obama.
Meet subdued Santorum.
After several highly publicized remarks that left many in his party questioning whether he had crossed the line in attacking a fellow Republican, Mr. Santorum has struggled to find the balance between being a tenacious underdog and leaving himself open to criticism that he is just an embittered also-ran. 
He still reserves plenty of derision for Mr. Romney, mocking him repeatedly as the ''Etch A Sketch'' candidate whose conservative values are malleable and insincere. But in campaign speeches across Wisconsin the past few days he has directed more of that outrage at Mr. Obama, particularly over the issue of government-mandated health care.
He is now refraining from more pointed language. Mr. Romney is ''uniquely disqualified,'' as Mr. Santorum has mildly put it, to make the argument for conservatives that Mr. Obama's health care plan should be repealed.
''I've got a long, strong, consistent record on the issue of health care,'' Mr. Santorum told a group of more than 100 supporters at a campaign rally in Janesville on Tuesday night. ''No wobbles, no bobbles.''
The sudden restraint has surprised some of his supporters.
Paul Kurtz, a high school social studies teacher from Janesville who was at the rally, said he thought Mr. Santorum seemed to be repressing his trademark tenacity.
''I think Rick tempered what he could have said,'' said Mr. Kurtz, 36, who was sipping the dregs of a beer as the crowd filed out of the Armory in Janesville. ''I think he was really close to going there. I was waiting for the personal attack on Romney.'' But Mr. Kurtz left disappointed.
Underlining the dilemma Mr. Santorum faces as he tones down -- temporarily, at least -- some of his sharper words, Mr. Kurtz said he understood the need to be so brusque.
''I've seen 10 Romney ads,'' he said. ''But I haven't seen one Santorum ad.''
Given how overwhelmingly he is being outspent by Mr. Romney and his allies -- who have so far committed $3 million to advertising compared with about $700,000 from Mr. Santorum and his supporters -- Mr. Santorum's fiery attacks are essentially his most potent campaign weapon. Milquetoast sound bites do not suffice for the kind of national media attention his campaign thrives on.
And his fervor is one of the characteristics his supporters find most appealing.
''We all wish he'd kind of tone it down a little,'' said Heather Larson, 26, who works at a day care center in Viroqua, a small city southeast of La Crosse, which sits along the Wisconsin-Minnesota border. ''But we understand the passion. And that's why we support him so much.''
Ms. Larson, along with about a dozen other young Republicans, went to a bowling alley in La Crosse on Wednesday to meet Mr. Santorum, bowl and share pizza with him.
But that passion has been the source of more than one foot-in-mouth moment for Mr. Santorum recently. He raised eyebrows last month when he said that John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on the separation of church and state made him want to ''throw up.'' After initially defending the remark, he later said he regretted it.
Mr. Santorum's opponents pounced on him a week and a half ago after he said, ''I don't care what the unemployment rate is going to be'' while campaigning in Illinois.
Though he made the remark in a broader context -- he was saying he viewed his campaign as a fight for freedom and not about any single issue like the economy -- he spent the next week explaining himself.
He was also forced last week to explain why he had said ''we might as well stay with what we have'' when making the argument to a Texas crowd that Mr. Romney's policies did not offer a clear contrast with Mr. Obama's. Then on Sunday he uttered a profanity after a reporter for The New York Times asked him to clarify a comment that Mr. Romney was the ''worst Republican in the country'' to nominate. He said that he was talking only about Mr. Romney's capacity to lead the Republican Party in a challenge to Mr. Obama's health care law.
With some polls showing Mr. Romney's unpopularity on the rise -- a new Washington Post survey released on Wednesday showed half of Americans now express unfavorable views of him, a new high for him -- some Republican voters question whether Mr. Santorum sometimes plays too rough.
''It alarms me,'' said Frank O'Laughlin, 49, a resident of La Crosse who works for the National Guard finding jobs for veterans.
Mr. O'Laughlin, who said he did not know which candidate he would vote for in Tuesday's primary, visited the bowling alley to make his own assessment of Mr. Santorum.
Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum have been far too negative, Mr. O'Laughlin said.
''We're going to point fingers and jab and bruise rather than heal,'' he said. ''And it's all just a lot of noise.''
At a restaurant on Wednesday in Onalaska, a small city north of La Crosse, Mr. Santorum stood in front of a window with panoramic views of the Mississippi River and a banner bearing the word ''Freedom.'' A large government role in health care like Mr. Obama supports, he told a crowd of about 100, poses a threat to their personal liberties similar to what colonial Americans faced from the British monarchy.
''You no longer become a people where the government is there to serve you, but you will become a people just like the folks who conducted a revolution back in 1776,'' he said.
Toward the end of his speech he reached for his Etch A Sketch, which an aide usually places near his lectern. The toy should remind them, he said, ''who is the conviction conservative, and who is someone who, as his own campaign admitted, writes his own policy on an Etch A Sketch.''

HEADLINE: Who Captured the Fed?

BYLINE: DARON ACEMOGLU and SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve has been overwhelmingly attentive to bankers' needs, and that's not likely to change any time soon, two economists write. 

 BODY:
A hundred years ago, monetary policy - control over interest rates and the availability of credit - was viewed as a highly contentious political issue. People on the left of the political spectrum feared the central bank would be used to prop up Wall Street banks; those on the right thought it would unduly expand the role of government, giving too much power to politicians.
In the 1980s we entered a phase in which the Federal Reserve, along with other major central banks around the world, was seen as independent and run by technocrats supposedly immune from political pressure.
But in the light of the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, we have to ask: Has our central bank fallen back under the influence of special interests?
The origins of the Federal Reserve System lie in an emotional debate, conducted more than 100 years ago, about whether the government should seek to affect interest rates - and support the credit of Wall Street firms during times of crisis - and, if so, how.
The Panic of 1907 convinced many people that the United States needed a central bank of some kind. A complete collapse of the financial system was too scary a prospect. But there was also a longstanding American aversion against ceding too much power to big banks.
At the dawn of the republic, Thomas Jefferson railed against the risks posed by government backing for concentrated power in the financial sector. President Andrew Jackson fought to abolish the Second Bank of the United States in the 1830s, the leading private bank of his day, which helped manage public finances and the banking system. Consequently, there was nothing resembling a central bank in the United States for much of the 19th century.
The Federal Reserve System, created in 1913, was a uniquely American compromise, trying to balance public and private interests. Banks controlled the boards of the 12 regional Feds - with big Wall Street firms holding great sway over the New York Fed, which had a disproportionate influence within the system as a whole -- and still does.
This version of the system presided over a crazed and highly leveraged stock market boom in the 1920s and the catastrophic collapse of credit in the early 1930s, while protecting the big Wall Street firms.
Under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the role of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, based in Washington, was strengthened, and Wall Street was more generally constrained by effective changes to a wide range of banking and securities laws. These reforms and the effects of World War II pulled the central bank away from powerful bankers and further into the orbit of elected officials.
Unfortunately, as the United States and other countries learned after 1945, clever politicians can use central banks to manipulate the business cycle, boosting output growth and cutting unemployment ahead of elections. Richard Nixon, for example, famously pushed the Fed to ease monetary policy when it suited him.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve is nominated by the president to a four-year term (subject to confirmation by the Senate); anyone who would like be reappointed needs to please the White House.
The high inflation of the 1970s was interpreted by many observers as partly due to politicized central banks' trying to help their elected masters and failing to control inflation expectations. The anticipated rate of increase in prices has a big impact on the actual rate of increase.
When monetary policy is not credible, meaning no one believes that the central bank will keep inflation under control because that might hurt the president's party at the polls, wages and prices can easily spiral out of control.
In 1979 Paul A. Volcker became chairman of the Fed and tamed inflation by raising interest rates and inducing a sharp recession. The more general lesson was simple: Move monetary policy further from the hands of politicians by delegating it to credible technocrats.
Thus was born the idea of independent central bankers, steering the monetary ship purely on the basis of disinterested, objective and scientific analysis. When inflation is too high, they are supposed to raise interest rates. When unemployment is too high, they should make it cheaper and easier to borrow, all the while working to make sure that inflation expectations remain under control.
Increasingly, however, it seems that technocratic policy-making is just a myth. We have come full circle, and the Wall Street banks are calling the shots again.
Crucially, the idea that politics is just about electioneering misses the point. Politics is about getting what you want, not just through the ballot box but by persuading people in public office to take actions that help you. So declaring the central bank independent doesn't move it outside the orbit of politics.
Monetary policy has an impact on inflation, output and employment. But it also has a major impact on stock market prices. Any central banker raising interest rates is reducing stock market values and thus eroding the bonuses of top bankers and other chief executives.
Those people will lobby, asserting that higher interest rates will undermine the economy and cause us to plummet into recession, or worse.
In principle, the Fed could stand up to the bankers, pushing back against all specious arguments. In practice, unfortunately, the New York Fed and the Board of Governors are quite deferential to financial-sector "experts." Bankers are persuasive; many are smart people, armed with fancy models, and they offer very nice income-earning opportunities to former central bankers.
We have lost track of the number of research notes from major banks pleading for easier credit, lower capital requirements, delay in implementing financial reforms or all of the above.
In recent decades the Fed has given way completely, at the highest level and with disastrous consequences, when the bankers bring their influence to bear - for example, over deregulating finance, keeping interest rates low in the middle of a boom after 2003, providing unconditional bailouts in 2007-8 and subsequently resisting attempts to raise capital requirements by enough to make a difference.
As the American economy begins to improve, influential people in the financial sector will continue to talk about the need for a prolonged period of low interest rates. The Fed will listen.
This time will not be different.

HEADLINE: Indian Students Look Regionally for Higher Education

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: United States and Britain remain leaders, but South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are emerging destinations for higher education. 

 BODY:
"While finishing high school near Pune, India, Pooja Modi started looking for university engineering programs online. Eighteen years old at the time, she knew she wanted to become a solar energy expert," Christopher F. Schuetze writes in The International Herald Tribune. 
"The location of her studies was less important to her than the quality of the program," Mr.Schuetze writes. "Going abroad was not important, but getting the best education was," for Ms. Modi, he writes.
She was admitted to the University of New South Wales in Australia. Now in her fourth year of studies there, she says she could not have made a better choice, Mr. Schuetze writes. 
Though traditional host countries like the United States and Britain are still heavily favored, a trend toward regionalism is emerging. More students are choosing the shorter travel distances, greater cultural similarities and closer economic ties of neighboring countries.
South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are "emerging market" destinations according to Chiao-Ling Chien of Unesco's Institutes of Statistics, which carries out studies on foreign students.

HEADLINE: Is the Economy Growing Faster Than We Knew?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: An alternative measure of activity, gross domestic income, may be pointing to a stronger performance than the more commonly cited indicator. 

 BODY:
There is a pleasant surprise in the latest batch of economic data released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Buried deep inside the government's revised estimate of fourth-quarter growth (revised but unchanged at 3 percent annualized) is an alternate measure of economic activity that is winning increased attention. And by that alternate measure, gross domestic income, the annualized pace of growth in the final three months of 2011 actually climbed to 4.4 percent.
That's the kind of growth we usually see during an economic recovery, the kind of growth that's fast enough to create new jobs. Indeed, it suggests that we may have learned the answer to a fretful mystery. Until now, economists have struggled to explain why unemployment was falling so fast when the major measure of growth, gross domestic product, was rising at an exceedingly modest pace.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday that in his view the most likely explanation was that the pace of job growth was not sustainable.
The data released Thursday suggests an alternative explanation: the government's estimate of gross domestic product may be understating the actual pace of growth. The estimate of gross domestic income may be closer to the truth.
As I wrote in an article last year, the two measures should produce identical results. Gross domestic product emphasizes spending; gross domestic income measures income. And "a penny spent is a penny earned by someone else. But estimates of the two measures can diverge widely, particularly in the short term, and a body of recent research suggests that the income estimates are more accurate."
A growing number of economists argue that the government should incorporate both methods to improve the quality of its primary estimate of economic activity. A 2011 paper provides a good account of the case for doing so.

HEADLINE: Where the Hiring Is Strongest

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A Gallup survey shows Oklahoma City to be the strongest metropolitan area for the predominance of hiring over layoffs. 

 BODY:
Hiring started to pick up toward the end of last year, but you might be surprised to learn which cities were strongest in job creation.
 A survey released by Gallup on Thursday showed that Oklahoma City led the 50 largest United States metropolitan areas last year in the pollster's Job Creation Index because more than a third of workers said their employers were hiring and just over one in 10 said their firms were laying off workers.
 Rounding out the top five metro areas for job creation were Pittsburgh; Richmond, Va.; Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, Tenn.; and Orlando-Kissimmee, Fla. The cities with the highest proportion of employers hiring were San Antonio and Memphis. The results are based on interviews with United States workers conducted January through December 2011.
 At the bottom end, the weakest metropolitan area for job creation was Providence, R.I.-New Bedford-Fall River, Mass. But the New York metropolitan area and the Inland Empire counties of Riverside and San Bernardino, Calif., were also weak. The good news is that even in these areas, more workers reported that their employers were hiring than firing.
 The cities with the dismal distinction of having the highest proportion of employers laying off workers were Las Vegas, Riverside and Virginia Beach.

HEADLINE: Older Women Struggle to Make Ends Meet

BYLINE: SHAILA DEWAN


HIGHLIGHT: Sixty percent of older women in the United States do not have enough income to cover basic expenses without help, even if they are married, according to a report. 

 BODY:
The United States is aging, and a new report from Wider Opportunities for Women sheds some light on what that may mean and underscores the importance of saving for retirement.
Sixty percent of women in the United States who are 65 or older do not have enough income to cover basic expenses without help, even if they are married, according to the report.
That is compared to 41 percent of men in that age group. 
The report compares income, not including food stamps or help with utility bills, to very basic monthly expenses for housing, food, transportation and health care. For a single person, this Elder Economic Security Standard Index, developed by Wider Opportunities for Women, estimates an annual income of $19,000 to $28,000, depending on whether they own their homes outright, rent or pay a mortgage. For married couples, the necessary income to cover basic expenses ranges from $29,500 to $39,000.

More than half the nation's elderly do not make enough. But women, who typically outlive men, are more vulnerable. Nearly half of white women, 61 percent of Asian women and three-quarters of black and Hispanic women have incomes that fall below the Elder Index levels. Men 65 or older report incomes that are almost 75 percent higher than women's.
"Occupational segregation, pay inequity and care-giving responsibilities all contribute to women's reduced earnings during their working-age years and diminished capacity for saving," the report says.
Women are also far less likely to have a pension. According to the new Income of the Aged Chartbook, released on Wednesday by the Social Security Administration, about two-thirds of elderly households count on Social Security as more than half of their income. Almost 40 percent rely on a pension, a type of benefit that is less and less common.
"A staggering majority of older women in America can't afford to cover their most basic expenses," said Donna Addkison, the president of Wider Opportunities for Women. "This is the startling reality facing countless older women around the country and a harsh eye-opener for working women and families who are saving for retirement today."

HEADLINE: Scientists Call for Practical Steps to Smooth Humanity's Journey

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Scientists gauging global environmental trends propose practical steps to cut risks. 

 BODY:
Planet Under Pressure, a four-day conference exploring how science can identify and limit risks in the face of increasing human impacts on the Earth, has ended* with a call for "urgent action" against the the unrelenting buildup of greenhouse gases. But the prime focus, refreshingly, was on boosting science education and interdisciplinary inquiry and maintaining investments in systems and agencies devoted to comprehending environmental change. 
At a final press briefing, Sybil Seitzinger, executive director of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program, which has been charting the great acceleration of environmental impacts, said: "I think we're ready for a great acceleration of the next steps in our science."
(The meeting also saw the release of a new report pointing to ways to address stresses on the global food system, summarized nicely by Justin Gillis on the Green Blog.)
Particularly refreshing, in a session on "convergent global megatrends," was Sir John Beddington, the science adviser to the British government. He offered a perspective on the challenges of sustaining a thriving planet that was far more cogent and realistic than anything I've heard in years. (Watch the video clip above.)
First, he said, plainly, that no one knows at present how to get the world on a path toward stabilized concentrations of the main greenhouse emission, carbon dioxide. In essence, he acknowledged that this process will take a very long time and require a series of generational handoffs, as data and options evolve. This is the iterative "learn and adjust" approach that also was stressed in the recent America's Climate Choices report from the National Academy of Sciences.

That approach contrasts with the strategy tried, in vain, under two decades of international negotiations aimed at building a comprehensive and binding treaty, and, in the United States, a lost decade aimed at passing a "comprehensive" climate bill. Beddington's stance reflects a broader shift away from "solving the climate crisis" toward managing climate risk, both by enhancing the capacity to withstand extreme conditions while working as hard as possible to stem emissions.
Here's one transcribed excerpt from our chat after the panel. Beddington notes that while long-term outcomes for humans and climate are uncertain, human and environmental trajectories through 2030 or so are already clear, offering clear choices on actions that could limit regrets and boost prospects later in the century:
There are three key areas that are determined. Population growth is one. We are going to reach a further billion people by 2025 . We also know the distribution of that billion -- about 500 million in Africa 500, about 500 million in Asia . Changes in fertility will not affect it much.
The second trend is urbanization. There's a massive trend towards people moving into cities in the developing world. And so for example those 500 million Africans are likely to be in 1,000 cities of 500,000 people each. Something similar in Asia except the cities are about a million. So those are two trends that are just not going to change. They're going to be there for about the next 15 to 20 years.
The third change that's happening is climate change. And because of the delays in the climate system, the greenhouse gases that are up there now are going to determine the climate for about 15-20 years ahead - even whatever happens in terms of the reduction of greenhouse gases, or indeed their expansion.
During the session, he said that the challenges posed by these simultaneous trends, in terms of providing adequate food, water and economic prospects, will force governments to act even as they resist steps to address the longer-term questions.
"The seriousness gives me some degree of hope," he explained, noting how the near-term stresses fit within the political cycles of most developing democracies. "I think you have a situation where countries will actually have to recognize these things are happening," he said, saying that the responses will, appropriately, be local. "The world will not come together to solve the world water problem. It will be solved on the local level."
He described steps identified by Britain's Foresight Project, which has produced a string of invaluable reports assessing issues and opportunities arising in considering the next 20 to 80 years in agriculture, water, climate, food and other areas.
One huge opportunity lies in closing the "yield gap" between African farm productivity and that in developed countries. Another is cutting food, water and energy waste. Beddington noted, for example, that China is building many of its reservoirs underground to limit losses from evaporation.
Needless to say, this approach resonates with me. It also meshes with the approach on climate taken by Stephen H. Schneider late in life, when he called for stepwise action that demonstrates success and builds popular support instead of intensifying divisions -- as so many policy approaches on climate have done so far.
Here's a Debategraph "map" of issues and options explored at the meeting. I'll be filing a separate post about this fascinating new tool for shaping constructive discourse on layered issues.
Finally, here's the statement issued by the conference organizers. It is not meant to reflect a consensus of the participants, but does reflect the main themes I heard presented at the meeting. A great way to review impressions of the conference is to sift for the #planet2012 and #askplanet tags on Twitter.
The State of the Planet Declaration is by the Co-Chairs of the Planet Under Pressure conference, Dr Lidia Brito and Dr Mark Stafford Smith, supported by the conference Scientific Organizing Committee.
1. Research now demonstrates that the continued functioning of the Earth system as it has supported the well-being of human civilization in recent centuries is at risk. Without urgent action, we could face threats to water, food, biodiversity and other critical resources: these threats risk intensifying economic, ecological and social crises, creating the potential for a humanitarian emergency on a global scale.
2. In one lifetime our increasingly interconnected and interdependent economic, social, cultural and political systems have come to place pressures on the environment that may cause fundamental changes in the Earth system and move us beyond safe natural boundaries. But the same interconnectedness provides the potential for solutions: new ideas can form and spread quickly, creating the momentum for the major transformation required for a truly sustainable planet.
3. The defining challenge of our age is to safeguard Earth's natural processes to ensure the well-being of civilization while eradicating poverty, reducing conflict over resources, and supporting human and ecosystem health.
4. As consumption accelerates everywhere and world population rises, it is no longer sufficient to work towards a distant ideal of sustainable development. Global sustainability must become a foundation of society. It can and must be part of the bedrock of nation states and the fabric of societies.
5. The Global Environmental Change Programmes (DIVERSITAS, International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change and World Climate Research Programme) with the International Council for Science convened the Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions conference to assess the state of the planet and explore solutions to impending global crises. The conference brought together nearly 3000 leading experts and decision-makers to discuss global challenges and offer new solutions. And at least 3000 people across the world participated in the conference online.
A. NEW KNOWLEDGE
6. Humanity has taken a huge leap and become a planetary-scale force. Significant changes have occurred since the 1950s, and the rate of change is accelerating. Researchers observe unsafe levels of pollution, ecological change and resource demand, with potentially catastrophic consequences for our global civilisation.
7. The past decade has seen the emergence of important areas of new scientific understanding by which to define what we are witnessing:
* Humanity's impact on the Earth system has become comparable to planetary-scale geological processes such as ice ages. Consensus is growing that we have driven the planet into a new epoch, the Anthropocene, in which many Earth-system processes and the living fabric of ecosystems are now dominated by human activities. That the Earth has experienced large-scale, abrupt changes in the past indicates that it could experience similar changes in the future. This recognition has led researchers to take the first step to identify planetary and regional thresholds and boundaries that, if crossed, could generate unacceptable environmental and social change.
* The Earth system is a complex, interconnected system that includes the global economy and society, which are themselves highly interconnected and interdependent. Such systems can confer remarkable stability and facilitate rapid innovation. But they are also susceptible to abrupt and rapid changes and crises, such as global financial meltdowns or the volatility of the global food system.
* Assessments of current mechanisms for governing global environmental change show why existing international arrangements are not dealing quickly enough with current global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. There is growing evidence that diverse partnerships amongst local, national and regional governments as well as business and civil society provide essential safety nets should singular global policies fail - a polycentric approach for planetary stewardship.
8. These insights from recent research demand a new perception of responsibilities and accountabilities of nation states to support planetary stewardship. This requires goals aimed at global sustainability in order to achieve universal sustainable development. A crucial transformation is to move away from income as the key constituent of well-being and to develop new indicators that measure actual improvements in well-being at all scales. Equity in opportunities to improve well-being and eradication of poverty at the individual level will also play pivotal roles in the transition towards planetary stewardship.
B. NEW SOLUTIONS
9. Interconnected issues require interconnected solutions. Rapid scientific and technological progress can provide potential solutions - if adopted in timely manner - to reduce the risk of deleterious consequences for societies everywhere. But technological innovation alone will not be enough. We can transform our values, beliefs and aspirations towards sustainable prosperity.
10. Research plays a significant role in monitoring change, determining thresholds, developing new technologies and processes, and providing solutions. The international global-change research community proposes a new contract between science and society in recognition that science must inform policy to make more wise and timely decisionsand that innovation should be informed by diverse local needs and conditions. This contract needs to encompass three elements:
* Integrated goals for global sustainability based on scientific evidence are needed to provide essential targets for societies. In support of this, the international scientific community calls for a framework for regular global sustainability analyses that link existing assessments that build on the foundations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and other ongoing efforts. Such analyses can be designed to bring coherence to the science-policy interface.
* The challenges facing a planet under pressure demand a new approach to research that is more integrative, international and solutions-oriented. We need to link high-quality focused scientific research to new policy-relevant interdisciplinary efforts for global sustainability. This research must integrate across existing research programmes and disciplines, across all domains of research as well as local knowledge systems, across the North and South, and must be co-designed and implemented with input from governments, civil society, research funders, and the private sector. As part of this new collaboration, at this conference the global-environmental-change programmes support a major research initiative, Future Earth: research for global sustainability.
* New mechanisms to facilitate an interactive dialogue on global sustainability among the various stakeholders and the policy-making community at different scales. Such interactions should be designed to bring societal relevance and trust to science-policy interfaces, and more effectively inform decision-making to keep pace with rapid global change.
11. To these ends, the initiatives above must be supported by:
A greater commitment to fund and support capacity-building in science and education globally, and particularly in developing countries.
A strong commitment to both applied and pure research and increased efforts to bring together disciplines, across all research domains.
Strengthened support for observing systems, particularly in developing countries, including the new observations needed to support decision-making for global sustainability. New approaches should fully integrate global observing systems for environmental and social issues.
Continued exploration of new areas of knowledge, such as theoretical and applied research in behavioural science and economics addressing ecological and social tipping points and irreversibility at multiple levels.
C. NEW OPPORTUNITIES: SCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF RIO+20
12. The United Nations Rio+20 Conference is an opportunity the world must seize at this crucial juncture. The UN Secretary-General's Global Sustainability Panel report, Resilient People, Resilient Planet, provides a strong strategic framework for a sustainable future while calling for a marked strengthening of the interface between science and policy. The findings of the Planet Under Pressure conference support the key recommendations including:
* Fundamental reorientation and restructuring of national and international institutions is required to overcome barriers to progress and to move to effective Earth-system governance. Governments must take action to support institutions and mechanisms that will improve coherence, as well as bring about integrated policy and action across the social, economic and environmental pillars. Current understanding supports the creation of a Sustainable Development Council within the UN system to integrate social, economic and environmental policy at the global level. There is also strong support for strengthening global governance by including civil society, business and industry in decision-making at all levels.
* A commitment to the proposal for universal Sustainable Development Goals is needed, as goals for Global Sustainability. These should be developed to take account of the synergies and trade-offs in and between areas such as food, water and energy security, maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services, sustainable urbanisation, social inclusion and livelihoods, protection of seas and oceans, and sustainable consumption and production. The research community should be involved in the development of goals, targets and indicators, recognising interconnected issues and building on existing measures of well-being. They should apply to all levels of governance.
* Recognition of the monetary and non-monetary values of public goods such as ecosystem services, education, health and global common resources such as the oceans and the atmosphere. These must be properly factored into management and decision-making frameworks at the national and sub-national levels to ensure that economic activities do not impose external costs on the global commons. Corrective measures that internalize costs and minimize the impacts on the commons need to be identified and implemented through regulatory and market-based mechanisms.
2012: A DEFINING MOMENT IN HISTORY
13. Our highly interconnected global society has the potential to innovate rapidly. The Planet Under Pressure conference has taken advantage of this potential to explore new pathways. It has marked a new direction for global change research. The international scientific community must rapidly reorganize to focus on global sustainability solutions. We must develop a new strategy for creating and rapidly translating knowledge into action, which will form part of a new contract between science and society, with commitments from both sides.
14. Society is taking substantial risks by delaying urgent and large-scale action. We must show leadership at all levels. We must all play our parts. A strong contribution from all stakeholders should make the UN's Rio+20 conference a defining moment that sparks global innovation to move us towards a sustainable future. We urge the world to grasp this moment and make history.

HEADLINE: The Floral Parade Has Begun

BYLINE: MARIELLE ANZELONE


HIGHLIGHT: Spring Time, Week Two: Warming temperatures quicken the pace of life in the woods of Staten Island. 

 BODY:
See a larger version of the forest from this week. Compare with the enlarged version of last week's image. 
I had a Snow White moment as I stood in our wooded area on Staten Island last Friday morning with wildlife all around me. In nearly 70-degree heat, fat, furry bumblebees lolled about while cabbage-white butterflies skimmed and soared. I half expected the northern flicker, a woodpecker, that swept and bobbed among the trees to circle back and land on my shoulder.
The floral parade has begun. In our photograph, lesser celandine provides a jolt of color. The bright green leaves are now adorned by glossy yellow blossoms. This exotic species emerges earlier than our native flora, choking it out. While it does reproduce sexually via seed, its invasive success is due to vegetative offsets called bulbils. In the coming weeks we will watch it overwhelm other wildflowers.
Farther back on the upper right bank is a groundswell of grayish green, the leaves of trout lily. Its fishy moniker comes from the resemblance of these fleshy mottled masses to brook trout. 
Downstream from us along the swampy bottom is skunk cabbage. Usually a series on spring would begin with admiration over its unusual flowers that brave late winter snows. But spring is in a hurry this year. Now most blossoms are lying flaccid in the muck while the leaves enlarge and overshadow.
Already there are floral buds on blue cohosh, silver-stained leaves of Virginia waterleaf and strappy blades of wild leek. There is little time to contemplate or admire, there is so much to see, we are running just to catch up.
Spicebush flowers light up the woods. These small lemony clusters, dotted along branches up to six-feet high, resemble a painting by George Seurat. This pointillism will soon be lost when leaves emerge with their bolder strokes of color.
Behind us at the top of the bank is a large American beech. The tree still holds last year's curls of tawny leaves. Among the folds of its flaring roots we find more trout lily, but this patch is in bloom. These golden-hued flowers resemble bright sunshine on the forest floor. They are all the more striking among the usual paler spring forest blossoms. 
Releasing pollen, the flowers are in anthesis, which has garnered the attention of red-necked blister beetles. They swarm above this floral cluster, eating pollen and occasionally immature seeds. This native beetle is distinguished by a brick-red upper thorax, or pronotum, on an otherwise all black body.
Trout lily's flowers also sustain native bee populations. They produce pollen when sources are scarce, allowing queen bumblebees to feed their larvae. These younger bees later emerge to pollinate other plants throughout the summer.
A mourning cloak butterfly appears from behind the trees. It is unmistakable with its chocolate brown wings edged in black and blue with a seam of creamy white. This large butterfly is one of the few to hibernate through the winter as an adult, sheltering under loose tree bark or hollows of unheated buildings. Now it tilts, glides and soars as its dark body absorbs warmth from the sun. Long-lived, it will be our companion for the next 10 months.
Back in Brooklyn, I am greeted by gusting winds, their chill a reminder that spring has only just begun.

HIGHLIGHT: The institutions of the Ivy League and other highly selective schools started informing most of this year's applicants of their fate beginning Thursday afternoon. 

 BODY:
If there were an event like the Super Bowl that capped the college admissions season, then it would likely be this week -- beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday.
At that time, the eight institutions of the Ivy League and other highly selective colleges and universities, including Duke and Johns Hopkins, are scheduled to make available, online, their decisions on most of the applications submitted this year in the main admissions round (usually submitted on or around Jan. 1). We at The Choice are also well aware that there are about 2,000 four-year colleges and universities in the United States, most of which have long since told this year's high school seniors where they stand.
As has been the case on big decision nights in years past, we'd like to convene the equivalent of a virtual, communal kitchen table on The Choice blog. We'd like to invite our readers of The Choice on India Ink to join us.
To this year's applicants: please use the comment box in the original post to tell us what the colleges are telling you. Are you happy with your choices, as they now come into sharp relief? Disappointed? Or are you not sure what to feel, especially in the case of those of you who were neither rejected nor accepted but offered spots on the waiting list?
And now that you're the one making the decisions, what factors will be front of mind -- especially in this challenging economy?
Please let us know.
And for those readers who passed through this process long ago -- or have yet to do so -- we would like to hear from you as well, in particular with some well-chosen words of advice, reassurance and perspective.
And with that, the floor is yours.

HEADLINE: Creation and Expression: Reflecting on Text and Context in Art

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE, HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Looking at the work of Keith Haring and the events and cultural trends of the 1980s to consider what time and place of creation tell us about artists and their work, and what art tells us about its context. 

 BODY:
Overview | What does art tell us about the time and place of its creation, and what does the context tell us about an artwork? In this lesson, students consider the work of Keith Haring in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which can be used as a framework for studying any artist and era. Students research historically and culturally significant events as a potential means to understand artists and their works. They create and present slide shows that incorporate images of the work with commentary that place the pieces in their historical and cultural context. Finally, they trace the legacy of their chosen artist via the work of artists who came later or their effect on culture. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access, projector, audio player, music from the Brooklyn Museum's "Keith Haring: 1978-1982" playlist.
Warm-Up | Ask: When you think about the 1980s, what do you think of? As students brainstorm ideas, write them on the board.
Next, show the slide show "That Early '80s Look" or a music video compilation from that era. What ideas from the brainstorm come up here? What else arose? What were people and the culture like back then? What did they want and care about? What was daily life like? What do you think were some of the inspirations or other drivers of forms of art, like music and fashion? What were some of the important events that occurred in this era? Can they make any connections between the art and the context in which it was created?
Ideas might include the economy; issues like the crack epidemic, which gripped many cities; AIDS and H.I.V.; elements of popular culture like music, includingpopand the emergence of punk, disco and hip-hop;fashion and style; literature; and popular pastimes.
(Note that this framework could be used for any specific time period, but can be adapted to any era and artist. For example, Abstract Expressionist painters can be studied alongside the jazz musicians they listened to as they worked, or contemporary artists and the music or films they like, or that were -- or still are -- in the public consciousness. Likewise, the events of the day should be considered in light of the art.)
Next, play some of the music from the Brooklyn Museum's Keith Haring playlist, used in the museum's exhibit of Haring's work both on site and online. As the music plays, show the images in the Times slide show of Haring's works.
Have them jot down their reactions. Ask: Have you seen these images before? How does the music affect your experience? What do the images mean to you? What aspects of the images seem to repeat, creating Haring's signature style?
Then ask: Can you tell that these images were created between 1978 and 1982? How? What ideas about that era that we discussed earlier do you see being expressed here?
End by checking the two lists on the board: What information is true? What clarifications can be made to the inaccurate information?
Related | In the article "A Pop Shop for a New Generation," Karen Rosenberg reviews the Brooklyn Museum's Keith Haring exhibit:
In 1980, for instance, he photocopied and pasted around the city provocative collages made from cut-up and recombined New York Post headlines. One reads, "Reagan Slain by Hero Cop"; another, "Pope Killed for Freed Hostage."
More famous are the chalk drawings he made in subway stations, on the sheets of black paper that covered old advertisements. The Brooklyn show ends with an entire gallery of them, though the accompanying slide show of photographs by Tseng Kwong Chi preserves more of the original, semi-illicit context.
At this point you will either have succumbed to the blaring punk and New Wave soundtrack - compiled by Scott Ewalt, a D.J., and available as an iTunes playlist - or fled the galleries altogether. The show was organized by Raphaela Platow, the Contemporary Arts Center's chief curator; the Brooklyn Museum's nightclub-like presentation has been supervised by its project curator, Tricia Laughlin Bloom, and Patrick Amsellem, a former associate curator of photography.
My advice: Go, and enjoy the party. Relive the Paradise Garage, if you are old enough to have been there; celebrate the progenitor of Banksy, if you weren't. But keep an eye out for the other Harings: the theory head, the video whiz, the impresario, the cartoonist from Kutztown.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Why do you think Ms. Rosenberg said she was worried about what the exhibition would be like?
        
Who is the "mythic Haring" she describes? Who are the "other Harings"?
        
What kinds of art are included in the show?
        
How was Haring a "social-media savant in a Xerox and Polaroid age"?
        
Were you familiar with Haring or his work before reading today's article? What's your impression of him and his work?
Activity | Return to the conversation about whether Haring's work is emblematic of the late '70s and early '80s. You might guide the conversation by mentioning Ms. Rosenberg's fear that the exhibition would be "one big, marketable nostalgia trip."
Ask: How does the music affect your experience with the art, and vice versa? Should art be viewed, as it is often presented in art galleries, devoid of any signs of its historical and cultural context? Or do period music and other elements enhance the experience and put it into proper perspective?
Working in pairs, students next choose a visual artist who was making art in the same period as Haring (or whatever era is under consideration in the course). These might include artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Kiki Smith, Anselm Kiefer, Judy Chicago and Cindy Sherman.
Pairs can use art books, Web sites of museums and specific artists and other resources like Google Art Project and Google Images to find the works of art they would like to consider by the artists they have chosen to focus on. They might even visit a museum to see some works in person.
The pairs should also investigate further what the world looked like at the time and what some of the likely influences were on their chosen artist, researching historicalevents and elements of culture as well as things like where they lived and attended school.
They can also read interviews and artist statements to glean any insights that connect the artist's purpose to his or her specific works. If possible, they should read reviews written by art critics to learn how the art was originally received and how it is viewed today.
When research is complete, pairs create slide shows that showcase the works they selected, annotated with informative captions and perhaps images of relevant contextual elements - historical events, cultural trends and fashions, for example. They might also prepare a music soundtrack to play as they show the slide show. If research reveals that a particular piece is a reaction to something in the artist's experience or events in the world, they should explain that, and identify any influences -- other visual artists, musicians, filmmakers and so on.
When presentations are complete, students share what they learned about putting artwork into context. What are the insights to be gained? What are the limits? To what extent are works of art the product of a specific era? And to what extent do they transcend their time and place?
Going Further | Students can explore the legacy of the artist whose work they presented. Which artists working today were -- or are -- influenced by them? Have the students choose their own, or assign artists known for their public work, like Banksy or Shepard Fairey, or someone who might be compared to Andy Warhol and his studio approach to art-making, like Damien Hirst.
As they did earlier in the lesson, they will research the context in which the artist worked, or is working. They write essays that outline how specific works address their times, including other art forms, and the degree to which artists before them seem to be influences.

HEADLINE: BRICS: Policy Block or Photo Op?

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The group of big emerging market nations has yet to agree on objectives or actions. 

 BODY:
"The new BRIC era has yet to arrive," Jim Yardley writes in The New York Times ahead of the meeting of the group's leaders in New Delhi Thursday. 
When they meet at the Taj Palace hotel, "their biggest achievement will have been adding an S: they took on South Africa last year," he said. 
"The five BRICS nations still rank among the fastest-growing economies in the world, and, even if growth has slowed, individually, their global influence continues to rise. But they have struggled to find the common ground necessary to act as a unified geopolitical alliance," he writes. 
The group lacks both agreed objectives and agreed common actions, analysts say.
Since its inception, the group has discussed creating a development bank to rival the World Bank, and on Wednesday a Chinese official expressed hope that a breakthrough might come this week. Yet to date the proposal has been stalled, partly over worries that China would dominate the new institution.
Last year, the five countries could not agree on a new leader for the International Monetary Fund. Nor have they endorsed a candidate to replace Robert B. Zoellick as head of the World Bank. (President Obama recently proposed Jim Yong Kim, president of Dartmouth College.)
In other spheres, the group has been splintered. National security and terrorism are common concerns, yet the members are not always in alignment, the most recent division being Iran's nuclear ambitions. (Reports in the Indian news media this week indicated that the group might try to carve out a joint position on Syria.) India is actively lobbying for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, a move China has resisted endorsing.
"It's not a policy bloc at all," said Yasheng Huang, a professor of global economics and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It's really a photo op. It is really this idea that the West is no longer or should no longer be viewed as the only center of gravity."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Contingency Plans

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The Supreme Court appears divided over whether the 2010 health care law can survive without a provision called the individual mandate, Adam Liptak reports. As the justices heard arguments for the third and final day, they focused on the real world consequences of invalidating all or part of the law.
With the Supreme Court expected to rule late in June, the political challenge for President Obama is to mount a vigorous defense of the health care law, even while preparing a contingency plan if all or part of it is struck down, Jeff Zelenywrites in a Political Memo. And there are challenges, too, for Mitt Romney, who, while seeking the Republican presidential nomination, faces skepticism from conservatives over a similar state law that was enacted while he was the governor of Massachusetts.
Jonathan Weisman reports that business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are finding that the money they spent helping Republicans gain a majority in the Househas not led to the pro-business agenda that the groups had desired.
Catherine Rampell interviews the economics professorwho persuaded lawmakers in Massachusetts and members of the Obama administration that an overhaul of the health care system would not work without an individual mandate requiring everyone to participate.
Around the Web:
The Washington Post looks at what the people who have camped outside the Supreme Court during the health care arguments plan to do now.
Happening in Washington:
Economic information expected to be released on Thursday include the 2011 annual and fourth-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims (8:30 a.m.), followed by weekly mortgage rates and 2011 vacation and investment homes reports (10).
The House is expected to pass its 2013 budget proposal, with proceedings starting at 9 a.m.
At 9:30, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on gasoline prices.
Also at 9:30, Richard Cordray will testify at a House Financial Service Committee hearing on the semiannual report of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
At 10, the Senate Rules Committee will consider the Disclose Act, which would broaden disclosure requirements for corporations, labor organizations, super PACs and other groups.
At 12:45 p.m., Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will discuss the aftermath of the financial crisis in the fourth and last installment of a lecture series at George Washington University.

HEADLINE: Toronto-Dominion Prepares for C.E.O. Transition

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ed Clark, who expanded the Canadian bank's presence in the United States through acquisitions, is expected to move gradually out of the position of president and chief executive beginning next year. 

 BODY:
5:20 p.m. | Updated 
OTTAWA -- The Toronto-Dominion Bank signaled on Thursday thatEd Clark, who turned it into Canada's dominant retail bank before starting a successful foray into the United States, will gradually move out of the position of president and chief executive beginning next year. 
In a speech prepared for the company's annual meeting on Thursday, which will be held simultaneously in New York and Toronto, Brian Levitt, the bank's chairman, said that after Mr. Clark's current contract expires in April 2013, he will continue as chief executive only through "an open-ended employment agreement."
Exactly how long that will continue is unclear. But both Mr. Levitt and Mr. Clark suggested that any change was unlikely to come quickly.
"At some point Ed will retire but he plans to be around for a while yet," Mr. Levitt said. "The board is confident that Ed's successor will be internal and will carry on with the same vision and values."
Mr. Clark, who led the New York side of the presentation, that after next year, the bank can ask him to leave at any time without making a severance payment.
He added that although he turns 65 next year, he doesn't anticipate being quickly replaced.
"I'm in no hurry, I've got a fantastic job," he said. "But I also think there's a point at which I have to move on."
While Canada's five large banks dominate financial services in their home country and all enjoy stable financial performance, even during economic downturns, most of them have been unable to translate that success into expansion into the United States. 
Under Mr. Clark, however, Toronto-Dominion has found success in the United States. He applied the same formula of high levels of customer service that also turned Toronto-Dominion into the leader in its home market.
Until now, Toronto-Dominion has grown in the United States through acquisitions including its $8.6 billion purchase of Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey in 2008 as well as its acquisition of Chrysler Financial, which is now called TD Auto Finance.
On Thursday, however, Mr. Clark said the bank would invest directly in opening 50 new branches in New York, with the goal of becoming the city's third-largest retail banker based on deposits within four years. Mr. Clark said it currently ranked fifth.
He estimated that opening the branches would require an investment of "a couple of hundred of millions."
While a stable real estate market with potential for high quality mortgage lending is one of the features Mr. Clark finds attractive about New York, he said that the market's sheer size is its chief attraction.
"The greater New York City area has a deposit base three quarters the size of all of Canada," he said. 
Mr. Clark said the United States economy was displaying some "signs of life." He cautioned that although the bank did not expect to "see a snap back recovery, we may well see a consistent steady recovery, as well as, hopefully, paced structural reforms to deal with the critical underlying issues."
Mr. Clark noted that Toronto-Dominion's continued strong financial performance stemmed in large part from its conservative management style, which avoided subprime mortgage lending in the United States and other risky investments. 
"If something seems too good to be true, it probably is and we won't do it or sell it," he said. "We'll walk away from opportunities." 
While not cited by Mr. Clark, the lack of a housing bubble and corresponding credit crisis in Canada also shielded all of Canada's banks from a downturn.

HEADLINE: The Politics of the Mandate

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Debating the electoral consequences of a Supreme Court decision striking down the individual mandate. 

 BODY:
In my Campaign Stops column this week, I make a version of the fashionably counterintuitive case that it would actually be good news for the president's re-election hopes if the Supreme Court were to strike down the individual mandate while leaving the rest of the health care bill intact. (Notwithstanding the tenor of the oral arguments, this still seems to me like the second-likeliest outcome from the case - less likely, even after the last few days, than an Anthony Kennedy-led decision affirming the mandate's constitutionality, and more likely than a decision striking down the bill completely)
For the strongest counter to my counterintuitive case, here's Jonathan Last:
There is a school of thought which argues counter-intuitively that President Obama needs to lose at the Supreme Court in order to win the general election. According to this reasoning, since the individual mandate is the most unpopular component of the law, it would be good for the court to take it off the table. That way, the president won't be forced to defend it. Rather, he'll be liberated to argue that he alone is capable of preserving the popular parts of the law (there are some) against the raging Republican hordes.
As logically compelling as this idea is, it's probably too clever by half. One of the iron laws of politics is: Winning always beats losing.
Imagine a world in which Obamacare is deleveraged, either in whole or in part, by the Supreme Court. Even if unemployment is declining, it's still likely to be at over 8 percent by the time the Supremes issue their decision. Even accepting the rosiest of economic forecasts, our recovery will still be tentative and far from touching most voters. Gas prices will probably be better off, for example, but the housing sector won't be. In that context, a loss at the Supreme Court would feed the image of Obama as a failed president, a man who couldn't accomplish what he promised. The law, after all, is his signature legislative accomplishment. Worse, it will look as though he wasted America's time pursuing a massive and wide-ranging effort at "reform" that voters didn't want in the first place.
I think this plainly true of a Supreme Court decision striking down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. That kind of decision might be good for Democrats in 2014 and beyond, given the mess of our current health system and the Republican leadership's determined refusal to embrace a plausible path to reform. But for Obama, the immediate perception of political incompetence - - would overwhelm any potential advantages that his party might reap from the decision. It would be the debt ceiling debate all over again: Even many voters who didn't agree with the Supreme Court's decision would be more inclined to see Obama as ineffectual, out-of-his-depth, a failed leader, etc. ... and those kind of perceptions are fatal to an incumbent president.
A decision that only strikes down the mandate, though, is a trickier case. Last could be right: The headlines reading "Supreme Court rebukes president" could be enough to make it a simple "bad news equals bad news" scenario for the White House. But the president's defeat in that case wouldn't be nearly so sweeping and embarrassing, and the world he asks us to imagine leaves us out one important variable: The continuing unpopularity of the Republican Party (and the relative weakness of its likely nominee), and the fact that the White House's re-election strategy hinges on bringing up everything that voters dislike about the G.O.P. Right now, the health care bill is sufficiently unpopular that it's hard for the president to draw contrasts on that issue without reminding voters of how much they dislike Obamacare. But if one of the most unpopular aspects of the legislation gets tossed out and many of the more popular provisions remain intact, it might suddenly become much easier for the president to score points by talking about, say, how Mitt Romney doesn't have a plan to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
Maybe the aura of presidential defeat would still be strong enough to overwhelm these newfound rhetorical opportunities. But it seems to be that there's a big difference between having your signal domestic policy accomplishment amended by the Court and having it thrown out completely - and that once the dust settled, a White House that had been defeated the mandate and the mandate would find its own record slightly easier to defend, and its opponents slightly easier to attack.

HEADLINE: Unions Relish Idea of Romney as Nominee

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Union leaders see an easy target should Mitt Romney win the Republican nominating fight. 

 BODY:
Many Republican leaders are eager for Mitt Romney to clinch the presidential nomination, but an unlikely group -- the nation's union leaders -- also relishes that prospect.
While many labor leaders back President Obama and acknowledge that it might be easier for him to defeat Rick Santorum, they seem to savor the idea of taking on Mr. Romney, seeing him as an easy target in this age of the 99 percent and 1 percent. Unions are already rolling out plans to attack him with a populist message about the layoffs ordered by Bain Capital, his proposals to cut taxes on the wealthy and his statements like his $374,000 in speaking fees were "not very much."
"Do we welcome doing battle with him over his past as a businessman? You bet," said Tim Waters, political director of the United Steelworkers. "We're already talking to folks about what happened in his years at Bain -- how they closed all these factories and people's lives were destroyed by this kind of vulture capitalism."
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which formally endorsed Mr. Obama on March 13, plans to mount its biggest electoral effort this year. It plans to reach out to millions of nonunion members and to try to woo many working-class whites away from the Republicans.
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, voiced confidence that many Reagan Democrats would embrace Mr. Obama over Mr. Romney.
"Right off the bat we see that Romney has problems relating to workers because he's part of the 1 percent," Mr. Trumka said. "Every time he opens his mouth it comes out that he's about the upper class. He doesn't understand workers because he's never around us."
This November unions not only hope to re-elect Mr. Obama and help the Democrats regain control of the House, but also hope to undo some of the damage they suffered in the 2010 elections, when Republicans captured many state legislatures and governors' mansions. Unions plan to run intensive state and local campaigns that go beyond their ongoing effort to recall Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, who pushed through legislation to curb public employees' bargaining rights.
"These state fights are a jump start to get people engaged," said Brandon Davis, political director for the Service Employees International Union. "The reality is we're going to fight at every level. We're going to say that Scott Walker is pushing the same anti-worker agenda as Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. We're confident that if we get turnout to vote in municipal elections, they will also vote our way in national elections."
Mr. Romney has repeatedly attacked "union bosses," saying they have killed businesses and hurt the nation's competitiveness. He has repeatedly denounced Mr Obama's multibillion dollar bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, calling it a huge favor to the United Auto Workers union.
"Big labor unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect President Obama, and he has been repaying them ever since," said Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman. "Union bosses have repeatedly attacked Mitt Romney in this campaign because they know he will end the sweetheart deals they have enjoyed under President Obama. Mitt Romney has fought labor bosses before and he will fight them again."
Unions have already run ads attacking Mr. Romney in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and other states, not so much to help his Republican opponents, but to stretch out the nominating contest and soften him up for the expected head-to-head contest against Mr. Obama. For instance, the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees spent $500,000 on ads in Ohio that attacked Mr. Romney for opposing the auto bailout, a move the ads said had saved 1.4 million jobs.
"Let them go bankrupt," the ads quote Mr. Romney saying. The ads continue: "Romney would have turned his back on us in the depths of the recession, but he supported giving the banks billions in bailouts? That's Mitt's world."
Bob King, the U.A.W.'s president, said the auto bailout and President Obama's push to expand manufacturing would resonate with many of the blue-collar whites that Mr. Obama and the Republicans are battling over.
"He's pushed to preserve manufacturing and bring it back to the U.S.," Mr. King said. "In Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, we wouldn't have much of an auto industry or much of a union if he hadn't given a loan to the auto industry."

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Continues to Rise Faster Than Job Creation Rate

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A new State Labor Department report says the city's unemployment rate rose to a 20-month high of 9.6 percent in February. 

 BODY:
New York City keeps on adding jobs but not fast enough to stop its unemployment rate from rising.
 That was the seemingly contradictory message delivered on Thursday in the latest report from the New York State Department of Labor. It showed that the city's unemployment rate rose to a 20-month high of 9.6 percent in February, up from 9.3 percent in January.
 But it also said private-sector employers in the city added more than 25,000 jobs last month, about 50 percent more than the norm in February. Counting that gain, the city added 65,200 jobs over the past 12 months, an increase of 2 percent, the Labor Department said. That was only slightly lower than the 2.1 percent increase in the number of private-sector jobs in the country over the same period.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been making favorable comparisons between the city's recovery from the recession and the nation's. In his radio address on Sunday, he said that "New York City created jobs at a rate almost 60 percent greater than in the nation as a whole during 2011."
 But so far this year, the city's unemployment rate has been climbing while the national rate has been falling. The city's rate is its highest since June 2010, said Elena Volovelsky, an economist with the Labor Department.
 Ms. Volovelsky said there were several possible reasons for the divergence in the numbers on employment and unemployment, a constant one being that they are derived from separate surveys of employers and city residents. Another reason, she said, could be that many of the jobs being created are going to people who commute to work from outside the city.
 "We saw a lot of gains in professional and business services, a sector that pays high salaries and attracts workers who come in from outside the city," Ms. Volovelsky said. (Professional and business services include law and accounting firms and agencies that provide temporary workers.)
 Indeed, about two-thirds of all of the private-sector jobs that have been added in the city in the last year have come in two sectors: professional and business services and leisure and hospitality, which includes hotels, museums and restaurants.
 James Parrott, an economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research organization, said he thought a more likely explanation was that a significant number of New Yorkers who had been freelancing or working as consultants had found permanent jobs with the sort of companies surveyed every month by the Labor Department. Those transitions would add to the jobs count but would not reduce the unemployment rate.
 Mr. Parrott said the city's job market appeared to be healthy, but added: "I don't think it's quite as glowing as the mayor might want people to believe it is. Unemployment is still very high and there are challenges for many people who have been unemployed for a long time."
 The share of adults in the city who were working was at a two-year low, 54.1 percent, which is a full 2.5 percentage points lower than it was four years ago, before the financial crisis hit.
 Statewide, the unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent, from 8.3 percent in January. More than 806,000 state residents were unemployed in February, though only 55 percent of them were receiving unemployment benefits.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Passage to India

BYLINE: NIKHILA GILL


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs holds its board meeting in India for the first time. 

 BODY:
Nestled in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city here sits the Leela Palace hotel. This week, its ninth floor has been home to the board of Goldman Sachs.
This is the first time the firm's directors have gathered in India and one of only a handful of times they have met outside of the United States. This meeting is viewed as a nod to India's growing importance, both to Goldman and to the American economy. Goldman and other banks are increasingly looking overseas for business to offset a slowdown at home. Also this week, leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are meeting here for their 2012 summit meeting.
Goldman directors are required a key card to enter their meeting area, but hotel staff also let visitors up without one. Executives on the floor, most of whom were dressed casually, some in polo shirts and jeans, were tight-lipped about the agenda for the meeting when approached by DealBook. But there is certainly no shortage of topics for discussion.
It has been a rough few months for the big bank. Goldman, along with the rest of Wall Street, struggled with lackluster earnings in 2011, and it recently faced conflict-of-interest allegations from a Delaware judge, who criticized Goldman over the multiple roles it played in brokering an energy deal.
Then, earlier this month, a Goldman employee, Greg Smith, sent shock waves through Wall Street when he quit the firm and announced his resignation in an opinion article in The New York Times, criticizing the firm for putting its own interests first and "ripping off clients."
This week, Goldman directors are expected to review the bank's first quarter results, which are scheduled to be released on April 17. So far, 2012 is looking better financially than last year.
Financial analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are predicting that Goldman will earn a profit of $3.25 a share, which is up from estimates just a month ago when they were forecasting a profit of $2.94 a share. Estimates are likely to continue to trend up in the weeks leading up to earnings. In the first quarter of 2011, Goldman reported a per-share profit of $3.39.
This meeting may also be one of the last for John H. Bryan, Goldman's lead director. Mr. Bryan, a former chief executive and chairman of Sara Lee, has been on the board since 1999, the year Goldman went public. He recently turned 75, which will prompt his mandatory retirement from the board unless directors ask him to stick around.
Goldman directors are arriving in New Delhi to be welcomed at the hotel by decorative sandstone elephants. The ninth floor of the hotel is a "Royal Club" floor. It has a large, brightly lit conference room and a long, narrow, carpeted corridor with rooms on either side, some of which were converted into temporary offices for the board members.
The hotel itself is loaded with after-hours options for directors, including the restaurants like Le Cirque, which bills itself as an "institution known for its clubby atmosphere and comfort food for billionaires." Rooms start at roughly $350 a night.

HEADLINE: What Do You Think the BRICS Can Build?

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. After the group's fourth summit in New Delhi, Rendezvous asks if it is a potentially mighty bloc, or just a Goldman Sachs economist's smart catchphrase. 

 BODY:
The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa announced on Thursday that they would investigate establishing a system that would allow them to bypass the dollar and other global currencies when trading among themselves.
The leaders of the BRICS group of nations also announced that they would explore setting up an alternative to the IMF and the World Bank that would loan to developing countries and bypass the U.S.-European axis of power that has dominated global economic affairs since World War II. 
In a story on the stakes and the obstacles before the BRICS nations, our colleague Jim Yardley explained that the group had not accomplished very much before this, their fourth summit meeting, in New Delhi. But Jim wrote that they were expected to come away with at least one concrete product this time:
They are expected to announce agreements that would enable the nations to extend each other credit in local currencies while conducting trade, sidestepping the dollar, a substantive move if not yet the kind of game-changing action once expected from BRICS.
But that raises the questions:
 Do you expect the BRICS to change the global game? What is their potential as a bloc or an alliance? Indeed, are they a bloc at all, or just a list of countries whose growing economic might symbolizes the rise of a world where the United States is no longer solely dominant? 
The five countries have very different agendas and forms of government. Does this make forming any kind of unified policy or outlook unlikely? Are they really just a smart catchphrase from a Goldman Sachs economist to encapsulate changing global economics, as Walter Ladwig, a visiting fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, argued in the Opinion pages of the IHT? 
The French daily Le Figaro believes that "little by little, the BRICS are asserting themselves." To what end, it does not say.
In its analysis of the summit meeting, the Times of India concentrates on the group's political statements urging negotiated resolutions of the conflict in Syria and the West's nuclear standoff with Iran. 
Reuters concentrates on the lecturing and hectoring that BRICS leaders delivered to the profligate West, quoting the customary end-of-summit joint declaration: "It is critical for advanced economies to adopt responsible macroeconomic and financial policies, avoid creating excessive global liquidity and undertake structural reforms to lift growth that create jobs."
Illustrating the countries' differing, though not always conflicting, agendas:
China Daily reported that Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader, called on the BRICS to "deepen political trust" in one another. 
Punjab Newsline said India called on the others to "avoid political disruptions" to trade, especially in West Asia.
And AllAfrica.com said Jacob Zuma, South Africa's president, called on the others to invest in his country.

HEADLINE: Artifacts | Bat-Sugar Bombshell

BYLINE: LINDA YABLONSKY


HIGHLIGHT: A nameless beauty of the night continues to bedevil the artist Ellen Berkenblit, as seen at her latest show at the Anton Kern gallery. 

 BODY:
She's the life of the party and she's going bats. Her golden hair fanning out in the wind and ribbons - or are they cocktail straws? rivulets of blood? - flying from her mouth, she kicks up her heels and heads into the dark, dive-bombing the target of her vampire's kiss.
Part cartoon heroine, part femme fatale, this long-lashed, nameless beauty of the night has bedeviled the artist Ellen Berkenblit for most of her 54 years. In her latest exhibition at the Anton Kern Gallery (Berkenblit's sixth since 1999 and her most assured to date), the character is once again the artist's sole subject, only she has never looked more bewitching or her portraits more lush. 
She also looks vaguely like Berkenblit, who admits she has a thing for bats. Not only do her paintings have titles like "I Draw Blood" and "Ghastly Charmer," but they're so aggressively executed that they come at the viewer in a seductively predatory rush.
"I'm not sure what bats represent to me," Berkenblit said the other day, admitting that she thinks of them like imaginary pets. "Maybe it's the nighttime, because that's when I think the best. It's where I dwell."
Actually, Berkenblit lives in Brooklyn, with the film producer Josh Astrachan, her husband of the last three years. (Once associated with the director Robert Altman, his latest movie is "Friends with Kids.") His name gave her the title of one new painting, "Yours Truly, Frankenstein Astrachan," but it's more like a love letter than one signed with a poison pen.
In that purple-hued painting, her needle-nosed character has bright green hair, while the pink ribbons in her mouth are tying themselves into a bow. "I like when things tie," Berkenblit said. "A bow or a tie is a line that got twisted."
Her paintings have a visceral buoyancy that stems from their slashing streaks of parrotlike color and radiating lines of hair - touch points that move the viewer through the moonlit world of each painting. But Berkenblit always starts with her obsessive character's distinctive profile, one that she has been drawing since her childhood in Westchester County, N.Y., where she first developed a crush on her future husband.
"I fell in love with him when we were 13 and he was a leprechaun in a high school production of 'Finian's Rainbow' and painted green all over," she said. "But I was afraid to speak to him then." As an adult, she had relationships with other men but never stopped thinking about that leprechaun.
Eight years ago, Astrachan saw one of her shows at the Kern gallery and called her up. Altman was planning a movie about the art world, and Astrachan wanted an interview. They talked over dinner at the Odeon, and though the movie never came to be, they have been together ever since.
If Altman was her Cupid, Frankenstein has become the driving force behind Berkenblit's work. "He's what I think painting is all about," she said. "Taking all these elements - crescents, stars, ribbons, legs, hair - and making them live and breathe on the canvas."
Her vibrant color sense does that, too. She says that seeing them together creates a taste in her mouth that comes out in the ribbons of her paintings. One of them, "Striper," combines mustard yellow, lime green, hot pink and black. It's also the only canvas in her show that pictures her favorite witch with her eyes open. Most others are all about her eyelashes - feathery curtains over downcast eyes that make the character seem more demure than dangerous. A few dispense with the profile altogether and concentrate on her shoes, mostly to convey her determined, I'm-gonna-get-you step.
Of the lot, the teeth-baring creature with the deep green complexion in "Ellie Greenwich" is the most vampiric. Greenwich was the co-author of huge 1960s pop songs like the Ronettes' "Be My Baby" and the Shangri-Las' "Leader of the Pack." Those girl groups, Berkenblit said, marked her sexual awakening, and those songs are still in her head. "There's something primal in that music," she said. "I'm listening to music when I'm painting and I think of painting like songwriting. They reduce the human condition to the most basic chords, yet they're incredibly powerful."
With their economy of line and emotion, cartoons do that too. "To me it's all calligraphy," Berkenblit said. "So simple yet fraught with meaning."
 "Ellen Berkenblit" continues through March 31 at the Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, the World Bank's Next Likely President Is Facing 2 Rivals

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the first time, the World Bank is considering more than one candidate for its five-year presidency -- a change that reflects the fast-growing clout of emerging economies, even as it raises questions over whether that change is coming quickly enough.
Experts say that victory is all but assured for the American nominee, Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College and an expert in global health. But emerging and developing economies are rallying behind Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the 57-year-old Nigerian finance minister, and Jose Antonio Ocampo, the former Colombian finance minister and high-ranking United Nations official, who is 59.
The World Bank's 25-member board will interview all three candidates in the coming weeks and plans to announce its new president by the I.M.F.-World Bank meetings in mid-April. Robert B. Zoellick, the current president, will step down at the end of June.
Ms. Okonjo-Iweala and Mr. Ocampo have won the endorsement of a group of developing economies. And the United States is weathering criticism for the time-honored gentlemen's agreement that ensures its control of the World Bank, even if the institution's presidential selection process is opening up. 
''For all its virtues, this nomination and its predetermined success reflects how global governance continues to lag behind shifting economic realities,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell and an expert on international institutions. ''Domestic politics has again trumped true multilateralism.''
Global health experts largely applauded Dr. Kim's nomination, and he has scooped up the endorsement of a number of prominent commentators, like the development economist Jeffrey Sachs. Europe is expected to back him in that the United States supported the candidacy of Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister, for managing director of the International Monetary Fund last year.
Ms. Okonjo-Iweala and Mr. Ocampo were carefully vetted and specifically chosen for their long resumes and expertise in development and international economic negotiation. African governments lobbied the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, to encourage Ms. Okonjo-Iweala to run; the Group of 11 emerging economies pushed for Mr. Ocampo.
Ms. Okonjo-Iweala was a World Bank managing director -- working directly beneath the president -- from 2007 until last July. In Nigeria, she has fought to reduce the country's debt, gain greater access to international credit markets and battle corruption.
Mr. Ocampo served as finance minister and the head of the Colombian central bank, and led the arm of the United Nations that facilitates economic development.
In an interview, Mr. Ocampo expressed some initial hesitancy to enter the race, given the odds. ''It is a relatively unbalanced competition,'' he said with a laugh.
But he said his four decades of experience in development and international policy made him an excellent candidate. ''I thought the developing-country candidates who were suitable for the job should be in the race,'' he said. ''I felt a responsibility to put a stone in the road toward a democratic process.''
Speaking by telephone from New Delhi, where she was attending the BRICS meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, Ms. Okonjo-Iweala also called for a merit-based, transparent selection process, suggesting a televised debate for herself, Mr. Ocampo and Dr. Kim.
''I have tremendous respect for Dr. Kim,'' she said. ''But you're looking for the best. You're not just looking for the acceptable. I can't believe what I'm hearing: Is this the same West that talks about democracy, openness, and meritocracy, and it's like it has already been decided!''
In a communique, the leaders of BRICS -- whose countries represent more than 40 percent of the world's population -- underscored the need for a merit-based presidential selection process and change within the bank.
''We welcome the candidatures from developing world for the position of the president of the World Bank,'' the statement said. ''The nature of the bank must shift from an institution that essentially mediates North-South cooperation to an institution that promotes equal partnership with all countries as a way to deal with development issues and to overcome an outdated donor-recipient dichotomy.''
Major aid groups like Oxfam International and development research groups like the Center for Global Development have also called for an open process and criticized American dominance over the bank.
Dr. Kim, President Obama's nominee, has tried to head off some of that criticism and rally support for his candidacy since the White House announced its choice last week. In an opinion piece published in The Financial Times, Dr. Kim called for an ''open, inclusive'' bank, saying, ''If the World Bank is to promote inclusive development, it must give developing nations a greater voice.'' He is currently on a ''listening tour'' through Ethiopia, China, Japan, India, Brazil and Mexico.
Dr. Kim, who is 52, has not yet outlined his goals for the World Bank. A senior administration official indicated that Mr. Obama chose him for his data-driven development approach, hands-on experience in developing countries and focus on the world's very poor. The administration also wanted a practitioner rather than a banker or a politician, officials said.
Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said that she hoped to make the World Bank more ''nimble'' in responding to developing countries' needs and to be able to give loans or other forms of support in days or weeks rather than in months or years. She also called on the bank to improve its focus on alleviating unemployment, particularly among the young.
''There is an opportunity for a demographic dividend'' for emerging economies where a large proportion of the population is under 30, she said. ''The World Bank is the premier institution to support young people, with all of its instruments to create jobs, build infrastructure and invest in human infrastructure,'' like schools and hospitals.
She said she had the necessary experience and familiarity with the World Bank to do that. ''Doing grass-roots development work is wonderful,'' Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said. ''But ultimately, this is about making tough choices that effect millions of lives. And I've done that. And I can hit the ground running because I know how to make this institution work for the world's poor.''
Mr. Ocampo said he planned to make the World Bank more responsive to international development goals. ''There are issues related to low-income countries which should always be the priority of the World Bank,'' Mr. Ocampo said. ''But there are also issues for middle-income countries that are increasingly the bank's concerns, related to global public goods.'' He said the World Bank should work more closely with the United Nations to make progress on issues like corruption and climate change.

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707-1857' (through May 6) This exhibition covers the late reign of the rich and powerful Mughals, from whom we derive the word mogul, tracking their decline, which coincided with the rise of British rule in India. Wall texts describe imperial intrigue and violence, while paintings depict serene landscapes and interiors and exquisitely drawn courtly figures. There are British colonial patrons called ''White Mughals'' because they had Indian families and adopted local customs, and a final section in which the gruesome narrative told in the texts fuses with the images, in the medium of photography, in works like ''Zafar in Captivity,'' which shows the last Mughal emperor as a profoundly defeated man. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Juan Downey: The Invisible Architect' (through May 20) In the wilder moments of his career, Mr. Downey, who died of cancer in 1993 at 53 and is getting his first United States museum retrospective here, reversed the traditional dynamic of sculpture, examining how humans could affect objects rather than the other way around; administered oxygen to pedestrians on the street in New York in ''Fresh Air'' (1972); and cohabitated as a kind of gonzo anthropologist -- or early implementer of art as social practice -- with the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela. Central to his vision, which drew on Frederick Kubler, critical theory and hallucinogenic states of mind, Mr. Downey also developed a concept of ''invisible architecture'' which he described in 1973 as ''an attitude of total communication within which ultra-developed minds will be telepathically cellular to an electromagnetic whole.'' 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Keith Haring: 1978-1982' (through July 8) Heavy on the party photographs and punk-to-New Wave soundtrack, this show repackages the mythic Haring -- club kid, Warhol protege and maker of friendly street art -- for a younger generation. But other Harings emerge in rarely seen early drawings, collages, journals and, especially, in short performative videos like ''Painting Myself Into a Corner'' and ''Tribute to Gloria Vanderbilt.'' 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Frick Collection: 'A Passion for Drawings: Charles Ryskamp's Bequest to the Frick Collection' (through April 8) Modern museums have their origins in the German wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities: collections of objects assembled by European aristocrats. The cabinet at the Frick doesn't hold the same range of marvels, but the current show of 10 drawings donated by Charles Ryskamp, a former Frick director, functions almost like a wunderkammer. There is a botanical watercolor by Pierre-Joseph Redoute, who worked for Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution and Empress Josephine afterward; a watercolor by Eugene Delacroix from his first journey to North Africa; a William Blake drawing created during a seance; and George Stubbs's portrait of Warren Hastings, first governor-general of India under British colonial rule, as Hastings was being prosecuted for corruption. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Schwendener)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Francesca Woodman' (through June 13) Francesca Woodman, the photographer who at 22 took her own life in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures she made -- mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked -- project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art. Viewing this riveting survey of her sadly abbreviated career, it is hard to shake off the admittedly absurd notion that she was too pure an artist for this muddy world. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Japan Society: 'Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945' (through June 10) This beautiful, surprising and sociologically intriguing exhibition reveals how Japanese artists, designers and craftsmen cultivated their own version of Art Deco, that excruciatingly suave style of art, design and decor that prevailed in Europe and America during the 1920s and '30s. The 200 paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, jewelry, fashion and printed ephemera on display seamlessly blend East and West and old and new. You could almost believe it was the Japanese who invented Art Deco. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Kehinde Wiley / The World Stage: Israel' (through July 29) After earning a master of fine arts at Yale in 2001, Kehinde Wiley began exhibiting his large, figurative oil-on-canvas portraits of young black men in hip-hop apparel. With their emphasis on bright, acid colors and ghetto-fabulous outfits, the paintings borrowed heavily from the work of Barkley Hendricks, although Mr. Wiley's contribution was to push things in a more bombastic direction, hijacking the format of old master portraits. Mr. Wiley's work hasn't changed much over the last decade, although his scope has gone global. This exhibition, which focuses on Ethiopian Israeli Jews, shown alongside historic papercuts and textile works he selected from the museum's collection. The result is a fusion of Pattern and Decoration painting with figuration, a mash-up or sampling of historical styles and references. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition' (through July 8) Concluding the Met's series of Byzantine art blockbusters, this show tells the story of the Byzantine Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean, from Syria through Egypt and across North Africa, as it made contact with (and lost ground to) the emerging Islamic world between the seventh and ninth centuries. Loans from Egypt could not be secured, because of the continuing turmoil of the Arab Spring, but important pieces from Jordan, Greece and Georgia are among the show's highlights. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (through May 20) This lovely small show, focused on self-portrait paintings and prints, proposes that Rembrandt was a greater influence on Degas than has generally been recognized. Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects. But a group of four captivating self-portraits at the heart of the show -- two by each artist painted at age 23 -- suggests that the men were temperamentally about as alike as a cat and a dog. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped Modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Henry Taylor' (through April 9) Mr. Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles, paints fast, loose and sensuously on canvases great and small. Portraiture is his work's center of gravity, African-American life his subject. With exuberant generosity, he portrays friends, relatives, acquaintances from the art world and off the street and heroes of sports and politics. Along the way, he takes in downbeat cityscapes patrolled by cop cars and envisions allegories of spiritual trauma in the Land of the Free. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Dan Flavin: Drawing' (through July 1) The artist Dan Flavin (1933-96) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find that Flavin was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper. The Morgan's show includes drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School and will completely change the way you see his art. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin'' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-2 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props, masks and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through April 22) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (through April 22) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. There is also a schedule of performances on- and off-site. An Israeli collective, Public Movement, will stage topical debates around town. Yet another collective, House of Natural Fiber, from Indonesia, plans to demonstrate technology for producing alcoholic beverages and electronic music simultaneously. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption.

'Approaching the Horizon: Important Japanese Prints From the Brewster Hanson Collection' (through April 13) Unfamiliar landscape prints by familiar names -- mainly Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige -- dominate this lavish show, and their superb condition has kept the colors strikingly vivid. The grandly descriptive can turn grandly abstract on a dime, especially when Hokusai tackles waterfalls in vertical formats. Also noteworthy are the prints of his lesser-known contemporary Keisai Eisen, whose inclination to give tumbling water the solidity of nearby rocks has a bracing visionary force. Joan B. Mirviss, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 799-4021, mirviss.com. (Smith)
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Jenny Holzer: 'Endgame' (through April 7) This bluntly provocative show presents the first paintings Jenny Holzer has made since her student years in the mid-1970s. They resemble her well-known silk-screen copies of United States government-censored documents related to war in the Middle East. But here the redacted areas are painted to resemble types of Modernist abstraction, implicitly indicting aesthetics-first art for its political obliviousness. It is a tired conceptual gambit. Skarstedt Gallery, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Johnson)
'Kokon Biannual: Spring 2012' (through April 10) The works here range in size from two six-panel screens by the great Kano Tan'yu (1602-74) that make brilliant proto-Minimalist use of empty space, to a rectangular stoneware dish decorated with bellflowers and pampas grasses by the inimitable Ogata Kenzan (1663-1743). A 14th-century star mandala and a fan with a painted landscape by Tan'yu's grandfather, Kano Eitoku (1543-1590), are among the other rarities in this inspiring show, made all the more so by the gallery's elegantly serene design.

Galleries: 57th Street
- 'Silver and Gold in Ancient China' (through April 14) Ranging from a first-century B.C. silver harness ornament depicting a winged stallion to bevies of gold hair ornaments depicting dragons, birds and flowers from the 10th to 14th centuries (Liao, Northern Song and Song dynasties), this exhibition provides a rare in-depth at ceremonial and luxury objects. Forms, purposes, techniques and surface decoration vary tremendously and to illuminating effect. Standouts include a chased silver Liao dynasty funeral mask and a Song pictorial dish engraved with a marvelous landscape scene of scholars drifting in a boat. Instructive pleasures abound. J. J.

Paul Graham: 'The Present' (through April 21) This latest series by the British photographer Paul Graham was shot entirely in high-traffic areas of Manhattan (Penn Station, Times Square and 125th Street, among others). Its 16 diptychs and 2 triptychs have a simple premise: They show two or three views of the same intersection, taken seconds apart and from more or less the same angle. People go out of focus or disappear entirely and are replaced by new pedestrians doing pretty much the same thing. Cabs speed by, cellphone conversations end, attentions are diverted and street photography is reinvented for an age of perpetual distraction. The Pace Gallery and Pace/MacGill, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Ryan McNamara: 'Still' (through April 14) The backdrops of faux brick, wood or ivied stone wall that figured in the photo shoots overseen by Mr. McNamara in this gallery for most of March are now dotted with small tinted images of people captured during these sessions, as are assorted props and pieces of furniture. Although they convey some of the antic hay of the sessions, and some of the individual objects have decor potential, they're not as good altogether as the original images, which are still on the gallery's Web site. Elizabeth Dee Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545, elizabethdee.com. (Smith)
- Terry Winters: 'Cricket Music, Tessellation Figures, & Notebook' (through April 14) Terry Winters's new, vigorously painted abstractions are ravishing. As if to defend against anti-hedonist judgment, Mr. Winters also offers a series of notebook collages combining scientific and quasi-scientific imagery in Matthew Marks's small exhibition space at 502 West 22nd Street. They are interesting, but the paintings of flickering, warping, spiraling and tunneling diamond patterns in hot and cool colors are the real trip.

Galleries: Other
- 'The Brucennial 2012: Harderer. Betterer. Fasterer. Strongerer.' (through April 20) Organized by the collective of anonymous artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation, this jampacked, multifloor exhibition displays paintings, sculptures, videos and more by close to 400 artists. A radically inclusive survey of what artists in New York really are doing outside the filtering systems of galleries, museums and curators, it is by turns exhilarating, numbing and depressing. Don't miss it. 159 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, thebrucehighqualityfoundation.com. (Johnson)
Guy Goodwin: 'Recent Works' (through April 8) The latest paintings by this veteran abstractionist are laugh-out-loud beautiful. They amp up his longtime interest in bold, roughly painted motifs and objectlike impact through the use of searing color and cut-out (and cut-into) laminated cardboard, with obsessive stapling doing double time as brushwork. More comedic than existential, they make a place for themselves in the tradition of raucous American abstraction that could be said begin with Stuart Davis and George Sugarman. Brennan & Griffin, 55 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 227-0115, brennangriffin.com. (Smith)
Oded Hirsch: 'nothing new' (through April 15) In the mesmerizing video art of Oded Hirsch, who is having his first solo exhibition in New York, the communal labors of the kibbutz become haunting performances. In the 10-minute ''50 Blue'' (2009), a young man struggles to push an older man in a wheelchair through a swampy landscape to an elevated viewing platform. And in ''Tochka'' (2010), men in blue shirts and white peasant hats cross a field and set to work on a mysterious construction project, which turns out to be a bridge to nowhere. Thierry Goldberg, 103 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 967-2260, thierrygoldberg.com. (Rosenberg)
Thomas Kovachevich: 'Alpenglow' (through April 15) Named for the glowing skies that accrue near mountains because of extremes of temperature and humidity, this show is dominated by three large striped wall pieces made of nothing but white packing tape and brightly colored grosgrain ribbon. They implicate the gallery space by adjusting noticeably to prevailing climatic conditions: the tape curls or uncurls, and that makes all the difference. Rarely has the divide between Minimalism and Post-Minimalism -- or Donald Judd and John Cage -- been finessed with such elegance and economy. Showroom 170, 170 Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (646) 559-2856, showroom170.com. (Smith)
Sam Moyer: 'Slack Tide' (through April 22) Sam Moyer's beguiling, expansive pictures oscillate astutely between the sublime and the decorative. Mounted on panels whose dimensions range from about 5 to 10 feet, they resemble much-enlarged, black-and-white, aerial photographs of mountainous topographies, possibly on another planet. They also are like giant, dark photocopies of profusely wrinkled bed sheets. But they are entirely made by hand. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Johnson)
'A Tribute to Forrest Bess' (through April 11) Occasioned by the sale of a cache of paintings bequeathed to a Houston hospital, this exhibition of 43 typically small, intense, richly symbolic works by Forrest Bess (1911-77), an eccentric visionary painter-fisherman, provides an inadvertently encompassing view of his artistic strengths, weaknesses and vagaries. A 48-minute film from 1998 recounts his tormented life and is punctuated with glimpses of additional, often better, efforts. Although up and down, this is the greatest number of Bess paintings to be shown in New York since 1988. Christie's, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street, (212) 636-2000, christies.com. (Smith)
Public Art
Josephine Meckseper: 'Manhattan Oil Project' (through May 6) Two pristine, full-size oil pumps seemingly toiling away in an empty lot of the theater district are intended to raise alarm about waste and the environment, but mainly they exemplify Surrealist cliche, highlight public sculpture's all-too frequent role as light entertainment and -- highlighted with red on black -- are presentable enough to appear on the Broadway stage, perhaps in an update of ''Oklahoma!''

Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation.

Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: 'Henry Ossawa Tanner: Modern Spirit' (through April 15) Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was the first African-American artist to achieve international fame in modern times. After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. 26th Street at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Last Chance
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (closes on Monday) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
- Duro Olowu: 'Material' (closes on Saturday) Assembled by the London fashion designer Duro Olowu, this amalgam of art, artifacts, furniture, jewelry, photographs, books and garments offers an inspired antidote to the ultra-Conceptual, undervisual, often color-free curatorial approach frequent to New York gallery group shows. It moves across time and continents, makes illuminating juxtapositions and includes invigorating feats of recycling. Mr. Olowu's dresses, which typically and distinctively combine bold, contrasting printed fabrics, encapsulate the paradisiacal culture clash that rules the room. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, between the Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Smith)
'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (closes on Saturday) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of Modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
- 'Bill Walton' (closes on Sunday) Mounted by two Lower East Side galleries, this stunning show introduces the distinctive achievement of Bill Walton (1931-2010), a sculptor prominent in nearby Philadelphia for nearly 40 years. Brilliantly adept at transforming discarded materials and neglected objects into small pristine assemblages and sculptural tableaus, often arranged on tiny cantilevered perches, Walton brought an almost radiant sense of syntactical rightness to Post-Minimalism. At once self-effacing and fiercely ambitious, his works anoint him as a sculptor's sculptor, a painter's sculptor and a poet's sculptor, all rolled into one. James Fuentes, 55 Delancey Street, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com; JTT, 170A Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, (212) 574-8152, jttnyc.com. (Smith)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: FRICK COLLECTION: 'RENOIR, IMPRESSIONISM AND FULL-LENGTH PAINTING': (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Above, Renoir's ''Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg),'' 1879. Central among the others is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish woman guides two well-dressed girls along a garden path. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.

HEADLINE: Muddying of Beloved Creek Is Last Straw for Neighbors of a City Reservoir

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
SAUGERTIES, N.Y. -- For years, the resentment simmered as residents of Ulster County endured development bans, flooded basements and ruined crops, all for the sake of protecting New York City's water supply.
But the last straw in a string of grievances was the browning of a cherished tributary that is vital to recreation and agriculture in this corner of the Catskills. Discontent has given way to full-throttle fury against the city, which has always called the shots on reservoir management in the region.
The tipping point was a two-year-old decision by New York City environmental officials -- with state support -- to allow frequent releases of muddy water from one of the city's major upstate reservoirs, the Ashokan, into the waterway, the 34-mile-long Lower Esopus Creek. The purpose of the discharges is to rid the reservoir of clay particles and other materials stirred up by rainfall, ensuring that the water supply for nine million people downstate remains pristine. 
Last year, the releases from the Ashokan Reservoir turned the Lower Esopus a muddy brown, forcing the shutdown of local beaches, undermining boating, fishing and tourism, and marring the sparkling vistas that many people in Ulster County have come to see as their birthright. Now, as local residents prepare for spring rains that could result in more discharges, they worry that the tributary may never run clear.
Michael P. Hein, the county executive, has threatened to file suit if the discharges are not stopped, comparing the city's treatment of his county to that of ''an occupying nation'' toward ''indigenous people.'' More broadly, he wants his county's population of 180,000 to have an enduring say in how the watershed is managed.
''There's a complete lack of respect for the people of upstate New York,'' said Mr. Hein, surveying blown-up pictures of the muddy Lower Esopus in his office in Kingston. ''It's reached the breaking point.''
New York City mostly blames nature. Officials with the city's Department of Environmental Protection say that more frequent rains over the last two years have stirred up sediment that washes into the Ashokan Reservoir's two basins. At the same time, a 2007 order from the state required the city to reduce its use of a chemical, alum, it had relied on to treat turbidity.
The city has tried to cast the discharges in a positive light, saying they reduce reservoir levels and minimize the flood risk in downstream communities after wet days.
Nonetheless, the region is basically stuck with a situation of mud or flood, the city's environmental commissioner, Carter Strickland, told a crowd of more than 300 anxious residents at a town-hall-style meeting that Mr. Hein organized in January at SUNY Ulster in Stone Ridge. ''There are no great options.''
Farmers, tourism officials and other residents in the audience were indignant. ''If a fish can't live, neither can we!'' one woman snapped at Mr. Strickland.
The anger is rooted in longstanding problems. For over a decade, leaks in an aqueduct that delivers about half of New York City's drinking water have damaged dozens of homes in the town of Wawarsing and left yards perennially soggy. And the high levels of the Ashokan Reservoir worsen flooding from the Lower Esopus during rains, residents say, damaging homes and crops.
Then there is the long-held perception that the city will prevail in any dispute decided in Albany -- and, worse, that people downstate belittle rural dwellers. People here still recall a 1984 Playboy magazine interview in which Edward I. Koch, then New York's mayor, scoffed at country people in ''gingham'' dresses and ''Sears Roebuck'' suits.
Yet the tensions over water and land go back more than a century, to when the city, after impounding water from the Croton River in Westchester County, looked farther north and tapped the Old Esopus Creek and, later, the headwaters of the Delaware River for additional sources.
''They made a very conscious decision to go for the highest-quality water and protect it, and it's paid off,'' said Steve Via, who handles government regulation and policy affairs for the American Water Works Association, a group of water professionals. ''They could have just as easily decided to pull water off the Hudson.''
Generally, 90 percent of the drinking water in New York City -- more than one billion gallons a day -- comes from what are known as the Catskill and Delaware water supply systems.
The city is widely recognized for maintaining the quality of its drinking water and thereby winning an exemption from the federal Environmental Protection Agency's filtration requirements -- a rarity in the United States.
The unfiltered system, comprising 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes spanning eight counties on both sides of the Hudson River, serves eight million people in New York City and another million in Westchester, Putnam and Orange Counties and small sections of Ulster County.
The stakes for New York City in doing anything that would jeopardize its filtration exemption are enormous. Installing a filtration system would involve spending an estimated $11 billion and passing the water rate increases on to customers.
While many in Ulster see the city's water advantages as coming at their expense, the E.P.A. and the State Department of Environmental Conservation firmly support the nonfiltration policy. Both say that local communities have benefited from the $1.35 billion that the city has spent on restoring wild areas, building sewage treatment plants, repairing septic tanks and other measures to protect the watershed in the last 15 years. The city also pays about $132 million in local taxes each year, although it is also known for vigorously fighting to lower its tax assessments.
Some political historians argue that the state government has no choice but to defer to its most populous city, home to nearly half of New York State's residents.
''It's not good policy for the state to treat that place exactly the same as it treats everyone else,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz in Ulster County. ''Distinctions are made in law and regulation and politics.''
But Dr. Benjamin, who was born in New York City, suggests that the Bloomberg administration could do better. ''The city has to operate with sensitivity to localities because we're the custodian of the watershed,'' he said. ''And I'm not sure they're operating with that degree of sensitivity.''
Some upstate residents point out that to protect its 2,000-square-mile watershed, New York City officials have issued strict regulations limiting economic growth, enforced by upstate outposts of the city's Department of Environmental Protection staffed by hundreds of employees and even a police force that has been known to give out speeding tickets.
Complaints about the situation are now heard all around the Catskills and up and down the Delaware River, particularly on the flooding issue.
City officials say they keep the Ashokan Reservoir at about 90 percent capacity to ensure plentiful supplies and guard against drought. But John Gill, a corn farmer in the Ulster hamlet of Hurley, said he operated under the constant threat of flooding from the high water table in the reservoir. The Lower Esopus runs a winding path along his farm and flooded it five times last year, he said, washing away the topsoil on 20 acres and ruining crops worth $1.5 million.
''All it takes is a foot of snow and a rain event -- we're flooded pretty consistently right now,'' he said. ''I can't afford taking a hit like this all the time.''
As for the turbid releases, Marc S. Gerstman, executive deputy commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said he expected his department and the city to reach an agreement this spring that would require a city-financed review of the environmental impacts. (Turbidity is considered a pollutant.)
''We're concerned about the city meeting the Clean Water Act,'' Mr. Gerstman said in an interview. ''We consider all these interests very important.''
Officials with the E.P.A. monitor the watershed but have not stepped in, instead promoting further talks. The environmental group Riverkeeper has meanwhile joined forces with Ulster County, pressing state officials to declare the Lower Esopus an ''impaired'' waterway eligible for protection. It says they may sue jointly if no compromise is found.
With no resolution in sight, Sandra D. Sheeley, the youth and recreation director for the Town of Marbletown, said she was contemplating the possibility of a summer with no swimming, which would mean eliminating seven summer lifeguard jobs.
The Lower Esopus is the lifeblood of summer recreation in the area, she said, noting that the town does not have a public pool.
''We don't have anything else,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 2-Year College, Squeezed, Sets 2-Tier Tuition

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- For years now, administrators at the community college here have been inundated with woeful tales from students unable to register for the courses they need. Classes they want for essential job training or to fulfill requirements to transfer to four-year universities fill up within hours. Hundreds of students resort to crying and begging to enroll in a class, lining up at the doors of instructors and academic counselors.
Now, though, Santa Monica College is about to try something novel. This summer it will offer some courses for a higher price, so that students who are eager to get into a particular class can do so if they pay more.
The plan may be the first of its kind in the country, college officials and other higher education experts say, and if the college succeeds in implementing it, many other community colleges are likely to follow. Since 2009, enrollment in California community colleges has fallen by 300,000 students, to 2.6 million, and many believe the difficulty of registering for classes is the most important deterrent. 
For generations, community colleges have been seen as a social equalizer, providing a relatively inexpensive education for poor students, immigrants and others without the skills, grades or money to attend a four-year institution.
So the two-tiered tuition structure being proposed here is raising eyebrows, and fundamental questions, about the role and obligations of community colleges. Will the policy essentially block some of the people it is designed to benefit? Many students believe the new policy -- if the state does not block its implementation, which it could yet do -- will unfairly exclude the poorest students and create a kind of upper and lower class of students.
A financial squeeze since the recession led first to a reduction of federal and then state financing for colleges and universities. Since 2008, California's community college system has lost $809 million in state aid, including $564 million in the most recent budget, even as more students than ever before try to enroll.
Many colleges have reduced class offerings. Santa Monica College has cut more than 1,100 classes from its fall term.
David Baime, the senior vice president for government relations and research at the American Association of Community Colleges, called the Santa Monica plan ''extremely rare if not completely unprecedented.''
But the impetus behind it, he said, is clear. ''In many cases, and California most prominently, amid the recession there was a huge spike in enrollment concurrent with budget cuts,'' Mr. Baime said. ''The colleges have just maxed out in terms of how many students they can serve.''
Community colleges are hardly the only places suffering budget cuts. Last week, administrators of the California State University system approved a plan to significantly limit the number of students it accepts next year because budget cuts have made it impossible to pay for any enrollment increase.
''Every year we look around and think about how we can serve more students, but what we have now is not working,'' said Chui L. Tsang, the president of Santa Monica College. ''Literally thousands of students are missing out on opportunities we want to give them and have the ability to give them if we just had the money.''
Officials in the California Community Colleges chancellor's office said that they could move to block Santa Monica's proposed tuition increase. They said that it was not clear such a change was legal and that the program could limit access for students, particularly those who did not have enough money to pay for the more expensive courses.
Currently, each community college class costs $36 per credit hour. Under Santa Monica's plan, the more expensive courses would cost $180 per credit hour -- just enough to cover the college's costs, Dr. Tsang said.
While the college is still ironing out the details, it expects to offer about 200 courses at the higher tuition price, in addition to hundreds of regularly priced courses. College officials say that nearly every class is filled to capacity and that they are asking departments to choose which courses have the highest demand so they can offer more of those -- typically basic courses in English, writing, math and science.
For now, the college does not plan to offer the higher-priced courses in the fall and spring semesters, but will charge $180 per credit for all classes in the shorter winter term. Nearly every other community college in the state has eliminated the winter term because of budget cuts.
''There is a real concern about equity here, because if there are higher fees that will only gain access for certain students, does that really address the problem,'' said Paul Feist, the vice chancellor for communications of the California Community Colleges. ''The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of students who are not getting access to community college -- and access has always been what we are famous for.''
Santa Monica College, which has 34,000 students, is widely considered one of the most successful community colleges in the country, with one of the highest transfer rates to four-year colleges. Many students from Los Angeles choose to attend the school for their first two years as a way to save money.
California community colleges have some of the lowest tuition fees in the country. And for decades, the community college system has operated under the presumption that lower fees translated into greater access, said John Aubrey Douglass, a senior researcher at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley. But as budget cuts have forced campuses to dramatically scale back what they can offer, that paradigm has begun to shift.
''There's a sense that if the colleges can generate the adequate income themselves, they may no longer be struggling with the lack of resources, because there is certainly a tremendous level of demand,'' Dr. Douglass said. ''It's a much-needed conversation that we need to have -- is it possible our tuition is too low? This is a very important move to push the envelope.''
One donor has agreed to give $250,000 in scholarships for students who want to take the more expensive classes but cannot afford them. Dr. Tsang hopes that will make the program more attractive.
Also, since Santa Monica is prosperous enough to have built a community college relatively rich in facilities, it tends to draw students from across the Los Angeles region. Some say such students may be more willing to pay higher tuition rates.
Janet Harclerode, an English instructor and president of the college's Academic Senate, said that many professors viewed the new plan as having a ''real ick factor,'' but that few saw any real alternative. Many instructors have already accepted extra students in their classrooms, even allowing a few to sit on the floor when seats were scarce.
''We hope that this is just a stopgap measure, before taxpayers step up and the state really starts to reinvest in the colleges,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tied Together in Aisle 5: Country Acts and a Cause

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
MARKETERS working for record labels once commonly used in-store promotions, including advertisements near record bins and stand-alone product displays with cardboard cutouts of musicians.
But as consumers have increasingly migrated online to buy digital downloads and CDs, and chains like Tower Records and Borders have closed their stores, those opportunities have dwindled.
Now Big Machine Label Group, which owns three country labels in Nashville (Big Machine Records, the Valory Music Company and Republic Nashville), is about to embark on major in-store marketing effort, but with a twist. Musicians will be promoted in supermarkets, where the drumsticks are attached to chickens. 
In a new campaign, called Outnumber Hunger, several of the labels' popular country acts will be featured on General Mills' products as part of a charitable effort to raise more than $2 million for Feeding America, a hunger-relief charity. Acts including Rascal Flatts, Martina McBride, the Band Perry and Reba McEntire will appear on dozens of products from General Mills, including those for brands like Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Bisquick, Green Giant and Betty Crocker. In all, the labels' artists will appear on more than 60 million packages.
General Mills has long supported Feeding America, donating food valued at more than $200 million over the last decade.
In the new effort, which will continue through February 2013, consumers go to the Outnumber Hunger Web site and enter a numeric code found on packages. For every code entered, General Mills will donate 65 cents, which Feeding America says is enough to secure five meals for food banks. After entering the code, participants can choose a free song from a Big Machine artist to download.
Cheryl Welch, the integrated communications director for General Mills, said anti-hunger efforts were particularly relevant since the economic slump.
''The economy is part of what really makes this resonate with consumers today,'' Ms. Welch said. ''People may have a greater awareness of hunger because they might see it in their own neighborhood more than in the past -- or maybe they themselves have been affected.''
Feeding America is a national network of more than 200 food banks, but consumers can direct money by entering a ZIP code on the site. Joe Waters, whose blog, SelfishGiving.com, is about the competitive benefits of charitable efforts, or cause marketing, lauded the local angle of the program.
''People really want to see stuff happening on the ground and consumers are looking to their own community and looking for impact,'' Mr. Waters said.
Requiring consumers to enter a code online rather than simply cutting a check to Feeding America ''makes it a lot more potent for General Mills, because they're involving their consumers in the process,'' said Mr. Waters, who also is the co-author of ''Cause Marketing for Dummies.''
That process can help shoppers connect the company and charity, and for General Mills' brands, that ''creates a lot more buzz and boosts their favorability with a key target market, which is moms,'' Mr. Waters said.
A 2010 study about cause marketing by Cone, a public relations firm, found that 80 percent of Americans were likely to switch to brands that supported a good cause, with an even greater portion of mothers -- 93 percent -- likely to do so.
Because country music tends to be family-oriented, said Scott Borchetta, president of Big Machine, his company is trying to reach the same consumers as General Mills.
''If you ask General Mills, they'll tell you this is about the moms, and moms also are the country target,'' said Mr. Borchetta. (Of the 37 albums his labels have released since Big Machine began in 2005, none have been flagged with a parental advisory message by the Recording Industry Association of America for having explicit content.)
Big Machine musicians, who collectively have 40.5 million followers on Facebook and 13.3 million on Twitter, will be advocating Outnumber Hunger to fans on those social networks. In addition, public service announcements about the effort that feature the labels' musicians will run on more than 500 country music stations.
On the evening of April 5, almost 600 movie theaters nationwide will host a Rascal Flatts event that includes recorded concert and backstage film, as well as a live appearance by the band through a satellite feed. Also shown will be a short video promoting Outnumber Hunger and featuring the band volunteering at a food bank. The band, which is releasing a new album, ''Changed,'' on April 3, is featured most prominently on General Mills packaging to promote the release.
In some cases, CDs will be sold in grocery aisles. Beginning April 6 at about 2,400 Walmart locations, for example, Outnumber Hunger displays in the produce section will feature Big Machine CDs.
Country music fans, it turns out, have been slow to abandon the CD format for digital downloads. While sales of CDs in 2011 accounted for only 49 percent of units sold for electronic music, 61 percent for rock, and 64 percent for rap, they were 81 percent of sales for country, according to Nielsen data. Among the 13 genres Nielsen tracked, only two others had a higher percentage of sales from CDs: gospel, with 83 percent, and Latin, with 90 percent.
Music labels tend to promote their talent but not themselves. But in this case, even the label group is getting in on the act. The packaging and site feature the slogan, ''It takes a Big Machine to Outnumber Hunger.''

HEADLINE: Hacking Case Based in China Is Given a Face

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from Mumbai and David Barboza from Shanghai. Xu Yan contributed research from Shanghai.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- A breach of computers belonging to companies in Japan and India and to Tibetan activists has been linked to a former graduate student at a Chinese university -- putting a face on the persistent espionage by Chinese hackers against foreign companies and groups.
The attacks were connected to an online alias, according to a report to be released on Friday by Trend Micro, a computer security firm with headquarters in Tokyo.
The owner of the alias, according to online records, is Gu Kaiyuan, a former graduate student at Sichuan University, in Chengdu, China, which receives government financing for its research in computer network defense.
Mr. Gu is now apparently an employee at Tencent, China's leading Internet portal company, also according to online records. According to the report, he may have recruited students to work on the university's research involving computer attacks and defense. 
The researchers did not link the attacks directly to government-employed hackers. But security experts and other researchers say the techniques and the victims point to a state-sponsored campaign.
''The fact they targeted Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement,'' said James A. Lewis, a former diplomat and expert in computer security who is a director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''A private Chinese hacker may go after economic data but not a political organization.''
Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor the Chinese consulate in New York answered requests for comment.
The Trend Micro report describes systematic attacks on at least 233 personal computers. The victims include Indian military research organizations and shipping companies; aerospace, energy and engineering companies in Japan; and at least 30 computer systems of Tibetan advocacy groups, according to both the report and interviews with experts connected to the research. The espionage has been going on for at least 10 months and is continuing, the report says.
In the report, the researchers detailed how they had traced the attacks to an e-mail address used to register one of the command-and-control servers that directed the attacks. They mapped that address to a QQ number -- China's equivalent of an online instant messaging screen name -- and from there to an online alias.
The person who used the alias, ''scuhkr'' -- the researchers said in an interview that it could be shorthand for Sichuan University hacker -- wrote articles about hacking, which were posted to online hacking forums and, in one case, recruited students to a computer network and defense research program at Sichuan University's Institute of Information Security in 2005, the report said.
The New York Times traced that alias to Mr. Gu. According to online records, Mr. Gu studied at Sichuan University from 2003 to 2006, when he wrote numerous articles about hacking under the names of ''scuhkr'' and Gu Kaiyuan. Those included a master's thesis about computer attacks and prevention strategies. The Times connected Mr. Gu to Tencent first through an online university forum, which listed where students found jobs, and then through a call to Tencent.
Reached at Tencent and asked about the attacks, Mr. Gu said, ''I have nothing to say.''
Tencent, which is a privately managed and stock market-listed Internet company, did not respond to several later inquiries seeking comment.
The attacks are technically similar to a spy operation known as the Shadow Network, which since 2009 has targeted the government of India and also pilfered a year's worth of the Dalai Lama's personal e-mails. Trend Micro's researchers found that the command-and-control servers directing the Shadow Network attacks also directed the espionage in its report.
The Shadow Network attacks were believed to be the work of hackers who studied in China's Sichuan Province at the University of Electronic Science and Technology, another university in Chengdu, that also receives government financing for computer network defense research. The People's Liberation Army has an online reconnaissance bureau in the city.
Some security researchers suggest that the Chinese government may use people not affiliated with the government in hacking operations -- what security professionals call a campaign.
For example, earlier this year, Joe Stewart, a security expert at Dell SecureWorks, traced a campaign against the Vietnam government and oil exploration companies to an e-mail address that belonged to an Internet marketer in China.
''It suggested there may be a marketplace for freelance work -- that this is not a 9-to-5 work environment,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''It's a smart way to do business. If you are a country attacking a foreign government and you don't want it tied back, it would make sense to outsource the work to actors who can collect the data for you.''
The campaign detailed in the Trend Micro report was first documented two weeks ago by Symantec, a security firm based in Mountain View, Calif. It called the operation ''Luckycat,'' after the login name of one of the other attackers, and issued its own report. But Trend Micro's report provides far more details. The two firms were unaware that they were both studying the same operation.
Trend Micro's researchers said they were first tipped off to the campaign three months ago when they received two malware samples from two separate computer attacks -- one in Japan and another in Tibet -- and found that they were both being directed from the same command-and-control servers. Over the next several months, they traced more than 90 different malware attacks back to those servers.
Each attack began, as is often the case, with an e-mail intended to lure victims into opening an attachment. Indian victims were sent an e-mail about India's ballistic missile defense program. Tibetan advocates received e-mails about self-immolation or, in one case, a job opening at the Tibet Fund, a nonprofit based in New York City. After Japan's earthquake and nuclear disaster, victims in Japan received an e-mail about radiation measurements.
Each e-mail contained an attachment that, when clicked, automatically created a backdoor from the victim's computer to the attackers' servers. To do this, the hackers exploited security holes in Microsoft Office and Adobe software. Almost immediately, they uploaded a directory of the victims' machines to their servers. If the files looked enticing, hackers installed a remote-access tool, or rat, which gave them real-time control of their target's machine. As long as a victim's computer was connected to the Internet, attackers had the ability to record their keystrokes and passwords, grab screenshots and even crawl from that machine to other computers in the victim's network.
Trend Micro's researchers would not identify the names of the victims in the attacks detailed in its report, but said that they had alerted the victims, and that many were working to remediate their systems.
A spokesman for India's Defense Ministry, Sitanshu Kar, said he was not aware of the report or of the attacks it described. Fumio Iwai, a deputy consul at the Japanese consulate in New York, declined to comment.
As of Thursday, the campaign's servers were still operating and computers continue to leak information.
''This was not an individual attack that started and stopped,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a researcher that helped lead Trend Micro's efforts. ''It's a continuous campaign that has been going on for a long time. There are constant compromises going on all time. These guys are busy and stay busy.''

HEADLINE: Mixed Results as Indexes Finish on an Upswing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied to finish mixed Thursday after spending most of the day in the red. Investors were reminded that Europe has not solved its debt crisis and the United States economy is far from healed. 
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 94 points at its low but finished up 19.61 points, or 0.15 percent, at 13,145.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.26 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 1,403.28, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 9.60 points, or 0.31 percent, to 3,095.36.
The government released some incremental good news: the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since April 2008, and economic growth for the last three months of last year was in line with expectations. But the government also said many more people than originally estimated filed unemployment claims in recent months. And economists believe growth has slowed to an annual rate of about 1.5 percent from 3 percent last quarter.
A belief that the economy was improving drove a strong rally in stocks this year. Now, ''investors are pausing to examine whether the growth is real,'' said Lawrence R. Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester.
Investors are also waiting to see companies' earnings for the first three months of the year. The earnings season traditionally begins with Alcoa, which reports results April 10.
David A. Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners in St. Louis, said he expected stocks to be volatile during earnings season. The S.& P. has gained as much in three months as some analysts thought it would gain all year.
''The stock prices got ahead of expectations,'' Mr. Rolfe said, ''and there's a price to pay.''
Some of the day's rally may have been buying ahead of the end of the first quarter on Friday, said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 98 19/32, and the yield fell to 2.16 percent from 2.20 percent late Wednesday. That means more investors put their money into the perceived safety of the bonds, which can be a sign they are pessimistic about the economy.
European markets fell across the board. In Spain, workers took to the streets to protest spending cuts. Yields crept up for government bonds issued by Spain and Italy, a possible sign of investor concern about those countries' debt problems.
''I think there's a little bit of nervousness creeping in,'' said Paul J. Simon, chief investment officer at the Tactical Allocation Group in Birmingham, Mich.
The price of oil fell $2.63 to $102.78 in New York, the first time it has finished under $103 in more than a month, after France's prime minister said there was a ''good chance'' the United States and Europe would release oil reserves.
Gasoline at the pump rose a penny, to an average $3.92 a gallon.
President Obama weighed in, making a plea to Congress to end $4 billion in tax subsidies to oil companies, but he was rebuffed when the Senate turned back a Democratic bill that would have done just that.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Borough President Wants N.Y.U. to Trim Expansion Plans

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York University is having a hard time selling its ambitious plan to expand its Greenwich Village campus to Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, who is expected in the next two weeks to make a pivotal recommendation on the project's future.
Mr. Stringer wants the university to scale down its proposal substantially before he will endorse it, people familiar with his thinking said. 
Mr. Stringer is frustrated that N.Y.U., in his view, seems to be backpedaling on a 26-page proposal it put forward in January that indicated it could shrink its plan to erect four academic and dormitory buildings, whose total size would equal that of the Empire State Building, within two housing complexes south of Washington Square Park.
In Mr. Stringer's view, N.Y.U. proposed a 2.2 million-square-foot expansion, but said it could live with 1.5 million square feet as long as it could locate the remaining 700,000 square feet elsewhere in its neighborhood, which the university defines as extending virtually from Canal Street to 23rd Street.
According to officials close to Mr. Stringer, the university's lawyers have now indicated that the university wants to concentrate the entire expansion -- perhaps the largest construction project ever proposed for Greenwich Village -- within the footprint of the two apartment complexes, Washington Square Village and University Village. Those close to Mr. Stringer asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose private conversations.
Mr. Stringer would not discuss his conversations with the university, but said in an interview on Thursday: ''When you propose a plan you know will overwhelm the existing community, you lose credibility with architects, planners and land-use experts, and you lose the heart and soul of a community.''
The university argues that it has been put in a no-win situation. Opponents of N.Y.U.'s construction projects in Greenwich Village have long urged it to build within its core campus and not swallow up or tear down the neighborhood's low-rise building stock.
But the university's willingness to restrict its current expansion plan to property it already owns -- the superblocks where the apartment complexes are located -- keeps running into fierce resistance from many neighbors.
John Beckman, a spokesman for the university, said that a chart highlighting the 700,000 square feet of swing space was ''meant to illustrate that the less that was approved for us to have on the superblocks, the more we would need to go out and find space in the neighborhood.'' Any other interpretation, he said, was a ''willful misreading.''
''The plan that N.Y.U. is proposing is a response to constant urging we had about staying on our own footprint instead of acquiring new properties and expanding in the neighborhood,'' Mr. Beckman said.
The local community board unanimously recommended in February that the City Council, which will make the ultimate decision on the expansion plan because it requires zoning changes, reject the university's plan because, it contended, the project was too dense and tall and would mar the neighborhood's character.
Mr. Stringer must weigh in by April 12, and his opinion, although advisory, is considered crucial. He is expected to run for mayor, and his rejection of N.Y.U.'s plan could put Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who is also expected to run for mayor, in a difficult spot.
Both officials are competing for the generally liberal votes of neighborhoods like the Village, the East Village and Chelsea. Yet both are also sensitive to the needs of the city's universities -- important economic engines -- to remain competitive and do not want to be seen as antidevelopment, since developers make up a sizable cadre of political contributors.
Mr. Stringer has been able to burnish his reputation with his constituents with compromises he helped engineer for Columbia University's plan to build a campus in West Harlem and Fordham University's plan to expand at Lincoln Center.
''I'm hoping N.Y.U. will live up to the planning principles we developed with the community in the last five years and come to the table with an expansion plan that balances the needs of the university with that of the community,'' Mr. Stringer said.
In pressing a plan it calls N.Y.U. 2031, the university says it needs to grow in order to accommodate a student body that has half the space per student that comparable schools have and to attract faculty.

HEADLINE: A Fleeting Beauty, Shared With the Multitudes

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
IT is a rite of spring for many longtime Washingtonians: Find out when the city's gorgeous Japanese cherry trees will explode in pink-and-white blossoms, and then avoid the monuments area, and the crush of tourists, for the duration.
This year, however, your correspondent made an exception, and not because I figured that many out-of-towners were no doubt foiled by the blooms' extremely early arrival. On a recent Sunday I shelved the jaded attitude on learning that 2012 is the centennial of the trees' planting; that called for a return visit. 
I never had thought about Washington without its cherry trees; as a child growing up 500 miles away, I'm sure I thought cherry was the specimen that young George Washington cut down. Yet neither he nor Thomas Jefferson nor Abraham Lincoln, whose memorials are framed by the delicate flowers in countless photographs and postcards, ever set eyes on a cherry tree here.
From past experience -- seeing the blossoms for the first time as a new resident more than a quarter-century ago and again when my children were young -- I knew what to do before heading to the Tidal Basin: Get in the zone.
Prepare mentally, those of you planning ahead for next year's blooming, for lots of other people who will be sharing the view, no matter when you go, and just enjoy both the flora and the fauna. If there is light, and even if there is not, there will be people of all ages and tongues.
My first year here, I jogged from my house on Capitol Hill at dawn on a weekend, thinking it would be pretty much me, the monuments and the blossoms. I should have known that others -- on foot and especially in cars -- would have the same idea. (Still, I have often wondered: Just when do those photographers go, the ones who snap the postcard and calendar photos of the Tidal Basin in bloom without a man or minivan in sight?)
My trepidation was all the greater for knowing that since my last visit at cherry blossom season, a few new tourist magnets had been added to the area: memorials to World War II, the Korean War, Franklin D. Roosevelt and, most recently, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Yet if there are thousands of people, there are also thousands of trees to share, spreading beyond the Jefferson Memorial to the Washington Monument. Japan sent 3,020 saplings for that first gift in 1912 and another 3,800 in 1965. The National Park Service over the years has planted new trees from the grafts of the old and has so well maintained the originals that about a hundred of them have reached 100. Their aged, bent and gnarly trunks and branches make for a dramatic contrast with the young, fragile blossoms, a contrast that can be appreciated only by walking beneath the floral canopy.
Yes, walking. No amount of mental prep can make me tolerant of the too many tourists whose idea of seeing the scenery is doing so from within the cars that creep along the roads circling the Tidal Basin. Looking for a close-by parking space? There are not many, and why would there be? The National Mall is the nation's front yard; the point here is nature, not Nascar. (And beware, on my recent mid-Sunday visit, the financially struggling Park Service had its folks out in force, ticketing vehicles in ''Permit Parking Only'' spaces.
How much are the fines? a woman asked a ranger writing a ticket for a car with New York plates. ''Twenty-five dollars and tow costs,'' he said. She skedaddled back to her just-parked car.)
Confession: I did drive to the National Mall that Sunday, but I knew to take 15th Street through downtown Washington, pass the Washington Monument and wind behind the Jefferson Memorial to East Potomac Park. Parallel roads on that long spit of land, Hains Point, which juts into the Potomac River, allow parking in each direction.
Still, the best bets for those without cars or familiarity with Washington's tourist-unfriendly roads is to take a taxi or ride the Metro subway system's Blue Line, exiting at the Smithsonian station. When you emerge on the Mall, walk toward the Washington Monument. From the cherry orchard there, to the left looms the pink necklace around the Tidal Basin, with the Jefferson Memorial as its marble pendant.
From far and near, the blossoms do not disappoint. But up close, the Tidal Basin is another story. The concrete seawall that forms the circular promenade beneath the trees' branches was decrepit in the late 1980s. It's worse now: Cracked, sloping toward the water, full of standing puddles in many spots, the walk forces pedestrians to look down frequently for their own safety when they want to be looking up.
(Just consider the wreckage as another monument, a metaphorical one, representing Washington's broken political system. The $800 billion economic-stimulus package that President Obama signed into law three years ago included $200 million to rehabilitate the National Mall, mostly to repair the Tidal Basin seawall.
But conservative pundits and Congressional Republicans seized on the sum as evidence of the measure's excess -- Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican who is now the House majority leader, said the money would be used to ''upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington'' -- and it was yanked from the legislation. PolitiFact.com, the nonpartisan fact-checking group, ruled Mr. Cantor's claim false, saying he ''grossly distorted the numbers to make a point.'')
I joined the parade at the Jefferson Memorial, where it is most crowded, and slowly made my way around, zigging and zagging to avoid ruining someone's family photo and ducking out occasionally to enjoy the view from a bench or the grass. The one irritant was the man with twins in a double-wide stroller on a bridge path little wider, who braked right there to take a photo, seemingly oblivious to those of us he had stopped cold.
Yet, having adjusted my attitude, I was entertained both by snarling children tugging at their parents' arms to leave and by parents barking at their kids to ''Smile!'' for another photo, glad to have that maternal experience behind me. A young woman in a bridal gown posed for her portrait. Eavesdropping on conversations, I counted languages -- Spanish, German, French and English of the Irish and Australian varieties and, of course, Japanese.
Oh, and once in a while I gazed at the blossoms.

Previews and Openings
'Being Shakespeare' (opens on Wednesday) Simon Callow brings his plummy tones and a lifetime of experience in classical theater to this play by the Shakespeare scholar Jonathan Bate, structured along the lines of the ''Seven Ages of Man'' speech from ''As You Like It.'' Directed and designed by Tom Cairns, the solo piece threads together soliloquies, poetry and dramatic excerpts to take a fresh look at the life of the Bard. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (David Rooney) 
'Clybourne Park' (in previews; opens on April 19) After winning the Pulitzer Prize and becoming a hit in London, this Bruce Norris play moves to Broadway in this production, first seen at Playwrights Horizons in early 2010. Riffing on a situation depicted in Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun,'' this satire on social prejudices jumps from 1959 to 2009, examining how we think and, more important, talk about race, then and now. Directed by Pam MacKinnon. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Columnist' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 25) John Lithgow stars in David Auburn's new play as the renowned American journalist Joseph Alsop, who becomes embroiled in political and personal dramas as the mood in Washington shifts at the dawn of the 1960s. Returning to Manhattan Theater Club, Mr. Auburn is reunited with his director on ''Proof,'' Daniel Sullivan, in a production that also features Margaret Colin and Boyd Gaines. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Don't Dress for Dinner' (previews start on Friday; opens on April 26) Roundabout aims to capitalize on the success of the Tony-winning 2008 revival of ''Boeing-Boeing'' with Marc Camoletti's sequel to his '60s sex farce. Back on the same stage where he played Valmont in ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the British actor Ben Daniels steps into the shoes of Robert (the role played by Mark Rylance in ''Boeing-Boeing'') in the comedy about a romantic rendezvous gone awry. John Tillinger's production also stars Patricia Kalember, Adam James and Jennifer Tilly. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'An Early History of Fire' (previews start on Thursday; opens on April 30) Following the New Group's 2005 revival of ''Hurlyburly,'' David Rabe returns to the company with this premiere about America's loss of innocence, directed by Jo Bonney. Set in a small Midwestern town in the early '60s, the play focuses on a young man pulled between the grip of his immigrant father and the mind-expanding ideas of a woman returning from college in the East. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'End of the Rainbow' (in previews; opens on Monday) Transferring from a hit London run and a pre-Broadway engagement at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Peter Quilter's bio-play with songs chronicles the 1968 comeback attempt of an addled Judy Garland, channeled here in an acclaimed performance by Tracie Bennett. Directed by Terry Johnson (who staged the recent revival of ''La Cage aux Folles''), the production also stars Michael Cumpsty. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, endoftherainbowbroadway.com. (Rooney)
'Evita' (in previews; opens on Thursday) One of the defining musicals of its era, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1978 Eva Peron bio-drama returns in its first Broadway revival, with the Argentine actress Elena Roger reprising the star turn that earned her kudos in London. (With luck, she will erase all memories of Madonna in the role.) Flanking her in Michael Grandage's production are Michael Cerveris, as Juan Peron, and Ricky Martin, swapping la vida loca for that of the show's enigmatic narrator, Che. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Ghost: The Musical' (in previews; opens on April 23) Yes, there's a new score by Dave Stewart (formerly half of Eurythmics) and Glen Ballard (a key collaborator of Alanis Morissette and Michael Jackson). But fret not, you won't be denied hearing the Righteous Brothers hit ''Unchained Melody,'' which had women flocking to pottery classes when the smash 1990 movie was released. Bruce Joel Rubin has adapted his Oscar-winning screenplay for the stage, with Matthew Warchus directing the afterlife love story. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Gore Vidal's The Best Man' (in previews; opens on Sunday) How will the ruthless chicanery of Mr. Vidal's 1960 play about the presidential primary season measure up against its real-life contemporary counterpart? Quite well if the top-notch cast assembled for Michael Wilson's Broadway revival is any indication. That lineup includes James Earl Jones, John Larroquette, Candice Bergen, Angela Lansbury, Eric McCormack, Kerry Butler, Jefferson Mays and Michael McKean. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Judith of Bethulia' (opens on Friday) After crucifying Hollywood convent movies in ''The Divine Sister,'' the peerless drag satirist Charles Busch turns his celebratory attention to biblical epics in this limited engagement running for just 24 performances (and off limits to reviewers). Directed by the playwright and star's frequent collaborator, Carl Andress, the bawdy comedy's ensemble features Mary Testa and Jennifer Cody alongside Mr. Busch as a comely widow surrounded by lepers, whores, eunuchs and centurions. Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'Leap of Faith' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 26) A couple of seasons ago it was race; now it's religion. Joining ''The Book of Mormon,'' ''Sister Act,'' ''Godspell'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' in shining divine light on Broadway, this musical stars Raul Esparza as Jonas Nightingale, the con-man faith healer played by Steve Martin in the 1992 movie of the same name. Christopher Ashley directs the show, which has a book by Janus Cercone and Warren Leight, music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glenn Slater. St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Lyons' (previews start on Thursday; opens on April 23) A hit downtown when it had its premiere at the Vineyard Theater, this Nicky Silver comedy transfers to Broadway. Described by Ben Brantley in The New York Times as a ''savagely sentimental portrait of familial loneliness,'' the play stars Linda Lavin as a tart-tongued Jewish mother whose brood regroups around a hospital bed, waiting for her husband to die. Mark Brokaw's production welcomes back the entire original cast, which also includes Dick Latessa, Michael Esper and Kate Jennings Grant. Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Magic/Bird' (in previews; opens on April 11) After teaming up for the football-themed ''Lombardi,'' the playwright Eric Simonson and the director Thomas Kail continue to mine sports for drama in this N.B.A.-backed account of the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, which captivated basketball fans and yielded one of the most famous friendships in professional sports. Kevin Daniels and Tug Coker play the hoop stars. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Massacre (Sing to Your Children)' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 12) Brian Mertes directs this reconceived version of Jose Rivera's 2007 play, set in a small New Hampshire town where seven friends conspire to murder their mysterious neighbor. Presented by Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, the work has also spawned a pilot, again written by Mr. Rivera, for a one-hour HBO series called ''Mayhem.'' Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (in previews; opens on April 29) Invariably a magnet for top acting talent, Classic Stage has assembled an intriguing cast for Tony Speciale's production. With Bebe Neuwirth, Christina Ricci, Anthony Heald, Taylor Mac and David Greenspan on hand, this promises not to be another routine flit through Shakespeare's enchanted woods. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Rooney)
'The Morini Strad' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Casey Childs directs the New York premiere of this play by Willy Holtzman, inspired by the true story of the concert violinist Erica Morini and her beloved Stradivarius. The cast of this Primary Stages production includes Michael Laurence, Mary Beth Peil and the violin soloist Hanah Stuart. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Rooney)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' (in previews; opens on April 24) Following in the footsteps of ''Crazy for You,'' this new musical with a book by Joe DiPietro (''Memphis'') stitches nuggets from the Gershwin songbook into a Roaring '20s story of playboys, politicians, bootleggers and chorus girls. Fresh from her lauded work on ''Anything Goes,'' Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a stellar cast headed by Matthew Broderick, Kelli O'Hara, Estelle Parsons and Judy Kaye. Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Ninth and Joanie' (previews start on Thursday; opens on April 18) A member of LAByrinth Theater Company since 2003, Brett C. Leonard (''Unconditional'') returns with this portrait of a South Philadelphia Italian-American family in crisis. Mark Wing-Davey directs a cast that includes Kevin Corrigan, Dominic Fumusa (''Nurse Jackie'') and Bob Glaudini. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'Out of Iceland' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Josh Hecht stages this premiere for Culture Project of Drew Larimore's modern-day fairy tale about a woman who falls off an Icelandic volcano and wakes up on the couch of a complete stranger. Lea DeLaria plays a flamboyant troll who appears to her out of the television with a warning. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, outoficeland.com. (Rooney)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' (in previews; opens on April 15) After a hit downtown run at New York Theater Workshop, this ''Peter Pan'' origin story, adapted by Rick Elice (''Jersey Boys'') from the best seller by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, moves to Broadway. Christian Borle (''Smash''), Adam Chanler-Berat and Celia Keenan-Bolger star in the imaginative mix of old-fashioned story theater, song and playful hipster humor, directed by Roger Rees and Alex Timbers. Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'A Slow Air' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 12) Arriving in New York from the Tron Theater in Glasgow and last summer's Edinburgh Festival Fringe, this drama written and directed by the Scottish playwright David Harrower (''Blackbird'') weighs the impact of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attacks through the eyes of a family from the village where the terrorist activity was planned. The production kicks off 59E59's Scotland Week celebrations. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
'A Streetcar Named Desire' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 22) From the same producing team behind the all-black 2008 revival of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' comes this multiracial rethink on another Tennessee Williams classic. Waging the war between delusional fantasy and brutal reality this time are Nicole Ari Parker as Blanche and Blair Underwood as Stanley, with Daphne Rubin-Vega as Stella and Wood Harris as Mitch. Emily Mann directs a production that features original music by Terence Blanchard. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Taming of the Shrew' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Maggie Siff (''Mad Men'') and Andy Grotelueschen lead the cast as the brawling lovebirds Kate and Petruchio in Arin Arbus's postfeminist take on sexual politics according to Shakespeare. Ms. Arbus returns to Theater for a New Audience, where she staged acclaimed productions of ''Othello'' and ''Measure for Measure.'' The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Death of a Salesman' Mike Nichols has created an immaculate monument to Arthur Miller's masterpiece, starring a deeply thoughtful, if uneasily cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman. The production is exceptionally lucid, but the experience is rather dutiful, like visiting a great historic landmark. The dedicated cast includes Linda Emond, Andrew Garfield and the excellent Bill Camp and Finn Wittrock (2:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Jesus Christ Superstar' Another op'nin', another crucifixion. Des McAnuff's flashy modern-dress revival of the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber pop-rock musical features a tasty villain in Josh Young's Judas Iscariot, but Mr. McAnuff's sleek staging cannot mask the musical's absurdities (2:00). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties (2:00). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman (who concludes his run on Sunday) is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold is the smooth director. On Tuesday, Jeff Goldblum takes over the role of the seminar leader (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the Gothic rafters, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'Beyond the Horizon' Eugene O'Neill's bleak 1920 drama, a tale of two brothers beaten up by bad choices and bad karma, has been given a dutiful revival by the Irish Repertory Theater. Directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, this is a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other march into a grim destiny that even Thomas Hardy might have deemed excessive (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)
'The Big Meal' Dan LeFranc's comedy-drama telescopes more than three generations of family life -- and family strife -- into a brisk 85 minutes. An excellent cast under the skilled direction of the busy Sam Gold doesn't quite disguise the play's emphasis on style over substance (1:25). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, playwrightshorizons.org. (Isherwood)
'Carrie' This exceedingly sober revival of a fabled flop musical from the 1980s, based on Stephen King's classic horrors-of-high-school novel, is as minimal and subdued as a little black choir robe, which means that it isn't much fun. Molly Ranson is a tad too sane as the vengeful Carrie, but Marin Mazzie is very good as her demented mother (2:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Brantley)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
- 'Edward Albee's The Lady From Dubuque' Edward Albee throws a mean party in this scintillating revival of a much-maligned play, in which death comes to call wearing pearls. David Esbjornson directs a crackerjack cast that includes Michael Hayden, Laila Robins and, in the title role, a serenely commanding Jane Alexander (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)
- 'Gatz' Elevator Repair Service's word-for-word presentation of ''The Great Gatsby'' chronicles one reader's seduction by a single, ravishing novel. The astonishing Scott Shepherd is the reader, a bored employee in a shabby office, and a first-rate ensemble embodies both his fellow workers and the characters he brings to life. John Collins directed this work of rare imagination and intelligence (6:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Growing Up Gonzales' This one-man play about a Nuyorican family in the 1970s is part stand-up, part melodrama and part cultural tourism. Andres Chulisi Rodriguez alternates between playing two brothers: Cisco, the sweet-natured, slow younger brother, who we learn at the outset has recently died; and Johnny, the thuggish older sibling, who has discovered Cisco's journals after his brother's death. The quiet Cisco, it turns out, was quite the storyteller and has colorfully recreated the tragedies and farces of their fatherless childhood, including ridiculous stories about shoplifting raw chickens and imitating Bruce Lee (1:30). Jan Hus Playhouse, 351 East 74th Street, (212) 811-4111, growingupgonzales.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Him' The merits of this bonbon (written and directed by the onetime glittering New York talent manager and social operator Clifford Streit) about a gay couple almost undone by the Hollywood closet are so abundant that it's painful when you realize the malicious disdain the play has for women (1:10). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com. (Andy Webster)
'Look Back in Anger' Sam Gold's stylized staging of John Osborne's 1956 drama about a working-class lad with the weight of a stifling social system on his shoulders wins points for ingenuity -- the stage is about three feet deep -- but in the crucial central role, Matthew Rhys (television's ''Brothers and Sisters'') never locates the genuine pain beneath the surface rage (2:10). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Lost in Yonkers' There are no flashy directorial or design touches in Jenn Thompson's warmly satisfying revival for TACT/The Actors Company Theater of the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning 1991 Neil Simon play, one of his most affecting works. Instead, the director and her very solid cast find just the right delicate balance of tenderness, melancholy and humor in this story of a 1940s New York family, whose damage is traced back to the emotional scars of its steely German-Jewish immigrant matriarch (2:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
- 'A Moon for the Misbegotten' This sure-footed revival does justice to Eugene O'Neill's final completed play, a heartsick valentine to his wastrel brother. Kim Martin-Cotten and the splendidly understated Andrew May wring nearly every sodden, soulful moment out of O'Neill's towering romance (3:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Eric Grode)
- 'No Place to Go' An immensely appealing cabaret of anxiety, from Ethan Lipton, who muses on job loss and financial uncertainty through song. Assisted by his fine three-piece band, Mr. Lipton wills himself into a mongrel show-biz alter-ego -- part lounge crooner, part folk balladeer -- to connect with his own worldly (and universal) woes (1:30). Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Now. Here. This.' The lovable gang from ''[title of show]'' is back with a similarly sweet and happily self-conscious new musical tracing their paths from youthful misfit-dom to the stage. Slighter and less original than their first collaboration, it's nevertheless performed with an audience-embracing brio by the talented cast under Michael Berresse's direction (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Painting Churches' Kathleen Chalfant and John Cunningham are ideal interpreters of the fading Boston blue bloods at the center of Tina Howe's 1983 family portrait, their patrician airs masking fear and fragility. But as the artist daughter who arrives from New York to paint their portrait and help the elderly couple pack up their lives for a move necessitated by failing health and diminished means, Kate Turnbull is outclassed. The same goes for the director Carl Forsman in a pedestrian revival that smudges the subtleties of Ms. Howe's delicate play (2:10). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'A (radically condensed and expanded) SUPPOSEDLY FUN THING I'LL NEVER DO AGAIN (after David Foster Wallace)' The endless title is apt: Daniel Fish's theatrical homage to the po-mo literary icon honors the writer's brilliant but hardly economical style. Probably strictly for Wallace worshipers (2:30). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Rated P for Parenthood' Half of the time, Sandy Rustin, Dan Lipton and David Rossmer's musical about the joys and trials of having children is touching and wistfully funny. The rest of the time, it offers nothing more than we're-all-alike platitudes, shakily conveyed (1:25). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Regrets' Matt Charman's drama, set at a Nevada motel where men park themselves for six weeks to escape their marriages, is set in 1954 and almost feels as if it was written then, so definitively antique is its dramaturgy. Brian Hutchison shines in an uneven cast under the direction of Carolyn Cantor (2:00). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rutherford & Son' The Mint Theater revives Githa Sowerby's grimly unsentimental 1912 drama about John Rutherford, the owner of a glassworks in northern England, and the misery he has wrought on his children's lives. Directed by Richard Corley, this production remains a static and slightly musty affair (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
- 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, but most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
Off Off Broadway
'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each tune -- and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Grode)
'Swell' Juliacks's floridly ornate graphic novel about a bereaved family (particularly a daughter, Emmeline), is an immersive experience for brave readers. This profoundly visual stage adaptation offers a similarly lush stream of consciousness, one so encompassing that it almost proves overwhelming. But Emma Galvin, as the main character, anchors it and leaves you grateful for having made her character's acquaintance (1:15). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111, womencenterstage.org. (Webster)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

Incubator Arts Project, inside St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, incubatorarts.org. (Zinoman)
'Baby Wants Candy' (closes on Saturday) A talent-rich cast accomplishes the feat of an improvised musical. Saturday at 10 p.m. only (1:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com.
'Court-Martial at Fort Devens' (closes on Sunday) An account of a little-remembered insurrection in the last months of World War II, when black WACs who had enlisted as medical-technician trainees were reassigned by a racist camp commander to serve as hospital orderlies and refused to comply; two of the women faced court-martial for insubordination in what was seen as a fight for racial equality. Using flashbacks to add context and develop characters, Jeffrey Sweet's intriguing historical play rises beyond stereotypes. As a drama, though, it still falls a bit short (1:30). Castillo Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-5800, castillo.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Deep Are the Roots' (closes on Sunday) About the homecoming of a black soldier to the South after World War II, this play by Arnaud d'Usseau and James Gow lacks the immediacy it must have had in 1945, when it was first staged. It's not a great play, but it's an interesting one, and the Metropolitan Playhouse production has a pulpy propulsion (2:40). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org. (Saltz)
'Eternal Equinox' (closes on Saturday) The Bloomsbury group giveth, and it taketh away: Joyce Hokin Sach's imagining of a fraught night among members of this early 20th-century British tribe is pleasing and at times engrossing. But it never meets the very high bar set by its historical source material (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Give Me Your Hand' (closes on Sunday) The idea of the staycation seems to have had its day. Still, those looking to get away without actually going anywhere might consider Paul Durcan's poetic tour of the National Gallery in London. It's not every day museumgoers get guides like Dermot Crowley and Dearbhla Molloy (1:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (La Rocco)
'Hand to God' (closes on Sunday) The Devil is a sock puppet in the return of this foul-mouthed, fun-packed play by Robert Askins about the urges that drive good men (and women, and boys) to dirty deeds. Exuberantly performed by a great cast, led by Steven Boyer as a troubled teenager at odds with his id (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'An Iliad' (closes on Sunday) Denis O'Hare and Stephen Spinella alternate in this solo adaptation of the Homer epic about the Trojan War. The text, by Mr. O'Hare and the show's director, Lisa Peterson, blends small selections from Robert Fagles's translation with larger expanses of vernacular language (1:40). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, nytw.org. (Isherwood)
'Lifeline' (closes on Sunday) Ken, a tortured soul and wannabe playwright, has rented out a basement apartment after separating from his wife. For some reason his chatty new landlord, Pete, welcomes the visibly unstable stranger with open arms. The minute Pete declares ''my gut tells me I can trust you,'' of course, we know he's in for it. Brian Wallace is spine-chillingly creepy as Ken, and Buzz Roddy adds texture to an otherwise incredulously credulous Pete. But even their skilled performances, aided by Jules Ochoa's painstaking direction, cannot overcome Frank Tangredi's capricious script (1:20). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-2055, abingdontheatre.org. (Rampell)
'The Maids' (closes on Sunday) Jeanine Serralles and Ana Reeder play the servants who plan a poisonous tea party for their mistress (J. Smith-Cameron) in Jesse Berger's somewhat burlesqued version of Jean Genet's play (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Isherwood)
' 'Tis Pity She's a Whore' (closes on Saturday) All roads lead to bed in this overheated, modern-dress interpretation of John Ford's notorious tragedy, from the inventive British troupe Cheek by Jowl. Declan Donnellan's production piles on the sexual and religious motifs so heavily that they smother individual characterization. As the doomed, incestuous young heroine, Lydia Wilson offers some lightning flashes of insight (1:55).

HEADLINE: Scenes of a Crime

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''Scenes of a Crime'' is a critical exploration of modern interrogation, specifically the Reid Technique, shown in a police training video, whose goal is to extract a confession using sophisticated psychological manipulation. Although the technique is far from the much rougher, old-fashioned method known as the third degree, which involved physical torture, its use still raises questions about what constitutes coercion. 
The documentary, produced and directed by Blue Hadaegh and Grover Babcock (''A Certain Kind of Death''), focuses on the case of Adrian Thomas, an unemployed father of seven whose 4-month-old son, Matthew, was pronounced brain dead at a hospital in Troy, N.Y., in September 2008. Because of injuries described by a doctor, the police suspected Mr. Thomas of killing his son. He initially proclaimed his innocence, but during a lengthy session with detectives, he demonstrated how he roughly threw the infant into a crib. At the end of the videotaped 10-hour interrogation, some of which is shown in the film, Mr. Thomas signed a confession.
After further medical examination, the same doctor found no evidence of a fatal skull fracture; the death instead was attributed to sepsis, a bacterial infection in the blood. Although Mr. Thomas recanted, he was tried for murder, and the videotape of his demonstration was shown to the jury, which convicted him. Currently serving 25 years to life, he just lost an appeal.
''Scenes of a Crime'' explores the case and the circumstances of Mr. Thomas's life. Prosecution and defense lawyers, jurors and medical experts are interviewed. And this smart, cool-headed film, which has a ''Rashomon''-like vision of the case, presents a disturbing picture of courtroom justice and how different people come to opposite conclusions, based on the same testimony.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Blue Hadaegh and Grover Babcock 1 hour 28 minutes; not rated
