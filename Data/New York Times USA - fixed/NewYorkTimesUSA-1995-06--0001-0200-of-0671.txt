HEADLINE: Stunning Surge On Wall Street: Dow Up 86.46

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market, after falling in recent sessions, vaulted yesterday to all-time highs, dumbfounding analysts as the Dow Jones industrial average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain in a year and its biggest point gain in more than three.
No single explanation seemed to suffice. The Government reported more data that reinforced Wall Street's view that the economy is slowing enough to contain inflation but without choking corporate profits. The dollar rose in value after the world's leading central banks took concerted action to buy it. And the market seemed to chase the usual rumors, including a breakthrough in trade talks with Japan that proved unfounded. 
 Whatever the case, the Dow rose 86.46 points, to a record 4,465.14. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.82 points, to 533.40, also a new high.
Even the Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have taken a beating in the last four sessions, came clawing back, though short of its record 879.64 last Tuesday. It rose 5.88 points yesterday, to 864.58.
It is normal for markets, after rising quickly, to drop or plateau and then recover. But yesterday's powerful rally defied convention. At 3:09 P.M., the surge set off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules that are intended to calm volatile markets. The Dow then roared ahead another 36 points.
The stock market has not seen such a one-day rise since Dec. 23, 1991, when the Dow surged 88.10 points, to 3,022.58, for an advance of 3 percent. Yesterday's climb was equal to a rise of 1.97 percent and brings the Dow to a day or two's trading away from the 4,500-point level.
To be sure, for much of the session stocks simply made up lost ground from Thursday's and Friday's declines. And until the last half-hour of trading, when the market's climb picked up even more speed, stock traders were simply buying back the very stocks whose prices they had battered the week before.
Suddenly cheaper shares of the Microsoft Corporation, for example, rose 111/16 , to 8411/16 , though still short of their 52-week high of 89 1/4 on Thursday. And the Intel Corporation's stock, the most active stock, , rose 1 3/4 a share, to 112 1/4, still shy of its top price of 117 1/2.
The Dow recovered from a tepid opening and picked up 30 points in the morning, as the dollar surged in response to a buying spree by American, Japanese and European central banks. But stocks leveled off by midday, leaving analysts groping for explanations for the sharp afternoon rally.
"I can only think the stock market has been lagging the bond market and it's just catching up," said Gail M. Dudack, chief investment strategist for S. G. Warburg & Company. Bond prices, which often influence stock performance, have risen faster than stock prices recently.
The Commerce Department also reported its first revision of first-quarter growth in gross domestic product yesterday. Wall Street economists had expected a rise to 3 percent or more from 2.8 percent, but were surprised by a downward revision to 2.7 percent.
The weaker-than-expected first quarter reinforced the "soft landing" outlook for the economy, but also prompted speculation of a stronger-than-expected second quarter, primarily because unsold goods, or inventory, had piled up in warehouses at a slower rate. The expectations of a weak second quarter depended on factories producing less because of bulging inventories.
The department also reported that new-home sales slipped 2.7 percent, to an annual rate of 580,000 sales, far less than expected.
But the housing sales and G.D.P. figures, which barely moved the bond market, seemed an unsatisfactory explanation for the rise in stocks, according to Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities. For one thing, he said, the figures do not seem to justify the cut in interest rates by the Fed expected to take place later this year.
"If anything, the economy is not strong enough for the Fed to tighten and not weak enough for the Fed to ease," Mr. Fine said.
Meanwhile, the dollar's surge yesterday was not by itself large enough to encourage numerous foreign investors to buy American stocks. The Dow, for example, has risen 16.45 percent so far this year in dollars, but only 6.46 percent in German marks, and has fallen nearly 1 percent in Japanese yen.
Some analysts cited rumors that a leading brokerage house was about to recommend a change in its "asset allocation," raising its recommended share of stocks. But no brokerage house appeared to make such a declaration by the end of the session.
Other analysts pointed to rumors of a significant breakthrough in the stalemated trade talks with Japan concerning the sale of American auto parts. But as of yesterday, the Clinton Administration had agreed only to reschedule the resumption of talks to mid-June from late June.
Jan Terbrueggen, a bond portfolio manager for Flagship Financial, which manages $4.5 billion in bonds, said there would be more than enough mine fields in the days ahead to send financial markets heading downward. Gold, for example, is hovering at about $385 an ounce rather than declining, a sure sign that traders expect to see inflation sometime this year, Mr. Terbrueggen said.
Also, the Government's April leading economic indicators are due tomorrow. Three declining index numbers in a row are "90 percent correlated with a recession," Mr. Terbrueggen said. "I, for one, am going to watch that number."
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.57 points, to 286.44, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners, 1,585 to 708. Big Board volume totaled 366.2 million shares. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.77 point, to 492.10.
Among advancing stocks was that of the Ride Snowboard Company, a snowboard maker in Redmond, Wash. Its shares rose 4 1/4, to 24 7/8, after an analyst appearing on Dan Dorfman's program on CNBC made a bullish forecast. The Altera Corporation, a maker of integrated circuits, rose 3 1/2 a share, to 77 7/8.
Among declining stocks was that of the Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, a drug manufacturer. Its shares fell 4 1/8, to 19 3/8, after its management said the company expected its 1995 earnings to fall short of analysts' expectations. The American depository receipts of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese electronics conglomerate, fell 4, to 157.

HEADLINE: First Members Are Named to Washington Financial Control Board

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
President Clinton today named a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board to head a new financial control board that will have final authority over every aspect of the District of Columbia's finances until the city's fiscal crisis ends.
In Andrew F. Brimmer, Mr. Clinton appointed a specialist in monetary policy, with a deep interest in urban finance, to reverse trends that have led the city to a budget deficit of more than $700 million. Mr. Brimmer, 68, an economist, served on the Federal Reserve Board from 1966 to 1974. 
 Mr. Clinton also appointed two other people to three-year terms on the five-member panel whose members are not paid -- Joyce A. Ladner, interim president of Howard University, and Constance B. Newman, undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The President is expected to name the other members after background checks are completed.
Under the law establishing the board, it is required to balance the city's budget in four years and to continue to monitor that the budget is balanced for four more years, after which it would be disbanded.
" "We were fortunate to have such a wealth of talented, committed individuals who sought to do this vital job," Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House. Mr. Clinton predicted that the board would help "insure a stable economic future for the District." City officials have said that without a loan from the Federal Treasury, the District, which has a low bond rating on Wall Street, will be bankrupt in a month.
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said he looked forward to working with Mr. Brimmer and hoped that the board would help the city obtain more money from the Federal Government or new taxes.
It is widely believed by Federal lawmakers involved in creating the board, as well as by local officials, that part of Mr. Barry's enthusiasm for the board is that it will provide him with political cover for tough decisions, perhaps including dramatically reducing the number of city employees.
Mr. Brimmer, who returned to Washington today from a business trip, issued a statement through his office saying he was "pleased with the President's expression of confidence in me." He was not available for further comment.
As the most powerful board ever created to rescue a city in trouble, the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority becomes, in effect, more powerful than all the city's elected officials. It also ends expectations, for now, of expanding the limited home rule that Congress granted the city in 1974 and, beyond that, of statehood.
But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a strong advocate of statehood, said the board might actually be a "silver lining in the the cloud of Congressional occupation" and enhance prospects for statehood by helping the city overcome longstanding financial problems.
Created by act of Congress, the board has final authority over city budgets, contracts and loans, with its ultimate power the right to veto any measure that has a fiscal effect. It also has the power to enact its own alternatives to specific spending plans and make recommendations on contracts.
Federal lawmakers said that no previous control board, including the one that rescued New York in the 1970's, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, had had such power. That is, in part, because the Washington board also has the responsibility to seek long-term solutions to such problems as the financing of Medicaid and the operation of jails, for which other cities in financial trouble have had state financing and other aid.
The city's financial plight has coincided with what many residents have regarded as a decline in the quality of life in Washington in recent years, attributed to lax and inefficient municipal government, a huge demand for social services and limited sources of revenue.
In the last few weeks alone, the city's foster care system was placed under court supervision, crime rates have risen as the police budget has been pared, trash recycling has ended because of cutbacks in the public works budget and Federal authorities have subpoenaed Mr. Barry's personal financial records as part of an investigation into his relationship with a contractor who did renovations at his house. The same authorities are investigating accusations that Mr. Barry's wife diverted $2,000 in campaign funds last year to her brother.
Beyond those problems, the capital has suffered a steady exodus of businesses and middle-class residents to suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, shrinking the city's tax base. That, in turn, has reduced the annual Federal payment to the city, a subsidy intended to compensate for the exemptions of foreign embassies, nonprofit organizations and the Federal Government from property taxes.
Mr. Brimmer, a native of Newellton, La., who has lived in Washington for nearly 20 years, emerged as the Administration's choice as chairman of the control board after a career as an economist, an economics teacher and, since 1976, the president of Brimmer and Company, a Washington-based economic and financial consulting firm.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's representative in Congress, referring to the first chairman of New York's control board, said "I think Andrew Brimmer will become Washington's Felix Rohatyn.".
But just how effectively Mr. Brimmer and his colleagues solve city problems will depend largely on the cooperation of Mr. Barry and the City Council, which also supports the board's creation.
Mr. Barry said today that because spending reductions would not be sufficient, the control board must study "the revenue side" of the city's problems. "We can't cut our way out of this," the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
US. LEADS NATIONS IN SURPRISE BUYING TO PROP UP DOLLAR

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and a dozen foreign countries took the currency markets by surprise today, buying billions of dollars in an intervention that appeared to have stopped yet another slump in the dollar.
After several days of sliding slowly down toward its record lows of mid-April, the dollar bounced back sharply today against the Japanese yen and the German mark. But when trading ended, the dollar had not quite reached the levels that traders said would signal a new stability. 
 Still, the dollar's recovery contributed to a sharp rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its biggest percentage gain in a year, surging 86.46 points, or nearly 2 percent, to a record high of 4,465.14. [Page D1.]
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued a statement this morning that described the currency market intervention as consistent with a commitment in April by the United States and six other leading industrial nations to bring about an orderly reversal of the dollar's fall this year.
"We acted in the exchange markets this morning consistent with the exchange rate objectives expressed in the April 25 G-7 Communique," he said, referring to the Group of Seven nations. "We are prepared to continue to cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate."
American officials said privately that the Administration also wanted to make clear that it would not use a weak dollar as a weapon in the negotiations with Japan in the contentious trade dispute over American automobiles and auto parts. They also indicated that the White House was leaning toward moving up the date of the next round of talks.
Previous trans-Pacific trade disputes have produced sharp drops in the dollar that have made Japanese goods more expensive and less salable in the United States.
But the fall in the dollar has result
ed this year in a steady rise in the prices of imported goods. The resulting threat of possible inflation has made it somewhat harder for the Federal Reserve to consider a reduction in interest rates, even though the American economy appears to be slowing.
Administration officials have also been watching with concern the growing number of indications that the economy may be weak during the 1996 election campaign. Propping up the dollar in currency markets, if successful, allows the Administration to continue confronting Japan while also leaving the Federal Reserve with the option of lowering interest rates at some point.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, predicted in an interview this afternoon that the economy was continuing to slow from the torrid growth of late 1994, but would not slip into a recession. "We're going to see continued moderation in the pace of growth, but we're going to have growth," he said.
Mr. Lindsey also acknowledged some concerns about the effect of rising import prices on inflation, but emphasized that imports accounted for only a fraction of the goods and services sold in the United States. "I think it is a matter of concern but I think the numerical effects are relatively small," he said.
Currency traders said that if the Administration had not acted to support the dollar, it would have continued its recent decline. "You can characterize today as a pre-emptive strike before the dollar could test its lows again -- that was the direction that market sentiment had been building," said Stephen Flanagan, a currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
The dollar settled in New York late this afternoon at 84.54 yen, up 1.68 yen from Tuesday, after trading as high as 85.28 yen around 9 A.M. after the Federal Reserve and Japanese and European central banks entered the currency markets. It also jumped to 1.4157 marks today from 1.3905 marks. [The dollar showed little change in Asian trading by mid-afternoon on Thursday.]
Because the dollar did not end trading in New York above 85 yen and 1.42 marks, two key psychological levels, traders said the dollar might still be vulnerable to further attacks by speculators.
Still, traders cited several reasons why the Administration succeeded in pushing up the dollar today after previous interventions in currency markets this year had failed.
David F. DeRosa, the director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said traders were reluctant to bet against the success of Government purchases of dollars because many traders' profits and losses were calculated today, the last day of the month. That makes traders eager to protect the profits they have already made or minimize the losses they have already suffered.
Kevin J. Lawrie, a foreign exchange manager at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said traders were also content to let the dollar rise because they feared that today's currency market intervention might be part of a coordinated international strategy that could include a cut in German interest rates when the top council of the German Bundesbank meets on Thursday. Lower German interest rates would make it less attractive for international investors to put money there and more attractive for them to buy dollars and invest here.
For every dollar won in foreign exchange trading, somebody else loses a dollar, and traders said that losses today were probably heavy. The heaviest damage probably was in Asia, where markets were closed when the intervention took place and some traders might not have been able to undo their bets against the dollar, said Neal M. Soss, a hedge fund manager in Manhattan.
European money managers may also have had trouble selling other currencies and buying dollars within seconds so as to avoid losses. "It happened today at a time when many Europeans were probably thinking more about lunch than about their positions," Mr. Soss said.
The decision to intervene in currency markets is made by the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Rubin. But the Federal Reserve actually buys the dollars in exchange for yen and marks from its own reserves and from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund.
Mr. Rubin used to direct currency trading at Goldman, Sachs and has a reputation as a savvy market strategist. But until now, his record in directing currency interventions had been mixed.
Traders had more respect for Mr. Rubin today. "A lot of people have criticized Rubin and his predecessors for not carrying out skillful interventions -- this time they did a pretty good job," Mr. DeRosa of the Swiss Bank Corporation said.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Andrew Felton Brimmer;
New Washington Leader

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
Andrew F. Brimmer was brought in today to help shore up the sagging fortunes of the District of Columbia more than a decade after predicting the city was in for "steady erosion" of its financial base.
As the head of a five-member financial control board, Mr. Brimmer, a 68-year-old former Federal Reserve Board governor, is expected to hand out tough medicine to a city that has been mired in financial crisis for more than a year. It is a prescription that will appeal to the city's critics on Capitol Hill. 
 Earlier this year Congress -- dismayed by the weak reaction of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. to the financial crisis -- gave control of the city's financial concerns to a board.
The board, similar to those established in New York and Philadelphia when they were struggling financially, has broad power to recommend and even put into effect its own budget plans for the city if local officials fail to move toward a balanced budget in the next several years. The board will also review major city labor contracts and all legislation emerging from the District of Columbia City Council.
"I think he's an excellent choice," Terry Lynch, director of the Downtown Coalition of Churches said of Mr. Brimmer's three-year appointment to the unpaid post. "Right now we've basically got a city government that has collapsed. We need someone with his kind of management and fiscal expertise and at the same time proven civic and civil rights concerns."
Mr. Brimmer, the first black to serve as a governor at the Federal Reserve Board, emerged as the top choice from a short list of candidates under consideration by the White House, Administration officials said, because he combined strong fiscal and management skills with a commitment to civil rights. He has headed his own financial consulting firm, Brimmer and Company, in Washington for almost 20 years
Mr. Brimmer was appointed to a full 14-year term at the Federal Reserve by President Lyndon B. Johnson in March 1966 but he resigned in August 1974 to pursue other ventures.
"I am pleased with the President's expression of confidence in me," Mr. Brimmer said in a statement from his office today. "I will meet promptly with the other appointees to the authority to organize the work of the board."
For starters, Mr. Brimmer is likely to propose such solutions as a commuter tax and the restructuring of Federal assistance to help the city with its long-range financial planning -- moves that are likely to meet some resistance in Congress if they call for it to take more responsibility.
"This will be the toughest fiscal control board job in the country," said Bernard Anderson, an assistant secretary at the Labor Department who was chairman of the fiscal oversight board in Philadelphia in the early 1990's. "Tougher than Philadelphia, much tougher than New York. But Andrew Brimmer does not suffer fools gladly," said Mr. Bernard, who was Mr. Brimmer's graduate assistant when he taught at the University of Michigan. "He will decide what needs to be done and he has the kind of strength and courage to get it done."
During his time at the Federal Reserve "he was always very outspoken, thoughtful, and well-prepared," said J. Dewey Daane, a former Federal Reserve governor who served eight years with Mr. Brimmer and is now a professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University. "I expect him to be all those things in this job."
A tough but gentlemanly taskmaster, Mr. Brimmer is known as a workaholic, who rarely takes vacations, but savors long weekends of deep sea fishing off the coast of Vancouver.
Andrew Felton Brimmer was born Sept., 13, 1926, in Newellton, La., where his father, Andrew Sr., was a sharecropper and warehouse worker. After graduating from high school in 1944, he left the South for Washington State. He served in the Army in the Pacific during World War II until his discharge in 1946 in Hawaii.
Like many veterans, he took advantage of Federal grants to attend the University of Washington. He switched majors from journalism to economics, convinced that it offered him the best way to understand America. He received his undergraduate degree in 1950, a master's degree in 1951 and doctorate in economics from Harvard University in 1957.
Mr. Brimmer is married to the former Doris Millicent Scott. The couple have one daughter, Esther Diane. Besides fishing, Mr. Brimmer enjoys reading world history and business travel.
At Mr. Brimmer's offices today, his appointment was met with delight. Garth Trinkl, an economist who has been Mr. Brimmer's executive assistant for 12 years, said his boss expected "a lot of work and some contention but looked forward to the challenge."

HEADLINE: H. Don Reynolds, 83, Specialist in Aviation Law

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
H. Don Reynolds, whose career in commercial aviation spanned the days of propeller planes to those of supersonic airliners, died on Monday at his home in Phoenix. He was 83.
The cause was cancer, a spokesman for the family said. 
 A specialist in aviation and transportation law, Mr. Reynolds was house counsel for Pan American World Airways in the early 1950's and assistant director of the International Air Transport Association from 1961 until 1972. At the association, based in Montreal, he often found himself mediating differences over contentious issues like fares and deregulation.
He was the first director of the United States Tour Operators Association from 1976 to 1979, when he became the association's counsel on legal and government affairs. He was with the tour operators group, whose members package domestic and international tours for bus companies, travel agencies and airlines, until 1991.
Howard Donald Reynolds was born in Greeley, Colo. He graduated from Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, in 1932 and from the Law School of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., in 1936. In 1942, he joined the Civil Aeronautics Board as chief of economic regulation, and after service in the Navy he returned to the C.A.B., where he headed its first office of enforcement and litigation.
After his brief tenure as house counsel for PanAm, he continued to provide legal representation for the carrier, as well as for Butler Aviation and American Express. At other points in his career he worked for Northwest Orient Airlines and American Airlines.
Mr. Reynolds is survived by his wife, Imogene, who lives in Phoenix and in Scarsdale, N.Y., where he also lived part of the year; a daughter, Donogene Mealie of Kansas City, Mo.; a sister, Jane Ellen Morgan of Placerville, Calif., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE DIPLOMACY;
U.S. Says It Plans to Propose New Concessions to Serbia

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has decided to offer new concessions to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and plans to propose indefinitely suspending most of the trade and financial sanctions against Yugoslavia, Administration officials said today.
According to the officials, Mr. Milosevic will be asked to grant diplomatic recognition to Bosnia and Herzegovina and denounce the taking of United Nations hostages by Bosnian Serb forces. The hope is that Mr. Milosevic will exert his considerable power as President of Serbia to press for a settlement of the Balkan conflict, which has continued for nearly four years. 
 Robert Frasure, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, met in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic today, and Administration officials said he was instructed to sweeten a previous offer for relaxing the sanctions.
In exchange for Mr. Milosevic's steps towards bringing peace to the Balkans, Mr. Frasure was prepared to make it harder for Western nations to reinstitute the sanctions once they were suspended, a key concern of Mr. Milosevic's.
The economic sanctions, imposed by the United Nations three years ago, have been widely breached by smugglers and neighboring nations. But they have substantially harmed the Yugoslav economy, and are the main remaining leverage the West has in the region.
Last year, as part of a diplomatic bargain with Mr. Milosevic, the United Nations -- but not the United States -- suspended some of the restrictions, allowing resumption of international flights to Belgrade. Yugoslavia was also allowed to participate again in international sporting and cultural events.
In exchange, Serbia agreed to cut off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs, a step which if fully effective would have hobbled their war effort. The hope was that as Mr. Milosevic distanced himself from the Serbs in Bosnia, the remaining sanctions, including an oil embargo, could be suspended one by one.
American officials say the cordon between Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs has been leaky at best. Nonetheless, earlier this month, Mr. Frasure traveled to Belgrade with a proposal for the next round of suspending sanctions. The Serbs rebuffed the offer, insisting that the sanctions be immediately and completely lifted.
After a NATO bombing raid prompted the Bosnian Serbs to take hostages, American officials reconsidered their stance towards Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Frasure was dispatched with new orders.
Under the previous American negotiating stance, sanctions were suspended, but held in abeyance, and could have been reimposed if any member of the United Nations Security Council, including the United States, raised questions about Serbia's compliance with the terms of the deal. This gave Washington a means of unilaterally triggering the resumption of sanctions if Mr. Milosevic reneged.
The proposal to be delivered in Belgrade by Mr. Frasure, officials said, gives the United Nations Secretary General sole responsibility for judging whether Yugoslavia has carried out its side of the bargain. American and Western officials said this approach was worked out between the Administration and the other four countries that make up the so-called contact group: Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
In previous negotiating sessions, the officials said, Serbia has been pressing American negotiators for relief from the embargo on importing oil, an important aspect of the sanctions. The Serbs wanted permission to import hundreds of thousands of tons of oil a month, the officials said, an amount that would quickly have allowed Belgrade to amass a huge stockpile as insurance against any future embargo.
While the Clinton Administration was cool to that proposal, officials said the approach that Mr. Frasure was to convey would allow Serbia to satisfy most of its domestic needs.
The officials said Serbia would be allowed to resume trade with its neighbors, but would not be allowed to import goods that could be used for military purposes.
American officials said Yugoslavia would still be banned, for the moment, from applying for help from international financial institutions like the World Bank. In addition, the Yugoslav assets that were frozen in Western banks around the world would not be released until the nations that emerged from the wreckage of Yugoslavia could agree on how the money should be parceled out.

Optimism in Belgrade
 By The New York Times
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 31 -- The Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia expressed optimism today as talks with Mr. Frasure began.
"The talks are serious and productive, and I expect that everything will go well," the Foreign Minister, Vladislav Jovanovic, said in a televised interview. "By everything, I mean that our expectations, our requests will be met by the other side."
Mr. Jovanovic's comments were the first official indication that the talks were making progress.

HEADLINE: Lab's Fate Is in Air Force Numbers;
New York Officials Say Pentagon Tailors Its Data to Politics

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last October, anticipating a new round of military base closings, Air Force analysts used a computer to estimate how much the Defense Department would save if it closed its high-tech military laboratory in Rome, N.Y., and merged it with a lab elsewhere.
Their October cost-benefit analysis found that moving the lab would be so expensive -- $133.8 million -- that it would far outweigh the $1.5 million in annual savings from closing it. Indeed, the computer determined it would take more than 100 years to recoup the price of the move. So the Air Force ranked the Rome laboratory among the last installations it would consider closing. 
 But four months later, as politicians across the country lobbied feverishly to save their local bases, the Air Force issued a whole new cost-benefit analysis. It said the relocation would cost less than half as much -- $52.8 million -- with big annual savings of $11.5 million.
Suddenly the cost of closing Rome Lab could be recouped in just four years. Suddenly the Air Force had the numbers to justify shutting Rome. On Feb. 28, a week after the second computer run, the Pentagon made public the list of 119 installations it hoped to close or consolidate this year, including, for the first time, Rome Lab, which develops sophisticated electronic equipment for commanders to use to communicate with their forces.
The search for the true numbers provides a window on the jockeying that goes on as the military labors to substantiate its decisions. It is a process even Government Accounting Office auditors have characterized as elusive.
To some, the Rome Lab case suggests that the base closing system is hardly the open and apolitical process it was intended to be.
Supporters of the lab -- including Raymond Meier, the County Executive of Oneida County, where it lies, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- say they are sure the Air Force altered the numbers between October and February to support a behind-the-scenes political decision to shut Rome.
"They're cooking the books," Mr. D'Amato said. "The decision to move the lab was made. And then they had to invent the numbers to justify the decision."
Indeed, the discrepancy between the October and February numbers was so striking that the special Presidential commission on base closings asked the Air Force in April to do a third calculation. On May 23, the computer produced an estimate radically different from the first two.
 
Small Changes Make A Big Difference
 The Rome case illustrates how subtle changes in estimating basic costs like maintenance, moving or construction can strikingly alter an installation's fate. For example, in October the Air Force estimated the one-time costs to move and reinstall Rome's equipment at $16.8 million. But in February, the Air Force cut this estimate to $7.6 million, making it cheaper to close Rome.
Air Force officials, defending their analyses, say the estimates changed with circumstances. The October numbers were based on the premise that Rome would be merged into one other Air Force base, Hanscom, near Boston. The February estimate is based on splitting Rome between two sites, Hanscom and the Army base in Fort Monmouth, N.J., resulting in far less new construction, Air Force officials say.
"The data used in the Air Force analysis is publicly available, and has been certified and reviewed within the Air Force," said Maj. Gen. Jay D. Blume Jr., special assistant to the chief of staff for base realignment and closure. General Blume said he expected the commission on base closings "to closely scrutinize our data and we are confident the commission will find the recommendation is well supported."
But the May 23 computer run, which followed recent visits by Air Force analysts to Rome, Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, seems to raise more questions than it answers.
For example, the estimated relocation cost went from $133.8 million in October down to $52.8 million in April, and then back up to $79.2 million in the third analysis.
An analyst in the Air Force, who insisted on anonymity, defended the third computer run, calling it "the best possible estimate of what it will really take to do this action." He said it indicated that closing Rome was feasible and that the costs could be recouped in six years.
Senator D'Amato is no more convinced by these numbers, however, than by the previous set from the Air Force. "They are not big enough to admit they were wrong," he said.
Even as savvy a political operator as Mr. D'Amato has only theories on what political strings may have been pulled. He says it may have been California interests, trying to save a large Air Force depot at McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, or Massachusetts interests protecting Hanscom Air Force Base.
After Senator D'Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki railed against the Air Force's numbers at a May 5 hearing, the commission's chairman, former Senator Alan J. Dixon of Illinois, said: "I think we're interested in looking at Rome more carefully." The independent commission is to begin voting in late June on the Pentagon's recommendations.
 
Explanations Draw Criticism
 Senior Air Force officials say that the wide variation between the October and February analyses of Rome, which employs about 1,000 civilians, has a simple explanation. Moving the whole lab to Hanscom, they said, would have required $95 million in new construction. But splitting Rome between two bases would take advantage of existing empty space.
In explaining the specific changes -- like the change in equipment-moving costs from $16.8 million in October to $7.6 million in February to $10.4 million in May -- Air Force officials have hardly been definitive. When first asked by a reporter why the moving costs fell between October and February, a senior Air Force official said that some equipment would be left behind at Rome.
As to why the moving estimates then jumped from $7.6 million in February to $10.4 million in May, the Air Force analyst said the May estimate included buying new equipment to replace what had been left behind.
Such explanations have not satisfied two retired military budget officers, Paul Freund and Bill Harvey, both veterans of previous rounds of closings, who were hired by community officials in Rome to check the Air Force numbers.
For weeks, Mr. Freund has been arguing that the February moving figure, $7.6 million, was too low. He produced an internal Air Force memorandum, dated Dec. 29, 1994, which says that moving just four pieces of heavy equipment from Rome would cost nearly $7 million alone. What about the thousands of other items that must be moved, Mr. Freund asked.
On seeing the Air Force's third moving estimate, $10.4 million, in the May 23 analysis, he said: "At least they're going up. That's a step in the right direction."
The case of Rome Lab is not unique. Since 1988, when the Pentagon first proposed post-cold war base closings, communities have complained loudly that the costs of shutting their bases were underestimated and the savings inflated. In past rounds, the odds that a locality would persuade the commission to reverse the Defense Department were slim, about 1 in 10.
That has not deterred economic development officials in the Rome region. Already stung by the closing of Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome in 1993, a team led by the Oneida County Executive, Mr. Meier, has spent $500,000 to plead its cause. They say the lab has more than $100 million in annual contracts with upstate companies and universities.
The local officials hired a public relations firm. They also hired Mr. Freund, a retired lieutenant colonel who oversaw the Air Force's base-closing budget process in 1993, and Mr. Harvey, a retired colonel who had a similar role in the Army. The two consultants, who have named their Virginia firm the Survivors Group, have been retained by a half-dozen communities facing closings.
Among their questions about Rome is "real property maintenance," an annual budget line that includes replacing broken toilets, repainting offices and other odd repairs. In October, the Air Force estimated it would save $3.2 million in maintenance by moving Rome to Hanscom. But in February and again in May, the Air Force increased the maintenance savings, to $8.1 million.
 
Shifting Estimates Of Needed Space
 Air Force analysts said more would be saved by moving the lab into existing space at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, where maintenance is already provided. But the consultants say that if the space is empty now at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, the maintenance costs will increase when it is occupied.
Equally troubling, they said, was the Air Force's assumption about the space needed to relocate the 500,000-square-foot laboratory. In October, the Air Force said it would need 328,000 square feet to move the entire Rome Lab to Hanscom; in February, the combined space it requested at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth fell to 223,000 square feet.
The less space needed at a new site, of course, the stronger the argument for closing Rome.
After the February numbers became public, the consultants said they were skeptical about whether the lab could be squeezed so small. In the May 23 analysis, the Air Force seemed to agree, saying the laboratory would now require 365,000 square feet at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth.
It is difficult to determine if politics played a role in all this. In a report in April, the General Accounting Office chastised the Air Force for providing insufficient documentation "to substantiate the extent of deliberations and analyses leading to decisions to close" bases.
There is no shortage of theories about Rome. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, an Oneida County Republican, says he believes that Rome did not have an "angel" in the Pentagon's inner circle. Senator D'Amato suspects early Presidential politics and theorizes that Rome was selected for closing to save the depot at McClellan, which employs 10,000 civilians, because of California's electoral votes.
The Senator and Representative both said they suspected that Hanscom, in Bedford, Mass., was designated to inherit about 60 percent of the Rome laboratory because the base has a strong relationship with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the three decades before she became the Air Force Secretary in 1993, Sheila E. Widnall was a professor of aeronautics at M.I.T., which would benefit if the lab moved nearby.
Rudy de Leon, the Air Force undersecretary, said suggestions of favoritism were ludicrous. "The Secretary is a person of absolute integrity," he said.
Air Force officials say they supported Rome until November, when a Defense Department committee first suggested moving part of the lab to the Fort Monmouth Army base so the Army and Air Force could combine similar functions.
Still, Representative Boehlert said he believed the commission would vote Rome's way next month. "The numbers are with us," he said.

Chart: "ADDING IT UP: Closing an Air Force Lab"
 Before it can recommend closing an installation, the Air Force, like the other services, must estimate the potential costs and savings. It does so using a computer model nicknamed Cobra, or Cost of Base Realignment Actions. Chart shows selected results from three Cobra analyses on Rome Laboratory, a high-tech Air Force research installation in Rome, N.Y. The Air Force believes the final analysis to be most accurate.

Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech today at the United States Air Force Academy, as provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
Our security objectives over the last 50 years have been dictated by straightforward events, often beyond our control, but at least they were straightforward and clear. In World War II, the objective was simple: win the war. In the cold war, the objective was clear: contain communism and prevent nuclear war. In the post-cold-war world, the objectives are often more complex, and it is clear that American security in the 21st century will be determined by forces that are operating both beyond and within our own borders. . . . 
 Clearly there are powerful historical forces pulling us together: a worldwide thirst for freedom and democracy, a growing commitment to market economics, a technological revolution that moves information, ideas, money and people around the globe at record speed.
All these things are bringing us together and helping to make our future more secure. But these same forces have a dark underside which can also lead to more insecurity. We understand now that the openness and freedom of society make us even more vulnerable to the organized forces of destruction, the forces of terror and organized crime and drug trafficking.
The technological revolution that is bringing our world closer together can also bring more and more problems to our shores. The end of Communism has opened the door to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and lifted the lid on age-old conflicts rooted in ethnic, racial and religious hatreds. These forces can be all the more destructive today because they have access to modern technology.
Nowhere are the forces of disintegration more obvious today than in Bosnia. For the past two and a half years, the United States has sought to contain and end the conflict, to help to preserve the Bosnian nation as a multistate entity, multiethnic entity, to keep faith with our NATO allies and to relieve human suffering. To these ends, we have led the NATO military responses to calls by the United Nations for assistance in the protection of its forces and safe areas for the people of Bosnia; led efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement; deployed peacekeeping troops to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to contain the conflict within the present borders of Bosnia; and conducted the longest humanitarian airlift to the people there in history.
Two weeks ago the Bosnian Serbs unleashed 1,400 shells on the civilians of Sarajevo. The United Nations called this attack a return to medieval barbarism. They asked for a NATO air response, which we supported. Now we have joined our allies to develop a coordinated response to the Serbs' continued refusal to make peace and their illegal capturing of United Nations personnel as hostages. We believe still that a strengthened United Nations operation is the best insurance against an even worse humanitarian disaster, should they leave.
We have a longstanding commitment to help our NATO allies, some of whom have troops in the U.N. operation in Bosnia, to take part in a NATO operation to assist them in a withdrawal if that should ever become necessary. And so, if necessary, and after consultation with Congress, I believe we should be prepared to assist NATO if it decides to meet a request from the United Nations troops for help in a withdrawal or a reconfiguration and a strengthening of its forces. We have received no such request for any such assistance, and we have made no such decision.
But in any event, we must know that we must continue to work for peace there. And I still believe that we have made the right decision in not committing our own troops to become embroiled in this conflict in Europe, nor to join the United Nations operations. So I want to say to you we have obligations to our NATO allies, and I do not believe we can leave them in the lurch. So I must carefully review any request for an operation involving a temporary use of our ground forces. But we have made the right decision in what we have done and what we have not done in Bosnia.
I believe we must look at all of these problems and all these opportunities in new and different ways. For example, we see today that the clear boundaries between threats to our nation's security from beyond our borders and the challenges to our security from within our borders are being blurred. One once was clearly the province of the armed services, the other clearly the province of local law enforcement. Today we see people from overseas coming to our country for terrorist purposes, blurring what is our national security. We must see the threats for what they are and fashion our response based on their true nature, not just where they occur.

HEADLINE: Citing Rising Costs, Port Authority Kills Airport Rail Plan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has decided not to build a 22-mile railway from Manhattan to Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports in Queens because of rising costs, dealing a major setback to a decades-old search for an affordable and convenient way to transport travelers between the airports and the city's center.
The rail line would have been the largest new public-works venture in the region in years, an undertaking that recalled the mammoth projects of earlier eras: the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the subways, the Hudson River tunnels. But its demise reflects the pressures of today, when public spending is a political concern and a new generation of Republicans wants to shrink government and rein in its aspirations. 
 "The full 22-mile plan is dead," George J. Marlin, the authority's new executive director, said in an interview yesterday. "It cannot be. We don't have the resources for it."
Seeking to salvage something from their years of work, planners are now examining whether it might be feasible to construct only one small part of the railway. Such a segment, for example, might move people between a terminal at East 59th Street in Manhattan and La Guardia, but nowhere else.
But without the full railway, most travelers will be left with the much-bemoaned options they have had for years, most of them expensive, time-consuming or both -- taxis, buses or driving and parking at the airport for fees that can run $18 a day.
Mr. Marlin said the estimates for the plan had soared in recent months. When it was originally conceived in 1991, as a pet project ofGov. Mario M. Cuomo, a smaller version of the proposal was expected to cost $1.6 billion. The latest figure for completing the entire 22-mile railway is $4 billion to $5 billion, officials said, with some in the agency maintaining that it is even higher.
Port Authority officials first disclosed misgivings about building the entire 22-mile railway in January, but they did not appear ready at that time to drop it altogether.
The move to abandon the proposal throws the Port Authority's plans for improving the routes to Kennedy and La Guardia into uncertainty, raising the prospect that the two might continue to lose business to other airports. It has also angered officials in Queens, who accuse the authority of giving up too soon.
Before the proposal was scuttled, the agency was to have built a railway from the station at East 59th Street and Lexington Avenue over the Queensboro Bridge to La Guardia and then south to Kennedy before returning to Manhattan, making other stops along the way at places like Shea Stadium. The fare would probably have ranged from $9 to $13.
But the plan drew strong criticism from some transportation experts, largely because it was financed by a $3 surcharge on airline tickets that sharply limits its scope. Under Federal law, that money cannot be used for general transportation purposes, meaning that the railway could not be connected directly to subways or commuter rail lines.
The transportation experts said it made no sense to allocate so much for a railway that was isolated from other transportation systems. The project also stirred a backlash on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, with some residents complaining that the terminal at 59th Street would increase traffic congestion.
By the end of this year the fund generated by the ticket surcharge is expected to reach about $280 million. Any money not used for the railway would probably be spent on renovations of the two airports. Either way, the Port Authority hopes to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to continue collecting the surcharge.
Mr. Marlin, who was brought in by Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, with a mandate to turn over some of the authority's operations to private industry, said he feared that the project could ensnare the Port Authority in a financial fiasco, like those he had watched unfold in his last job as a municipal bond expert, including the long-delayed construction of Denver's new airport.
He said the authority would be able to raise $1 billion from the ticket surcharge, leaving it several billion dollars short unless it borrowed to make up the difference. In recent months, some officials in the agency have also suggested that it try to find a private company as a partner, but that apparently is not considered possible.
The Port Authority has never broken ground on the railway project, but it has spent millions of dollars on engineering, environmental and other studies. The authority's board has not yet formally canceled the full plan, but its commissioners have been talking in recent weeks about alternatives and are expected to take them up this summer.
The project had been pushed by Mr. Cuomo, who is from Queens, but Mr. Pataki, has expressed doubts about it since the campaign.
"The Governor's views are like mine," said Charles A. Gargano, a Port Authority commissioner and Mr. Pataki's economic adviser. "During this time of budget problems, before we go forward with a project of this magnitude, we have to see whether it can sustain itself later, or else the public is going to have to subsidize it forever."
Another commissioner and Pataki adviser, Peter S. Kalikow, said he hoped that the authority would still be able to handle the one segment of the railway from Manhattan to La Guardia. But first, he said, it was important that costs be laid out more clearly.
"I can't vote for something if they say $2 billion, $3 billion, $7 billion," he said. "These are the numbers that they are throwing around."
One of the project's biggest boosters, the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, a Democrat, said that Port Authority officials were inflating the figures to gain support for abandoning it.

HEADLINE: Richer for Failing

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
When the head of National Medical Care announced a takeover attempt for that company last month, analysts were quick to praise the offer. This was not, they insisted, another Kirk Kerkorian bid.
That day should have convinced everyone that the naysayers were right: Mr. Kerkorian's $22.8 billion takeover bid for the Chrysler Corporation was dead in the water. Since he announced his offer on April 12, Mr. Kerkorian had been transformed in the eyes of Wall Street from a credible suitor to the personification of an empty bidder. 
 Are there lessons to be learned from this apparent stumble? Or did Mr. Kerkorian outsmart them all, having found some victory in his apparent defeat?
The answer depends on Mr. Kerkorian's intent when his Tracinda Corporation announced its offer of $55 a share. If he really planned to gain control of Chrysler, his moves could well become a case study in how to doom a takeover attempt.
Mr. Kerkorian's first misstep may have been to rely to much on the cult of personality, having teamed up with Lee A. Iaccoca, the former Chrysler chairman.
What was missing was cash: Mr. Kerkorian had no financing, and had not hired an investment bank to assist him. As the days passed without Mr. Kerkorian's announcing his bankers or advisers, his credibility suffered.
Making it all worse was the structure of his proposed deal. Mr. Kerkorian was attempting a highly leveraged transaction in a cyclical industry -- one that has significant ups and downs as the economy changes. As a measure of risk, remember that even in the 1980's, the heyday of the fast-money mergers, no one attempted a deal as large as Mr. Kerkorian's proposal for a cyclical company. It was considered too risky.
"One thing that is clear from this is that it is very hard to get financing for a leveraged deal in a cyclical industry, and that is a good thing," said Steven Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago business school.
Finally, Mr. Kerkorian and his advisers projected an image that was almost too naive. They railed about Chrysler's attempts to persuade the banks not to lend money for the deal -- something that is Step No. 1 in every corporate defense playbook. They criticized Chrysler for calling the bid hostile, when, they contended, the company had been made aware of Mr. Kerkorian's intentions and never raised objections. Their continuous talk about past events served only to undermine their credibility, since Wall Street cared only about the future of the bid.
But perhaps Mr. Kerkorian did not lose so badly as it appears. Indeed, some on Wall Street argue that he never intended to acquire Chrysler, or his attempt would not have been so badly mishandled. Instead, this theory goes, Mr. Kerkorian's loud saber-rattling was an attempt to gain a measure of control over Chrysler's management.
"Whatever happens down the road," said one lawyer specializing in mergers, who spoke on he condition that he not be identified, "you can be sure that Chrysler is going to listen closely to what Kerkorian has to say."
Mr. Kerkorian's announcement yesterday underscores that. While withdrawing his bid, he pointedly disclosed that Wasserstein Perella & Company, a firm that made its name in mergers, had been retained to help him map out his next step. The implicit threat: that Mr. Kerkorian could well come back with a refined bid that would prove more palatable for Wall Street.
And Mr. Kerkorian has already won a victory of sorts. Chrysler shares are up 11 percent from where they stood before Mr. Kerkorian announced his bid. That is almost double the 6 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's 500 in the same period, and Chrysler shares outperformed those of Ford and General Motors.
"Clearly, Kerkorian scored some points," Mr. Kaplan said. "You can attribute some of that rise to him."
What that means for Mr. Kerkorian personally is that his 36 million shares of Chrysler are now worth about $160 million more than they were the day before he announced his bid -- not bad for a deal he never did.

Treasury Prices Are Mixed; 30-Year Bond Yields 6.64

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices closed mixed yesterday as the bond market reacted to several economic reports that reduced the odds that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon.
The 30-year bond rose 6/32 , to a price of 112 20/32 for a yield of 6.64 percent, down from 6.66 percent on Tuesday. Intermediate notes were mixed. A 10-year maturity moved lower in price to yield 6.28 percent, up from 6.27 percent on Tuesday. 
 Economists and dealers said the market was disappointed by nearly all of the economic data released yesterday, especially the final sales and inventory components of the revised first-quarter gross domestic product.
While the Chicago purchasing managers index fell to 53.5 in May from April's 57.6, it was still slightly up from average estimates of 53.1 and above the key 50-point level, hurting Treasury securities.
Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities in Chicago, said, "It brings down the odds that the Fed is going to ease anytime soon."
April new-home sales were down 2.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 580,000 units, lower than consensus estimates of 582,000, and thus provided little support to the market.
First-quarter gross domestic product was revised slightly downward to show a growth rate of 2.7 percent, down from 2.8 percent, and well below an expected 3.1 percent.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said some of the components of the revised first quarter G.D.P. numbers implied that second-quarter growth was likely to be revised upward. "Growth during the second quarter, nevertheless, continues to appear weak, with final sales growing an estimated 2.0 percent," she said.
Chris Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, said the numbers "were bullish on the surface, but not quite as good when you looked at the underlying components."
The market is now looking at tomorrow's employment number as a jump ball, he said, forecasting "a large revision to April's number."
Looking ahead toward reports on April consumption, the May purchasing managers report, April factory orders, May chain store sales, May auto sales and initial weekly jobless claims, Mr. Leary said, "You have to be at least cautiously neutral right now because the numbers should be favorable to the bond market."
In the municipal bond market, yields were little changed but still near 13-month lows. Investors were attracted in droves to yesterday's $1.25 billion bond offering by the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency of Orange County, Calif., through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities, which offered higher yields. It was by far the largest auction in the muni market this year.
Despite the strong demand, investors were seeking yields of more than 7 percent on many of the securities because of concern about the start-up nature of the project and because this toll road will run through the heart of the nation's largest bankrupt municipality.
The financing includes $813.5 million in senior lien current interest bonds priced to yield from 6.50 percent for an issue due in 2016 to 6.78 percent in 2032, 6.75 percent in 2034 and 6.73 percent in 2035.
For $207 million of zero-coupon bonds, which pay no interest, dealers priced the securities to yield 6.70 percent in 2004 to 7.30 percent in 2026 through 2030. And for $151.5 million of zeros that are convertible to current interest rate bonds, yields ranged from 6.95 percent in 2007 to 7.15 percent in 2013 and 2014.
All the bonds are rated triple-B- by Standard & Poor's
Walter Kreutzen, executive vice president of finance and administration for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, said he did not think the offering had been penalized by the Orange County bankruptcy.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 13-day cash management bills, which are used to meet short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions:

Why hasn't a weaker dollar cut America's trade deficit?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE dollar, everyone knows, has taken a pounding in the last year while the yen is flying high. Yet trade accounts have not responded: indeed the United States deficit has swelled while Japan's surplus has continued to climb. Doesn't that prove adjustments in exchange rates have little or no influence over trade flows?
The search for an alternative theory of what drives foreign trade accounts has taken on a new urgency after the latest round of exchange-rate gyrations. For if exchange rates don't matter, the assumption that free markets in currencies can more or less keep the world trading system on an even keel no longer holds. 
 Not to worry. William Cline of the Institute of International Economics has marshaled impressive evidence that exchange rates really do drive the trade accounts of the economic superpowers. Or perhaps you should worry: Mr. Cline's estimates suggest that the dollar would still have to fall a long way before America shed its status as a borrower. For the foreseeable future, it seems, the world's richest economy is destined to remain dependent on loans from its friends.
The simplest explanation for the failure of the depreciating dollar to slash the trade deficit is that it has not depreciated nearly as much as most people assume. For while the dollar has tanked against the yen and the European currencies linked to the German mark, it has held its own against the currencies of the smaller Asian trading countries and done very, very nicely against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
But that simple explanation is hardly complete. After all, the trade-weighted dollar has still depreciated by about 10 percent in the last year, with a seemingly perverse impact on America's trade balance.
Mr. Cline fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle by showing that the trade accounts of both America and Japan are, in fact, quite responsive to changes in exchange rates. The catch is that other factors, notably the business cycle, also affect trade. Make that two catches: Exchange rates work, but only with a considerable time lag.
Specifically, Mr. Cline used statistical techniques to isolate the impact of exchange rates on the "current account" -- the broadest measure of trade flows. Economic growth at home sucks in imports, while growth abroad increases the demand for exports. Once adjustments are made for changes in growth rates, he found that the current account responded to the exchange rate with a two-year lag.
So the real story of trade and exchange rates over the last few years goes something like this. The rise (yes, rise) in the dollar in 1993 is only now being fully felt on the American trade account, with each percentage point increase adding roughly $7 billion to the deficit. And the impact has been exacerbated by the fact that the American economy has been growing since 1992 while Japan remained mired in recession.
By Mr. Cline's analysis, the decline of the dollar in the last year has been fully justified; otherwise the American current account deficit, now pushing a record $200 billion, would balloon past $250 billion by 1997.
By the same token, the appreciation of the yen makes good sense in light of the Japanese recession and Tokyo's failure to stimulate the economy. Assuming the Japanese economy grows at a tepid 2.5 percent rate this year and a less-than-spectacular 4.5 percent rate in following years, Mr. Cline predicts that today's yen exchange rate would only just barely push Japan's current account surplus below $100 billion in 1997.
Evidence that exchange rates work according to Hoyle should be only modest comfort, though. By Mr. Cline's numbers, it would take an additional 15 percent drop in the dollar merely to halve America's current account deficit. Moreover, since the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso along with most Latin American and Asian currencies would probably follow the dollar, real progress on reducing America's deficit would require sharp dollar depreciation with respect to the yen and the strong European currencies.
There is a very different way of looking at the same problem. The dollar-yen crisis, if you want to call it that, is really the indirect consequence of Japan's economic stagnation. If Japan could return to a growth path, say, two percentage points above that of the United States, the pressure for further adjustment in exchange rates would presumably dissipate.
But don't count on it. The best and perhaps the only way Japan can beat the economic blues anytime soon is to stimulate the economy with tax cuts that increase the Government's already substantial budget deficit. And judging from the past year's sorry performance, the deeply conservative bureaucracy controlling economic policy would rather watch Japan's great industrial complex wither than spend its way out of recession.

HEADLINE: A Poor Plan for Nynex

 BODY:
The future of telephone service in New York State will be shaped today when the state Public Service Commission votes on a poorly fashioned plan to loosen regulations on Nynex, which provides residential phone service to over seven million customers. The plan, which the commission's staff negotiated with Nynex, would slightly lower and then freeze residential rates for up to seven years. In return, Nynex would be allowed to keep whatever extra money it earns from cutting costs and selling new communications services. The goal is to entice Nynex into lower costs and greater innovation. But the plan will not work unless drastically altered.
For starters, the duration of the plan is too long. To lock in rates today based on seven-year projections of inflation and productivity invites serious problems. Either the rates wind up too low, forcing Nynex to cut back services, or too high, thereby generating windfall profit with which to subsidize -- to its competitors' detriment -- entry into new fields. Consumer groups complain, with justification, that the plan will not force Nynex to improve its poor service record. They also claim that the proposed rate reductions are skimpy, falling below those achieved in other states. 
 One provision threatens to misshape the telephone market for years. AT&T, MCI and other alternative carriers want to compete against Nynex for medium-distance toll service. But toll calls start and finish on Nynex's wires to the home, a service for which Nynex charges an access fee. The alternative carriers say the proposed plan sets access fees above Nynex's costs and much too high to allow them to provide a low-cost service.
The commission could fashion a better plan by shortening its term and further reducing residential rates and access fees. It is also important to clarify that the plan would be pre-empted by a forthcoming restructuring of telecommunications markets so that every service is opened to competition. That way Nynex's privileged position will not endure longer than necessary.

War on the World

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
By taking hundreds of peacekeepers hostage, using them as human shields and calling them "prisoners of war," the Bosnian Serbs have declared war on the world.
Will the world fight back? Not likely; it prefers to disengage in high dudgeon. 
 The British response -- dispatching combat engineers with artillery -- has as its purpose the extrication of its forces from a doomed mission. The French will follow; the international decision is being made to withdraw, and President Clinton has agreed to some American cover.
The Serbs know that the U.N. is a sponge designed to absorb humiliation. Now they are testing the Western powers to see who has the will to fight and win in Bosnia.
No outsiders have that will. When Americans dare to suggest that Europeans collectively enforce Europe's peace, the response is: Without you? You lead, America -- send U.S. troops to fight -- and we may follow, criticizing all the way.
They know that America won't become Europe's internal policeman. And so Serbs -- with the arms and the will to win -- are winning.
No one doubts that an exercise of force three years ago -- European troops, U.S. air power, world economic pressure -- would have saved the day for collective defense. But that was then; appeasement failed; continued peacekeeping requires war-making; what now?
The Surrender Solution is the one preferred here now, provided enough fig leaves can be found. This would include angry warnings to terrorist hostage-takers; fighting forces added, under national commands, to cover a withdrawal in strength; pressure on the Bosnians to be good sports and surrender. This would avoid a televised bloodbath and an unwanted guilty conscience all around. The problem is with the victims, who prefer to fight.
The Secular Muslim Solution is quietly being bruited about. If the U.N. is paralyzed by terrorists, some suggest turning to Turkey and Pakistan to do for Bosnia's Muslims what the West has no will to do: send the 100,000 troops needed to persuade the Serbs that they could lose everything by fighting.
A grateful European Union could make such intercession worth Turkey and Pakistan's while. This romantic notion -- stimulated by the picture of Tansu Ciller and Benazir Bhutto visiting Sarajevo -- is admittedly far-fetched.
The Fundamentalist Muslim Solution is one that no European wants, but that Serbs invite. Iran is already smuggling arms into Bosnia, and -- with gun-for-hire Afghanis -- radicalizing secular Bosnian Muslims. Teheran's idea is to turn the victims into villains: secure a guerrilla foothold in Europe, and -- as Iran becomes nuclear with Russia's help -- intimidate northward from a base of persecuted and angry Bosnians.
The Balance of Power Solution is "belated lift-and-strike," never seriously pressed by Clintonites, now made costlier by delay. It calls for actively taking Bosnia's side.
Stage one: Lift the U.N. arms embargo, and supply and train Bosnian troops, while removing U.N. peacekeepers with U.S. air support. Offer up no more hostages.
Recognize that in the pullout's aftermath, eastern enclaves will be overrun; Serbian terrorists will kill tens of thousands of innocents. If most Bosnians are prepared to pay this price for a nation of their own, it is not for the West to fail to arm them.
Stage two: See what heavy bombing does to the Bosnian Serb forces, cut off from Serbia. Such suppressing fire from the air might allow the Muslim advantage in military manpower -- three to two over Serbs in Bosnia -- to manifest itself.
This last is not a happy or heroic solution. It will cost lives sooner rather than later. But it levels the killing field. That bloody balancing of power is the only language terrorists understand.
The U.S. should help in a withdrawal guaranteed to lead to lift-and-strike, but not in any "reconfiguration" intended to prolong the embargo and the dithering.
Outsiders do not have the will to win. Serbs do. So do embattled Bosnian Muslims. Humanitarians must become air-support allies; in that way, the world can win the war.

HEADLINE: How New York City Privatized Street Cleaning and Rued It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The statement by Prof. E. S. Savas, the "prophet" of privatization (news article, May 25), that "introducing competition into the delivery of public services" is "new" displays astonishing ignorance. 
 Between 1842 and 1881 the streets of New York City were cleaned by private contractors, whose contracts were awarded by competitive bidding. (Competitive bidding was probably used even earlier, but information about the period before 1826 is incomplete. Between 1826 and 1841 the streets were cleaned by public employees, who performed remarkably well.)
There were strict means to enforce performance, including the right of the mayor, with just 24 hours' notice, to order the streets cleaned at the derelict contractor's expense. What's interesting is that despite competitive bidding and the availability of strict enforcement measures, the streets of New York City were continuously filthy.
In 1860 the city inspector declared that the contracting-out system "has in every instance proved a failure." It is precisely because of the failure of competition that the city government stepped in, in the first place.

HEADLINE: Wolfensohn to Step Down As Kennedy Center Head

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
James D. Wolfensohn, who had hoped to remain as chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts even after assuming the presidency of the World Bank on Thursday, has decided instead to relinquish the arts position, a spokeswoman for the center said tonight.
Confirming a report of Mr. Wolfensohn's decision in The Washington Post, the spokeswoman, Tiki Davies, said that Mr. Wolfensohn would leave the Kennedy Center at the end of the year, and that the center's board would start a search for his successor. 
 Mr. Wolfensohn, a New York financier and philanthropist, previously headed Carnegie Hall and was credited with bringing a measure of financial stability to the Kennedy Center. He will become chairman emeritus at the Kennedy Center, Ms. Davies said, a position he holds at Carnegie Hall.
Attempts to reach Mr. Wolfensohn by telephone tonight were unsuccessful. The Post quoted him as having said that "the more I got into the work at the bank, the more it became clear to me that I could not take on the total responsibility" of heading both the World Bank and the Kennedy Center.
In March, President Clinton chose Mr. Wolfensohn to succeed Lewis T. Preston as president of the World Bank. Mr. Preston was ill with cancer, and died early this month. By tradition, the United States selects the head of the World Bank, which issues $17 billion in loans each year for development projects in poor countries.
Mr. Wolfensohn was born in Australia and became an American citizen in 1980. The chairman of his firm, James D. Wolfensohn Inc., which advises major corporate clients, is Paul A. Volker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Wolfensohn is a cellist and has moved freely in the disparate worlds of high finance and performing arts. When his selection as head of the World Bank was disclosed, Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International and a former official in the Carter and Reagan Administrations, said of Mr. Wolfensohn, "He's a Renaissance man, with extremely good judgment and great integrity."

HEADLINE: An Italian Master Works His Glass Alchemy

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
THERE are magicians who saw people in half or make them disappear in miracles of illusion. And there is Lino Tagliapietra, a magician whose miracles are real.
Dipping his blowpipe into a 2,000-degree mass of molten glass, Mr. Tagliapietra breathes gentle puffs of air through the tube and then in a flash, with a snip of steel tweezers, a pull and a tug, creates a planet Saturn, wreathed in rings. Or a delicate gleaming goblet with a base like an inverted parasol that pings musically at the tap of a finger. 
 Eccolo: It is a miracle.
Mr. Tagliapietra, a master glassblower from Murano, a town in the Lagoon of Venice, can blow glass into a perfect circle with the ease of a child blowing a soap bubble.
William Gudenrath, a glass blower who lives in Jersey City and whose goblets are sold at places like Bergdorf Goodman, said, "A master has two qualities -- a sense of design, and he invents something new to do in glass."
William Traver, Mr. Tagliapietra's dealer in Seattle, said, "Lino has blended the traditional European mastery of glass with the innovative American way of making larger, more abstract forms."
How does he do it? Many Murano glassblowers would never say, their techniques having been treated like state secrets for centuries. But Mr. Tagliapietra, who is 61 now and who became a glass-factory apprentice at 11 and a master by 22, is more relaxed.
His generosity in sharing the art and craft of glass making, which the Venetians have been practicing for 1,000 years, has not made him popular with his colleagues at home.
Indeed, since 1979, he has not only collaborated with artists like Mr. Chihuly, but also taught regularly at Pilchuck Glass School, near Seattle, and occasionally at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Me.
For such disclosure, which has helped stimulate interest in glass blowing, he has been ostracized by some other Murano glassblowers. He is not the first glassblower to leave Murano to teach, but he is the first to teach so often.
"When I teach, I teach everything," Mr. Tagliapietra said. He also blows his own designs, which sell from $1,200 for a goblet to $28,000 for a sculpture that is 30 inches in diameter.
In addition to the William Traver Gallery in Seattle, his dealers include the Sanske Gallery in Zurich.
One artist who has worked with Mr. Tagliapietra is Izhar Patkin, who hired him to execute a design for a 14-foot glass sculpture, a full-breasted figure with six arms that looks like a composite of Carmen Miranda, Josephine Baker and the Hindu god Shiva.
"If you go to Venice and to Murano and hire a glassblower, there's a maestro who does extremely beautiful roses and a maestro who does very beautiful vases -- but Lino can do everything," Mr. Patkin said. The sculpture, called "Where Each Is Both," was acquired last year by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
When Mr. Tagliapietra collaborates, he charges $1,500 to $2,000 a day, plus expenses, and salary and expenses for a team of other glassblowers and assistants to help him.
Mr. Patkin went to Murano to arrange for a factory to let Mr. Tagliapietra blow. "The owner said yes, and the workers said no," Mr. Patkin recalled. "It was a horrible moment for me, to go back to Lino with the factory owner, and say, 'We don't know how to tell you this, but the workers will walk out.' "
And so Mr. Tagliapietra blew the 14-foot-high sculpture at the New York Experimental Glass Workshop, now called Urban Glass, in Brooklyn. The ostracism was gradual.
"The first time, in 1979, nobody say nothing," he said. Then, he added, "My social life practically disappeared."
"There were no more invitations to the party, no dinners with some friends," he added. "If the economy has a little problem, it's because Lino took out the secrets."
Mr. Patkin said later: "You have to be very centered when you're sitting there to blow a perfect bubble. This extends to his personality."
Last month, Mr. Tagliapietra returned to Urban Glass to blow glass from designs by Dorothy Hafner, an artist and ceramicist, for her show at the Heller Gallery at 71 Greene Street (at Spring Street) that opens tomorrow. Even maestros do not blow alone: Ms. Hafner assembled a team to work with Mr. Tagliapietra, including two glassblowers from Seattle, Bryan Rubino and Janusz Pozniak, over the course of the four days it took to blow the 27 objects of mosaic glass. Glassblowing is theater: when Mr. Tagliapietra finished a vessel, many applauded.
Mr. Tagliapietra's tools, ancient and simple, were laid out by his bench. There were the hollow blowpipe, shears, and pincers for pulling the glass. To shape it, there were long wooden blades called jacks, wooden blocks, cork paddles and large wads of wet newspaper. The pontil, a solid rod, attaches to the bottom of the glass.
During the process, a clear glass bubble is rolled across a tray of colored glass pieces that adhere to it. It is then blown into its final shape, emerging as a painting in the round.
First, Mr. Pozniak dipped the blowpipe into the furnace, gathering the bubbling liquid onto the tip. He began to blow the 15-pound bubble, repeating the process until it was nearly the right size to pick up the mosaic pieces. Then he passed it to Mr. Tagliapietra, who, as Ms. Hafner said, "blows in the magic."
Amy Schwartz, who, with Andrew Stenerson, was one of the assistants, used the wood paddles to shield his hands from the heat. Then, as Mr. Rubino blew, Mr. Tagliapietra began to shape the vessel with wet newspapers.
It was reheated, then rolled in brilliant bits of cobalt, scarlet and ochre glass, which had been heated. As Mr. Tagliapietra blew, circles became ovals and squares metamorphosed into diamonds.
In 12 hours, the finished vessel will cool to room temperature. What will sell for $6,000 to $12,000 took Mr. Tagliapietra an hour to make. "Or 40 years," he said, smiling.

HEADLINE: Evidence Shows Link of 2 Centuries of Drought to Maya Decline

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
New evidence from a Mexican lake bed has revealed that an unusually severe drought about 1,200 years ago may well have contributed to the abrupt decline of classic Maya civilization.
Scientists from the University of Florida said an analysis of sediments beneath Lake Chichancanab on the Yucatan Peninsula provided "the first unambiguous evidence" for a period of extreme aridity between A.D. 800 and 1000. The drought was the harshest in the region in 8,000 years and coincided with the widespread collapse of Maya culture, a time of spreading warfare and finally the abandonment of many great cities of monumental architecture. 
 Although in recent years archeologists have made many new discoveries in Maya ruins and managed to decipher telling hieroglyphic texts, the mystery of the civilization's sudden decline a thousand years ago persists. Various theories have implicated overpopulation, environmental degradation and bitter intercity rivalries leading to destructive warfare throughout much of the Maya lowlands of what is now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras.
And now, in a report being published today in the journal Nature, scientists added regional drought as a possibly critical factor in the civilization's fate. The findings from a chemical analysis of shell carbonate and gypsum, burned grasses and root fragments in cores from the lake bed might not alone support the drought theory, they said, but other geological evidence of low lake levels elsewhere in Mexico and Costa Rica suggested that the climate shift was just in Central America.
The study was conducted by Dr. David A. Hodell and Dr. Jason H. Curtis, both geologists at the University of Florida and Dr. Mark Brenner of the university's department of fisheries and aquatic sciences.
In an accompanying commentary, Dr. Jeremy A. Sabloff, director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archeology and Anthropology and a Maya specialist, said the new findings added "another important component to the model that archeologists are currently building to help explain the upheavals of the late eighth century and early ninth century A.D. in the Maya lowlands."
But the drought lasting at least two centuries was probably not solely responsible. The region, Dr. Sabloff noted, was "already under heavy stress" from political, economic and environmental problems.
"To a civilization facing a number of stresses both internal and external, the scarcity of water could have greatly increased the vulnerability of numerous classic Maya cities," Dr. Sabloff wrote. "The arrival of a drier regime would have exacerbated the perilous situation, ultimately causing the demise of elite power, the abandonment of many urban centers and important demographic and economic shifts from the southern to northern lowlands."
Such research into the causes of the Maya collapse could have implications for other cultures, ancient and contemporary.
By identifying the circumstances contributing to Maya successes and failures, Dr. Sabloff said, anthropologists might learn "how severe do internal stresses in a civilization have to become before relatively minor climate shifts can trigger widespread cultural collapse."

HEADLINE: U.S. Called Ready to Compromise on Date for Japan Trade Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 31

 BODY:
In a small step intended to accommodate complaints by Asian and European trade officials, the Clinton Administration is leaning toward moving up the date of the next round of talks with Japan on trade in automobiles and auto parts, several American officials said today.
Last week, the Administration rebuffed a Japanese call for urgent negotiations, proposing that the talks be held in Washington on June 20 or 21. Instead, officials said today, the Administration is now leaning toward offering dates of June 15 or 16 for the discussions, possibly to be held in Geneva. American punitive tariffs on Japanese luxury cars are scheduled to take effect on June 28. 
 The new willingness for earlier talks is significant because it would bring the United States into partial compliance with an international trade agreement. It would also separate the trade talks from a meeting of heads of government of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on June 15-17 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Anne R. Luzzatto, a spokeswoman in the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said no final decision on further negotiations would be made until at least Thursday. But other American officials said momentum was building in favor of earlier talks. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry and Tokyo's top official involved in the auto dispute, was the first to suggest the new schedule.
Tonight, Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, said on Air Force One that President Clinton planned to meet privately with Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, on June 15 in Halifax. However, an Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was no intention of resolving the auto-trade issue in Halifax.
The rules of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, which the United States and Japan helped establish at the beginning of this year, require that members begin to hold negotiations within 30 days of a complaint. Japan filed such a complaint on May 17 against the American plan to impose 100 percent tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars if an auto-trade deal was not reached by the June 28 cutoff.
A 30-day deadline for talks in the auto dispute expires on June 16, the date now tentatively envisioned for resumption of the negotiations.
The main sticking point in the talks has been the United States' insistence that Japanese companies agree to a plan to increase their purchases of American-made auto parts. The Japanese refuse to discuss such plans, regretting that they agreed to a similar arrangement during the Bush Administration. The targets in that arrangement, on computer semiconductors, have since been met. But while American officials were signaling new flexibility today on procedural matters like the timing of negotiations, they showed no sign of backing down on the substance.
In Geneva, at a meeting of delegates to the World Trade Organization, the Americans today expressed a new willingness to meet soon with Japanese officials, people who attended those discussions said. "There was general appreciation that both sides had agreed to seek a solution to the dispute under the dispute settlement mechanism" of the World Trade Organization, said Krishnasamy Kesavapany, Singapore's representative to the trade group, in a telephone interview.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has said he does not want the dispute with Japan to become the centerpiece of next month's Group of Seven meeting. By holding separate trade talks on another continent at the same time, the Clinton Administration would at least make it possible for other issues, like the weakness of the American dollar, to hold center stage in Halifax.
In a move that seems likely to complicate the auto-trade talks even further, the 15-nation European Union made a formal request today to the United States for inclusion in these negotiations. Such requests are made under a specific procedure in World Trade Organization rules and may be hard to turn down. American officials had no immediate reaction to the request this afternoon.
The Europeans have been increasingly nervous in recent weeks that the United States and Japan might cut a deal at their expense. The Americans this year have been emphasizing their desire for Japan to buy more American auto parts, rather than that Japan open its market to auto parts from any country.
In the 1980's, the United States tried to negotiate a guaranteed share of the Japanese semiconductor market for its producers. European officials warned at the time that increases in the American share might come at the expense of other exporters to Japan. They eventually persuaded the American negotiators to pursue overall increases in the market shares of all companies shipping semiconductors to Japan.

HEADLINE: Films and Recordings Threaten Nation's Character, Dole Says

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 31

 BODY:
In his quest to gather support from conservative Republicans for his Presidential bid, Senator Bob Dole made a withering attack tonight on the entertainment industry for what he said was a barrage of movies and recordings that are slashing the social fabric of the nation.
"We have reached the point where our popular culture threatens to undermine our character as a nation," said Mr. Dole, whose speech propelled him into the forefront of Republican candidates denouncing Hollywood for producing what he called "nightmares of depravity" involving sex and violence. 
 Early reaction to Mr. Dole's speech ranged from muted to angry. Some critics of the speech said Hollywood was an easy target for conservatives like Mr. Dole, who, they said, were failing to deal with social issues like gun control and unemployment.
Specifically singling out Time Warner for promoting gangsta rap recordings with depictions of violence against the police, the Senate majority leader said, "I would like to ask the executives of Time Warner a question: is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers? You have sold your souls, but must you debase our nation and threaten our children as well?"
Another challenge to Time Warner today today came from William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary, who wrote to board members of the company, demanding that it stop distributing gangsta rap because of its violent or sexually degrading content. Several executives at the Warner Music Group said that if they were forced to drop the genre it could have a corrosive effect on the company. [Page B10.]
Mr. Dole made his remarks at a fund-raising dinner before a group of about 600 business leaders and Republican stalwarts, only a few from the entertainment industry. Bo Derek, the actress, sat in the front row and was the only performer on hand.
The speech was Mr. Dole's most muscular attack on the entertainment industry since announcing his Presidential drive in April. As the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Mr. Dole has sought to gather support among hard-line conservatives within the party who dominate the primary process. Abortion rights, gun control and, lately, Hollywood have been targets for the 71-year-old lawmaker who has in recent weeks lashed out at entertainment executives for promoting "casual violence and even more casual sex."
But aides to Mr. Dole felt that his earlier forays into social politics had been too general for a candidate who has never been known to strongly espouse the party's moral agenda and concluded that he had to add some punch and some detail to his oratory on the subject.
Other politicians have sought to criticize Hollywood's standards ever since former Vice President Quayle began the 1992 campaign's "family values" debate by denouncing the morality of the comedy series "Murphy Brown."
Mr. Quayle's attacks were initially successful for the Republicans, but backfired at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, where speaker after speaker focused on social and moral issues and, in the view of many Republican and Democratic strategists, alienated large groups of voters. Since then, the Republicans have been seeking ways to bring a family values agenda back to life, but none have seized the issue in quite the same way as Mr. Dole.
Tonight he cited such films as "Natural Born Killers" and "True Romance," as well as groups like Cannibal Corpose, Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew for their depictions of "mindless violence and loveless sex." (An aide to Mr. Dole acknowledged that the candidate has not actually seen the movies or heard the songs, but read the film reviews and lyrics).
Some of the more vocal liberals in Hollywood were unresponsive to the Dole speech. Marilyn Bergman, chairman of American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which represents 68,000 people in the music business, said she would have no comment. Others declined to speak for the record.
But Norman Lear, creator of "All in the Family" and other television hits, said: "Hollywood in its presentation of violence and sex has no more to answer for than the Congress of the United States. The name of the game in the entertainment business is short-term profit. This is exactly what Congess is all about: how can we get re-elected in the short term and every other value be damned."
Lara Bergthold, executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, representing mostly wealthy female executives in the entertainment business, termed the Dole speech "unbelievable hypocrisy."
"It's always easier for a Senator to blame fictional characters than to blame themselves for their inability to take guns off the streets and provide jobs to people."
Some of the bluntest comments came from Michael Fuchs, newly appointed chairman of the Warner Music Group, who also runs Home Box Office. In the face of ongoing criticism about rap lyrics, Mr. Fuchs had been asked last week by Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner, to develop guidelines to place more specific warning labels on some rap albums.
In his attack, Mr. Dole was not singling out all rap, but mainly the songs often referred to as gangsta rap that deal with violence against police and contain sexually charged lyrics.
Speaking over the telephone from his office in New York, Mr. Fuchs said that Mr. Dole "had made no effort to have a dialogue or to try to look at this thing in anything less than an expedient political manner.
Citing Mr. Dole's strong opposition to gun control, Mr. Fuchs added, "I'd like some objective opinion as to whether guns or lyrics are causing the kind of turmoil among America's youth that's tearing at the fabric of this country."
He said that some of the most profitable films in recent years were actually family films like "The Lion King," "The Santa Clause" and "The Flintstones." He also included "Forrest Gump" in his list and oddly "True Lies," an action thriller in which Arnold Schwarzenegger's character kills with high-tech Hollywood abandon.
But Mr. Dole said Hollywood was utterly failing to deal with various films and songs extolling violence. He deplored "music extolling the pleasures of raping, torturing and mutilating women" as well as "songs about killing policemen and rejecting law."

AIR FRANCE AND BOEING REVISE DEAL ON ORDERS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Air France reached an agreement yesterday with the Boeing Company to revise its airplane orders, increasing the number of planes but postponing delivery until 1999 to 2001, without incurring penalties. The new order could be worth as much as $988 million to Boeing, compared with $578 million for the old orders. Air France said it expected to reach a similar agreement soon with the European airplane consortium Airbus Industrie. The airline said its previous orders for 7 Boeing jets had been replaced by an order for 15 planes -- 7 wide-body 767-300 extended-range aircraft and 8 narrow-body 737-500's -- to be delivered between 1999 and March 2001. Shares of Boeing, which is based in Seattle, gained 62.5 cents, to $58.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Germany to Reorganize New York Tourist Office

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, May 31

 BODY:
The German Government promised today to reorganize its official tourism office in New York after a series of scandals that culminated last week with the disclosure of a policy document saying no American "blacks, Jews, Hispanics and Asiatics" should be encouraged to visit Germany.
Gunter Rexrodt, the Economics Minister, whose office pays 85 percent of the New York office's $30 million-plus annual expenses, said the German Government official who oversaw the New York office, Ulrich Geisendorfer, would be dismissed. He said the office would be thoroughly reorganized by July and that Government money might be withdrawn. 
 The German National Tourism Office in New York is already facing lawsuits totaling some $15 million from employees charging sexual and racial discrimination.
And an employee has been dismissed for disseminating documents seeking to discount the Holocaust.
But the event that most shocked Germans was the disclosure last week by the office's acting director, Fred Gross, that a directive had been in effect since 1984 to discourage "blacks, Jews, Hispanics and Asiatics" from visiting Germany.

HEADLINE: Lab's Fate Is in Air Force Numbers;
New York Officials Say Pentagon Tailors Its Data to Politics

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last October, anticipating a new round of military base closings, Air Force analysts used a computer to estimate how much the Defense Department would save if it closed its high-tech military laboratory in Rome, N.Y., and merged it with a lab elsewhere.
Their October cost-benefit analysis found that moving the lab would be so expensive -- $133.8 million -- that it would far outweigh the $1.5 million in annual savings from closing it. Indeed, the computer determined it would take more than 100 years to recoup the price of the move. So the Air Force ranked the Rome laboratory among the last installations it would consider closing. 
 But four months later, as politicians across the country lobbied feverishly to save their local bases, the Air Force issued a whole new cost-benefit analysis. It said the relocation would cost less than half as much -- $52.8 million -- with big annual savings of $11.5 million.
Suddenly the cost of closing Rome Lab could be recouped in just four years. Suddenly the Air Force had the numbers to justify shutting Rome. On Feb. 28, a week after the second computer run, the Pentagon made public the list of 119 installations it hoped to close or consolidate this year, including, for the first time, Rome Lab, which develops sophisticated electronic equipment for commanders to use to communicate with their forces.
The search for the true numbers provides a window on the jockeying that goes on as the military labors to substantiate its decisions. It is a process even Government Accounting Office auditors have characterized as elusive.
To some, the Rome Lab case suggests that the base closing system is hardly the open and apolitical process it was intended to be.
Supporters of the lab -- including Raymond Meier, the County Executive of Oneida County, where it lies, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- say they are sure the Air Force altered the numbers between October and February to support a behind-the-scenes political decision to shut Rome.
"They're cooking the books," Mr. D'Amato said. "The decision to move the lab was made. And then they had to invent the numbers to justify the decision."
Indeed, the discrepancy between the October and February numbers was so striking that the special Presidential commission on base closings asked the Air Force in April to do a third calculation. On May 23, the computer produced an estimate radically different from the first two.
 
Small Changes Make A Big Difference
 The Rome case illustrates how subtle changes in estimating basic costs like maintenance, moving or construction can strikingly alter an installation's fate. For example, in October the Air Force estimated the one-time costs to move and reinstall Rome's equipment at $16.8 million. But in February, the Air Force cut this estimate to $7.6 million, making it cheaper to close Rome.
Air Force officials, defending their analyses, say the estimates changed with circumstances. The October numbers were based on the premise that Rome would be merged into one other Air Force base, Hanscom, near Boston. The February estimate is based on splitting Rome between two sites, Hanscom and the Army base in Fort Monmouth, N.J., resulting in far less new construction, Air Force officials say.
"The data used in the Air Force analysis is publicly available, and has been certified and reviewed within the Air Force," said Maj. Gen. Jay D. Blume Jr., special assistant to the chief of staff for base realignment and closure. General Blume said he expected the commission on base closings "to closely scrutinize our data and we are confident the commission will find the recommendation is well supported."
But the May 23 computer run, which followed recent visits by Air Force analysts to Rome, Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, seems to raise more questions than it answers.
For example, the estimated relocation cost went from $133.8 million in October down to $52.8 million in April, and then back up to $79.2 million in the third analysis.
An analyst in the Air Force, who insisted on anonymity, defended the third computer run, calling it "the best possible estimate of what it will really take to do this action." He said it indicated that closing Rome was feasible and that the costs could be recouped in six years.
Senator D'Amato is no more convinced by these numbers, however, than by the previous set from the Air Force. "They are not big enough to admit they were wrong," he said.
Even as savvy a political operator as Mr. D'Amato has only theories on what political strings may have been pulled. He says it may have been California interests, trying to save a large Air Force depot at McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, or Massachusetts interests protecting Hanscom Air Force Base.
After Senator D'Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki railed against the Air Force's numbers at a May 5 hearing, the commission's chairman, former Senator Alan J. Dixon of Illinois, said: "I think we're interested in looking at Rome more carefully." The independent commission is to begin voting in late June on the Pentagon's recommendations.
 
Explanations Draw Criticism
 Senior Air Force officials say that the wide variation between the October and February analyses of Rome, which employs about 1,000 civilians, has a simple explanation. Moving the whole lab to Hanscom, they said, would have required $95 million in new construction. But splitting Rome between two bases would take advantage of existing empty space.
In explaining the specific changes -- like the change in equipment-moving costs from $16.8 million in October to $7.6 million in February to $10.4 million in May -- Air Force officials have hardly been definitive. When first asked by a reporter why the moving costs fell between October and February, a senior Air Force official said that some equipment would be left behind at Rome.
As to why the moving estimates then jumped from $7.6 million in February to $10.4 million in May, the Air Force analyst said the May estimate included buying new equipment to replace what had been left behind.
Such explanations have not satisfied two retired military budget officers, Paul Freund and Bill Harvey, both veterans of previous rounds of closings, who were hired by community officials in Rome to check the Air Force numbers.
For weeks, Mr. Freund has been arguing that the February moving figure, $7.6 million, was too low. He produced an internal Air Force memorandum, dated Dec. 29, 1994, which says that moving just four pieces of heavy equipment from Rome would cost nearly $7 million alone. What about the thousands of other items that must be moved, Mr. Freund asked.
On seeing the Air Force's third moving estimate, $10.4 million, in the May 23 analysis, he said: "At least they're going up. That's a step in the right direction."
The case of Rome Lab is not unique. Since 1988, when the Pentagon first proposed post-cold war base closings, communities have complained loudly that the costs of shutting their bases were underestimated and the savings inflated. In past rounds, the odds that a locality would persuade the commission to reverse the Defense Department were slim, about 1 in 10.
That has not deterred economic development officials in the Rome region. Already stung by the closing of Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome in 1993, a team led by the Oneida County Executive, Mr. Meier, has spent $500,000 to plead its cause. They say the lab has more than $100 million in annual contracts with upstate companies and universities.
The local officials hired a public relations firm. They also hired Mr. Freund, a retired lieutenant colonel who oversaw the Air Force's base-closing budget process in 1993, and Mr. Harvey, a retired colonel who had a similar role in the Army. The two consultants, who have named their Virginia firm the Survivors Group, have been retained by a half-dozen communities facing closings.
Among their questions about Rome is "real property maintenance," an annual budget line that includes replacing broken toilets, repainting offices and other odd repairs. In October, the Air Force estimated it would save $3.2 million in maintenance by moving Rome to Hanscom. But in February and again in May, the Air Force increased the maintenance savings, to $8.1 million.
 
Shifting Estimates Of Needed Space
 Air Force analysts said more would be saved by moving the lab into existing space at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, where maintenance is already provided. But the consultants say that if the space is empty now at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth, the maintenance costs will increase when it is occupied.
Equally troubling, they said, was the Air Force's assumption about the space needed to relocate the 500,000-square-foot laboratory. In October, the Air Force said it would need 328,000 square feet to move the entire Rome Lab to Hanscom; in February, the combined space it requested at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth fell to 223,000 square feet.
The less space needed at a new site, of course, the stronger the argument for closing Rome.
After the February numbers became public, the consultants said they were skeptical about whether the lab could be squeezed so small. In the May 23 analysis, the Air Force seemed to agree, saying the laboratory would now require 365,000 square feet at Hanscom and Fort Monmouth.
It is difficult to determine if politics played a role in all this. In a report in April, the General Accounting Office chastised the Air Force for providing insufficient documentation "to substantiate the extent of deliberations and analyses leading to decisions to close" bases.
There is no shortage of theories about Rome. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, an Oneida County Republican, says he believes that Rome did not have an "angel" in the Pentagon's inner circle. Senator D'Amato suspects early Presidential politics and theorizes that Rome was selected for closing to save the depot at McClellan, which employs 10,000 civilians, because of California's electoral votes.
The Senator and Representative both said they suspected that Hanscom, in Bedford, Mass., was designated to inherit about 60 percent of the Rome laboratory because the base has a strong relationship with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the three decades before she became the Air Force Secretary in 1993, Sheila E. Widnall was a professor of aeronautics at M.I.T., which would benefit if the lab moved nearby.
Rudy de Leon, the Air Force undersecretary, said suggestions of favoritism were ludicrous. "The Secretary is a person of absolute integrity," he said.
Air Force officials say they supported Rome until November, when a Defense Department committee first suggested moving part of the lab to the Fort Monmouth Army base so the Army and Air Force could combine similar functions.
Still, Representative Boehlert said he believed the commission would vote Rome's way next month. "The numbers are with us," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a chart yesterday listing the projected costs of closing the Air Force laboratory in Rome, N.Y., misstated the Oct. 13, 1994, estimate of how much space would be needed for a new location for the lab. It is 328,000 square feet, not 0.328.

 Before it can recommend closing an installation, the Air Force, like the other services, must estimate the potential costs and savings. It does so using a computer model nicknamed Cobra, or Cost of Base Realignment Actions.

HEADLINE: Orange County: Reluctant Fiscal Test Case

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
Faced with the nuts and bolts of dismantling much of their bankrupt government, the residents of Orange County are finding themselves divided, angry about the options they face, but unable to turn back from a course that many conservatives had encouraged even before the county's financial debacle.
As deadlines approach and tough decisions are made, Orange County's bitter struggle to reverse years of government growth is providing an accidental laboratory of sorts in the new less-is-more civics of the 1990's. 
 Nearly six months after becoming the largest municipal government ever to file for bankruptcy -- after a ruinous $1.7 billion loss on investments in the bond market -- Orange County has reached a critical juncture in its battles for financial survival and direction. The issues are no longer ideology but specifics: which social programs will be eliminated, whether the county will make good on its debts, which library branches will be closed and how much elementary school students will do without.
"We didn't approach this as a multiple-choice exam," said William J. Popejoy, 56, the corporate executive who became the county's unpaid interim chief executive in February. "At this point, what we have here isn't a dogma or a political problem. We have a financial problem. And what we need is to fix it. The longer we wait to fix it, the more expensive it is going to get. Nobody likes that. They like it less and less all the time."
Mr. Popejoy has restructured the budget, eliminating 41 percent of the county's operating costs. He has initiated the sale of nearly $100 million in assets, from office buildings to landfills. About 10 percent of the county's 15,000 employees have lost their jobs.
He has also pushed for a half-cent increase in the sales tax, to 8.25 percent, a measure that has sharply increased the anger in this rigidly anti-tax area.
The county's lawyers said they were close to reaching an agreement with investors in $975 million of the county's bonds to wait an extra year for repayment and to accept a lower interest rate.
Mr. Popejoy has insisted that the measures, while painful, are merely a financial tourniquet to rescue a county bankrupted by reckless investments.
Robert L. Citron, the former Treasurer, pleaded guilty last month to six felony charges of misappropriating funds and misleading investors, but most of those crimes appear to have been committed in a desperate effort to prop up his collapsing house of cards. Mr. Citron's former deputy, Matthew Raabe, was recently indicted on six counts of similar charges and is free on a $200,000 bond.
Residents will vote on the proposed tax on June 27. It will help determine whether the county will be able to construct a long-term plan for repaying its bondholders. Thus, it will have a large impact on when the county can emerge from bankruptcy and on what terms.
But no matter how the vote goes, Mr. Popejoy said in an interview, he has begun laying plans for a more profound transformation of the county government, which could affect it far longer than a default on its bonds. Perhaps the most important change will be satisfying the demands of residents who distrust government, yet expect a minimum of services to be delivered efficiently.
"People here regard government as a vending machine," said Frank Benest, the city manager of Brea, an upper-middle-class area at the northern edge of the county. "They put in a quarter and they still want a dollar's worth of services."
Mr. Popejoy said one of the first lessons he learned was that, in effect, there is not one county budget but three: separate portions financed by the Federal Government, by the state, and by the county.
Of the county's total $1.6 billion annual budget, he found, only $463 million was paid for with the county's own revenue -- and all the cuts had to come from that sliver. He has already sliced off $180 million. And that is not enough.
There are two reasons for the sharp reductions. By suffering the huge losses on its investment fund, the county also lost $160 million in interest that it expected to take in as revenues. And the county is being forced to cut operating costs in the hopes of putting away enough money to repay its bondholders.
What is more, Mr. Popejoy said, he also found that some of the county-financed portion of the budget had to be spent to entitle the county to substantially greater matching sums from the state and Federal governments. For instance, a drug rehabilitation and education program requires the county to put up $600,000 to get $20 million in Federal money. Mr. Popejoy said he was not cutting the program now.
Mr. Popejoy also faced a disappointment when it came to selling county assets, a course strongly encouraged by conservatives and libertarians. For instance, when he looked into selling the county's John Wayne Airport he said he had discovered that the unprecedented sale -- no public airport has ever been sold to the private investors in the United States -- would require changes in Federal law.
Little by little, the cutbacks are starting to be felt. The county had to abandon most of its water testing along its 42 miles of coastline for fecal coliform bacteria. Some defendants in county courts who cannot pay fines are now being ordered to perform maintenance duties at the courthouse.
Schoolpower, a parent-run foundation that supplements classrooms with educational materials, has started a drive to help fill a $820,000 cut in the school budget. Without private money, programs like physical education at elementary schools, marching bands and continuing education for teachers could be slashed or dropped.
"I feel defeated," said Lisa Montague Hamer, the mother of a kindergarten-aged child, as she read in a school flier that in addition to being asked for $200 by Schoolpower she would now have to pay $220 a year for previously free bus service.
Mr. Popejoy said: "There will be muscle and bone cut from the county's services. We're probably going to be sued."
That fact underscores one of the most telling responses of residents in this conservative, Republican county.
Mr. Benest, the city manager of Brea, said he worried that hastily slashed budgets were destroying the county's enviable standard of living and could drive away business.
But Robert Poole, president of the conservative Reason Foundation, argued that, if anything, county officials had not gone far enough in handing over basic services to the private sector.
While these two fiscal warriors are world's apart in their fiscal views, they agree on how residents have responded to precisely the sort of experiment in restructuring government that many Republicans in Congress are advocating for the country at large.
"People aren't willing to take any responsibility," Mr. Benest said. "This a tremendous era of selfishness. People are libertarian in philosophy here, but when it comes down to their service they want to keep it."
Mr. Poole was blunter. "There's a certain amount of hypocrisy out there," he said. "It's true: People don't want to take responsibility for doing the things they depend on government for now."
The state has played a large role in the recovery. On one hand, some state officials have threatened a takeover of the county if it defaults on its bonds; such a default, it is feared, could hurt all municipal borrowers in California.
But the state has also provided crucial aid by accelerating a variety of payments to the county and easing some regulations. A legislative package recently passed in Sacramento includes $360 million for waste-management programs, $660 million from motor vehicle fees and $160 million in advance payments on various tax programs.
That assistance is one essential element of Mr. Popejoy's financial rescue; the second part is the sales tax increase, which would raise about $160 million a year and provide collateral for immediate borrowings. Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, said that if the tax was passed -- polls show that voters are closely divided -- and everything else proceeded well, the county could emerge from bankruptcy in about a year at the earliest.
One of the most popular, if misunderstood, aspects of Mr. Popejoy's recovery strategy is his effort to hand off to cities many services previously offered by the county.
This is a popular measure in Congress as well. The premise is that grass-roots social programs should be shaped and administered by government agencies that are closer to those receiving the services. But that still leaves a problem that few officials have so far had the stomach to address here.
"The question is, Will there be revenues to pay for those services?" Mr. Benest said. "We are in no position to accept those services without a discussion about money. And so far nobody has talked about money."
Mr. Popejoy said he nevertheless planned to merge several county government departments to save money, push services like the issuing of building permits to the cities and make fundamental changes in how the county's supervisors work.
Currently, there are five elected supervisors with overlapping responsibilities. Mr. Popejoy said he wanted to model the system on a corporation. The board would be expanded to seven or nine supervisors, but they would be paid less and would work part-time. And they would operate like corporate directors; they would set policy and hire a chief executive to enforce it.
The supervisors, he said, should get just a telephone and a secretary, rather than suites of offices, and they would be paid $30,000 to $40,000 a year, down from $82,056 now.
"The people don't know what it is going to feel like yet," said John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees Association. "They haven't felt the bankruptcy. They read about it in the paper. But pretty soon this is going to start trickling down. People aren't going to like it."
But Mr. Poole of the Reason Foundation is adamant that the people will prefer a government that is less intrusive and makes people are more self-reliant.
Mr. Benest is less sure.
"If they privatize things like environmental protection to some engineering conglomerate, who is going to look after the public interest?" Mr. Benest asked. "You can't privatize that.
"That's why I say, ultimately, some of this is misleading. Government cannot really function without a sense of community, and we've lost that. What does that say?"

Stocks Continue Rally; Some Indexes Set Records
 The stock market continued to climb in the wake of its huge rally on Wednesday, providing relief to traders who feared the market might plateau or drop. 
 The Dow industrials rose 7.61 points, to a record 4,472.75, rebounding from a morning fall of more than 27 points. The broader S.& P. 500 index rose 0.09 point, to 533.49, also a record. The dollar rose to 84.65 yen, but fell to 1.4055 marks. [Page D6.]
 
Auto Sales Fall 2.8%
 Car and truck sales for May fell 2.8 percent. The results were better than expected, but virtually insured that 1995 sales would lag behind those of 1994. [D3.]
 
Retail Sales Encouraging
 The nation's big retailers reported encouraging sales gains in May, helped by milder weather and some bigger tax refunds. But most retail executives and analysts agreed that the figures did not point to a genuine recovery in consumer spending. [D2.]
 A major reason for the weakness in consumer spending this spring was the sharp rise in payments by homeowners and affluent taxpayers to cover high 1994 tax obligations, two Wall Street economists have found. [D2.]
 
Further Signs of a Slowdown
 The National Association of Purchasing Management index showed greater weakness in manufacturing than had been expected. Also, the Government reported that personal income and spending each rose just 0.3 percent in April, further indications of a slowdown, since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. [D6.]
 
America Online to Buy Web Site
 America Online plans to create a separate business, offering Internet access to computer users. To get it off to a quick start, the company agreed to pay $11 million for Global Network Navigator. [D6.]
 
Ex-Honda Executives Convicted
 Two former executives of American Honda were found guilty of accepting more than $15 million in kickbacks from dealers. [D3.]
 
Sony in Deal With Film Executive
 Stanley Jaffe, the former president of Paramount Communications, has struck a deal with Sony Pictures in which the studio would invest $75 million in his independent production company. [D4.]
 
Study Sees Obstacle for Unions
 Helping to explain the nationwide decline in union membership, a survey showed that many workers were often too cowed by management opposition to vote in favor of a union at their workplace. [D16.]
 
Recall Does Not Worry Smokers
 Reports of the contamination of eight billion Philip Morris cigarettes heaped more bad publicity on the tobacco industry, but smokers seem to have taken the news without panicking. [A18.]
 
Ads Spoof Martha Stewart
 How do you promote a magazine meant to embody the life style of a woman who has been called everything from "the diva of domesticity" to "a control-freakish middlebrow taste maker." A new campaign for Martha Stewart Living does it by spoofing everyone's perceptions of Ms. Stewart. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D4.]

Regulators Back Plan to Freeze Nynex Rates

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
New York State's top utility regulators approved a sweeping plan yesterday that would freeze the telephone rates of 7.4 million New Yorkers for up to seven years and substantially deregulate the Nynex Corporation.
Nynex has until July 19 to accept or reject the Public Service Commission's plan, which would allow the company to earn unregulated profits in return for a slight reduction and subsequent freeze in local phone rates. Nynex would also have to improve its poor reputation for customer service to avoid onerous financial penalties. 
 The company has operated under rate-of-return regulation -- in which the commission strictly governed its profits -- for most of the period since it was created in the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
"This is a major breakthrough for this company and the state," Ivan G. Seidenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Nynex, said. "But it's not a big thing if it's not right."
Although Nynex initiated the plan two years ago, Mr. Seidenberg said the company would withhold judgment on yesterday's proposal until it had a chance to study the details, which the commission does not plan to disclose until June 15. Several industry executives, however, said yesterday that they expected the company to accept it.
"This is a very good deal for Nynex," said Michael Morrissey, the vice president for government affairs at the AT&T Corporation.
If Nynex accepts the plan, New York would vault to the forefront of the 20 states that have deregulated their monopoly local telephone markets in an effort to spur competition and keep rates down. The plan would have an enormous impact on Nynex, which is laboring to turn itself from a regional utility serving New York and New England into a global communications conglomerate.
Massachusetts also recently abandoned its rate-of-return regulation of Nynex in favor of a "price cap" plan similar to the one approved yesterday by New York's public service commission. As a result, close to 95 percent of Nynex's telephone revenue would now be governed by price-cap regulation.
Under such regulation, Nynex would be able to keep the extra profits it generates by running its operations more efficiently. But it would no longer have the cushion of steadily increasing phone rates. The company's stock rose 25 cents yesterday, to $41.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"This is a truly revolutionary step," said Harold A. Jerry Jr., the chairman of the Public Service Commission, who brokered the plan in a month of intense negotiations with the other four commissioners. Mr. Jerry said the proposal would be the most significant change in New York's telecommunications regulation in his 22 years on the commission.
The new plan will not add up to much in savings for residential customers -- at least initially. The only local rate Nynex would immediately cut is the 50 cents it now charges customers for touch-tone, or push button, service. Eliminating that charge would reduce Nynex's average monthly residential bill by 1.7 percent, to $33.
Over time, however, consumers would benefit as inflation enhanced the value of the rates, which would stay at current levels. Nynex estimates that its residential and business customers would have cumulative savings of $1 billion in the first five years of the seven-year plan.
Customers would also pay lower rates for short-haul long-distance calls -- from Manhattan to New Rochelle, N.Y., for example. Nynex said yesterday that it could not quantify what an average customer might save, but that the company would forgo $191.3 million in toll revenue over five years.
Yesterday's plan is substantially similar to the "incentive regulation" proposal that the commission staff and Nynex jointly submitted last fall. But the commission has stiffened the financial penalties that Nynex would face if it fails to improve its customer service.
"Nynex's service, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, has been terrible for the last few years, and everybody knows it," Mr. Jerry said. "Nynex's service has just got to improve."
He said that if Nynex did not bolster its service from last year -- when it fell short of the commission's standards in the frequency of its breakdowns and missed-repair appointments -- the company would have to pay $77 million in penalties.
Mr. Seidenberg said Nynex's service record had already improved somewhat. The number of the company's service interruptions and missed-repair calls each declined 14 percent in the first three months of this year, compared with the corresponding period last year.
The commission also said that Nynex must reduce the access fees it charges long-distance carriers for switching calls from their networks to its local customers. AT&T, MCI, and Sprint contend that these charges hamper them from competing for Nynex's local and toll customers.
But Mr. Morrissey said the reduction in access fees was not sufficient to enable AT&T or other long-distance carriers to compete with Nynex. "If we can't make money in this market, it's an open question whether we'll want to participate in it," he said.
Long-distance carriers were not the only groups that criticized the plan. Several consumer advocates chastised the commission for not reducing local residential phone rates enough.
"The P.S.C. was duped into believing that it had to give Nynex unlimited profits and high rates in exchange for the possibility of reasonable service," said Robert Ceisler, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board. "The result will be high telephone rates for the vast majority of New York residents for years to come."
If the commission is dissatisfied with Nynex's performance under the new regulations, it can pull the plug. The commission's staff and Nynex had proposed reviewing the company's progress after the fifth year of the plan's seven-year cycle. But in yesterday's ruling, the commission added a second checkpoint in the third year.

HEADLINE: Bond Lawyer Admits Filing No Tax Forms

 BODY:
A bond lawyer who used to be a major fund-raiser for former Mayor David N. Dinkins pleaded guilty yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan to failing to file tax returns for three years, despite earning more than $600,000 in those years, Federal prosecutors said.
The lawyer, Joseph N. Barnes, 44, admitted in court that he never filed Federal tax returns for 1987, 1988 and 1991. He faces a year in prison and $300,000 in fines. 
 Mr. Barnes, a longtime supporter of Mr. Dinkins, worked on Mr. Dinkins's campaign finance committees in the 1985 race for Borough President of Manhattan and in the 1989 campaign for Mayor. He was a member of the screening panel that selected heads of economic development agencies when Mr. Dinkins took office in 1990.

HEADLINE: Purchasing Survey Indicates Sharper Economic Slowdown

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 1

 BODY:
A closely watched industry survey showed greater weakness in manufacturing than had been expected today, suggesting that the economic slowdown has been sharper than previously suspected.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of manufacturing activity fell to 46.1 last month from 52.0 in April -- the first time in 21 months it dropped under the critical level of 50 that marks the dividing point between growth and contraction. 
 The report buttressed signs of weakness that appeared in April, as the Commerce Department today reported the sharpest fall in factory orders in nine months and a sharp slowdown in consumer incomes and spending.
As consumers have cut back on spending, inventories have risen. As a result, factories have slowed production and scaled back operations.
"Clearly the economy is losing momentum more rapidly than was anticipated," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Consumers have cut back on their purchases of big-ticket items like new cars, and that is one reason manufacturers are cutting back; they will in turn cut jobs."
The Commerce Department report on personal incomes and spending during April noted that manufacturing payrolls fell in April at a rate of $7.4 billion a year, more than twice the $3.6 billion rate of decline in March.
That was partly because workers in the auto industry received large bonus payments in February and March but none in April, reflecting the industry's problem with weaker sales.
Overall incomes rose just three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.01 trillion in April, the smallest rise since November, when they were flat, following a revised increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Spending also gained three-tenths of 1 percent, to $4.82 trillion, in April -- less than half the big revised rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in March. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of national economic activity, which means that as spending slows so does the economy.
"The trend is pretty well set now: slower economic growth along with weaker income growth and cutbacks by producers," Mr. Sohn said.
Tepid business activity was evident at factory gates in April, as new orders fell 1.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $293.96 billion, after declines of four-tenths of 1 percent in March and three-tenths of 1 percent in February.
Not since the March-May period of 1993 had orders dropped for three consecutive months. In addition, shipments of finished products and order backlogs also weakened from March.
Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers, said companies "fundamentally overpredicted" the strength of consumer demand this year and were paying the price.
"The result is that business is facing a glut of unsold goods while consumers have been forced to scale back purchases," Mr. Richards said. "Production will have to be curtailed until surplus stocks are sold off."
The purchasing managers said their index of manufacturing activity plunged to its lowest in four years, since it was at 44.5 in May 1991 shortly after the last recession ended.
At every stage -- from new orders to production to backlogs, inventories and employment -- activity continued to weaken last month from earlier in the year, the purchasing managers reported.
Mr. Sohn of Norwest speculated that Federal Reserve policy makers might be forced to reverse course after seven interest-rate rises and possibly cut rates by August to try to stimulate economic activity and avert a recession.

HEADLINE: Weak Consumer Spending Is Linked to Bigger Tax Bite

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
One of the major reasons for the weakness in consumer spending this spring was the sharp rise in payments among many homeowners and affluent taxpayers to cover their unexpectedly high 1994 income tax obligations, two separate reports by Wall Street economists have found.
"Consumers got hit with a whopping tax bill in April," Joseph Liro, an economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, wrote in a research report that was released yesterday. 
 Another economist, David J. Greenlaw at Morgan Stanley, came to similar conclusions. After analyzing Treasury Department reports, Mr. Greenlaw, said: "Individuals wrote $20 billion more in checks this year than last to settle their obligations with the I.R.S. That's a 30 percent increase."
Indeed, spending growth slowed sharply in April, when most of those who owe taxes file their returns, a report from the Commerce Department showed yesterday. The agency reported that spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to $4.82 trillion, compared with a revised March gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Many economists have cited the slow pace at which the Internal Revenue Service issued tax refunds this year as a chief culprit for weak consumer spending.
Mr. Greenlaw disputed this view, saying that at the worst point the value of refund checks issued was $6 billion behind and in mid-April began to surge ahead. And refunds, which are running slightly higher than last year, now appear to be contributing to a modest improvement in the outlook for consumer spending.
"In the last few weeks there has been an acceleration in refunds," Mr. Greenlaw said. "Right now refunds are $9 billion above last year's pace."
The average refund check this year is $1,128, up from $1,037 in 1994, the I.R.S. said. I.R.S. officials said they had not computed the average amount of checks submitted with tax returns.
The reason so much more money was owed the I.R.S. this year appears to be a result of two factors that date to 1993. The first was the 1993 tax rate increase for the highest-income Americans and the other was the sharp drop in mortgage interest rates, which prompted many people to refinance their homes in late 1993.
Mr. Greenlaw said Government data showed that "mortgage payments fell to 5.7 percent of disposal personal income in 1994, down from a peak of 7 percent" in the early 1990's.
Reduced mortgage interest payments mean smaller deductions for taxpayers who itemize. Many homeowners who did not adjust their income tax withholding ended 1994 owing money to the I.R.S., Mr. Greenlaw said.
The 1993 tax rate increase was retroactive to the first of that year. In response to criticism that a retroactive rate increase was unfair, those affected were allowed to delay part of the payment on the retroactive increase until this spring.
Evidence that wealthy taxpayers also wrote bigger-than-usual checks to the I.R.S. is found in data on savings rates, according to Mr. Liro of S. G. Warburg. He noted that wealthy individuals tended to withdraw savings to cover large tax payments.
"The savings rate plunged from 5.2 percent in March to 4.3 percent in April," Mr. Liro wrote in his research report. He attributed the decline primarily to withdrawals to cover April tax payments.

HEADLINE: Rowland Signs Budget With Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 1

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland today signed a two-year budget that cuts taxes by $200 million and features what he called the smallest increase in state spending in 30 years.
The budget represents a victory for Mr. Rowland, the state's first Republican Governor in two decades, who campaigned last year on a pledge to phase out the state income tax and shrink state government. While the tax and spending cuts fall short of his campaign oratory, Mr. Rowland can point to them as the best that could be expected when faced with the political reality of a Democrat-controlled State House of Representatives. 
 Still, some Democrats charged that the $20 billion budget, which runs from July 1 through June 30, 1997, relied on gimmicks, like the sale of the state lottery and postponing debt payments, that do little to control state spending.
And it remains to be seen whether the income tax cut, which will amount to about $235 for a typical joint return in 1997, will help turn around the sagging Connecticut economy, as Mr. Rowland has promised.
Yet, the budget won impressive bipartisan support, and five prominent Democratic House members joined Mr. Rowland this afternoon at the signing ceremony.
"We came together and decided we should govern and not have partisan battles," Mr. Rowland said. "And we're in the process of turning this aircraft carrier around.
"The tax cuts will go a long way toward bringing back the confidence in the state that we want not only among our taxpayers, but our businesses also," he said.
According to the Office of Fiscal Analysis, a nonpartisan legislative agency, the appropriation for next year's budget is $9.9 billion and then $10.1 billion for the following year, up from estimated expenditures of $9.6 billion in this year's budget.
Using these figures, the agency estimated that spending would increase 2.57 percent next year and 2.64 percent the following year, the smallest increases in state spending in at least 30 years. But critics said that these figures and the balanced budget in general were a product of smoke and mirrors. In a scathing editorial this morning, The Hartford Courant called the budget "as fragile as a house of cards and as fraudulent as a three-dollar bill."
And at a news conference this afternoon, State Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat, said that the budget was rife with "gimmickry" and that it had the same growth in spending as the previous four years under Lowell P. Weicker Jr., if one did not include the restructuring of debt payments.
Mr. Jepsen said that expenditures were held down partly by stringing out over the next four years a debt payment of $328 million due next year, costing the state an additional $28 million in interest.
He also said that the $200 million needed for the tax cut was only made available through a last-minute proposal to make Connecticut the first state in the nation to sell an interest in its lottery to a private company. The idea is still being developed and must be acted on by the State Legislature in January before bids can be solicited.
"It seems absolutely incredible to me to project a $200 million tax cut based on something we haven't even studied," Mr. Jepsen said. "Why not make it $400 million?"
There is little question, however, that the budget represents a shift in how the state spends its money.
The budget estimates, for example, that the amount devoted to the welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, will be reduced from $369 million this year to $314 million next year and $316 million in the second year. The decrease comes largely from a reduction in monthly benefits from $581 to as low as $500 for a family of three.
And the state also expects savings of $17 million over two years from closing two institutions for the mentally ill.
Republicans have admitted that the cuts were not as deep as they would have liked and that compromises had to be made to win support in the House. Many of Mr. Rowland's most dramatic proposals in his original budget -- bundling of funding for social service programs into block grants and the consolidation of 29 state agencies to 12 -- largely fell by the wayside.
The $200 million tax cut is about one-fourth of what Mr. Rowland had proposed in the campaign, and about $300 million less than what he had called for in his budget address in February.
But Republicans called the tax cut a substantial achievement, one that many Democrats in February would have said was impossible.
Only last week, it had seemed that debate over the tax cut could jeopardize the entire budget.
Renewing the dispute over the income tax, which was adopted in 1991, Mr. Rowland had proposed cuts in the tax through the year 2000. Democrats balked at the idea of income tax cuts beyond the proposed budget and prepared for a fight that could have undermined the entire budget package.
But Mr. Rowland surprised many by withdrawing the income tax cuts for 1998, 1999 and 2000, although he said he would seek such reductions in the future.
With that obstacle out of the way, the Senate passed the budget late Wednesday night by a 21-to-15 vote, with the support of two Democrats.
The House had approved the budget early Saturday morning, in a 143-to-6 vote for the spending plan and a 126-to-21 vote for the revenue package.

HEADLINE: Russia to Activate Role in NATO Partnership

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 1

 BODY:
After nearly six months of hesitation and mixed signals, Russia has agreed to activate its membership in the program NATO calls Partnership for Peace, but Russian officials warned that NATO expansion would put an end to Moscow's participation.
Russian Defense Ministry officials said President Boris N. Yeltsin remained strictly opposed to NATO expansion eastward to Russia's borders. If and when such expansion occurs, the officials say -- a process that will take at least four or five years -- Russia will "immediately suspend" its participation in Partnership for Peace, a sort of associated status in NATO that can lead to full membership down the road. 
 Washington has been explicit in saying that NATO will expand and that Russia will have no veto over that expansion. But American and NATO officials also emphasize to Moscow that the process will be complicated and careful -- that new members must qualify on a long list of requirements from a civilian defense minister to ammunition compatibility, and that a new member must be ratified unanimously by all 16 current members and their parliaments.
So even Russia's warning that its membership will be suspended with expansion is regarded as a way to make membership digestible to Russian nationalist feeling. Four or five years is a long time in Russian politics, and NATO countries, including the United States, are in no hurry to create a domestic political crisis for Mr. Yeltsin, already weakened by the Chechnya situation and the unevenness of Russian economic reform, by pushing expansion now.
No one wants NATO to be an issue in Russian parliamentary elections in December, or in presidential elections scheduled for June 1996.
Military officials also think, according to Pavel Y. Felgengauer, the military expert of Sevodnya newspaper, that a firm Russian "no" to expansion will help delay it, and may even persuade nations like Greece, Portugal and Spain -- and perhaps others, like France -- to vote against expansion, which will be expensive. There is no point in Moscow's not talking tough right up until the end, these officials argue.
Mr. Yeltsin's foreign-policy adviser, Dmitri Ryurikov, said, "Russia strongly desires a general, all-European security system in which Russia and other countries have equal rights." That means an altered Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe.
Widening NATO "will simply divide Europe again," he said, and isolate Russia.
When Mr. Yeltsin sent relations into the freezer in December and refused to allow Russia to activate its NATO partnership, Moscow thought expansion was imminent, officials say. Asked what Russia gained from the delay, since no document was renegotiated, Mr. Ryurikov said that "we now have a much better and deeper understanding" of NATO enlargement.
But Moscow also forced the West to listen a little more closely, a Western diplomat said, and "to stop taking Russia too much for granted."

HEADLINE: Dallas Townsend, 76, CBS Radio News Anchor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dallas S. Townsend Jr., who wrote and anchored the morning CBS radio news roundup for 25 years, died yesterday at Montclair Community Hospital in New Jersey. A former resident of Montclair, he was 76 and lived in Sarasota, Fla., after retiring in 1985.
The cause was complications from injuries from a fall last week, a spokeswoman for the CBS Radio Division said. Mr. Townsend had gone to New Jersey on a family visit. 
 He presided at "CBS World News Roundup," which was broadcast on radio nationally, from 1956 to 1961 and again from 1963 to 1982, with two years out to anchor its evening counterpart, "The World Tonight."
In his 44 years with the network, he covered all the Democratic and Republican conventions from 1948 until 1984. He reported on the Japanese peace conference of 1951 and the start of the Vietnam peace talks in Paris in 1968.
His rich, distinctive voice informed millions of Americans about two Mercury space flights, four Gemini missions and two Apollo launchings. In addition, he covered atomic tests in Nevada in the early 1950's, and the inaugurations of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.
Born in Manhattan, he grew up in New Jersey. His father was an assistant Attorney General in the Eisenhower Administration.
He graduated from Princeton University in 1940 and from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University the following year. He briefly worked as a news editor at WQXR in New York before joining CBS in 1941.
He spent World War II in the Army, assigned to signal and communications centers in New Guinea, the Philippines and Japan, and became a captain. He helped to set up advance signal centers in Yokohama and Tokyo immediately after the Japanese surrender.
Returning to CBS, he worked successively as a news editor, director of special events and manager of television news broadcasts. In 1954, he was named a news correspondent. From 1982 until his retirement, he anchored several hourly news broadcasts.
He received an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism, a Peabody Award and an Armstrong Radio Pioneer Award for his work on the morning roundup, the longest running radio newscast in the country.
"For 25 years, the voice of Dallas Townsend has meant intelligent, incisive reporting and editing on CBS's enduring and distinguished 'World News Roundup,' " the duPont-Columbia jury said in 1983. "No other newsman in our day has had a broader acquaintance with news nor communicated it with more economy and precision."
Mr. Townsend is survived by his wife of 52 years, Lois Bradley Townsend; three daughters, Katherine Hamlin of Greenbelt, Md., Patricia West of Miami and Nancy Wilson of Upper Montclair; a son, Douglas, of Baltimore; a sister, Elizabeth T. McFadden of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Louis, of Washington, and Robert, of Toms River, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Steven R. Fenster, 52, an Expert In Corporate Restructuring, Dies

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Steven R. Fenster, a longtime investment banker and a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School, died yesterday at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He was 52 and had lived in Cambridge, Mass., since 1991.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Kerin, said. 
 Mr. Fenster, one of Wall Street's top experts in corporate restructuring, counted as clients a variety of the United States' leading corporations, including Pan Am, Digital Equipment, International Harvester and the Chase Manhattan Bank.
As a limited partner in the Blackstone Group in recent years, he worked on Federated Department Stores' takeover of R. H. Macy & Company. And in recent weeks, he had served as a consultant to the real estate investment trust that holds the mortgage on Rockefeller Center.
He was a native of Belle Harbor, Queens, and was a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard College and a Baker Scholar at the Harvard Business School. He also had a Fulbright Fellowship in the Netherlands, where he studied the relation between econometrics and economic policy for a year. After business school, he worked for three years as one of the "whiz kids" of Secretary Robert S. McNamara in the Defense Department before heading for Wall Street and Lehman Brothers in 1969.
At Lehman Brothers, he served as head of the financial restructuring and merger and acquisition groups. He was frequently consulted both by other investment bankers and by clients.
After Lehman Brothers was acquired by the American Express Company in 1984, he taught briefly at the Harvard Business School, worked as a consultant to the chairman and vice chairman at the Chase Manhattan Corporation, and then served for four years as a managing director at Dillon, Read & Company.
In 1991, when Mr. Fenster learned of his cancer, colleagues and friends established an endowed chair in his name at the Harvard Business School. Mr. Fenster then decided to teach there, and set up a course in corporate restructuring. He wrote many of the case studies, including cases he had worked on as an investment banker.
He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fund-raiser for Harvard, and served for many years as a director of American Management Systems Inc., Bloomberg L.P. and Sealy Inc.
Charles Rossotti, chairman of American Management Systems, who first met Mr. Fenster when they worked together at the Defense Department, said that when he and others started his company in 1970, they so valued Mr. Fenster's advice that they made him a special adviser to the board and brought him to meetings even though he was still very junior at Lehman.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Fenster is survived by a daughter, Emily, and a son, Edward, all of Cambridge, as well as his mother, Esther Hausman Fenster of Belle Harbor, and his sister, Ruth Block of Baldwin Harbor, L.I.

HEADLINE: Service Adds Another Portal To the Internet

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
America Online Inc., the country's fastest-growing consumer on-line information service, said yesterday that it would create a separate business to offer Internet access to computer users.
To get the new Internet business off to a quick start, the company agreed to pay $11 million for Global Network Navigator, one of the most popular information sites on the Internet's World Wide Web. 
 America Online already offers Internet access as one part of the on-line services it offers to an estimated 2.5 million subscribers. But to reach a broader audience of computer users who may not be interested in hobby forums, chat groups and other of its own information services, America Online and its rivals are creating separate Internet access businesses.
"It's a little bit like why General Motors makes pickup trucks as well as Chevys, or why American Express offers gold cards as well as Optima cards," said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Research of Bethesda, Md. "It gets them into different wallets."
America Online said yesterday that it would acquire Global Network Navigator from O'Reilly & Associates Inc. of Sebastopol, Calif., a publisher of technical books, for $9 million in stock and $2 million in cash. G.N.N. is in effect an electronic publishing company, read by thousands of subscribers each month.
America Online also said it had purchased rights to Webcrawler, a popular search tool that makes it easier to find information on the World Wide Web, the most popular service on the Internet.
The announcements are the latest confirmation of a blurring line between consumer networks and Internet service providers, who are racing to create friendlier systems to attract the consumer market.
"All roads are leading to the same place," said Steve Harmon, a media analyst with Paul Kagen Associates of Carmel, Calif. Mr. Harmon said that by making five major acquisitions in the last six months, America Online appeared to believe that it was easier to buy access into the Internet than to risk developing services and technologies on its own.
America Online's main rivals, Compuserve Inc. and the Prodigy Services Company, disclosed their separate Internet service plans last year. But America Online, which has grown rapidly through aggressive marketing and by offering customers easy access to the on-line world, appears to have found a kindred spirit in the Internet world in the form of Global Network Navigator.
G.N.N. was the first major electronic publishing site on the Internet's World Wide Web, offering more than a dozen "magazines," or subject areas, ranging from personal finance information to offbeat travel news. It organizes and catalogues the information for its readers in an easily navigated system.
"G.N.N. is one of the strongest searching and directory companies in the world of the Web," said Adam Schoenfeld, vice president of Jupiter Communications Inc. of New York. He noted that G.N.N. recorded more than 2 million "hits," or requests for information, from Web users in December. G.N.N. says it has more than 400,000 regular viewers, of whom 180,000 are registered electronic subscribers.
There is currently no extra charge to read information published on the G.N.N. site, and the electronic publications are supported by on-line advertising. Lisa Gansky, who will become vice president and general manager of G.N.N. programming for America Online if the deal goes through, said the site would at least initially remain free and open to all Internet users.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 7.61 A Day After Huge Rally

 BODY:
A day after one of the biggest rallies in its history, the stock market closed up only slightly yesterday, a relief to traders who feared the market might reach a plateau or drop.
Markets often decline the day after a big surge, as potential buyers become more hesitant with higher stock prices. "But today wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination," said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw. 
 After falling more than 27 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.61 points, to a record 4,472.75, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.09 point, to 533.49, also a record.
The Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that dropped sharply last week, continued to recover yesterday. The Nasdaq rose 4.24 points, to 868.82, but was still short of the 879.64 record posted on May 23.
The Dow rose 86.46 points on Wednesday, the biggest one-day point gain in more than three years and, at 1.97 percent, the biggest percentage gain in a year.
As with Wednesday's trading, there seemed to be no particular catalyst for the market's moves. But a report of weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity by the National Association of Purchasing Management, a trade group, continued to reinforce Wall Street's belief in a "soft landing" for the economy. In such a situation, corporate profits rise but inflation remains tame.
And yesterday's Commerce Department report on a drop in factory orders in April seemed to give support to the soft-landing theory.
Traders are certain to watch the May employment data due out this morning, as well as the April index of leading economic indicators, a combination of several indicators said to predict the future course of the economy.
Some traders and analysts contend that three months of declining indicators correlate as much as 90 percent of the time with the onset of a recession. The previous two months have been declines.
Meanwhile, the dollar rose to 84.65 Japanese yen, from 84.54 yen on Wednesday, and fell to 1.4055 German marks from 1.4157.
The value of the dollar is important because as the stock market rally continues, traders wonder whether American investors will continue to pour record amounts of money into mutual funds, which has helped lift stock prices. If the dollar rises, an influx of foreign investors would help insure that the rally continues.
But the declining value of the dollar has so far penalized foreigners when they seek to convert dollar gains back to their native currencies. The Dow has risen 16.65 percent in dollar terms so far this year, but only 5.79 percent in marks and has fallen 0.90 percent in yen.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.29 point, to 286.73, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks, 1,275 to 943. Big Board volume totaled 345.9 million shares, down from Wednesday's 366.2 million shares. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.20 points, to 490.90.
Among advancing stocks was Texas Instruments, an electronics and semiconductor company, which rose 5 3/8, to 121, after an analyst at Soundview Financial raised his 1995 earnings estimate to $11.15 a share from $11. Advanced Semiconductor rose 3 1/4, to 21 7/8, after falling from a 52-week high of 26 1/8 last Tuesday.
Among declining stocks was Cordis, a biotechnology company, which fell 6 1/4, to 62 3/4, after an analyst with Cowen & Company cut his assessment of the company from a "strong buy" to a "buy."
Celestial Seasonings, a tea company, dropped 1 3/8, to 16 1/4, after the company's management said on Wednesday that it expected third-quarter earnings to be below expectations.
The most active stock, at 8.5 million shares, was Ford Motor, which rose 3/4, to 30, after General Motors and Chrysler reported a decline in May auto sales. Ford reports its sales on Monday.

HEADLINE: Big U.S. Retailers Say May Was a 'Pretty Good Month'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The nation's big retailers reported yesterday that they had encouraging sales gains in May, helped by milder weather and shoppers with bigger tax refunds in their pockets than they had a year ago.
But most retail executives and analysts agreed that despite some signs of strength, the monthly figures did not point to a genuine recovery in consumer spending. 
 "It was a pretty good month for the industry as a whole," said Karen M. Hoguet, a senior vice president and treasurer of Federated Department Stores Inc., whose 450 stores include the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains. "But we don't see any major pickup in consumer spending."
Store sales were propped up by better weather in May than for the corresponding month a year ago, when unseasonable cold kept shoppers at home. Weather changes, analysts say, can account for more than half the month-to-month variations in store traffic.
The monthly retail sales may also have benefited from the Government's having paid an unusually high volume of tax refunds in May, later than in most years. The Internal Revenue Service was slow in making repayments to taxpayers this year, and the logjam broke in May, according to David Kelly, an economist for Lehman Brothers in Boston. I.R.S. refunds paid in May were $25.4 billion, up from $17.1 billion in May 1994.
That extra spending money stood in sharp contrast to the period up to April 15. The I.R.S. was slow to send refunds to many Americans and a great many relatively affluent taxpayers faced unexpectedly high tax bills that contributed to a sharp rise in their payments.
It is uncertain how much of the extra money returned to American households last month was quickly spent. "But I'm sure it helped retail sales in May," Mr. Kelly said.
Most retail analysts focused on what the May figures suggested about trends of strength and weakness in the retail industry rather than pointing to broader trends in consumer spending. The Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index, a weighted average of same-store sales of some 60 retailers, increased 3.4 percent.
A strong sector of the business was discount stores, like Wal-Mart and Kmart, whose same-store sales were up 5.4 percent, according to the Goldman Sachs Index. The other healthy performer was the department-store group, like Federated and May Department Stores, whose sales were up 3.1 percent.
The biggest weakness was in specialty apparel stores, like the Gap and the Limited, whose same-store sales dropped 2.6 percent in May. The weakness in the specialty apparel stores, which cater mostly to young women, has been evident for more than a year. Analysts and marketing experts have attributed the problem to a range of causes, from the declining number of women under 35 to a steady trend away from dressing up.
"You talk to 10 different people in the industry and you can get 10 different explanations for the problem in specialty apparel," Daniel Barry, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "But the May figures show that the problem is still there."
There were stores, however, that reported solid gains in the specialty apparel group. Talbots reported that its sales increased 9.6 percent in May over May of last year, while sales at Ann Taylor Stores were up 4.7 percent. "But those two chains get their core group of customers from older women, 35 years old and up," said Richard N. Baum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
Some retailers saw regional trends in the May figures. Federated, for example, has stores in 35 states. Ms. Hoguet, the senior vice president, said that her company was seeing some solid signs of retail strength in the Northeast, especially in New York. She attributed part of the improvement to the apparent success of the company's consolidation, begun in May, as its Abraham & Straus stores were converted to Macy's and Stern's stores.
But, she said, the rest of the pickup was the result of stronger store traffic caused by increased spending in general and foreign tourists taking advantage of the lower value of the dollar to shop for bargains in New York.
Kmart reported that same-store sales at its discount stores increased 5.6 percent in May, compared with a year ago, suggesting that the new management was making progress in improving its performance. Still, Wal-Mart remains well ahead and continues to lengthen its lead, posting a same-store gain of 6.7 percent for the month.
Straining to catch up, Kmart announced yesterday that it would close 72 poorly performing stores this year, eliminating about 5,800 jobs. Last year, the company, based in Troy, Mich., closed or relocated 120 stores, shedding 7,100 jobs.
About 2,200 Kmart and larger Super Kmart Centers remain. To compete with efficient rivals like Wal-Mart, some analysts said further streamlining was needed. "This isn't enough yet," Walter F. Loeb, an independent retail analyst, said. "Kmart has to close another 500 or 600 stores."

Fresh Data Help Treasuries; Short-Term Issues Strongest

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, though the 30-year bond underperformed most other Government issues.
Fresh data raised expectations that the economy was slowing and that inflation remained subdued. Some participants are trading on the belief that a cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve could come as soon as July. 
 Analysts said that was the reason shorter-maturity securities were the market's strongest sector. The Fed controls short-term rates to carry out monetary policy and these issues would benefit by a Fed cut.
Analysts said that over all the weak data released in the morning touched off the rally. But, they added, the market's direction will depend on the May employment report that is scheduled today.
The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond rose 14/32 , to a price of 1132/32 for a yield of 6.61 percent, down from 6.64 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the two-year note dropped 12 basis points, to 5.72 percent, while that of the five-year note dropped 9 basis points, to 5.95 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Among the economic indicators that moved the market were personal income and consumption data, which confirmed that a rebound in the economy could not be ruled out. The concerns were raised on Wednesday by revised figures for the first-quarter gross domestic product. Yesterday's data, along with the G.D.P. revision, caused prices to sag in early trading as investors grew nervous.
Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said traders' concerns about signs of continued consumer strength were offset by signals in the labor market suggesting slower growth ahead. Since the labor figures scheduled for release today are "considered to be the mother of all economic releases," he said, "market participants eventually realized that they couldn't ignore this information."
Market consensus for the May employment number to be released today calls for a gain of 183,000 jobs, Mr. Chan's own estimate is for a gain of 160,000.
Mr. Chan said the broad-based weakness in yesterday's report by the National Association of Purchasing Management for May caused investors to ignore an inflationary signal in the index's price component, which showed prices at the manufacturing level continuing to rise.
A report by the Government showed factory orders fell 1.9 percent in April, but that had been foreshadowed by an earlier report on orders for durable goods. The weakness in the purchasing managers' report was the surprise.
Traders said the market largely ignored the Federal Reserve's mid-quarter survey of loan officers, which found softer consumer demand but rising business demand. "But market participants did receive some encouragement from the report in that they realized that slower consumer-loan growth may help in extinguishing some of the present inflationary pressures in the economy," Mr. Chan said.
Mr. Chan said the credit markets "ended up concentrating on the data which suggested slower growth ahead and thereby ignored all the data such as consumer spending, which suggested firmer economic activity ahead."
Traders even slighted a rise of 1.88 points in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodity prices. Such a gain would normally raise red flags as a possible precursor of inflationary pressures.
"The market," Mr. Chan said, "is gaining solace from the realization that the number of economists predicting a tightening move by the Fed this year are slowly becoming an endangered species."
In the municipal bond market, yields were little changed amid low returns and lingering concern about tax revision that slowed demand for tax-exempt securities.
Traders said investors were concerned that the tax advantage of such securities over other investments could be diminished should significant tax-change measures win passage.

HEADLINE: Survey Points to a Cause of Union Decline

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Once workers organized unions in defiance of management, but now many are often too cowed by management opposition to vote in favor of a union at their workplace, even though they want one, according to a new survey released yesterday.
That finding helps to explain the nationwide decline in union membership, said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist involved in the survey. "People don't want to anger their managers -- management power is simply too great today -- although they feel a need for a greater say over their working conditions," he said. 
 The survey, carried out by Princeton Survey Research Associates, also found that more than 80 percent of American workers favor using independent arbitrators, rather than the courts, to settle disputes with management. Roughly 60 percent of those surveyed said that such an arbitration system would encourage workers to bring more complaints, which then would be settled "more fairly" than in the courts.
But workers want the arbitration system jointly administered by them and managers. Corporate America is increasingly using arbitrators to settle disputes, to sidestep the costs of a lawsuit. In many cases, however, management appoints the arbitrators.
The survey's most noteworthy finding was the growing reluctance of many workers to oppose managers, a finding that other, less thorough surveys have also uncovered. This one, supervised by Mr. Freeman and Joel Rogers, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, was carried out over a five-month period and involved 2,400 people, representative of about 70 million workers in the private sector, most of them below the rank of manager.
The survey's first results, released in December after three months of telephone interviews and focus group discussions in various regions, found that the old willingness of American workers to struggle with management had greatly diminished. Management power in the workplace has become "so great in the United States today that employees see" cooperation with management as necessary.
The second set of findings, released yesterday, examined this new attitude, through follow-up interviews with 800 workers previously interviewed. Some 33 percent of all nonunion workers said they favored union representation, or roughly three times the number of workers who actually belong to unions today in the private sector. But 12 percent of those who support unions would nevertheless vote against one at their workplaces rather than confront an angry management on the issue, the survey found.
Under American labor law, a union is formed at a workplace only if a majority of the workers vote in favor of one in an election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. That 12 percent is "enough to swing most N.L.R.B. elections" against union representation, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Rogers concluded.
"Management opposition is clearly a major reason for the decline of unions in the United States, although not the only reason," Mr. Freeman said, and he listed such other factors as fear among workers of losing their jobs if the company brought in replacements for them or moved a factory to another state or abroad to avoid unionization.

HEADLINE: Max Ratner, 87, Philanthropist and Developer

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Max Ratner, a businessman, philanthropist and the founder of the America-Israel Chamber of Commerce, died on Wednesday at his home in Cleveland. He was 87.
Mr. Ratner, who was born in Bialystok, Poland, emigrated to the United States in 1920 and received a law degree from Cleveland Marshall Law School. He began his career at the Buckeye Material Company, a Cleveland lumber concern, which later became Forest City Enterprises. 
 As the company grew, Mr. Ratner worked as a salesman, buyer and manager and, ultimately, served as president and chairman. Forest City is now primarily a national real estate development company with annual revenues of about $500 million. It has redeveloped urban areas in the United States and constructed the Tower City Center in Cleveland.
In 1986, Forest City and Mr. Ratner's nephew Bruce Ratner formed a joint venture, the Forest City Ratner Companies, that helped transform the Brooklyn skyline. Its projects there included One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights and Metrotech, a large office, commercial and academic complex in downtown Brooklyn.
A long-time supporter of Israel, which he first visited in the year of its independence in 1948, Mr. Ratner was founder and chairman of the America-Israel Chamber of Commerce. He also was active in the State of Israel Bonds organization and participated in many investments in Israel.
Mr. Ratner was a trustee of the Cleveland Museum of Art and a board member of the Greater Cleveland Growth Association. He also had been president of the Park Synagogue in Cleveland. Mr. Ratner and his wife, Betty, donated works to the Jewish Museum in New York.
Mr. Ratner is survived by his wife; his sons, Charles, Mark, James and Ronald; his sister, Fannye Shafran, and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Day After Intervention, Dollar Resumes Its Slide Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the mark yesterday, hurt by a decision to leave German interest rates unchanged and by a flurry of data that showed the United States economy was slowing faster than currency traders had anticipated.
The retreat followed Wednesday's broad intervention in foreign-exchange markets by the central banks of the United States and a dozen other nations, which bought billions of dollars in an effort to halt the currency's renewed slide. The coordinated effort stopped the slump for a day, and the dollar bounced back against the mark and the Japanese yen. 
 Still, many traders saw an opportunity yesterday to sell the dollar, reasoning it was warranted by evidence of weakness in the American economy. "The economic numbers showed the economy may be heading toward a hard landing," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York. "The central-bank intervention yesterday could not help too much today."
The dollar was also weighed down by the Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates unchanged. Many currency dealers had reckoned that the Germans would cut rates as a gesture of support for a stronger dollar. Lower rates in Germany would tend to diminish demand for marks, weakening the mark against the dollar.
"There was a bit of disappointment in the market that there was not any follow-through to the intervention," said Peggy Reed, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York. "The lack of movement by the Bundesbank made the market nervous and sent the dollar down."
In European trading yesterday, the dollar rose as high as 1.4371 marks, its highest level since May 25. But it fell steadily in New York, settling at 1.4055 marks, down from 1.4157 on Wednesday. It edged up to 84.65 yen from 84.54.
The dollar came under pressure early in the day after a series of weak Government reports on personal income and spending, and on factory orders. In addition, a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed a sharper decline than expected in manufacturing.
Recent weak economic figures have prompted concern that the economy is slowing to a point where the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to cut interest rates to pre-empt a recession. Lower rates make dollar-denominated holdings less attractive.

Copper Price at Six-Week High After a Decline in Stockpiles

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper rose to its highest price in six weeks yesterday on the Commodity Exchange after a drop in stockpiles indicated that demand from industry had not faded as the economy slowed.
On other commodity markets, gasoline prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities gained 1.88 points, to 234.60. 
 On Wednesday, the Commodity Exchange said that its warehouse inventories of copper fell by 1,217 tons, to 7,034 tons, the lowest since April 14, when stockpiles slid to a five-year low. Stockpiles have dropped by 3,588 tons, or 33 percent, during the last eight trading days.
"The stockpile levels keep coming down and it makes people nervous," said Tommy Laman, manager of copper marketing for the Commercial Metals Company in Dallas. "We don't see a lot of scrap metal out there and there's apparently not a lot of refined metal either."
The copper inventory decline comes even though economic reports show industrial consumption is weakening. Factory orders, a key barometer of copper demand, posted their third monthly decline in April, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Copper for July delivery rose 2.5 cents, to $1.335 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange, its highest price since April 19. Copper prices have risen 9.2 percent since reaching a six-month low on May 4.
Traders will be looking for today's inventory report from the London Metal Exchange to see whether global inventories are falling as well.
Gasoline prices fell below 60 cents a gallon for the first time in seven weeks as rising production and inventories eased concerns that refiners could not keep pace with demand this summer.
After the market closed on Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that American gasoline inventories rose 1.25 million barrels last week to 209.5 million barrels. The rise came as refiners in the United States increased gasoline output 1.6 percent, to 7.86 million barrels a day, the highest rate since mid-December.
"I don't think there is any concern about making enough gasoline to meet demand," said Leonard Camporeale, manager of refined-product risk and trading at Total Petroleum Inc. in Denver.
Unleaded gasoline for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.26 cent, to 59.78 cents a gallon, the lowest price for the contract closest to delivery since April 4. July crude oil rose 1 cent, to $18.90 a barrel.

Brodeur Shuts Out Tension to Shut Out the Opponent

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., June 1

 BODY:
Five pucks were lined up a few feet in front of Martin Brodeur's goal crease after many of the New Jersey Devils had left the ice. Just before the end of practice, Jacques Caron, the team's goaltending coach, was happily supervising a nightmare.
A teammate of Brodeur's would shoot a puck from in close, again and again. Brodeur faced backhands, wrist shots and jabs at rebounds, separated only by the time required for the shooter to pivot, reach back for another puck, and start again. The goaltender would drop to his knees or lean on his side, and when a puck would enter the net, a high-pitched shout would come from within his red, white and black mask. 
 As the Devils and the Philadelphia Flyers develop the strategies for the Eastern Conference finals that begin Saturday night at the Spectrum, the purpose of the drill was simple: To remind one of the most influential players in the playoffs of the days, all those years ago, when he was a child.
"Sometimes it's just good for him to feel the joy of the game," Caron said. "He tells me he plays his best when he feels like he's playing road hockey."
In a season shortened by a labor conflict, with his own contractual situation no clearer now than it was months ago, Brodeur has managed to operate as efficiently as he did when the game was played on Montreal asphalt and the stakes were not nearly so high.
His goals-against average of 1.25 and save percentage of .952 led the league after the second round of playoffs. Brodeur's three shutouts in the opening-round series against Boston marked the fifth time that a goaltender has had that many shutouts in a four-of-seven-game series and the first time the feat was completed in as few as five games. His current goals-against average is the best by any regular goaltender in the history of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Brodeur's economy of movement and a rare sense of poise for a 23-year-old in his second full National Hockey League season have provided an ideal match for New Jersey's careful defensive approach.
The expectations were heightened a year after Brodeur won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year and allowed an average of 1.95 goals in the playoffs. This year, in an inconsistent Devil season, it was Brodeur's decision to return to basics that helped return him to a central role in the semifinals for a second consecutive year.
"When I go out there, it's a different world," Brodeur said. "I don't feel you've got to be nervous to be able to perform. That's one thing I try to do. Don't put extra pressure out there. Sometimes I'm nervous. It probably doesn't show. I've got my mask on. I can do whatever I want.
"Every time I go out there, and you hear the music going and the fans going crazy, I say to myself, 'It doesn't get better than that.' Nobody can buy that. If you're not a hockey player or a sport person, it's hard to live that experience."
Brodeur is old enough to be the subject of an extended and so far unresolved negotiation that could eventually multiply his current salary of $140,000 by an additional zero. An arbitrator is expected to award the maximum of $850,000 for this season. He could become a free agent after the season, but the Devils would be able to match any offer.
But he is young enough that nine years ago, when Patrick Roy led Montreal to a Stanley Cup as a rookie, Brodeur was a teen-aged fan at the victory parade. Even now, in his old room at the home of his parents, the pictures on the wall include one of Ron Hextall, who will be in the Flyer goal.
When Brodeur was 15, Hextall was the Conn Smythe Winner, the most valuable player of the playoffs in a losing cause, at the end of a memorable rookie season. "When he came in the league, it was such a big change from other goalies," Brodeur said. "It was so different. I think that's what I liked about him. He was so different."
So Brodeur became the opposite. Hextall's passionate energy is clear from the last row. Brodeur, a professional conformist, can be so subtly efficient that his success has been attributed more to New Jersey's neutral zone trap than his own ability.
"I think one goes with the other," said Jacques Lemaire, the New Jersey coach. "You have to rely on the goalie if your team loses control in a certain part of the game. They attack. They attack. What's going on? Before you get your team back on the track, you need the goalie to help the team stay there. And when the team is going well and there's nothing much to do, it helps the goalie."
Caron, in his second season with the Devils, has seen improvement in Brodeur's awareness, especially his ability to anticipate plays around the net. "He is positioning himself well," Caron said. "He doesn't run around. He places himself early. This is the secret of a goaltender. If you place yourself on a proper angle early, then the second angle is easier to get. He sets himself and he just goes to what the play develops, and he's there again."
From the start of last season's playoff success, Brodeur listened to the comparisons with Roy and smiled. "He did it all the way," Brodeur says now. "I did it halfway, so far."
He listens to the talk about his accomplishments, and he answers with the work that remains to be done. "One thing I want to be able to do," Brodeur said, "is after my career, that they'll be able to say, 'This kid's going to have a career like Martin Brodeur.' "

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Mexico's Garage Sale;
In a Third Round of Privatization, Will a Nation Learn From Mistakes?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: COATZACOALCOS, Mexico

 BODY:
Under pressure from the United States and other creditors to cut spending and raise cash, Mexico is planning a garage sale. The idea is to unload Government-owned enterprises, from airports and communications satellites to the entire Mexican railroad system, including a creaky line that chug-chugs from this city on the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Coast at a seat-numbing speed of 12.5 miles an hour.
The sale will be Mexico's third big round of privatization since the mid-1980's. It is being watched closely here and in the United States -- from which many buyers will presumably come -- to see if it will be managed better than the earlier ones that were nonetheless able to raise more than $22 billion. In those sales the Government, in its zeal to get top dollar to meet its needs, accepted bids that were not always the best deal for the businesses being sold or for their customers. And it failed to adequately regulate the newly privatized businesses to protect those customers and promote competition. 
 For example, when Mexico sold 18 commercial banks beginning in 1991, it prohibited bids from foreign banks in favor of bids from Mexican investors, even though few of the local investors had banking experience.
Keeping out foreign banks and limiting the number of new banks effectively reduced competition in the market, making it more attractive to the local bidders and therefore driving up bids. The Government also failed to make sure that local bidders had sufficient reserves to operate the banks in case of losses. A result was that many banks could not respond adequately to the financial crisis that began in December.
Or consider the telephone system. A state-run monopoly, it was simply turned over to a privately owned monopoly that has done little to improve Mexico's laughably unreliable service. Or, take the Government's two airlines, Mexicana and Aeromexico. They were sold to groups whose managers had little experience and insufficient capital, and within a few years were again on the brink of bankruptcy.
Privatization, Mexico has learned, is not a cure-all. To make a deal succeed, a growing number of experts say, a government must consider not only the price but the system being created. That means looking at the experience and financial strength of the bidder, insuring competition and a commitment to service. And doing so may mean accepting a lower price.
Many people worry that the Mexican Government may repeat earlier mistakes in the coming round. "There's a bit of a naive view of privatization that says just give the properties to private owners and that's enough," said a senior Government official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "It's naive but it's pretty effective. And the pressure for that kind of thing to continue is very strong."
The sale of the railroads will provide an interesting study of whether the Government can balance a need to raise cash with a desire to improve an important industry.
But if Mexico sells the railroads in the same way it sold the telephone company, for example, the Government would give the whole system to a single bidder without expertise and thus create a privately owned monopoly no more efficient than the one the state has run so poorly for decades.
Some officials, as well as some potential bidders, want things to change. Under their approach, Mexico's railroads would be carefully split into competing systems. Qualifications of bidders would be scrutinized. And important questions about setting rates, cutting payrolls and dealing with unprofitable passenger routes would be addressed before bids were accepted.
So for many such reasons, the sale will not be easy. The Government's chances are not helped by Mexico being under even more pressure to raise money -- and to do so quickly -- than during the earlier rounds of privatization. In exchange for a $50 billion bailout package from the United States, the International Monetary Fund and other nations and organizations in March, Mexico agreed to raise $12 billion to $14 billion by selling money-losing state enterprises. Some say the United States Treasury demanded the sales to appease members of Congress who said that Mexico was getting a free ride.
President Ernesto Zedillo wants to show that he is committed to complying with the conditions. He also wants to demonstrate that despite the economic horrors that followed December's peso devaluation, Mexico remains on a modernization path.
The coming sales are also far more complex than earlier ones, because they require substantive changes in the law -- in some cases, the Constitution of Mexico. Railroads, for example, were considered strategic resources until the Constitution was changed a few weeks ago. Lawmakers also found that oil and natural gas were still strategic, but that natural-gas distribution was not and therefore could be sold to investors.
Then there are the emotional hurdles. Historically, the railroads are linked in many Mexicans' minds with Pancho Villa, hero of the Mexican Revolution who crisscrossed the country by train as he led the overthrow of a dictator. When it comes to nationalized property, perhaps only the oil monopoly Pemex raises more passion than the railroads.
On the surface, buying into the railways seems a good opportunity. Given the condition of the trains, the asking price, which has not been specified, is likely to be low. For another, the railroad offers land access to the United States, the biggest consumer market in the world. On top of all that, the cheaper peso is helping Mexican exports surge.
Kick the tires, however, and a wheel might fall off. Most of the country's 16,000 miles of rail werelaid under the Government of Porfirio Diaz, before he was ousted as President in the revolution of 1910.
Mexico has since spent little on the railways, and the equipment is horribly outdated. The work force of about 50,000 is three times more than necessary, by American standards, and a nearly equal number of retirees draw costly pensions. A Government official says some retirees use schemes to milk the system. One of the most creative, he said, is for aging railroaders to divorce their wives and marry younger women, who support the older women and keep collecting pension income long after the retiree has died.
The railroads now carry less than 15 percent of all general cargo in the country, and less than 2 percent of travelers. One Mexican shipper, the official said, prefers to bring containers from Asia to Long Beach, Calif., ship them by American railroads to Laredo, Tex., and then bring them into Mexico by truck rather than through the port of Lazaro Cardenas, on the Pacific in the southern state of Michoacan.
And many international investors, appalled by the poor condition of the railroads and some other Government properties, doubt that Mexico will realize as much as it expects from the sales in the current time frame of two to three years.
The Government is studying several options. One would give a 50-year concession for the entire rail system to one owner. Another would split the system into four regional and competing private systems. A third would break the system into even smaller pieces.
Based on Mexico's earlier experience with privatization, selling the entire system to a single bidder would probably bring in the most money. But it would probably do the least to improve service. Splitting the system into several parts would generate less money but would, according to some experts, do the most to create a more modern system.
Mexico's Minister of Transportation and Communications, Carlos Ruiz Sacristan, says the Coatzacoalcos line (pronounced kwahts-ah-KWAHL-kose), which crosses the narrowest part of the country, is the crown jewel of the privatization effort. It runs across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, from Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf of Mexico, to Salina Cruz on the Pacific. He intends to wrap the line with the shipping ports at either end and offer them in a kind of three-for-one special with the notion of eventually competing with the Panama Canal.
That was essentially how the line started nearly 100 years ago, but the idea never caught on. For one thing, it has only a single set of tracks, so one train has to pull onto a siding so another heading in the opposite direction can pass. The line also twists around mountains and through the streets of the city of Tehuantepec.
Given the trains' sorry condition, it is a wonder they can make the 150 miles in even the 12 hours required. At that rate, a train would take 10 days to cross the United States instead of less than 4. And rates for freight and passengers do not come close to covering costs.
Several large American railroads have expressed interest in Mexican railroads, but their attention is on the better-used northern lines that run from Mexico City to the United States border and serve a number of automobile-assembly plants. Some European companies are also expected to bid.
Robert G. Thruston, managing director of Southern Pacific Lines' Mexico group, said two important issues must be settled before his company would decide to bid: whether the Government would give a new owner the freedom to reduce the work force and tighten the retirement system, and whether it would require that passenger service be preserved.
Officials said they were considering a buyout to reduce the number of workers, and an overhaul of the social security system to include railroad retirees. As for passenger service, the Government is studying a plan to use subsidized buses in place of money-losing lines.
The Union Pacific is also interested in investing in Mexican railroads, including the better-used south-to-north lines from Mexico City to Laredo and El Paso. It has already formed an alliance with a big Mexican construction and engineering company, ICA.
John Rebensdorf, vice president for strategic planning at Union Pacific in Omaha, said he had been concerned about whether Mexico would repeat past mistakes in these privatizations. "We've had some concerns," he said, "but from all the indications of the way the Government and the railroad itself are going about it, we think they're putting a pretty solid process in place."

VW Chairman Predicts A Tough 1995-96

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Volkswagen chairman, Ferdinand Piech, braced stockholders yesterday to expect lackluster performance in new-car sales this year and next. Mr. Piech provided no profit forecast in his pessimistic report to 3,000 shareholders in Hamburg, Germany, but warned that for all of 1995 they can expect only "a slight increase in the number of cars sold and the number produced." He predicted a "somewhat better demand for autos in 1996." 
 Deliveries of new cars to customers in North America dropped in the first five months of this year, compared with the corresponding period in 1994, Mr. Piech said. The fall was attributed to Mexico's economic crisis and a slowdown in United States economic growth, he said. New-car sales also declined in Germany and the rest of Western Europe.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Declines in New York, but Little Growth Is Seen

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Despite a decline in the state's unemployment rate last month, the economic outlook for New York remains gloomy, Labor Department officials said yesterday.
 The unemployment rate in New York declined to 6.3 percent in May, from 6.8 percent in April and 6.5 percent a year earlier, still laggging behind the national rate, which dipped to 5.7 percent in May from 5.8 percent in April. 
 In New York City, the unemployment rate in May was 8.2 percent, down from 8.6 percent in April and 8.4 percent a year earlier.
 Still, there was little or no economic growth in the state or the city, Labor Department officials said. The recovery that has lifted regional economies elsewhere in the country continues to skip New York.
 "New York is near or at the very bottom in terms of job performance," said Anthony J. Ferrara, acting regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "As a result," he said, "I don't see much significance in the drop in the unemployment rate." One reason, he said, was that the labor force in the city continued to shrink, causing the rate of unemployment to shrink with it.
 "There's no job growth," he said.
 For example, while the nation showed a 2.8 percent increase in available jobs last month, New York's measurement of employment growth was a skimpy five-tenths of 1 percent.
 New Jersey, one of the few states in the Northeast to keep pace with the national recovery, continued to show signs of economic weakness that appeared two months ago. The state's unemployment rate increased slightly last month, to 6.5 percent, from 6.3 percent in April and 5.8 percent in March.
 "We could see a negative trend developing in New Jersey," Mr. Ferrara said. For example, he said a 2.2 percent increase in jobs in April declined to 1.8 percent in May.
 May figures were not available in Connecticut. It is not among the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases the national jobs data each month. But the Connecticut Department of Labor said the rate of unemployment for April was 5.1 percent, down from 5.3 percent in March and 5.8 percent in February.
 Nationally, widespread layoffs in manufacturing and construction caused the sharpest drop in business payrolls in four years, generating new concern over a possible recession.
 But Mr. Ferrara said New York was relatively insulated from the stall in the national recovery because its biggest economic sectors are in finance, real estate and insurance, three businesses that had already suffered large retrenchments.
 A most recent concern, he said, was the continuing reductions of jobs in the health care sector, which accounts for about 10 percent of New York's economy.

AGREEMENT REACHED ON A STATE BUDGET
Sixty-three days after the start of the fiscal year, Governor Pataki and the state's legislative leaders concluded their tortuous negotiations and declared a final agreement on a state budget that, by at least one key measure, will reduce state spending for the first time in a generation. The budget will also cut income and business taxes and impose modest new restrictions on welfare recipients. The finished product reflects a drastic reversal of New York's fiscal traditions. [Page 1.]
 
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, called for the first tax increase in four years, proposing to raise property taxes on some houses used as rental properties. [25.]
 
The budget agreement just completed by Governor Pataki and the Legislature should leave its mark on virtually every resident of the state. [24.]
 
After more than two months of silence and secrecy, the first real evidence of a state budget was plopped down on legislators' desks yesterday afternoon. As the voting started, few even looked at the packages. [24.]

Mrs. Solarz had pleaded guilty in April to two criminal charges. [25.]
 
CIRCLING WARILY OVER A CAROUSEL
Perhaps fittingly, they have been going around in circles for months: the Parks Department, the Central Park Conservancy and the concessionaire who runs the park's landmark carousel, whose charging wooden steeds have been chasing one another around the wheezing band organ for decades. The concessionaire, Salvatore Napolitano, fears that for the first time in his longtime association with the carousel, it may go round without him. [23.]

His wife, Deanne, urged him to try. [22.]

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: IN BELGRADE;
Milosevic Stiffens in Talks With U.S. Envoy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 2

 BODY:
The President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, insisted today on new concessions before he will sign an accord committing him to step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.
An American envoy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure, met again today with President Milosevic to offer a deal to lift the crippling United Nations sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. In exchange, Mr. Milosevic would have to recognize the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, condemn the hostage-taking by the Bosnian Serbs, and take further steps to seal the border across which the Bosnian Serbs are smuggling supplies. 
 The day's talks took place before the announcement tonight that Mr. Milosevic had served as an intermediary in the release of 120 United Nations peacekeepers held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs.
One diplomat monitoring the talks said the release of the hostages was likely to stiffen Mr. Milosevic's bargaining stance.
The release of the hostages "is Milosevic showing his stuff," the diplomat said. "He's saying that he can get something done, that he does have some influence over the Bosnian Serbs. Certainly he would think of that as something that might strengthen his position in the talks with Frasure.
"It's a good sign, but the obvious response is that there are still 200 or so hostages still in the hands of the Bosnian Serbs," the diplomat added. "Even if there are just two, it's not an acceptable situation."
Officials close to the talks are cautious about predicting any deal. They say Mr. Milosevic seems to feel strengthened by the hostage-takings because they add pressure on the outside world to reach an accord. Mr. Milosevic evidently senses the desire among Western nations for a deal, and is trying to extract the best possible bargain.
According to diplomats in Belgrade, President Milosevic is seeking a permanent lifting of the sanctions rather than the 200-day suspension that Mr. Frasure has offered. He wants the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to be responsible for deciding if Yugoslavia is meeting its commitments under any future accord, not the Security Council as Mr. Frasure has proposed.
Mr. Milosevic also wants a commitment that after the sanctions are lifted, Yugoslavia will have access to foreign credit. Mr. Frasure is believed to be offering credits, but only if the European Union agrees on providing them.
Finally, Mr. Milosevic is said to be insisting that Yugoslavia be allowed to import as much oil and petroleum as he deems necessary. Western governments are willing to give him access to fuel for factories and civilian vehicles, but are wary of providing a blank check for fear that some fuel may be used for military purposes.
Mr. Milosevic has been seeking relief from the United Nations sanctions since they were imposed three years ago, and has recently been told by his economic advisers that the sanctions could soon spark another round of hyper-inflation like the one that plagued the country in 1993.
Some experts here have predicted that an accord may be only hours away. Mr. Milosevic, they note, has often made major policy announcements on weekends in the belief that doing so minimizes the possibility of sudden adverse reactions from the public.
The government-controlled press, moreover, seems to be preparing people here for some kind of deal. Whereas in the past it was used to whip up sympathy for the plight of the Serbs in battle zones, the press has in recent weeks largely ignored their ordeals.
After the recent Serbian defeat in western Slavonia, for example, no pictures of destroyed Serbian homes or sobbing refugees were broadcast here. And when NATO planes bombed Bosnian Serb arms depots last week, the principal television station led its evening newscasts with a report on murals prepared for the planned Belgrade subway system, and mentioned the raids only briefly.
In a series of public statements, officials close to President Milosevic have taken an increasingly hard line against the Bosnian Serbs and their leader, Radovan Karadzic. In an interview with a leading German news magazine, Der Spiegel, released in advance of publication Monday, Mr. Milosevic's Foreign Minister, Vladislav Jovanovic, described the hostage-taking by the Bosnian Serbs as "irrational and unacceptable."
"I tell them that they can be paranoid as individuals or allow their families to be destroyed, but they have no right to destroy an entire people," Mr. Jovanovic said. "We are not going to allow a crazy man to prevent a clever man from arranging his international relations."

HEADLINE: ALBANY'S BUDGET: PROPERTY TAXES;
Vallone Urges Raising Taxes on Homes

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
With New York City receiving less financial help than expected from Albany, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone called yesterday for the first tax increase in four years, proposing to raise property taxes for owners of one- to three-family houses used solely as rental properties.
 Mr. Vallone, Democrat of Queens, said the increase would raise $80 million a year. That money, he said, could avert some of what he called the most "destructive consequences" of the budget cuts proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and, possibly, lower property taxes for owners of cooperatives and condominiums. 
 The proposed increase would be limited to people who are drawing incomes from houses that they own but do not live in -- 100,000 of the 600,000 one- to three-family houses in the city.
 The proposal nonetheless represents a significant shift for Mr. Vallone, a staunch defender of middle-class homeowners who has held virtually sacrosanct their relatively low tax rate.
 For the affected homeowners the effective tax rate would rise 47 percent. The owner of an average house with an assessed value of $160,000 would pay $1,840 a year at a rate of 1.15 percent, compared with $1,248 now, at just under eight-tenths of 1 percent.
 The Mayor swiftly rejected the proposal, calling it a "mistake for the economy of the city."
 "I can't see my supporting it," Mr. Giuliani said. "This is an attempt to raise taxes in order to spend more money."
 Aides to Mr. Vallone said he would press ahead despite the Mayor's response.
 The Speaker said the decision to seek the tax increase reflected a realization that the state government would provide far less assistance than Mr. Giuliani had hoped for when he proposed a $31.1 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 The state budget that Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders agreed to yesterday appeared to leave the city with at least $400 million less than the Mayor had hoped for.
 Mr. Giuliani had called for $950 million in new aid and savings from state cuts in Medicaid and welfare, as well as an added $106 million in aid for schools and foster care.
 That leaves a yawning gap in the Mayor's efforts to balance the city's budget. The Mayor's budget called for a $1.1 billion reduction in total spending, or 3.4 percent, and would gain concessions from the municipal unions and cut spending in ways affecting virtually every New Yorker.
 Mr. Giuliani, appearing in the Blue Room at City Hall after the accord on the state budget had been announced, said it was too soon to say exactly how he had fared in Albany. He has threatened to impose $400 million in service cuts on top of those already in his budget if the state figures fall short.
 But in recent days he has softened that warning, and the Council has pledged to resist those additional cuts, which would fall heavily on libraries, museums and day-care centers.
 At a news conference, Mr. Vallone said, "It certainly is time for the City of New York to take very seriously, both the Council and the Mayor, the devastating impact of many of the cuts that might have to take place unless we come up with some other ideas."
 He announced his proposal as the Council prepares to negotiate with the Mayor over his proposed budget, and the move appears to underscore a sense of urgency that many Democratic Council members feel, that the city's fiscal picture is becoming increasingly dire.
 In fact, the proposed tax increase is creating the sharpest division between the Council and the Mayor over the budget.
 Until yesterday, the Council, whose ranking leaders represent middle-class homeowning neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, had resisted calling for any tax increase and had supported the Mayor's effort to cut business taxes modestly.
 The last tax increase was in 1991. At that time Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Council agreed to raise the property tax $400 million, or more than 5 percent. Part of that sum was allotted to hire 6,000 police officers under the Safe Streets, Safe City program.
 The Speaker's proposal would represent a 1 percent increase in the $8 billion in city property taxes. Still, for Mr. Vallone, it represents a remarkable shift for an elected official who has fiercely resisted any increases for homeowners like those who form the core of his district in Astoria, Queens.
 In proposing the increase, Mr. Vallone portrayed it as a question of fairness. For years owners of one- to three-family houses have paid among the lowest property taxes in the region, thousands a year less than in the suburbs of Long Island or Westchester County.
 Mr. Vallone said the city should begin to equalize the rates for the houses that are known as Class 1 and those for co-ops and condos in Class 2, which are taxed at a rate more than two times that of private houses. Although Mr. Vallone said the increased tax revenue could be used to lower the rate for co-ops and condos, he did not specifically propose a reduction.
 In his preliminary budget, the Mayor proposed a $70 million tax cut for co-ops and condos, but replaced it with cuts for business taxes in his final proposal.
 In recent years, a cross-section of elected officials and advocacy groups for co-op and condo owners has called for balancing the rate. Some of those critics argue that Class 1 owners have been given what amounts to a huge tax break at a time when the city is struggling to balance its budgets.
 Mr. Vallone emphasized that he believed that homeowners should receive a break, but that the benefits should not extend to "absentee landlords."
 "That was not the benefit or the intention of the break," he said.
 Councilman John D. Sabini, Democrat of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, Queens, said he had supported raising the tax rate for people who did not live in the houses that they own, saying they had destabilized neighborhoods like his by renting the properties. "The retirees who move away and the real-estate companies are getting all the benefits of an Ozzie and Harriet tax break," he said.
 The Speaker's proposal would face a vote in the State Legislature, which established the complex system to classify and tax property in the city.
 Mr. Giuliani said even if he supported Mr. Vallone's plan, it would be highly unlikely that the change would be approved in the newly Republican climate in Albany in time to help this year -- or ever.

HEADLINE: Christopher Backs Free Trade With Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: MADRID, June 2

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher praised the idea of establishing a trans-Atlantic free trade area today as he called for closer economic and political ties between Europe and the United States to prevent them from drifting apart now that they no longer face a common cold war enemy.
Responding to European proposals to set up a free trade area linking North America and Europe, Mr. Christopher said the United States would seriously study the proposal, which he said has "considerable potential" to bolster prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 Mr. Christopher outlined a vision for tighter trans-Atlantic ties that would rest on not just security concerns and NATO, but also heightened political and economic cooperation through such measures as increasing coordination in fighting drug trafficking.
State Department officials said Mr. Christopher gave today's address to reassure Europeans who fear that America is turning away from Europe. As evidence, Europeans say American policy makers are focusing on the fast-growing markets of Asia and Latin America, Congress is turning more isolationist and the Pentagon is reducing its forces in Europe.
Mr. Christopher said: "In the absence of a single unifying threat, and at a time of understandable focus on domestic concerns, some argue that the ties that bind us are fraying, and that America and Europe will inevitably drift apart. I reject that view."
Then, echoing something Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, said recently about the trans-Atlantic relationship, he said: "It cannot be sustained by nostalgia. Every generation must renew the partnership by adapting it to meet the challenges of its time."
The Secretary of State suggested that an American-European partnership was vital for leading the world on crucial issues, like extinguishing regional crises and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.
"Our nations, working together, have the unique capacity to provide global leadership," he said. "We must resist the siren songs, heard in so many capitals, of isolation and withdrawal."
For Europeans, Mr. Christopher's speech was an eagerly awaited response to calls for tighter trans-Atlantic ties made in recent speeches by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Union's executive commission.
Sir Leon told the American Club of Brussels a month ago: "There is a widespread perception that the bonds between us are loosening. This must be taken seriously." He added that it was "time to revisit the relationship and adapt it to tomorrow's needs."
In his speech to the Casa de America, a center that promotes better relations between Spain and the Americas, Mr. Christopher called for broadening exchanges for students and legislators and for agreements to liberalize trade in movies, telecommunications equipment and financial services. He proposed more trans-Atlantic work to harmonize product standards and testing. And he proposed heightened cooperation to fight international crime and terrorism, by, for instance, establishing regular meetings of top American and European anti-narcotics officials.
Mr. Christopher said Europe and the United States should cooperate to integrate Turkey into the West and to settle the conflicts in Cyprus and Bosnia, which he said is the single greatest threat to peace in Europe. He also urged that the trans-Atlantic partners work together to expand NATO and aid former Soviet bloc nations in embracing free markets and consolidating democracy.
After attending a NATO ministers meeting in the Netherlands this week, Mr. Christopher came to Madrid to consult with Spanish officials about their plans when they assume the presidency of the 15-nation European Union next month.
Mr. Christopher said his new effort to break down trade barriers with Europe did not detract from Washington's plans to set up a trans-Pacific free trade zone by the year 2020 or complete talks by the year 2005 to create an Americas-wide free trade area.
"Our vision for the economic relationship between Europe and the United States must be no less ambitious," he said.
He laid down some caveats about establishing a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement, an idea that some foreign officials fear will create a new trading bloc that discriminates against outsiders, especially poor nations. Mr. Christopher said any trans-Atlantic trade accord must not undermine global trade liberalization and must not disadvantage less developed nations.
President Clinton is scheduled to discuss establishing a common agenda with Europe in a meeting on June 14 with Jacques Santer, the president of the European Union's executive commission, and President Jacques Chirac of France, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency.
"We must not take this relationship for granted," Mr. Christopher said. "It is our responsibility to build the partnership that will ensure that, by working together, our next 50 years will be as great as the last."

HEADLINE: PAYROLLS TRIMMED BY 101,000 IN MAY, THE MOST SINCE '91

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
In the most sobering evidence so far of the economy's abrupt slowdown, employers lopped 101,000 workers from payrolls in May, the biggest monthly decline since the end of the last recession in the spring of 1991, the Labor Department reported today.
At the same time, the Government index intended to forecast the economy posted in April its third straight decline, a development often interpreted as pointing to a recession six to nine months ahead. 
 Despite this grim convergence of reports, most private forecasters -- along with the Clinton Administration -- continued to maintain that the economic slowdown would probably stop short of an actual recession. In response to the unexpectedly bleak Government data, interest rates fell sharply while the stock market fluctuated wildly -- falling, then soaring, before falling again to end the day generally down. [Page 31.]
"The economy has obviously decelerated more sharply than we anticipated," said Paul W. Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore investment firm. "But it just doesn't seem to have the earmarks of a recession in the making."
Today's news, and the markets' reactions, led several analysts to predict that the Federal Reserve might soon agree to an official cut in short-term interest rates, perhaps as early as the next meeting of its policy-making group, right after the Fourth of July. But Fed officials have been strikingly upbeat recently in the face of other dour indicators, suggesting that they may not act unless there is even more evidence that the bottom is falling out of the economy. [Page 31.]
Pressure is building on the Fed on several fronts. Specialists noted that rates on some shorter-term Treasury securities had already moved well below the overnight lending rate among banks, which the Fed effectively controls.
"I've rarely seen the Fed this far behind the market," said Leif H. Olsen, a former chief economist at Citibank who now heads a Connecticut investment firm bearing his name.
The direction of interest rates, of course, has broad implications, not only for the markets but for businesses, borrowers and consumers at large. One Midwest bank even cut its prime lending rate today, but others did not follow its lead.
Today's reports also brought what were seen by some as the first hints that the Administration might seek to blame the Federal Reserve and its yearlong series of interest rate increases if the economy falls into recession. Administration officials have supported the Fed in its money-tightening efforts to pre-empt inflation, but they now appear worried that a result could be an economy stagnating, or worse, at the start of President Clinton's re-election campaign.
"The current slowing of the economy is in part the result of the rise in interest rates in 1994, which affected the interest-sensitive sectors such as durable goods and housing," the two current members of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Joseph E. Stiglitz and Martin N. Baily, said in a statement.
But they maintained that the worst might soon be over. "Since longer-term interest rates have declined substantially since the fall of last year," the White House economists said, "we expect that growth in the interest-sensitive sectors will resume in the second half."
A recession anytime soon would also severely jeopardize the reappointment of Alan Greenspan, whose term as chairman of the Federal Reserve expires in March.
Despite the generally unpleasant message of the job-market report for May, it did show that the unemployment rate inched down to 5.7 percent after jumping three-tenths of a point in April, to 5.8 percent.
This was largely a quirk, analysts said, reflecting a record 926,000 plunge in the labor force. Millions of students and teachers had left the classroom but had not yet begun to look for summer work. Although the figures are adjusted for such seasonal swings, the process seems to have failed to keep up with the trend toward earlier school closings.
Far overshadowing this bit of superficial cheer was the big drop in payroll jobs. Analysts had expected a modest-enough rise of 175,000, and many economists had also thought the May data would be accompanied by a sizable upward revision for April. Instead, payrolls shrank by 101,000 last month and the initial 9,000 decline reported for April improved only to a decline of 7,000.
Employment also skidded in the Labor Department's household survey, dropping by 753,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, but without raising the unemployment rate because the official size of the work force -- people with jobs or actively searching for them -- shrank so much.
Among the most populous states, the jobless rate jumped in California to 8.5 percent from 7.9 percent, leaving that state with the nation's highest unemployment. By contrast, unemployment fell by half a percentage point in New York, to 6.3 percent, and was essentially unchanged in Texas at 6 percent. But those state-by-state figures are subject to even greater vagaries than the national data.
The payroll tally showed greater declines in manufacturing and construction than in previous months, with factories losing 56,000 jobs across nearly all industries, and construction jobs down 57,000. Heavy rains and flooding in the South added to the toll on construction.
The apparel industry continued to shed jobs, losing 7,000 more last month to bring the 12-month total to 41,000, the report also showed.
Just as worrisome, some analysts said, was tepid growth in the once-robust services sector. A 60,000 gain in jobs brought the two-month total to just 95,000.
Just as employers snapped up temporary workers all last year to meet heavy demand for their products and services, they appear to have moved quickly to shed them as the economy has cooled.
Reflecting lower demand, the private-sector workweek contracted 18 minutes, to 34.3 hours, in May, while the factory workweek was unchanged and factory overtime fell, by 12 minutes, for the fourth month in a row.
Average hourly earnings, meanwhile, eased 2 cents after rising 6 cents in April. Average weekly earnings declined 1 percent to cut the 12-month advance to just 1.5 percent.
"There's absolutely no sign of wage-push inflation," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview.
The average weekly hours worked dropped to 34.3 from 34.6, and overtime fell back to 4.3 hours, from 4.5, suggesting that factories were cutting back as they sought to shrink excess inventories.
The household tabulation showed a decline of four-tenths of a point in the jobless rate for adult women, while blacks were doing unusually well in job-market competition.
The black unemployment rate, which eased eight-tenths of a point, to 9.9 percent, was below the Hispanic rate, which climbed to 10 percent, for the first time in the two decades that such statistics have been kept. Moreover, the black rate was less than twice the white rate, unchanged at 5 percent, for the first time one department official could remember.
Geographically, the jobless rate eased in the Midwest by three-tenths of a point, to 4.6 percent; by two-tenths of a point in the Northeast, to 5.9 percent, and by one-tenth of a point, to 5.4 percent, in the South. But unemployment rose three-tenths of a point in the West, to 7.1 percent, heavily influenced by the rise in California.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the index of leading economic indicators fell six-tenths of a percent in April, the third consecutive decline for the forward-looking gauge. Eight of its 11 components moved lower.
Historically, three consecutive declines in the index signal a recession. While the index has accurately predicted all nine of the country's postwar recessions, it posted three or more consecutive declines on five other occasions when no recession followed.

Economy Hits the Brakes As Payrolls Drop Sharply
Stark evidence of a rapidly slowing economy came in a report that employers dropped 101,000 workers from their payrolls in May, the worst decline since the spring of 1991 -- the end of the latest recession. The grim icing: the Government's leading indicators posted their third straight decline, which is often taken as a sign that recession lurks in six to nine months. But most private forecasters -- and the Clinton Administration -- aren't buying it; they insist the slowdown is likely to stop short of actual contraction. The Labor Department report did show that the unemployment rate inched down to 5.7 percent from 5.8, but that was seen as largely a statistical quirk as millions of students and teachers surged out of classrooms but had not started looking for summer work. One thing seems increasingly likely, though: that the Fed will loosen the screws a bit, perhaps by July 6. [Page 1.]
 
New York State's unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent from 6.8, and New York City's dropped to 8.2 from 8.6, but the good news stops there. There was little or no economic growth in the state or the city, the Labor Department said; the recovery that has lifted other regions keeps missing New York. [34.]
 
A Mixed Wall St. Verdict
The stock market gave a split verdict on the whiff of recession in the job numbers. In a volatile end to a volatile week, the Dow industrials lost 28.36, to 4,444.39, as some investors recoiled at the thought of a slowing economy. But others saw a silver lining in the likelihood of a rate cut by the Fed, with high-tech stocks on Nasdaq showing gains. [35.]
 
Treasury securities prices leaped, sending the 30-year bond yield down to 6.53 percent from 6.61. [44.]
 
Favored Trade for China
President Clinton renewed trade privileges for China, despite objections to its human rights record. He acted on the recommendation of Secretary of State Warren Christopher. [3.]
 
Dates Set for Auto Talks
The dates are set for talks between the United States and Japan on access to Japan's auto market: June 12 and 13 in Geneva, then June 20 and 21 in Washington, in the latest compromise. The deadline they're racing against: June 28, when those 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars kick in. [32.]
 
Inquiry Ended on Annuity Sales
The Justice Department's antitrust division dropped an investigation into efforts by the insurance industry to prevent banks from issuing annuities. [33.]
 
Tax Rise for New York City?
A tax increase for New York City -- the first in four years -- was called for by the City Council Speaker, who proposed higher property taxes for owners of one- to three-family homes used solely as rental properties. [25.]
 
Prodigy, Manhattan-Bound
Prodigy is moving its corporate headquarters from White Plains to lower Manhattan, an emerging multimedia mecca, showing that even in the age of e-mail and modems and faxes, the high-tech folks still like to look one another in the eye occasionally. [21.]
 
Younkers: Not for Sale
Younkers is not for sale, the board of the department store chain said, defying shareholder votes solicited by a hostile suitor, Carson Pirie Scott. The board also expanded its membership to reseat Tom Gould, Younkers' chairman, who had been defeated by a Carson-backed candidate. [33.]
 
Ruling on Labatt Bid
John Labatt's American shareholders do not have to be included in Onex's $1.68 billion hostile bid for Labatt, a judge ruled. [33.]
 
The Dollar Is Mixed
The dollar was mixed, rebounding from early losses amid concern that central banks might start buying dollars again, as they did on Wednesday. It was last quoted at 84.32 yen, down from 84.65 yen on Thursday, and was up a fraction against the mark. [41.]
 
Weather Lifts Corn Prices
Corn prices rose sharply as rain and cold weather added further delays to an already late planting schedule. [41.]

HEADLINE: In Japan's Showrooms, Barely;
U.S. Big 3 Find That Dealers Are Hard to Find

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 2

 BODY:
Yutaka Kobayashi's auto showroom in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba switched in November from selling Toyotas to Fords. In the six months since, he has sold 45 vehicles -- what a Toyota dealer typically sells in a month.
 The difficulties that American makers have in selling cars in Japan have been a focus of the bitter trade dispute that prompted the United States to decide it would impose 100 percent import tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars unless an accord with Japan could be reached by June 28. 
 Washington says Japanese auto dealers are restricted from carrying American cars because of their close ties to Japanese car makers. The Japanese respond that auto dealerships are independent businesses and that the reason so few of them carry American cars is that Detroit's products are ill suited to the Japanese market.
 Visits to two dealers that have taken on American cars -- Mr. Kobayashi's dealership and a Nissan dealership in western Tokyo that switched to Fords -- found some truth in each nation's view of the situation.
 American cars generally do not sell that well in Japan, so a dealer taking on an American line can expect two or three years of losses before there is any hope of profit. But even after these dealers make the commitment to carry foreign cars, their ties to Japan's auto makers seem to prevent them from putting their best effort into selling the American vehicles.
 "We are in a way Nissan employees, so it's rather hard to aggressively sell cars that compete against Nissan cars," said Yasutaka Ohata, a manager at Ford Tohnichi in western Tokyo. Ford Tohnichi was set up a year ago by Tokyo Nissan, a huge dealer in which the Nissan Motor Company holds a one-quarter stake. "Emotionally, we still have the feeling that we hope the customers will buy Nissan," Mr. Ohata said.
 One obstacle, for instance, is that both Nissan and the Toyota Motor Corporation pressed the dealers to set up separate showrooms for the Ford Motor Company products rather than sell them alongside Japanese cars. That makes it more costly for dealers to take on a new brand.
 "Toyota has been telling us we cannot mix Toyota cars and Ford cars," said Takashi Makino, general manager of Ford Chiba, which sells Fords but is owned by a huge dealership that sells Toyotas. In showrooms offering both brands, Toyota has been insisting that a wall be built to separate them, he said.
 Another obstacle is that both dealerships are reluctant to sell the smallest, least expensive Ford models, which might have the broadest appeal. Those Ford vehicles are made by the Mazda Motor Corporation, a rival of Toyota and Nissan.
 Yet another problem is that the two dealerships do not have access to the customer records from the days when they sold Toyotas and Nissans. When Ford Tohnichi switched to selling Fords, all records of existing customers were given to other Tokyo Nissan dealers and the salesmen were replaced by an entirely new crew.
 In Japan, dealers often sell cars by visiting their regular customers at their homes. Without the records, Ford Tohnichi and Ford Chiba had to start from scratch, waiting for customers to come to the showroom.
 But if the way the dealers do business presents obstacles, so, too, do the cars themselves. American cars still have a reputation in Japan for poor quality and for being large, expensive and fuel inefficient, the dealers said.
 They say the cars are inferior to Japanese cars in the fit and the finish -- the doors do not close as snugly, for instance -- giving fastidious Japanese consumers the impression that the cars are roughly made.
 "We have to explain the weak points of American cars before they buy, by saying the American view toward cars is different from the Japanese view," Mr. Kobayashi said in his showroom, which was bedecked with American and Japanese flags. They said, however, that customers who had bought Fords had not had major problems.
 Toshio Nakano, the president of Ford Tohnichi, said the biggest problem is that most Fords have steering wheels on the left instead of the right, as Japanese cars do. The exceptions are the Probe, a sporty car that does not have wide appeal, and the made-in-Europe Mondeo. But the Mondeo uses premium gasoline, a drawback in a country where gasoline costs three to four times what it does in the United States, he said.
 Mr. Nakano also said Ford's cars do not have retractable side-view mirrors, which many customers want for parking in tight spaces.
 In full-page advertisements placed in American newspapers, for example, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association asserts, "The Big Three have been ignoring Japan's auto market for years." The ad notes that Detroit does not offer a single "midget" model although 20 percent of the Japanese market is midget cars and that Detroit does not offer any small cars built in the United States although that niche is 60 percent of the market.
 How well Ford Chiba and Ford Tohnichi fare could help determine the number of other Japanese dealers who will sell American cars. "If the dealer selling Fords in Chiba is making money, others will get on the bandwagon," said Hiroshi Okuda, an executive vice president of Toyota. "With this exchange rate, the American cars should look very reasonable and cheap. The Japanese dealers should be jumping at them, but this doesn't seem to be happening."
 Konen Suzuki, the president of Ford Japan, said that it took time for new dealers to turn a profit and that longtime Ford dealers in Japan were making "huge profits."
 Neither Ford Tohnichi nor Ford Chiba is making money yet.
 Ford Tohnichi, which began selling Fords a year ago, has been selling about 15 cars a month, one-third of the number it sold when it was a Nissan outlet. And since there are so few Fords on the road, repair and service work -- a big source of revenue -- is scarce, Mr. Nakano said.
 Still, he said, the profit margin on Fords is higher than on Nissans and he hopes to make a profit in three years. Once that happens, Tokyo Nissan will add new Ford outlets.
 Ford Chiba sales are a little bit behind expectation but have been growing month to month by 20 percent. Toyota has no ownership role in the Katsumata Group, the huge Toyota dealer that set up Ford Chiba. Katsumata is the only Toyota dealer offering Fords so far, and it is thinking of adding Ford outlets.
 In the trade talks, the United States contended that one reason Japanese cars succeeded in America was that American dealers sold Corollas and Accords alongside Chevrolets and Dodges.
 Washington said that the high real estate prices in Japan made it prohibitively expensive for American companies to set up their own dealership networks, so they had to rely on existing Japanese dealers.
 But Japanese officials countered that some European car makers like BMW and Volvo had set up dealer networks in the 1980's and had done fairly well. Also, compared with Detroit's offerings, the European cars tend to be smaller and many more have steering wheels on the right.
 Some 182,000 cars and trucks from Europe were sold in Japan last year, five times the 34,000 imports from the Big Three's American factories. Still, European cars hold less than 3 percent of the vehicle market here.
 Japanese officials also point out that Ford itself generally insists that its cars be sold through showrooms that carry only Fords, so it should not criticize the Japanese. Mr. Suzuki, the president of Ford Japan, said the company preferred exclusive showrooms but was willing to make an exception because requiring separate showrooms made it less economical for Japanese dealers to begin carrying Fords.
 Despite Washington's aggressive posture, only Ford among the Big Three is pushing hard for dual dealerships. Mr. Suzuki said that so far the company had persuaded 17 Japanese dealers, mostly selling Mazdas and Nissans, to sell Fords.
 The General Motors Corporation has been selling almost exclusively through Yanase & Company, a dealership that specializes in foreign cars. This week, officials of G.M.'s Saturn subsidiary said that right-hand-drive versions of various Saturn models would be sold through exclusive dealerships in Japan as soon as 1997. The Chrysler Corporation has been selling Jeeps through some Honda dealers and through Seibu, another dealership that specializes in foreign cars. A spokesman said Chrysler planned to try to recruit Japanese dealers soon.
 A study commissioned by both the United States and Japanese Governments and released last year concluded that until 1980, franchise agreements in Japan prohibited dealers from handling another manufacturer's cars. Through 1990, the franchise agreements of some manufacturers still had a clause requiring advance consultation before a dealer could add another brand.
 While such explicit prohibitions have been removed, the United States contends that there are still close relationships with manufacturers that tie the dealers' hands. In many cases, the manufacturer owns part of the dealer.
 Even Japanese officials acknowledge that a word from the manufacturer can help smooth the way for dealers to add foreign cars.
 It seems clear, for instance, that the Nissan dealers that have started to sell Fords are not acting completely independently.
 "Nissan made the decision, not the dealers," said Atsushi Oi, the director of the automobile division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "I think Nissan can easily convey their intent to dealers to increase carrying of Fords."
 All this raises another concern: If Japanese dealers have such close ties to Japanese manufacturers that it is hard to recruit them, then is it wise for an American auto company to rely on them for sales? Isn't that entrusting sales to a competitor?
 Mr. Suzuki of Ford Japan said he was sure the new dealers would become loyal to Ford in a year or two.

HEADLINE: Detour on Journey to Democracy;
Survivor of Beijing Massacre Arms Himself With Economics

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Wearing a dark suit and sitting in front of a computer screen in a windowless cubicle with financial data stacked on a desk beside him, Li Lu, 29, appeared to be exactly what he is: an ambitious graduate student in business and law at Columbia University working as a summer intern at Allen & Company, a midtown investment firm.
 He'd finished "doing diligence," checking the figures on the sale of Premiere magazine. And now, on Thursday morning, he was awaiting word from his boss about his analysis of a paging company's proposal to raise venture capital. 
 But many in this city are not simply who they appear to be, and few have so dramatic a life cloaked by so conventional a mien as Mr. Li.
 Remarking on the fax machine beside his desk, he noted that the first time he had ever seen one was 1989 in Beijing, where six years ago this weekend he was one of the student leaders of the democracy movement that was crushed in Tiananmen Square.
 The students, he recalled, used their fax to send policy statements to supporters in other cities. In a country where information is controlled by the Government, the fax was a weapon.
 "It was our radio, our T.V.," he said. "When I learned this little machine could do this, I said 'Jesus, we got it.' "
 It was at that moment, perhaps, that Li Lu began consciously negotiating an extraordinary path through history that would transport him from his student dissident life in China, to a harrowing sea crossing to France, conducted by smugglers, and finally to Columbia University, where he arrived barely able to speak English but soaring nonetheless.
 In his mind, his journey continues today, aimed at a return to China, where he hopes to lend his hand eventually in drafting a Chinese constitution. "That would be the dream," he said.
 Though it does not seem so at first, Mr. Li, the young upwardly bound professional in Manhattan, is very much the logical extension of Mr. Li, the Tiananmen Square protester. His theory is that freedom will come to China through the creation of an independent judiciary, which will happen as the Chinese economy grows and the middle class is sizable enough to demand change.
 "It all begins with business," he said. "Through business law, you build an independent judiciary."
 For him, his journey is a path that began before he was born. He is at Columbia, he said, because that is where his grandfather, Zhu Qixian, studied in the 1930's. Zhu, a writer, philosopher and advocate of individual freedom, died in a Chinese prison in 1967, a victim of the Cultural Revolution.
 "I don't know how it happened that he has a grandson who read his books, learned his ideas," Mr. Li said. "But I have always known I wanted to be like him."

 
 
On China's List Of 21 Most Wanted
 This young man pursuing an education in banking, law and technology remains on the Chinese Government's list of 21 most wanted activists. Here, his career path could not be more establishment. Two years ago, his summer job was as a clerk to Judge Pierre N. Leval of United States District Court in Manhattan. Last summer, he was an intern at the law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett.
 This year, he chose Allen & Company for his internship because much of its business involves the communications media. "No dictatorship can be sustained within the context of an information revolution," he said.
 To be a leader of such a movement, he said, "you better be prepared to show people you've been there yourself, that you can back your words with concrete action, that you know what you're talking about."
 Mr. Li said he did not know when he could return to China or whether Deng Xiaoping's imminent death would make that easier.
 In the meantime, he has had something of a hero's welcome from several of New York's elite. Mary Daly, an activist who has organized benefit rock concerts for human rights, introduced him to Sting and Peter Gabriel, the musicians. Jason Epstein, the Random House editor, took him to what Mr. Li now says is the only restaurant he knows in Chinatown. Tomorrow, the anniversary of the massacre, he is scheduled to speak at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights.

 
 
Willingness To Take Hard Route
 He has traveled a jarring distance from the Tiananmen Square hunger strike that he helped organize at age 23 in the weeks before the massacre. As hundreds of Chinese citizens, many of them students, were being killed in the square, he was among the last 3,000 demonstrators to leave, beginning his own harrowing flight to safety.
 At Tiananmen, as can be seen in a new documentary film, "Moving the Mountain," Mr. Li was lean and long-haired, a fiercely hopeful, youthful figure. Today, he is sturdy looking and well groomed, a bespectacled man with a shy demeanor. But he is still fervent.
 Those who know him in this country say that what distinguishes his character is his determination to return to China with tools that he did not have when he left.
 William Theodore deBary, an emeritus professor of East Asian studies, said: "I've been teaching at Columbia since 1948, and I've rarely seen anybody with his willingness to take the hard route. One thing that struck me about him was that he was conscious of the need for some long-term service to society. He wasn't just another escapee exploiting his experiences at Tiananmen Square."
 Mr. Li testified about the massacre in 1990 in Geneva before a United Nations subcommittee on human rights, which issued a resolution rebuking the Chinese Government.
 "He was superb," said a human rights activist who still travels to China and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "There were 400 or 500 people in the room, 42 countries represented, and you could hear a pin drop."
 It was in the late summer of 1989 -- Mr. Li doesn't remember exactly when -- that he arrived in New York, after months of adventures, first in China and Hong Kong,then at sea, transferring from boat to boat, operated by professional smugglers.
 "I don't know who they are, and they didn't want to know me, either," he said.

 
 
Looking for Tofu, And a Thesis
 He spoke no English and for the first two weeks was so discombobulated in New York, he said, that he has no recollection of where he stayed or where he went. He remembers being unable to eat American food and craving tofu.
 "It was the blandest thing I could think of that I was familiar with," he said. "I was throwing up all the time."
 There were many in the human rights community who helped him, he said. He has had Thanksgiving dinner every year since his arrival with Robert L. Bernstein, the former chairman of Random House Inc., who is chairman of Human Rights Watch.
 The thing he wanted most was to go to Columbia, as his grandfather did. Indeed, his first act when he finally arrived there, Mr. Li said, was to go to the library, seek out his grandfather's thesis -- a comparison of the philosophical writings of John Dewey, Confucius and Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- and steal it. "I'll return it someday, but I figured I could take better care of it," he said.
 Columbia, it turned out, was a nourishing home.
 "For Li Lu the human being, not the dissident, a person dropped into the middle of an alien country, it was a good place to land," said Ms. Daly, the human-rights advocate, who gave Mr. Li a place to live, helped him find money for his education and took him to see the Rolling Stones.
 For his part, Mr. Li, who tends to marvel at the turns his life has taken, said: "Rock and roll was a revelation for me."
 Mr. Li was ushered quickly into a language program at Columbia, where, by all accounts, his progress was remarkable.

 
 
Striking Perspective On Adam Smith
 "My first impression was that he wouldn't survive," said Ruth Levenson, then the assistant provost, who is now retired. "He was all bone. He didn't have much vocabulary. My role was to keep his nose to the grindstone, and in less than a year, he moved into college level courses. His ability to comprehend the discussions and the text was phenomenal."
 Walter P. Metzger, a history professor for 42 years, recalled Li Lu's contribution to his Contemporary Civilization class with admiration.
 "I still remember it, and I don't have an outstanding memory," said Professor Metzger, who retired in 1992. "When we talked about Adam Smith, and the question arose, 'What was Adam Smith trying to advance or defend?' some of the students said he was defending the market economy. Li Lu said he was defending competition. He said the signal mark of a Communist regime was its fear of competition, and that Smith was talking about how an unplanned economy, by virtue of being unplanned, can produce results that a planned economy cannot."
 Much of Mr. Li's life has been chronicled in the movie "Moving the Mountain," which played in New York and Los Angeles last month and opened yesterday in Washington. It was adapted from Mr. Li's memoirs (published in England but not yet in the United States).
 Mr. Li's parents, both scientists, were sent to labor camps at the start of the Cultural Revolution, shortly after his birth in 1966. He lived in the industrial city of Tangshan with a dozen different families, including one that was wiped out in the earthquake of 1976, which killed 242,000 residents. He was reunited with his own family just afterward, when Mao died.
 Mr. Li, who said he adores New York, nonetheless has been somewhat frustrated by Americans who "believe they can understand a completely different situation, a different culture, anything new, by logical inference." Another difference between him and many Americans, he said, is ancestor worship. "Whatever you are is because of what your ancestors have done," he said.
 That is why, at the most fearful juncture of his fearful escape, Li Lu thought of his grandfather. Cast overboard and clinging for several hours to a small, open raft off Hong Kong, Mr. Li didn't expect to survive. When the smugglers returned hours later, he explained, it was only because they did not want to forgo the second half of the fee, which would be paid for his safe delivery.
 "At no time in my life was I more desperate," said Mr. Li. But he kept thinking, he said, of the pride he had felt when he had addressed the Tiananmen demonstrators. He had felt his grandfather speaking through him, and that in a way he had helped Zhu achieve his goal: to outlive Mao.
 "So I thought, at that time," he said, "this is a noble end."

HEADLINE: A New Tack at the Fed: Chin Up! Think Positive!

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 2

 BODY:
Even as figures indicating possible economic trouble ahead have piled up in recent weeks, Federal Reserve policy makers have shed their usual gloom and Clinton Administration officials have been steadfastly optimistic.
 Their motivation is clear: The difference in the months ahead between a "soft landing" and a recession may well lie in preventing a sudden drop of business and consumer confidence. 
 If millions of Americans start worrying about the next paycheck or profit and stop spending money, both institutions face a problem. Federal Reserve officials would face the embarrassing task of lowering short-term interest rates just a few months after raising them. President Clinton could face an even tougher re-election fight next year.
 The soothing comments from the Fed come as a growing number of economists now believe that the Federal Reserve may have raised interest rates too high over the last year to fight a threat of inflation that has scarcely materialized. "I think the Fed has overdone it," said Preston Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. "The last one or two increases were not necessary."
 Fed officials acknowledge that their upbeat comments are partly aimed at soothing consumers and business executives, but emphasize that the statements are based on a firm belief that the economy will continue growing. "There is truth to that, but there's truth that we genuinely believe this is a likely scenario," said Alan S. Blinder, the current vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. "The likely scenario is a period of, I would guess, a couple of quarters that look kind of rocky and then a restoration of something that looks like sustainable growth, say 2 1/2 percent."
 Janet L. Yellen, a Federal Reserve governor, was also optimistic today, but cautiously so. "I'm not going to say I'm unconcerned with the risks -- only history will tell us for sure whether the Fed has overdone it," she said.
 These and other comments by top Fed officials suggest that the central bank will be reluctant to cut interest rates unless further economic indicators in the coming weeks and months show a similarly gloomy picture. Although Fed officials declined to discuss specific indicators that might be important, the June unemployment report scheduled for public release on July 7 seems likely to be one of them.
 The Fed's top interest-rate committee is scheduled to meet again on July 5 and 6, and to receive a private copy of the June unemployment report on the afternoon of July 6.
 If the Fed does decide to go beyond jawboning to an actual cut in short-term interest rates, it has one big advantage: Inflation has barely risen this year, either because the Federal Reserve has been successful in its pre-emptive strike on inflation with higher interest rates last year or because the threat of inflation was never serious to begin with.
 Investors in financial markets have shown little concern about inflation and have driven down interest rates for three-month notes to five-year bonds below the level of the overnight rates that the Federal Reserve controls. That gives the Fed some freedom to cut rates soon.
 Yet any sharp reduction in interest rates could also hurt the value of the dollar in international currency markets. Just two days ago, the Federal Reserve joined with other central banks to buy dollars in these markets to support the dollar.
 Any interest rate reduction now would also put Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in the position of pursuing the same stop-and-go monetary policy that he has tried to avoid. Indeed, the point of raising interest rates last year before inflation became a visible threat was to break with the Federal Reserve's past pattern of raising rates too late to stop inflation and then lowering rates too late to stop a recession.
 In interviews today, top Fed officials offered several reasons for their belief that while the economy might slow sharply this summer, it would not fall into a recession. They pointed to the fall in long-term interest rates, which is making mortgages cheaper for would-be home buyers; the rise until today of stock prices, which has left many households with profits to spend, and the likely recovery of American exports this summer after a dip this spring because of financial troubles in Mexico.
 But the same officials also mentioned several concerns: a possible faltering in consumer confidence, a possible weakening of business investment and the large inventories that many companies have accumulated.
 Ms. Yellen said that she honestly felt that the disappearing jobs and falling earnings described by the Labor Department today would not disrupt consumer confidence, although she acknowledged that a loss of confidence could send the economy into recession.
 "A loss of consumer confidence is a mechanism by which that could occur, but I don't believe there is a reason for a loss of consumer confidence," she said. "The fundamentals in the household sector are excellent -- we probably will have a slow quarter or two, but the ingredients for strong consumer spending are in place."
 But if Ms. Yellen and her colleagues are wrong, the Clinton Administration made clear today that its response would be to blame the Federal Reserve for the economy's problems. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich emphasized in an interview today that many of the jobs lost were in manufacturing industries that are sensitive to short-term interest rates. And in a departure from recent practice, the Council of Economic Advisers included an indirect criticism of interest-rate policy in an otherwise upbeat statement today.
 "The current slowing of the economy," the statement said, "is in part the result of the rise in interest rates in 1994, which affected the interest-sensitive sectors such as durable goods and housing."

HEADLINE: Manhattan Emerging Hub Of Multimedia

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, June 2

 BODY:
The Prodigy Services Company, one of the country's leading on-line computer services, is relocating its corporate headquarters from White Plains to the emerging multimedia mecca of lower Manhattan, its president and chief executive, Edward A. Bennett, said today.
 Prodigy's move says much about the way business is conducted in the age of cyberspace. For all the efficiency of communicating by E-mail, modem and fax, even high-tech companies still put a premium on old-fashioned, face-to-face contact. 
 "Yes, this world is about people working anywhere because of computers and connectivity," said Mr. Bennett, who joined Prodigy less than a month ago. "But to have a group of hard-working, dedicated employees living and working in the creative community of New York -- which has become the Silicon Alley in this multimedia world -- is very important to our future."
 Mr. Bennett said he hoped to spruce up Prodigy's on-line offerings by relocating the company's programmers, producers and marketing executives to lower Manhattan, where they can draw on the talents of a growing subculture of graphic artists, writers, software designers and film makers. The area, called Silicon Alley by some, Multimedia Gulch by others, is fast becoming a national center of the fledgling multimedia industry, which takes animation, video and music and combines them into CD-ROM's and virtual reality.
 Prodigy, which has two million subscribers and is jointly owned by the International Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company, is struggling to keep pace with its two leading competitors, America Online and Compuserve. The on-line landscape is expected to become even more crowded later this year, when the Microsoft Corporation and AT&T are scheduled to introduce similar services.
 Of the 550 employees who work at Prodigy's leased headquarters in downtown White Plains, about half will be relocated to Manhattan by early 1996, Mr. Bennett said. The rest will continue to work in White Plains.
 Mr. Bennett said he had no plans for further layoffs -- the company let go nearly 400 employees in 1993 and 1994 -- nor did he intend to move the company's mainframe computers from Yorktown, in the northern part of the county.
 Mr. Bennett, who was interviewed by cellular phone between visits to prospective offices, said he had yet to decide on a specific location, but was looking in TriBeCa, the Flatiron District and SoHo. He said that his own circumstances -- he lives in Chelsea but is planning a move to the West Village -- had no influence on his plans for the company.
 Word of Prodigy's move, first reported today in the Gannett Suburban Newspapers, drew mixed reactions among analysts who follow the industry.
 Peter Krasilovsky, who follows on-line services for Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md., said he doubted that the move's effect would be more than cosmetic.
 "I think his mission there is to remake Prodigy into a more youth-oriented service," Mr. Krasilovsky said of Mr. Bennett, who is a former president of the VH-1 music video network. "Today's Prodigy is more of a family service that might appeal to watchers of 'My Three Sons.' He'd like to capture more of the 'Beavis and Butt-head' crowd."
 But Michael Rinzel, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in Manhattan, said he thought it was essential for Prodigy, which is a decade old, to be in New York City if it hoped to develop into a world-class information technology company. As part of its transformation, Prodigy is expected to dress up its on-line presentations with an array of new graphic illustrations.
 "This medium is starting to reach the level of a mass market," Mr. Rinzel said. "To get the right talent to produce a higher level of product, it's becoming more important to come back to the major cities where entertainment and information is produced."
 Prodigy's move is the latest in a year of comings and goings in Westchester County commercial real estate.
 Since last June, Nynex has announced that it would move its executive offices from White Plains to Manhattan; Mastercard International has prepared to move its headquarters in the opposite direction, from Manhattan to Purchase, and I.B.M. has said that it will abandon its glass-and-concrete honeycomb in Armonk so that it can build a more intimate headquarters just down the road.
 Local economic development officials and brokers described Prodigy as one of Westchester's largest commercial tenants, and conceded that the departure of its headquarters was a blow to the area's corporate self-esteem.
 Mr. Bennett said he regretted any pain he might be causing, but said he was intent on tapping fresh sources of creativity elsewhere.
 "White Plains can supply it," he said, "but I think you can do a better job and be more empowered by being in New York."

HEADLINE: Remarks on Airport Link by Port Authority Head Surprise Albany

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The nomination of George J. Marlin to head the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey nearly failed earlier this year because he lacked government experience and had a reputation as being combative and outspoken. Three months on the job, Mr. Marlin is running into that same criticism, only this time from an unlikely source: the Pataki administration, which sponsored his appointment.
 Senior aides to Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that the Governor and his top transportation advisers, including Charles A. Gargano and Louis Tomson, were surprised and angered by Mr. Marlin's comments on Wednesday that the Port Authority had abandoned a plan to build a 22-mile railway between Manhattan and its airports in Queens. 
 Mr. Marlin said the Port Authority had scuttled the proposal because of rising costs and was considering alternatives like building just one section of the railway. Although authority officials had been saying for months that the full plan was in trouble, Mr. Marlin was the first to say publicly that the agency would not go forward with it.
 The Pataki administration's displeasure did not stem from the decision to kill the project, a move that had seemed increasingly likely in recent months, but rather from how he overstepped his purview by announcing it without having first received the Governor's permission, officials said.
 "Not only did he not have our support, he didn't give us any notice," said a senior aide to Mr. Pataki who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The aide said he was astonished by Mr. Marlin's statements, adding that he feared that the Governor would have to monitor Mr. Marlin closely because his inexperience appeared to be showing.
 Mr. Marlin did not respond yesterday to messages left for him.
 After he was nominated, Mr. Marlin was attacked by some former and current authority officials because he had never worked in government and had little management experience. Mr. Marlin, a longtime executive in the municipal-finance industry, ran as the Conservative Party candidate for New York City mayor in 1993 on a platform that stressed conservative positions on social issues.
 His political style at the time is perhaps best captured by his writings, in which he railed against the "Albany gang," meaning politicians from both parties who, he said, had no fiscal discipline.
 "This is truly an example of grassroots tyranny," he wrote in an article in The Bond Buyer about the state's budget practices. "In the name of 'progress,' the hacks arrogantly ignore the will of the people and the Constitution. And on the rare occasion when they get nailed, what's their attitude to the voters? 'In your face!' "
 Apparently aware that he would be scrutinized in his first year at the Port Authority, Mr. Marlin had declined interviews with reporters until this week, saying that he needed additional time to familiarize himself with the agency's vast operations, which include the three major airports, bridges, tunnels, the World Trade Center, marine terminals and the PATH rail lines.
 When he did meet with reporters on Wednesday, his remarks seemed as conciliatory and tentative as those in the 1993 campaign were provocative and witty. He said repeatedly he would not take stands on issues like toll increases for bridges and tunnels until he had studied them further.
 His only mishap, it appeared, was in assuming that his predecessor, Stanley Brezenoff, had announced before leaving the authority that the agency would not pursue the full 22-mile rail plan.
 Effectively, only the governors of New York and New Jersey can kill the rail proposal, and they have not formally done so. Though it is highly unlikely that the Port Authority will ever build the full 22-mile line, officials in the Pataki administration said they wanted to delay the formal announcement of its demise to put the best face on what is clearly a blow to efforts to improve access to airports.
 In other words, Pataki officials said, the authority should have had another proposal ready to take the sting from the announcement that the 22-mile plan was, as Mr. Marlin put it on Wednesday, "dead."
 A person more seasoned in the often fractious politics of agencies like the Port Authority would not have made that mistake, said a Port Authority board member who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If he had more experience in the public sector," the board member said, "he would have cleared this with the Governor before he said it publicly."
 The aide who oversees the Port Authority for Governor Pataki, Mr. Tomson, declined to comment.
 Mr. Gargano, who is Mr. Pataki's top economics adviser and a board member of the Port Authority, declined to say whether Mr. Marlin had erred. He emphasized that there had been no final decision on the railway, although he expressed strong reservations about the price for the full 22 miles, which could run as high as $5 billion to $7 billion.
 "The statement that the project is dead, this is not a statement that was made by the Governor's office or by my office," Mr. Gargano said.
 Such assurances seemed intended to blunt the response to Mr. Marlin's comments, which were assailed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other municipal officials like the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman. They had accused the Port Authority of favoring projects in New Jersey.
 "I am very, very hopeful that this does not reflect the thinking of the Governor and that the Governor was just as surprised at this precipitous action, which is harmful to both New York City and New York State," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday.
 He added that he thought that it might be time to dismantle the Port Authority, contending that it wasted "enormous amounts of money" on items like executive salaries.
 Yet even as Mr. Pataki's advisers were backpedaling, other Port Authority officials acknowledged that formal cancellation or not, Mr. Marlin was basically correct.
 "We are not going to be building anything 22 miles long any time soon," said the chairwoman of the authority, Kathleen A. Donovan, who was appointed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. "That is not going to happen. 'We just don't have the money for it."

HEADLINE: Drop in Jobs Shifts Outlook For Economy

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Bad luck for many Americans turned into good luck for others yesterday as Wall Street learned that the number of people with jobs plunged last month, and reacted by pushing interest rates down sharply.
 That was good news for consumers, who will face smaller interest payments on their mortgages and car loans, analysts said. But it is a mixed blessing for companies, which may gain from lower interest rates but lose as a slowing economy hurts sales and earnings. Indeed, the stock market kept changing its mind about the news, falling, soaring, and falling again and ending generally down. [Page 35.] 
 Yesterday marked a sharp shift in many investors' thinking about the economy, interest rates and, perhaps, equities. "We had been expecting the U.S. economy to slow, but we didn't expect it to go from 80 miles an hour to 0 miles an hour," said Lawrence L. Kreicher, chief economist for Alliance Capital Management, a large New York money manager. He called the employment drop "just boggling."
 The number that startled economists across the country was the 101,000 decline in the number of people on payrolls in May, according to the Labor Department. The decrease did not mean unemployment went up; the percentage of Americans looking for work actually fell, to 5.7 percent from 5.8 percent.
 But it did signal a contraction in employment, and therefore weakness in the economy. So much so that Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist for the Wall Street firm CS First Boston, who had been expecting the economy to grow a little in the second quarter, cut her forecast to zero -- at best.
 And she joined some other economists in predicting that Federal Reserve policy makers would cut short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point at their next meeting on July 5 and 6. "I can't see what the downside is if they do it," she said. "The downside is much worse if this thing falls into a recession and they get blamed."
 The possibility of recession -- what Wall Street coyly calls the R-word -- and the prospect of a Fed easing, were clearly behind the bond market's sharp rally. The yield on the long-term Treasury bond fell as low as 6.44 percent, from 6.61 percent, before climbing back to 6.53 percent. [Page 44.]
 That is the lowest yield since mid-February 1994, shortly after the Federal Reserve began raising rates to slow economic growth and prevent inflation from heating up.
Coming on the heels of May's steep declines, yesterday's drop in rates will probably make it possible for more Americans to buy their first homes, and will allow others to save money on their mortgage payments by refinancing. "I think we'll start seeing companies offering 7.5 percent mortgage rates," said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Rates now average about 7.75, he said.
 Car loans, and indeed all kinds of borrowing, could become more affordable. The Southwest Bank of St. Louis lowered its prime rate, a bellwether that affects many corporate and consumer rates, to 8.5 percent from 9 percent, though analysts said few other banks were likely to follow suit unless and until the Fed acted.
 The dollar initially fell against the mark and the yen, as traders worried that lower interest rates in America would repel foreign investors. The dollar then staged a sharp recovery, on the expectation that governments would act to prop it up. Those gains eroded, however, and the dollar ended down against the yen, though up slightly against the mark.
 But the stock market could not make up its mind about whether the economic news was good or bad. This is always a tricky question for equity investors, because when the economy slows down, so do corporate profits, and that is bad for stock prices. On the other hand, a weak economy usually means lower interest rates, which help corporate profits and attract investors into the stock market.
 As the day began, the Dow Jones industrial average fell out of bed, dropping more than 40 points. But the Dow, an average of 30 blue-chip stocks, quickly recovered. The gain was egged on by market gurus like Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley's money management arm, who told the firm's clients to buy stocks.
 "I think the market's reaction to the weak employment numbers was crazy," he said later in the day. "The Street is worried about lower earnings, but much lower interest rates are much more important."
 The stock market's sunny mood did not last, and at the end of the day turned abruptly darker; the Dow closed down 28.36 points at 4,444.39. The Standard & Poor's 500 index of large companies also ended the day down, although issues of smaller companies, as measured by the Russell 2,000 index, ended the day with modest gains.
 But yesterday's losses did not wipe out the market's gains earlier in the week, and Dow ended the four-day stretch up 75 points. Stocks' strength in the face of bad economic news strikes some analysts as unrealistic, but they note that the market has a dynamic of its own, apart from the overall economy.
 "It's the press of money," said Michael Metz, chief strategist for Oppenheimer & Company. Huge sums are concentrated in mutual funds, and for portfolio managers, "the wisdom so far has been to spend that money as soon as you can," he said. That appetite for stocks, combined with a supply shrunk by corporate buybacks and takeovers, overwhelm economic factors, he said.
 But that does not mean the market will completely ignore the economic outlook -- indeed, it would not be healthy if it did so, said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates. Concern about recession "is in the background," he said. "Sometimes it is Recession with a capital R, sometimes it is recession with a small r."

HEADLINE: James Shapiro, 85, Innovator In the Home Sewing Industry

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
James J. Shapiro, who helped revolutionize the home sewing industry as a founder and president of the Simplicity Pattern Company, died yesterday at his home at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He was 85.
The cause of death was cancer, said his younger brother, Robert M. Shapiro. 
 Mr. Shapiro, who was born in Russia in 1909 and brought to the United States as a toddler, was a teen-ager in 1927 when his father, Joseph M. Shapiro, a magazine ad salesman, had an idea that would transform their lives.
At the time, producing dress patterns for the home sewing market was the exclusive province of McCall's and other women's magazines, including one long-forgotten publication that the elder Mr. Shapiro worked for in New York.
When the magazine failed, the father, recognizing the strong appeal of its pattern offerings, decided to form an independent pattern company with his elder son as his partner.
Given the entrenched competition of the women's magazines, the idea was daring, but as implemented by the Shapiros, it had an irresistible appeal.
For the first time, women interested in making their own clothes did not have to buy a magazine, then send off for a pattern that might cost as much as 25 cents. Instead, they could riffle through an open-top box on the counter of a local store, pay a dime for a pattern and, as often as not, buy the required fabric in the same store.
As a result, Simplicity, which started off using a single designer and relying on commercial printers, soon dominated the home sewing market. At its peak in the 1970's, the company, which went public in the 1930's, had 4,000 employees, its own paper mill and printing operations, factories in several countries, an extensive catalogue business, 20,000 retail outlets in the United States alone, and a flourishing sideline supplying patterns to fashion magazines.
It also sold more than 150 million patterns a year, accounting for more than half the international home sewing market. It was, in effect, the world's largest dress manufacturer, one whose vast home-based work force actually paid the company for the privilege of turning its patterns into finished garments.
James Shapiro was given much of the credit for the success.
"He was a marketing genius," Sidney Greenman, a former Simplicity director and general counsel, said yesterday, noting that it had been Mr. Shapiro who conceived the idea of enlisting chain stores as outlets and who then signed up Woolworth's, a major coup in the 1930's.
He also created a full-scale education department, which supplied high school home economic departments with equipment so millions of teen-age girls could learn to sew using Simplicity patterns.
"We were the first to introduce color," Robert Shapiro said. "We were the first to use photography, the first to go to four colors, the first do to a lot of things."
Robert Shapiro acknowledged that his brother had been an appropriately demanding executive in a business in which perfection must be standard (women buying patterns cannot try on a dress before buying), but he denied a widespread report that his brother had fired him as company president. "I retired," he said, citing failing eyesight.
After selling most of his stock in the company, James Shapiro himself retired in 1976, which turned out to be the peak year for the industry. It has shrunk considerably as women have flooded into the work force.
In addition to his brother, Mr. Shapiro is survived by a daughter, Paula Lund of Jupiter, Fla.; two grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Jump on U.S. Labor Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities leaped higher yesterday, as a Government labor report stunned economists, showing a loss of 101,000 jobs in May in contrast to an expected gain of 166,000.
 Doug Burtnick, senior analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said, "The data cleared out any thoughts that the economy really isn't slowing down," and consequently traders priced the slowdown into the bond market, which, hating inflation, tends to rise as the economy slows. 
 Another analyst quipped, "The batteries were recharged, and the ever-ready bond rally continues." The latest data raised the probability that the Federal Reserve could ease credit. Some market participants said that rates could be trimmed a quarter of a percentage point between now and the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee right after the Fourth of July.
 With some analysts seeing a recession as a possibility, the 30-year bond rose 16/32 points, to a price of 1148/32 , for a yield of 6.53 percent, down from 6.61 percent on Thursday. By the close of the New York market, investors taking profits gave back more than half the day's gains.
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, however, takes a more cautious view. "The sharp and unexpected decline in payroll employment during May strongly suggests that the second quarter's sluggish economic growth involves more than just inventory correction, and that it may not be limited solely to the industrial sector," he said.
 "At the same time," Mr. Fine continued, "signs of recession are hard to find, and economic growth during the second half of the year is still pointing to a soft landing." He said this certainly did not preclude a Fed easing, but a move in that direction seemed a little premature. The Fed is likely to be very cautious, Mr. Fine said, and will want to examine data for both June and the early part of the third quarter before undertaking its first easing since late 1992.
 "While the bond market has clearly built in future Fed easing," Mr. Fine said, "the Fed does not have to necessarily ease in July for the bond market to hold on to its gains. So long as the market believes that the next Fed move is ease, the rally is justified."
 He predicts the Fed is likely to move a quarter of a percentage in its initial easing move, which will come at the earliest in August. "If an inflation-fighting Fed moves more quickly and to a greater extent when the economy is heating up, it stands to reason that the Fed is likely to move a bit more cautiously and to a somewhat lesser extent when the economy is slowing down, particularly if a recession is not foreseen," he said.
 Mr. Burtnick of Technical Data said the short end of the market was prepared for an ease of more than a half a percentage point sometime this summer, or in the early fall -- "a huge switch from just a couple of months ago when the Street expected the Fed to keep tightening."
 Treasuries have outperformed most of the market for the last few sessions, Mr. Burtnick noted, and as a result mortgage and corporate traders have worked their way out of bad hedges by buying Government securities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Steadier With Traders Wary of Further Interventions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady yesterday against most leading currencies, rebounding from early losses as currency traders became concerned that central banks might again intervene to support the value of the dollar.
 A surprise round of dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve and a dozen other central banks sent the dollar sharply higher on Wednesday, punishing investors who had bet against the dollar by selling it for other currencies. 
 Traders still smarting from that attack were hesitant to push the dollar too low today after two reports provided more evidence of weakness in the American economy.
 "Everybody sold dollars this morning, but people were quick to buy them back for fear of Fed intervention," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.4089 German marks from 1.4055 marks on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 84.32 yen from 84.65 yen. Earlier in the day, the dollar fell as low as 1.3928 marks and 83.50 yen.
 News that a United States F-16 jet fighter flying a NATO mission was shot down over Serb-held northern Bosnia yesterday contributed to the dollar's recovery, traders said. Investors sometimes buy dollars as a haven in times of international turmoil.
 The downing of the jet "certainly brought the dollar up when it came across the screen," said Jim Raphael, currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "It's something everyone is thinking about."
 The dollar fell in early New York trading after the Labor Department reported a sharp drop in the number of workers on payrolls in May. The data fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve might be compelled to cut interest rates to revive the economy. A rate cut could hurt the dollar by making deposits denominated in the currency less attractive.
 "It's clear the economy is slowing much more quickly than expected, and that's being perceived as not good for the dollar," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at the Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in Chicago.
 While concern about another Fed dollar-buying spree helped the dollar yesterday, that supportive effect might not last much longer given the slew of recent economic reports suggesting slowing growth in the United States, traders said.
 "Right now the dollar is under a magnifying glass, and the numbers coming in just don't look good," Mr. Raphael of NatWest said.

HEADLINE: Bosnia: Not America's War

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration drops hints about the possible involvement of United States ground troops in Bosnia, the White House and some Republicans have started resorting to cold-war shorthand about NATO solidarity and the need for American leadership in Europe.
War is too important to be driven by such sloganeering, as the downing of an American F-16 fighter plane over Bosnia yesterday makes clear. The real issue in Bosnia is not one of the United States living up to its NATO responsibilities nor of continued American engagement in European security. Neither of those is in any doubt. The relevant question is whether the United States has a strong enough interest in the outcome of the Bosnian conflict to risk its troops in ground combat. In the view of this page, it does not. 
 At several points in recent history, special circumstances have invested the fate of the Balkans with worldwide significance. Today, no such circumstances prevail. The United States has no interest beyond a humanitarian one in the outcome of Bosnia's bloody three-year war.
When Austria-Hungary and czarist Russia wrestled for influence in the Balkans early in this century, nationalist quarrels there sparked the First World War. A generation later, when Hitler dominated Europe, threatening Britain and the United States, the Allies supported Marshal Tito's Partisans as part of their military strategy.
After the war an ideological iron curtain descended across Europe, as Churchill put it, "from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic." The Balkans again stood on the front lines of global conflict. That gave Washington a strong stake in keeping Tito's Yugoslavia outside the Soviet orbit.
The Hapsburgs, the czars and the German Kaiser are long gone. The Nazis were defeated 50 years ago. Tito's Yugoslav federation has been torn apart. The cold war has been over for nearly a decade. Moscow now struggles to control outlying areas of the Russian Republic and constitutes no threat to Trieste. Britain, France and Germany, whose clashes on the western front helped draw the United States into two world wars, are now partners in the European Union and NATO.
These changes do not mean the United States can return to the isolationism of the Republic's early days. For more than a century, American prosperity has been premised on peace and prosperity in Western Europe and access to the growing markets of East Asia. Without Middle East oil, the United States economy would grind to a halt. Upheaval in Latin America or Canada could send refugees streaming across this country's borders and even threaten its physical security.
But while America's interests are global, its ties to Europe are especially strong. NATO is the United States' most extensive and most binding alliance. It integrates American forces into joint training and command structures and solemnly commits Washington to come to the military defense of other member countries if they come under attack.
That pledge remains fully reliable. It does not, however, extend to the automatic protection of allied military units when they operate outside the NATO area. Britain and France and other nations involved in the U.N. operation in Bosnia have the military capacity to reinforce and protect their own troops. Should they need to evacuate those troops, the United States stands ready to help. Otherwise, American ground forces should be kept strictly outside the conflict.

HEADLINE: Investors in Withdrawal From Stock Funds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Investors pulled money out of equity funds in the week ended Wednesday as stocks hit record highs, AMG Data Services said yesterday. It was the first weekly net withdrawal of assets from these funds in four months.
 Equity funds lost a net $107 million for the week. 
 "Investors want to maintain more of a neutral strategy because of the uncertainty in the economy and the prospects of a soft landing," said Michael Kristin, an account executive at Stein Roe Mutual Funds in Chicago, which manages about $25 billion.
 AMG, a company in Arcata, Calif., that tracks cash flows in the mutual fund industry, said the asset decline in stock funds was the first since the week of Jan. 25.
 Investors, who invested as much as $2.1 billion a week into stock funds during April, have pared their purchases of stock funds steadily since then. Net purchases of equity funds totalled $1.2 billion in the week ended May 24.
 Much of the decline for the latest week was caused by money flowing out of international funds, AMG said. Investors yanked $238.9 million out of funds that invest in stocks outside the United States.

HEADLINE: Deficit Threatens America's Treasures

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Other Countries Thrive on Unbalanced Budgets" (letter, May 29) by Walter J. Moore:
Since the 1980's the annual budget deficit of the United States has been growing faster than its gross domestic product. The main problem for the United States is that the money that must be borrowed by the Government because of the deficit is being used to pay for current expenses, not for capital expenditures, such as the building and repair of highways and bridges and other infrastructure. 
 The deficit has got so out of control that Congress is now considering selling off precious assets such as the Presidio, described as "a spectacular section of the waterfront" in San Francisco (news article, May 29).
Most of the other countries mentioned by Mr. Moore are borrowing money to finance the purchase of productive assets. Italy is an exception. The Italian national debt surpassed 100 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 1990 -- interest on the debt is now the largest item in Italy's budget.
The interest the United States pays on debt is also our biggest budget item after "entitlements," which consume 52 percent of the budget, and the military, which consumes 22 percent. If not for interest on the debt, which is about 20 percent of the annual budget, our budget could be put almost into balance.
Mr. Moore is correct when he states that all the mentioned countries provide more in social services than the United States, but a main reason is that none of those countries spend anywhere near the percentage of their budgets that the United States spends on its military. The countries of Asia and Europe that have prospered under the umbrella of the American military got and continue to get a mostly free ride.
Are there any others out there who recall the story of the grasshopper and the ants? While the grasshopper relaxed in the warm summer sun, the ants industriously stocked up on food for the winter. When the snow, hail and sleet set in, the grasshopper found himself cold and hungry, while the ants were safely ensconced in their tree house, where music played and food warmed on an open fire.
For decades the United States has been acting like a grasshopper. The time has come to begin acting like ants.

HEADLINE: ALBANY'S BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
Pataki and State Legislators Say They Have Agreed on a Budget

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 2

 BODY:
Sixty-three days after the start of the fiscal year, Gov. George E. Pataki and the state's legislative leaders concluded their tortuous negotiations today, declaring a final agreement on a state budget that by at least one critical measure will reduce state spending for the first time in a generation.
The budget, on which both houses of the Legislature began to vote this afternoon, will also cut income and business taxes and impose modest new restrictions on welfare recipients. 
 The finished product reflects a drastic reversal of New York's fiscal traditions. For nearly four decades, governors of both parties have imposed steep taxes in an effort to sustain generous spending on social programs -- while at the same time they created structural deficits year after year.
While this year's budget is not everything that the state's new Republican Governor wanted, it largely follows the blueprint he sketched in last year's campaign, and in the budget he proposed in February.
It also sets a pattern of austerity for at least the next two years of the Pataki administration, and possibly far beyond. Because the cost of the tax cuts will grow significantly from now through 1997, and because the Governor did not succeed in cutting state spending as much as he wanted, many fiscal analysts believe that next year's budget battle may make this one look like a minor skirmish.
The impact of the state budget on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fiscal plans for New York City is unclear. The Mayor was relying heavily on help from the state to balance the city's budget, but it seems clear today that the new state budget will leave a significant hole in the Mayor's own proposed budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
Although Mr. Pataki said he was pleased with today's budget agreement, he acknowledged his need to seek deeper cuts in the future.
"We are going to have to have fiscal restraint in this state government going forward because we have not had it in the past," he told reporters. "We have made an enormous start this year, but we are going to continue to look for ways to reduce the cost of government."
Mr. Pataki said that the state's general fund budget, which consists of revenues from state taxes and fees that are not committed to specific purposes, would drop by 1 percent, or $334 million less than last year's $33.1 billion. The Governor had proposed a 3.5 percent cut in general fund spending, a drop of about $1.17 billion.
That 1 percent decrease would be the first decline in general fund spending since 1943, according to Mr. Pataki's budget division. Spending also decreased in 1990, but only after the Legislature was forced to make midyear cuts in the budget as the recession dried up state revenues.
This year's total state spending, however, would increase by about $1.5 billion, or 2.5 percent, to $63.5 billion. That figure includes Federal funds that pass through the state budget and other money that is not included in the general fund. Mr. Pataki had proposed an increase of less than 1 percent.
State officials could not be specific about a third calculation that is used to measure the budget, known as state funds. But that figure, which includes the general fund, debt service, capital projects, and several special dedicated revenue funds, is expected to remain flat at $42 billion, said Patricia A. Woodworth, Mr. Pataki's budget director.
The officials could not be specific about the aid to New York City either.
Mr. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver both estimated that Mr. Giuliani would receive about $650 million of the $1.05 billion in financial assistance he was seeking from Albany. That would leave the Mayor $400 million short.
And City Council officials warned that some of the savings that Mr. Giuliani expects from state cuts in Medicaid and welfare programs may be unrealistic as well. State cuts in those so-called entitlement programs save local governments money, because required local spending is pegged to state spending.
Assembly officials said that virtually all the savings in the state budget for Mr. Giuliani would come from the Medicaid and welfare cuts. The Mayor apparently will not receive any items he lobbied for on a last-minute trip to Albany last week, including unrestricted revenue sharing for the city and state money for prekindergarten programs for handicapped children.
Speaking to reporters at City Hall this afternoon, Mr. Giuliani declined to comment on how the city had fared in the state budget or to speculate on how he would close the budget gap left by Albany. He said he would do so only after the state budget had been enacted.
After Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, announced their agreement in a series of news conferences, the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate began passing budget bills this afternoon and evening. Both houses enacted the tax cut package and the part of the budget that finances state agencies. Some bills are still being drafted, however, and the voting is expected to conclude on Monday or Tuesday after a weekend break.
Today's agreement did not seem to heal many of the passionate political and ideological divisions that prolonged the negotiations, as the Assembly floor debate on the tax cuts demonstrated.
"This is a sad day for God Almighty," said Deputy Speaker Arthur O. Eve, a Buffalo Democrat. "God is not pleased today. So I ask Him to forgive each and every one of you."
Assemblyman Philip B. Healey, a Massapequa Republican, responded: "We're trying to encourage people to have jobs; don't leave New York State. If you want to quote the Bible, that's what St. Paul said: 'Everyone must work, and then we'll have a great future.' "
Legislators from both parties broke into muffled laughter, with several asking, "St. Paul said that?"
Mr. Pataki said the arduous negotiations, in which Mr. Silver strove to restore much of the money that the Governor proposed to cut, had produced "dramatic change."
"I am extremely confident that this begins the process -- it is not the end -- but begins the process of restoring people's confidence in the future of this state and restoring economic opportunity for this state," he said.
Among the final issues the leaders negotiated was a decision to review major changes in the state's sentencing laws after 10 years. A commission will evaluate the impact of the changes, particularly on the demand for prison space, and the Legislature will have to vote then to extend the laws.
Mr. Pataki said the budget would include $900 million in nonrecurring revenues -- or one-shot revenues, as they are called -- up from the $650 million he proposed in his original budget. Credit rating agencies and other fiscal monitors have criticized the state's reliance on those measures.
In another last-minute maneuver certain to generate criticism, the leaders agreed to help balance the budget, and those of local governments, by borrowing $230 million from a $360 million fund that is supposed to be used to increase pensions for state and local government retirees, legislative aides said. The remaining money in the fund will be used to increase pensions.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the sole trustee of the state's pension fund, said the move "sounds like another gimmick, another one-shot, another example of the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that has given New York State the lowest credit rating in the nation."

Chart: "A CLOSED LOOK -- Agreeing on Sentencing: Old Crimes, New Guidelines"
Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders have agreed to a new sentencing plan as part of broader negotiations aver the state budget. The plan would increase minumum sentences for a range of violent felons while repealing some laws requiring that repeat nonviolent offenders serve prison time. Below are examples of how sentences for some violent offenders would change. (pg. 24)

COMRADE CRIMINAL
Russia's New Mafiya.
By Stephen Handelman.
398 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $27.50. 
THE image of Russia has taken many a twist since those now-distant days when Boris Yeltsin defied Communist die-hards from the top of a tank. We have had Russia the starving giant, Russia threatened by civil war, Russia lurching toward fascism and Russia the empire rampant, crudely crushing Chechnya. Now we have Russia the state hijacked by organized crime. The picture is of hit men with zoot suits and Kalashnikovs operating brazenly in the heart of Moscow, of politicians amassing huge fortunes in bribes and army generals peddling anything from rifles to nukes.
This image, Stephen Handelman argues in "Comrade Criminal," his chilling study of what the Russians call the "mafiya," is deserved. Virtually every small business across Russia pays protection money to some gang; former Communist bosses snap up lucrative properties; vast fortunes in raw materials are smuggled out through the porous borders of former Soviet states; ministries and municipal governments peddle property and favors. Some 30 million unregistered firearms circulate in the former Soviet states -- one million of them in Moscow alone.
Moscow has become the new international Klondike, Mr. Handelman says. Shady millionaires in glossy suits with broad shoulders cruise about in motorcades of imported sedans with armies of bodyguards; foreigners in search of fast fortunes pack hotels; casinos and glitzy nightclubs sprout like mushrooms through the city center (replete with metal detectors and hulking bruisers at the door); guns are everywhere, often smoking. "The second great Russian revolution of this century," Mr. Handelman writes, "is awash in corruption, opportunism and crime."
A REPORTER who was in Moscow from 1987 to 1992 for The Toronto Star, Mr. Handelman takes us into places that few know of, and where even fewer have ventured. He meets with racketeers and gunmen, police officials and politicians, new millionaires and former dissidents. He guides us around the roots of Russian crime -- the old Soviet prison culture and the tolkachi, the specialists who found short cuts through socialist inefficiency; the greedy commissars and the Communist Party's secret bank accounts; the state monopolies that emerged as private monopolies. The problem, Mr. Handelman warns, is not only Russia's: Russian hit men have struck in London; Russian raw materials smuggled out of the country have played havoc with Western markets; Russia's underground millionaires are acquiring pricey chunks of Western real estate; Russian arms and nuclear materials have surfaced the world over.
This book is a sobering and chastening voyage for those in the West who were, in Mr. Handelman's words, "quick to claim 'victory' in the cold war." Yet terrible as Russia's crime problem may be, it has remained a confusing phenomenon for Westerners and Russians alike. For one thing, street crime, though far more visible and prevalent than under Communist rule, is no worse in Russia's cities than in many major cities elsewhere (a reasonably careful visitor is probably safer in Moscow than in New York). For another, Russians reared in Soviet ethics, which classified any form of private enterprise as evil, are quick to label any group dedicated to making money "mafiya."
The problem is that technically they're right. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left such a legal and economic mess behind that I doubt whether anyone who has lived in Russia in recent years, much less anyone who has tried to do business there, has not broken one law or another. A legal system constructed for a socialist police state has proved hopelessly inadequate for modern commerce -- there simply were no laws for facilitating private enterprise, and courts designed to handle domestic quarrels and street crimes were not prepared to handle complex economic cases. At the same time, the torrents of decrees and laws issued over the past three years by the President and his parliaments have often been crude, contradictory and utterly inconsistent. The inevitable result: Russians, as a wise man noted in the last century, "compensate for the severity of their laws by disregarding them."
In general, it is hard to imagine a society less hospitable to modern commerce than the old Soviet Union was. Everything belonged to "the people," and therefore to no one. The structures of efficient business -- banking, communications, credit, computerization -- were rudimentary. Money was less useful in obtaining scarce goods than were connections or rank, and rampant inefficiency and shortages relegated a major portion of the nation's economic activity to a gray zone.
In fact, when Communism crumbled, I often thought that the spread of crime and corruption was less amazing than the fact that the whole system did not collapse into anarchy. But Moscow today is in the grip of a dramatic boom of building and restoration. New shops and hotels open daily. More and more Russians are being drawn into private enterprise, many in legitimate businesses. However they obtained their fortunes, the newly rich are investing in schools, in culture, in the restoration of old buildings, in politics.
That, in the end, is the most intriguing question posed by Russia today: How is it, with all the crime and chaos, that most Russians are really not doing so badly? Is it like some Ponzi scheme, an illusion that will culminate in disaster? Is it a robber-baron stage of capital accumulation that will develop into a real market economy?
MR. HANDELMAN may be wise not to prophesy too much. Russia is a moving target, and it moves quickly and unpredictably. He does note hopefully that the "frontier capitalism" of Russia demonstrates at least that "ingenuity and grit are very much alive behind the old Soviet borders," and that "the second Russian revolution is not over." But more often his reaction is one of dismay -- he speaks repeatedly of that second revolution as having been hijacked or betrayed by "comrade criminal."
Dismay and hope, indeed, are the stock reactions to what is happening in Russia. Dismay, because so many in the West were certain that a red-blooded democracy was lurking just behind the cold Communist facade, only waiting to be loosed, and instead we find politicians still locked in old Soviet habits, entrepreneurs prepared to kill and steal, and a nation suspicious of our ways. Hope, because once we began to appreciate how far Russia has to go, we realized how far it had already come.
It is that tension that renders Russia's emergence from despotism so gripping, and that leaves us, after concluding Mr. Handelman's tour through the underworld, still hungry for more guidance on its meaning. Mr. Handelman has done a masterly and very courageous job of reporting, and he reveals a side of the new Russia that we overlook at our peril. But it is precisely because Russia is moving so fast, and in so many complex ways, that even something as sinister as organized crime must be treated both as a blight and as a clue.
 
 
 
THIEVES WORLD
 For decades, the prisons of the Soviet Union had been home to the world's most extraordinary criminal society. For almost a century, it had been known as vorovskoi mir, the Thieves World. From their cells, crime bosses planned and organized their operations across the country. . . . Lieutenants, often called brodyagi (vagabonds), conducted formal dealings with the outside. The so-called vagabond brotherhood provided the network for transmitting orders and collecting profits. In the Soviet era, the gangs operating from their prison bases were no threat to ordinary civilians. Their enemy and rival was the Communist Party, for which they bore an old and longstanding grudge.
Once the Soviet Union had collapsed, however, criminal organizations emerged from their lofty isolation. It was no longer necessary to guard against Communist infection. A modern gang leader could manage his empire from outside prison walls without shame; in fact, the new opportunities available for profit made this nearly a requirement. And even for those who remained inside, there was no risk of embarrassment or censure in bargaining with straight society. Like caged lions who suddenly realized their strength, the leaders of the Thieves World were ready to take what they considered their rightful place in the pecking order of the New Russia.

HEADLINE: FORWARD TO THE PAST

BYLINE: By Walter Russell Mead; Walter Russell Mead is the President's Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School. Research assistance was provided by Adam Feibelman.

 BODY:
With Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican allies in the House set to dismantle as much of the Federal Government as they can, we seem to be watching the twilight of the nation-state. A wave of change is sweeping across national governments worldwide. Regional governments everywhere, and state governments in the United States, will gain in strength relative to federal units as voters keep power closer to home. And international institutions like the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the newly established World Trade Organization will, with the help of market forces, erode national sovereignty from above.
Nations are being overwhelmed by markets. Transnational corporations have no allegiance to any government and sail the seas of the global economy under no flag but their own. An international culture is taking shape. Young people everywhere listen to the same music, wear the same clothes, watch the same movies. At the level of elites, professional communities of knowledge know no national boundaries; Russian, American and Swiss physicists have more in common with each other than with their lay neighbors. 
 It's all true -- but life isn't that simple. The nation-state may be sickly and pale, but nationalism is thriving, robust and rambunctious. Those Russians and Chechens fighting in the ruins of Grozny aren't rootless cosmopolites. The Hungarians and Romanians and the Bosnians and Serbs show that nationalism -- the desire of people who speak the same language and share a common history to form a common state -- is far from dead in international affairs.
The new nationalism isn't limited to the old Communist world. In Western Europe and the United States, anti-immigrant feeling testifies to the enduring power of national identity. In East Asia, the conflicting claims of various nations to the oil-rich Spratly Islands are more than alarming; the conflict in East Timor shows just how hard people will fight being ruled by those they consider culturally alien. Border skirmishes between, of all places, Ecuador and Peru show that Latin Americans are still willing to kill one another for the sake of a flag.
Nationalism is on the rise. During the cold war, people tended to kill each other for international ideas like freedom and socialism; today, the carnage is over ethnicity and national status. Ask the Bosnians and the Tutsis.
Even the Republican majority in Congress testifies to the paradox of rising nationalism in declining nation-states. Not all of the Federal establishment is coming under Newt Gingrich's knives. The Defense Department budget is, after all, being spared. Conservatives may want to scrap the Department of Energy and turn welfare back to the states, but don't wait for them to haul down the flag -- or ask American soldiers to serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations under foreign commanders. Even further on the right, the militia movement hates, with equal passion, the Federal Government, the United Nations and foreigners generally. This apparent paradox -- nationalism rising as nation-states decline -- is part of a larger pattern. The future is starting to look like the past; the 1990's are starting to look like the 1890's.
THE OMNIPOTENT nation-state of this century is a historical anomaly and was born in turmoil and blood. Before 1914, most states -- even sprawling autocracies like czarist Russia -- were small and weak by today's standards. Furthermore, many government functions that even conservatives now accept, like central banking, were private. The Bank of England was private until 1946. Before the Federal Reserve was established in 1913, the private House of Morgan functioned effectively as the central bank of the United States. International money markets were more closely integrated in some ways then than now. The international gold standard, for example, was an effective monetary union. Major currencies -- the pound, the dollar, the franc and the mark -- were pegged to gold and fluctuated only slightly against one another.
All this changed with World War I. In all the major powers, governments asserted unprecedented, even unimagined, power to control the production and the distribution of strategic goods. Government consumption shot up -- in money terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product. The Federal Government spent $572 million in 1902 and $12.6 billion in 1918. Taxes rose accordingly. The 16th Amendment established the basis for a national income tax in 1913. Families with incomes of $25,000 were in a 1 percent tax bracket; those with incomes of $1,000,000 were taxed at 6 percent. Four years later the nation was at war, and an income of $25,000 was taxed at 14.7 percent; $1,000,000 at 70.3 percent.
Once the shooting stopped, most governments retrenched -- but even so, governments everywhere played a larger role after the war. The Federal budget dropped back in the 1920's, but never to its prewar levels. By 1927, Washington was still spending $3.5 billion, seven times the 1902 budget.
Much of this increase arose directly from the war. Governments were saddled with huge debts; the war forced expensive social reforms on many countries. Politicians were alarmed by the specter of Communism and the danger that alienated soldiers would find they had more in common with their fellow workers on the other side than with their own national government. That created pressure to create better, more open societies after victory. These vows were only partly kept, but still they cost money and they began to change people's beliefs about what government could and should do.
Governments did more to control the international economy after the war. The collapse of the gold standard left governments managing currencies, and therefore price levels, and therefore international capital flows as never before. As part of the Versailles system, international government commissions set economic policy for Germany; for the first 10 years after the war the Allies essentially controlled the German central bank.
World War II and its aftermath completed the story; governments throughout Europe and North America grew to a size and power that no one would have dreamed possible in 1900. In 1943, British Government expenditure reached an astonishing 82 percent of gross domestic product. After 1945, governments were even more committed to economic management and welfare state policies. The Depression had shown how prone the private economy is to disaster without government support. And the war brought devastation of such scale that nothing smaller than national governments could hope to respond effectively.
Government remained powerful after 1945. The cold war perpetuated exceptional security costs for the next 40 years. Ever-expanding welfare states and ever-expanding entitlements for the citizens of the Western democracies helped prove the superiority of the Western system over its Communist alternative. Few questioned the desirability or the inevitability of the mixed-market economy, with its ever-expanding government.
But other factors were at work. The long peace among the Western democracies after 1945 allowed the private economy to recover. The severed trade links among nations were re-established; investors once again felt safe enough to put their money in international markets. Governments gradually lost the ability to control currency values and to dominate international capital flows. The collapse in 1971 of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates ended the domination of the international economy by nation-states.
In the 24 years since, private business and private capital have steadily returned to the commanding heights of the world economy. Governments today must obey markets, not the other way around. It is difficult to say how far this process will continue, but the 1990's already in some ways look like the 1890's -- an era of weak national states, free international capital flows and strong national passions. If so, we'll have to fasten our seat belts. History is about to enter a region of turbulent air currents.
A return to the conditions of the 1890's does not mean an era of serenely buoyant capital markets. The 19th century was an era of spectacular growth in some places, but it was also a time of disruptive booms and crashes, and of prolonged economic stagnation and depression. The stock market collapse of 1987 and the Mexican crisis of 1994-95 could be harbingers. The panic of 1893 that prostrated the American banking system started as a crisis among Argentine banks; numerous other American depressions and stock market crashes were touched off by international financial crashes throughout the 19th century.
INTERNATIONAL POLITICS WILL BE as turbulent as international markets. The French, British and German Governments before World War I were small and weak by present standards but public opinion in all three countries was much more chauvinistic than it is today. One possible explanation: If political leaders cannot control their economies to assure rising living standards they must and will play the nationalist card in the contest for power. This is obviously true today in the case of countries like Russia and Serbia. But it could well be true tomorrow in places like Germany, France and the United States if the inherent instability of an international economy dominated by unregulated private capital flows should plunge the world into a series of major economic crises.
Finally, in the long run, the pendulum will swing back toward strong government. A good analogy is flood control. Recent floods along the Mississippi and in northern Europe generated a consensus for dismantling the structures that "regulate" the rivers in the interest of flood control. Laissez faire is our new attitude toward the rivers -- let them flow; human interference just makes things worse.
But we should not forget, as we busily dismantle economic dikes and dams created to protect national economies from rampaging international capital flows, why we built those dikes in the first place. Tearing down the levees on the Mississippi may, in Lincoln's phrase, allow the Father of Waters to flow unvexed to the sea, but the chances are good that some of the communities in his path will be considerably vexed by the normal fluctuations of his course. Before long, some of the structures now being carted away will be rebuilt in haste when we rediscover the virtues of national governments strong enough to protect both individuals and nations from the ravages of economic and social catastrophe.
When that happens, there will no doubt be plenty of pundits and politicians who will hail the new trend toward strong and assertive national governments as a permanent feature of international life. They will probably be wrong.

As you might expect, its creation has set off a mad scramble for possession. The owners of old land claim priority to annex the new. The designers of the landfill say no, it was promised to them. A few people shout, "Save some for parks and playgrounds!" Some dare to suggest an auction to help reduce the budget deficit.
If the argument were really about land so obviously worth billions, the public would surely recognize its stake in the debate. The struggle at hand, however, concerns not landfill but airfill -- vast new space in the broadcast spectrum. The imminent availability of that space has arisen from what is murkily called the Digital-HDTV problem, as if to make sure that only a few thousand comprehending Americans will bother to decipher the technical, economic and political issues involved. But that new airspace is precious real estate indeed. It is worth billions. It was created at government initiative and its disposition should not be left to lobbyists and the legislators they routinely bribe with campaign contributions. 
 Here's the situation: About eight years ago, Japan was threatening to make all television equipment obsolete by leading the world into the era of "high-definition television" -- HDTV -- a wider picture, built of twice the present number of lines and therefore twice as clear and more beautiful than anything now available. The public, it was feared, would find the new pictures irresistible, forcing broadcasters to invest in expensive new equipment without the prospect of offsetting new revenues. Indeed, because the HDTV signals required more space in the spectrum, broadcasters feared that some stations might be crowded off the air altogether.
To meet the threat, the Reagan Administration risked a rare deviation from its free-market ideology and organized a competition to invent an American HDTV. And as incentive, the Federal Communications Commission promised to give broadcasters new channel space to transmit the sharper images. The competition was won by a little-known lab belonging to General Instrument, which stunned the world by abandoning the current analog transmissions -- radio waves that are analogous to the sound and light waves of the original image -- and creating its better picture with digital transmissions -- impulses that represent sound and light with the 1's and 0's of the digital computer code.
That breakthrough led to the creation of a consortium of seven major companies and labs, called "the Grand Alliance," to exploit the new technology. Lo and behold, the Grand Alliance's system, now almost complete, can do much more than send elegant pictures. In the spectrum space now used by one analog channel, it can transmit not just one high-definition image but five or six digital television signals as good as current ones. Airfill! And it can use those extra signals not just for television pictures but also to carry Internet computer files, two-way paging systems, electronic mail and much, much more.
Because the new system surpassed all expectations for HDTV, and also because they'd prefer not to bother any longer with an unprofitable conversion to HDTV, broadcasters have taken to calling the new technology by its alternate name, Advanced Television, or ATV. And as Reed Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, considers the policy decisions that ATV will require starting this year, he calls this "a true watershed moment for the broadcast world."
"Broadcasters are just now commencing the process of converting to the digital age," he observes. "In a few years, broadcasting in most parts of the country will start to be digital transmission. And TV will become fanatically diverse and complex, merging with the computer and communications industry to create the multimedia experience you've all been reading about."
Hundt wants commercial broadcasting to evolve competitively, with little or no government intervention and he has angered some members of the Grand Alliance by not forcing a conversion to HDTV. The alliance has invested heavily in the new technology and feels betrayed to see it diverted to other uses. But Hundt has also annoyed the broadcasters, who want the extra spectrum space once set aside for HDTV to be given to them for profitable services.
The F.C.C. chairman looks upon all the airwaves as public property, to be rented or bartered for commercial uses and to some degree reserved for public purposes. He recently earned nearly $8 billion for the United States Treasury by auctioning off space on the radio spectrum. And he is now seeking public support for the idea of making broadcasters pay for spectrum space with cash or contributions of time or a mixture of both.
"Who among us thinks it was a bad idea to set aside 843 acres in Manhattan to create Central Park?" he recently asked. "Does anyone think Teddy Roosevelt erred in proposing the National Park System that left us the treasures of Yosemite, Yellowstone and so many others? Surely not all the Western wilderness needs to be turned over to commercial development."
At the least, Hundt obviously intends to protect the investments already made by wireless phone and paging companies at his spectrum auction by charging comparable fees to broadcasters who would now compete with them. He has also suggested that broadcasters be required to set aside some of the huge new spectrum capacity for both educational children's programs and free political discussion. He suggests creating a "bank" of reserved free time for politics to be withdrawn with vouchers given to political parties and candidates. The free broadcasts and electronic mail that these vouchers would provide would, in a stroke, greatly reduce the costs of campaigning -- and therefore the influence -- of campaign contributors.
The question now is whether Congress will feel free enough from industry pressure to lay claim to the public's stake in the spectrum. For half a century, television broadcasters have paid nothing for their highly profitable use of the airwaves. Their promise in return to operate "in the public interest" was shown long ago to have little meaning and, in any case, to be unenforceable. And their campaign contributions almost succeeded last year in sneaking into law, without even a public hearing, an amendment that would have given them unrestricted use of the spectrum's new airfill.
These issues are not so technical that they defy public understanding. They ought to be the subject of a full and fair debate. If broadcasters want to demonstrate the responsibility that entitles them to the airfill bonanza, they could begin by offering generous time for a proper airing of the subject.

HEADLINE: High Ceilings And High Tech On the Triple 7

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; SETH MYDANS is a correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IN recent years, designers have set aside their attempts to make commercial aircraft faster and concentrated instead on improving the quality of the time passengers spend in the air. The latest advance in this direction is the Boeing 777, which makes its inaugural passenger flight on Wednesday. When the first Boeing 777's go into service for United Airlines, passengers will be riding the world's largest twin-engine plane, with the most powerful aircraft engines ever made for commercial flying and some of the roomiest seats and aisles available.
And once it is fully equipped, perhaps as early as next year, the aircraft will offer both a work station and an entertainment center at each of its 292 seats. 
 United Airlines is the first buyer, having placed an order for 34 of the planes, with an option for 34 more, and until 1997 it will be the only United States carrier to fly the 777.
The first three planes have been delivered, and service will begin with Flight 921 between Heathrow Airport near London and Dulles International Airport near Washington. The other initial routes will be Denver-Chicago, Chicago-Washington and Chicago-Frankfurt.
The offering of the trans-Atlantic route has been accelerated because, in an unusual effort, the airline completed the Federal Aviation Administration's flying-hour requirements before going into service, qualifying it for extended flights over water. These requirements are usually fulfilled over about two years after an aircraft has already begun passenger service.
With faster commercial aircraft like the Concorde proving not to be economically viable on a broad scale, enhancements in passenger service now focus on offering more entertainment, in making flying time more productive and on improving the physical comfort of the flight, said David S. Stempler, executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association. In these terms, he said, the Boeing 777 demonstrates "what we are going to be seeing throughout the industry in the future."
But technical problems, which have plagued other airlines as well, have delayed the completion of all the planned entertainment and communications components on the aircraft. The airline's glossy literature touting the features of what it calls the "triple seven" contains small stickers pasted over two sections that read "Coming this fall."
On a recent tour of the aircraft here, airline officials pointed out a range of comforts, some of them still on the drawing boards. In addition to the planned entertainment and workplace features, the new planes offer a big, bright cabin with one of the rarest luxuries in the sky: space.
Among its attractions are higher ceilings, with 6 feet 4 inches of headroom in the center aisle, an inch more than is offered by the largest 747; large, accessible retracting overhead storage bins, and broader aisles that the airline says will allow a passenger to "squeeze past" when a flight attendant has a cart in the way. Coach seats are the widest available, in rows of nine -- an inch and a half wider than the economy class on the larger B747-400's.
In a key detail, the 777 as configured by United offers more legroom with extended seat pitch, the distance between a point on one seat and the same point on the seat behind it. In first class, seat pitch is 64 inches, compared with the 60 inches more common on international flights. In business class it is 49 inches, compared with the 40 inches that is standard in the industry. In economy it is 33 inches, versus the more common 31, an airline spokesman said.
Originally configured for 303 seats, the plane was reconfigured at 292 seats when United decided to provide more comfort in business class (the greatest revenue producer), according to a spokesman for the airline.
United worked closely with Boeing over the past five years to develop the 777, offering input from the cabin crew, the flight deck, engineers and maintenance staff.
Powered by two giant Pratt & Whitney PW4084 engines, the planes have a range of 4,350 miles, allowing transcontinental domestic flights as well as trans-Atlantic flights from the East Coast. United is preparing to upgrade future orders to include longer-range aircraft with a more powerful version of the engine, capable of making trans-Pacific flights. (The 747-400, the newest in that series, can fly from Chicago to Japan or from Los Angeles to Sydney.)
So far, Boeing has sold 144 of the aircraft, which fill a niche between its 767-300 and 747-400 aircraft, and optioned another 99 to a total of 15 customers worldwide. British Airways is the second customer, with 30 aircraft bought or optioned and with its first delivery scheduled for September. The next American customer will be Continental, which will take delivery of the first of 10 bought or optioned aircraft two years from now.
When the first aircraft go into service this week, a United spokesman says, passengers will have access at their seats to 6 video channels and 19 music channels, and to 2 telephones per cabin.
United expects that passengers will eventually be able to "call anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world," said Bob Ketelsen, manager of aircraft interior planning for United.
"Interactivity on a plane has been a difficult thing to make happen," he said, citing problems with weight, power, heat dissipation, miniaturization and electromagnetic interference aboard highly complex and electronically sensitive aircraft.
The hardware, already in place, includes five-and-a-half-inch video screens that, in first and connoisseur (business) class, deploy on little necks from the armrests. In economy class the screens are built into the backs of each seat.
At all seats, a small handset will eventually serve as a telephone, program selector, game controller and credit card reader (for using the telephone). On one side are all the buttons that will make it a telephone receiver. On the other are controls that will serve as a computer mouse and, when held horizontally, as a video-game joystick.
THE handset also includes a jack for a personal computer to allow the sending and receiving of faxes and electronic messages, once the telecommunications programs are complete, perhaps as early as this fall.
Once the full service is in place, built around GTE's Genstar Telecommunications System, passengers will also be able to participate in three-way conference calling and to talk to each other from one seat to another.
The six video channels will offer a choice of two feature films as well as situation comedies, video news magazines, sports, business and regional programs. In the future, perhaps in early 1996, Mr. Ketelsen said, passengers will be offered six categories of video games including card and board games, arcade offerings, puzzles and children's games. Plans are under way to add video shopping and flight information.
The new aircraft is not the first to offer individual video screens, said Rob Brookler, a spokesman for World Airline Entertainment Association, an industry group. Virgin Atlantic offers them on all its planes.
 Virgin is also among the airlines developing telephone, fax and other communications capabilities for trans-Atlantic passengers.
Mr. Brookler said he was not surprised over delays in installing all the features in the Boeing 777, as the industry wrestles with the complex new systems. "The technology is quite new and there's often a great deal more involved in getting something up and running at 35,000 feet than it might seem," he said. "We understand that with these new systems there is always a period of trouble-shooting, a period of modifications, and that's pretty much par for the course."
As the world grows smaller and the airplane becomes an extension of both the living room and the office, passengers will gain a measure of comfort and efficiency, but they may also lose one of the last, albeit cramped, retreats from an ever more interconnected world.
"Some people say, 'I'm not sure I want to be reached. You're taking away my last sanctuary,' " said Mr. Ketelsen, contemplating one of the little handsets that, if everything works, promise to change the experience of air travel.

HEADLINE: Building a Business-Friendly New York

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
AMBASSADOR is the title that most of his associates still use when speaking about Charles A. Gargano, in deference to his three-year posting to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
But the 59-year-old Republican fundraiser and former Long Island contractor added a string of other important titles to his name this year: chairman and chief executive of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development and vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 Now, after assuming this governmental empire, Mr. Gargano has set out to shrink it, rename it, relocate it and -- taking his cues from Gov. George E. Pataki -- make it more responsive to business interests.
The strategy has brought some successes in recent months. In February, for example, the International Business Machines Corporation announced it would remain in New York State and build its new world headquarters in Westchester County, not far from its current Armonk headquarters.
"I.B.M. is encouraged by the Governor's approach and attitude toward business," said Louis V. Gerstner Jr., its chairman and chief executive. A spokesman, Thomas Beermann, quoted Mr. Gerstner as saying he "had never seen a government move as quickly as the Pataki administration in working to keep a business in the state."
Three months later, after Mr. Gargano intervened personally, the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse cleared a long-standing regulatory maze and received the last state permits needed to construct a 1.2 million-square-foot, 160-store mall called the Palisades Center in West Nyack, in Rockland County. Work is to begin in two weeks.
"If our case study is any indication of what the new administration will do, we believe they will get the economy going," said Joe C. Mareane, a Pyramid executive who was director of development for the City of Syracuse from 1987 to 1993.
"What we want to do is really reach out to the business people around this state," Mr. Gargano said in a recent interview. "Phase 1: retain them here, retain jobs. And then hopefully, with the Governor's new budget, his tax-cutting program and eliminating a lot of unnecessary regulations, try to make it easier for the business person to operate in this state."
At the same time, Mr. Gargano adopted a go-slow approach toward projects that he says would rely too much on scarce government financing and too little on private investment. Among these undertakings, several of which were championed by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, are a waterfront park along the Hudson River, from Battery Park City to 59th Street; an international trade center and hotel on West 125th Street in Harlem and a 22-mile railway linking Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports to mid-Manhattan. (Indeed, George J. Marlin, the new executive director of the Port Authority, said on Wednesday that the "full 22-mile plan is dead," although segments of the railway may yet be constructed.)
In a major real-estate transaction, the development corporation and department are to move out of 100,525 square feet in 1515 Broadway, between 44th and 45th Streets. "The space we now occupy is much too expensive," Mr. Gargano said -- $42 a square foot per year. Even worse, he said, the state Job Development Authority pays $60 a square foot for 17,700 square feet at 605 Third Avenue, between 39th and 40th Streets.
"These costs are prohibitive," Mr. Gargano said. In addition, the Mortgage Loan Corporation, an affiliate of the Urban Development Corporation, occupies 26,610 square feet at 11 West 42d Street, and the Hudson River Park Conservancy, another affiliate, has 7,500 square feet at 141 Fifth Avenue.
All of the offices -- 152,335 square feet in all -- are to be consolidated in 118,206 square feet over five floors at 633 Third Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets. The space is to be purchased as a commercial condominium from the Travelers Insurance Company over the course of 12 years, at an annual cost of $3.9 million, or $33 a square foot, including operating expenses.
"The new building will bring all the agencies together and will save us several million dollars per year," Mr. Gargano said, "and we'll operate more efficiently."
The physical consolidation will also mirror the organizational changes that Mr. Gargano has initiated. He has already reduced the staff of the Urban Development Corporation to 304 from 408, or 25 percent. He has also reduced the staff of the Department of Economic Development to 344 from 445, or 23 percent.
The Harlem Urban Development Corporation and the Western New York Economic Development Corporation are being eliminated. The Job Development Authority is being merged into the development corporation and the Science and Technology Foundation is being merged into the development department.
Mr. Gargano is even changing the name of the Urban Development Corporation, to the Empire State Development Corporation. The change reflects a decentralizing of the corporation in which the staffs at its regional offices will be "beefed up," Mr. Gargano said, to make these centers "one-stop shops" for businesses seeking development assistance. Outside New York City, the offices are in Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Fishkill, Ogdensburg, Plainview, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica.
"Our regional offices should be able to use their specialized knowledge to make independent decisions," Mr. Gargano told a recent breakfast seminar sponsored by the law firm of Zetlin & De Chiara.
At the seminar, which was attended by leaders in the real estate and construction industries, Mr. Gargano was introduced by Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, who declared: "Ambassador Gargano has had every position I can think of except one -- he's never been a Democrat." After the applause subsided, Mr. Anderson added, "I knew some of you would like that."
Mr. Gargano, who lives in Manhattan, arrived in the United States as a boy from Sant'Angelo de' Lombardi in the Avellino province of southern Italy. He holds a bachelor's degree in civil engineering technology and a master's degree in business administration from Fairleigh Dickinson University, as well as a master's degree in civil engineering from Manhattan College.
From 1963 to 1981, he was vice president of the J. D. Posillico Engineering and Construction concern in Farmingdale, L.I., a public-works construction company.
In 1981, Mr. Gargano was named deputy administrator of the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration, a position he held until 1983. In 1984, he was selected by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato to direct President Reagan's re-election campaign in New York State. Four years later, he was named ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, where he served through August 1991.
Last year, Mr. Gargano was named finance chairman for Mr. Pataki's gubernatorial campaign, for which he raised more than $14 million.
Mr. Pataki did not wait for his inauguration to launch an economic development campaign, Mr. Gargano said, but reached out quickly to Mr. Gerstner to express concern about the closing of I.B.M. operations in East Fishkill and Kingston.
I.B.M.'s new corporate headquarters "could have been built anywhere in the world," Mr. Gargano said, since 60 percent of the corporation's business is overseas.
Ultimately, I.B.M. decided to remain in Westchester, which Mr. Gargano attributed to a chain of events beginning with the Governor-elect's phone call. The new headquarters will be smaller than the current building, which has 420,000 square feet, said the corporate spokesman, Mr. Beermann. It ought to be completed in 1997, he said, and the existing headquarters will be sold.
New York State has agreed to buy portions of vacant I.B.M. properties in Kingston and Endicott and to lease part of the East Fishkill property, into which it will consolidate data-center operations.
To further assist I.B.M., the state agreed to a provide lower-cost power and to forego some sales taxes on purchases like office furniture. Mr. Beermann said he could not put a figure on those incentives, as the details had not yet been worked out. He said I.B.M. was also counting on the state for help with traffic improvements and sewer hook-ups in the area.
In his speech at the breakfast seminar, Mr. Gargano vowed to provide financial incentives "only to firms where such assistance will make a tangible difference in job creation and retention."
"We will not blindly throw money, as past administrations have, at highly visible firms that try to incite bidding wars between our state and others," he declared.
In the interview, Mr. Gargano declined to identify those firms at which he believed money had been thrown. But he distinguished I.B.M. from the crowd, saying: "They came and said: 'We have made a decision to stay here because of you reaching out to us. We're saying that in advance because we're not here to bargain with you but we need some help.' And I thought that was real class. The Governor directed me to look into any kind of assistance programs. And we did just that."
The $250 million Palisades Center in West Nyack presented a different challenge. "That project was being held up as a result of bureaucratic problems and little issues in different agencies," Mr. Gargano said. "One of the things that Governor Pataki wants us in his cabinet to do -- and specifically me -- is to coordinate and say, 'Where is the problem?' And we did just that."
Besides 160 stores, the four-level mall, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, is to have a 2,100-seat food court, a skating rink, a 16-screen movie theater and more than 6,000 parking spaces. It is being built on two landfills bounded by the New York State Thruway and Routes 59 and 303. Because of its size and location, the project has faced much opposition over the years from environmentalists and town residents.
Having spent a decade trying to emerge from the regulatory maze, Pyramid executives came well prepared May 2 to make their appeal to Mr. Gargano. In fact, they came a bit too well prepared, having put together a slide show for his benefit. "He let us know that we could call him when it was over," Mr. Mareane said. With the show canceled, Mr. Mareane said, the discussion "very quickly boiled down to a question of where the gridlock was focused." The Pyramid executives said they were awaiting permits from the state Transportation and Environmental Conservation Departments.
By the time the executives got up to leave Mr. Gargano's office, on the 52d floor of 1515 Broadway, the chairman was already on the phone to other state officials. By the time they returned to their headquarters in Syracuse that afternoon, the Pyramid executives had received a call from the Transportation Commissioner, John B. Daly, assuring them that he would look into the matter. By May 17, the permits were in place. And Pyramid plans to begin construction this month.
Thomas J. Valenti, a partner in Pyramid, said that Mr. Gargano's predecessor, Vincent Tese, and Mr. Tese's executive deputy commissioner, Alan C. Sullivan, "gave us great attention."
"I can't say enough about the effort they tried to give us," Mr. Valenti said, "but the fact is that we didn't reach a conclusion." In contrast, he said, "Mr. Gargano cut through politics, he cut through jurisdictional lines."
To judge from the Pataki administration's handling of Palisades Center, Mr. Valenti said, "they're going to turn the trend around from where businesses are fleeing New York to where businesses are going to want to come in."
AS an example of the business he would like to draw, Mr. Gargano cited a semiconductor plant that Motorola plans to build in Virginia to serve the northeast. "Why wasn't New York chosen?" he asked. His own answer: taxes, wages and energy costs are lower in Virginia and state officials "show -- by their actions -- that they really want major employers to create jobs."
"There's no reason why New York can't be as successful as Virginia and other states in attracting businesses," Mr. Gargano said.
David Shaffer, president of the Public Policy Institute at the Business Council of New York State, said he was encouraged by Mr. Gargano's interest in Motorola. "This is the kind of thing New York ought to be able to get," he said. "The past attitude was that these things don't happen or that you have to give away the store to get them."
Mr. Gargano does not believe that the state and city are giving away the store by subsidizing the redevelopment of 42d Street. Instead, he has been very visible in his embrace of a project that began under the Cuomo administration.
THE keystone is seen as a plan by the Walt Disney Company to lease the landmark New Amsterdam Theater, which is owned by the state, and renovate it for live productions. Disney would put $8 million of its own money into the reconstruction, which would cost at least $29 million. The state and city would lend the balance, at interest rates of 3 percent for the first $21 million and at 3.5 percent for an additional $5 million contingency fund.
"Sometimes when you need particular participation, you make an investment to attract others," Mr. Gargano said. "And I think Disney was an important element for 42d Street; the image of Disney, as compared with the image that's there today."
Moreover, he said, the city and state would be paid part of the gross sales every year -- 2 percent of the first $20 million and 3 percent on sales above that. "There will be a return over time," Mr. Gargano said. "The money will come back in ticket sales. It's not like we're giving a grant."
By contrast, he said, the Hudson River park project depends primarily on money from the state. "If we had deep pockets, we could forge ahead with that," Mr. Gargano said, "but I think we have to move ahead slowly because the budget doesn't allow us to do what we want to do."
Another major waterfront project that Mr. Gargano has inherited is Queens West, a commercial and residential development on Hunters Point, along the East River. He said he was pleased that construction might begin this fall on the first apartment building. "But we're going to need more private commitment in order for that project to move apace," he said. "And there has to be a market for the type of facilities and structures that are being planned."
Mr. Gargano said he will also apply the market test to the 22-story Harlem International Trade Center, planned at 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard (formerly Lenox Avenue). "To support an $85 million facility takes a lot of business, hotel business, office rental," Mr. Gargano said. "You don't build something unless you really know that there's a market for it."
Mr. Gargano has already antagonized development officials and politicians in Harlem with his decision to close the Harlem Urban Development Corporation. "It has not been a productive office," he said.
But Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, said the local corporation had "done a lot of good and is important to the Harlem community."
"If indeed there were problems with the board or the personnel," Mr. Rangel said, "the community is always open to suggestions as to how we could redesign it or shape it in a way that the Governor would find more consistent with his ideas."

HEADLINE: An Unconventional Course Tries to Fly

BYLINE: BY JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
A GROUP of 50 Fairfield University students and faculty members had good reason to feel discouraged as they huddled together on a remote airstrip in Stratford this month. On an afternoon that was to have culminated in an unusual business course project, just about everything seemed to have gone wrong.
The weather was atrocious: a cold and steady rain had pelted the group for almost two hours. Because of the weather, apparently, they had been unable to launch any of the eight Piper J-3 Cub model airplanes that 83 Fairfield University students had built. Then when one of the planes was launched, it rose only about 20 feet before diving and crashing upside down. 
 But aided by members of the Connecticut Model Airplane Club, who had helped the students throughout the school year, the group remained undaunted.
And finally, almost two hours after launch time, the same yellow and green plane, undamaged despite its mishap moments earlier, soared skyward.
Only this time it rose about 50 feet, made two loops and came in for a smooth landing as the students and professors cheered.
"It was a poignant moment," said J. Michael Cavanaugh, an assistant professor of management at the university, whose decision it was to use model airplane building as an integral part of a business course for Fairfield University sophomores. "The project certainly would not have been considered a failure if none of the planes got off the ground, but getting one in the air was a significant, symbolic gesture."
It was also the climax of an innovative business course that had given students a hands-on learning experience about the business world.
The airstrip, in a field close by the Sikorsky Memorial Airport, was in a sense an extension of the classroom that for eight months had been a spacious basement in Dolan Hall, a campus building that had been used for storage purposes in recent years.
There, the students, divided into eight classes of about 25 students each, had built eight six-foot-long model planes that weigh about 10 pounds and have 10 1/2-foot wing spans.
A drastic departure from conventional business courses, BU 100 is reflective of a reorganization of the university's School of Business under the new dean, Russell Boisjoly, that stresses interdisciplinary courses. A gift of $250,000 from the General Electric Company, whose world headquarters are in Fairfield, aided in the development of the new curriculum.
The course, Dr. Cavanaugh said, was "an act of desperation" when he first offered it in the summer of 1993 at the University of Massachusetts, where he has taught summer courses. A member of the Fairfield University faculty for the last five years, Dr. Cavanaugh contends that no one has been happy with the content and format of traditional business course curriculums.
"There's been a real panic among many business schools because of the drop-off in enrollment, which has been about 15 percent since 1989," he said. "We feel there's been a gap between what is being taught and what students really need to know to connect with the business world. And we have to make the curriculum more exciting."
Many business school graduates, Dr. Cavanaugh said, have lacked communications skills and an ability to comprehend "political situations" in the business world.
"We haven't been preparing students adequately for the dynamic environment that exists in a global economy, and we've had to rethink what we've been doing," he said. "You have to take the principles of the course out and actually live them. If you don't do that, they just stay in the notebook. And we, as teachers, are accountable and have to back up what we're teaching."
"In this case, the planes are a means to an end," Dr. Cavanaugh said. "The objective was to turn the classroom into a laboratory, and to stress the active rather than the passive."
In effect, the students in BU 100 built their own business organization. Along the way, they determined how much each plane would cost and established an overall cost schedule. Then, on their own, they decided how various tasks would be done and who would do them.
As Dr. Cavanaugh explained it, the project required student involvement in accounting, finance, marketing, business law and operations management. "It was a daunting project, a real challenge," he said.
Dr. Cavanaugh concedes it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to have built the Piper J-3 Cub model planes from balsa wood without the help of the Connecticut Model Airplane Club, which operates out of a small trailer off Lordship Boulevard in Stratford.
"They were our aero-mavens, and they were indispensable," Dr. Cavanaugh said. "Along the way, they kind of adopted us." Indeed, some of the members went often to the classes on campus to lend their expertise in the building of the planes, which were built to one-quarter scale.
Not all of the classes worked at the same pace. "Some paced themselves while some had to cram near the end of the course," Dr. Cavanaugh said. But all of the planes were ready by launch time.
Dr. Cavanaugh conceded that gender issues did arise at times in some of the classes. "In a couple of instances there were disagreements, but over all everyone worked together pretty well," he said. "I don't think either gender had any advantage or disadvantage."
Oscar Jensen, one of the professors who taught the course, said he thought that the women among the students "stayed at it a bit more while some of the boys stayed away from classes for a while."
"Some of the girls became the leaders," he said.
Dr. Jensen said there had been some resistance to the new concept. "Like grown-ups, some students don't like change," he said. "They wanted to learn about business the old way."
But Dr. Cavanaugh and Dr. Jensen said they thought that most of the students were receptive to the new approach. Laurent Painchaud of Southport, a coordinator for the team whose plane was successfully launched, said he felt that the model airplane project helped bring the students closer together.
"Working with your peers helped a lot," said Mr. Painchaud, adding that he believed that the course already had benefited him in his outside job as the sales manager at a Westport store that sells sailboats and sailing accessories. "The course taught you how to work as a team and the importance of planning and meeting deadlines," he said.
Mr. Painchaud said he was looking forward to seeing his team's plane on display at the Barone Campus Center, where it is scheduled to be hung for all to see.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Owning Shares In a Co-op
 
Q Are individuals the only ones who can own shares in a co-op? Or can other entities, such as corporations and limited partnerships, also own shares? . . . Mike Lichtman, Manhattan.
 
A Until 1986, only individuals could own shares in a co-op, said Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is also chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives. But since the enactment of the Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986, Mr. Weinstein said, any legal entity can become a shareholder in a co-op. 
 "That includes corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships and trusts," Mr. Weinstein said.
He added that co-op boards should exercise caution before permitting the sale or transfer of co-op shares to any "legal entity" other than a human being.
"The identity of the occupant of the unit should be known and agreed to by the co-op, and the co-op should be assured that the owner of the unit has the financial resources to pay maintenance charges," Mr. Weinstein said. "Many co-ops require a separate occupancy agreement and a personal financial guarantee before they will consent to ownership by an entity other than a person. And that is absolutely a wise move."
Breach of the occupancy agreement, Mr. Weinstein said, could be grounds for cancellation of the proprietary lease. "If someone else moves in, and the right documents are in place, that could be treated as an illegal sublet," he said.
 
When Amortization Is Negative
 
Q What is meant by "negative amortization?" Under what types of mortgage formats will it occur? . . . Erica W. Potts, Manhattan.
 
A "Negative amortization occurs when the monthly payments a borrower makes do not cover the full interest payment on a mortgage," said Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a mortgage broker in Manhattan. "The amount of the difference -- what the bank is owed for interest -- then gets added to the principal of the loan."
Typically, Ms. Scott said, negative amortization loans are used when borrowers want the benefit of low-interest, adjustable-rate mortgages, but also want to keep their monthly payments constant.
"It's only a problem when interest rates are going up," Ms. Scott said, explaining that when interest rates rise on a ordinary adjustable-rate mortgage the monthly payments change to cover the increase. On the other hand, she said, when interest rates rise on a negative amortization adjustable-rate mortgage, the monthly payments stay the same while the principal balance on the loan increases to cover the difference between the old interest rate and the new one.
"It's not necessarily a bad thing," Ms. Scott said. "I've sold mortgages like this to Wall Street types who know exactly what they're doing. They say, 'I don't care if I get $10,000 less when I sell my property. I'll invest the money in the meantime.' "
Such mortgages, however, are not appealing to "Wall Street types" alone. Kevin McConnell, a Manhattan lawyer and former Assistant Attorney General in the Real Estate Finance Bureau of the New York State Attorney General's office, said that negative amortization loans are appropriate for other borrowers as well.
"You see elderly folks doing it," Mr. McConnell said. "In many cases, the equity in their home at the time of their death is not of particular concern to them. And it keeps down their mortgage payments."

 BODY:
AT a local commercial station, the news director will say, 'Give me the pictures, and we'll do a story around it,' " said Michael Fairhurst, the news director at New Jersey Network. "We say, 'Give us issues, and we'll do a story around it.' "
In a state where television coverage almost invariably originates somewhere else and tends toward the hit-or-miss, the state-financed public television network -- created in 1971 expressly to provide New Jersey programs -- is a sober and comprehensive exception. 
 With the gravity that viewers expect from CNN or a national network, NJN's 30-minute evening newscast covers political and economic developments in Trenton and in the counties. Special reports focus on visually unexciting topics like tort reform.
The news is broadcast at 6 P.M., and rebroadcast at 7 and 11, on the network's four UHF channels, in Montclair, New Brunswick, Camden and Trenton. The PBS station WNET/Channel 13, which is based in Newark, also carries it at 6 P.M.
"When I watch it, I learn something," said Cliff Zukin, a professor of politics and mass media at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers. "I can find out what government did that day. I can't say that about any of the New York stations. When I watch them, I learn about fires, rapes, arsons."
But NJN's future is in peril. Squeezed by low ratings and reductions in the state budget, the newscast was cut last year from an hour. Five staff members from the news division have been laid off in the last three years, leaving seven full-time and two part-time reporters in the main office in Trenton and bureaus in Newark and Camden.
And Governor Whitman has proposed cutting off all state financing for the network over six or seven years. Right now the network gets nearly half its $13 million annual budget from the state; the rest comes from private corporations and foundations and from viewers. Whether it could survive without any funds from the state is unclear.
Even those who favor the Governor's plan typically support the network and its newscast, saying it fills a vital gap. (And even Mrs. Whitman has appeared on NJN fund-raising shows.)
In a 1994 study, two researchers from Rutgers found that the New York stations, when they covered New Jersey at all, focused primarily on accidents, disasters and crime. By contrast, during the week of May 22, 1995, NJN carried reports on everything from domestic-abuse legislation in New Jersey to former Gov. Thomas H. Kean's endorsement of Lamar Alexander in the Republican Presidential race, from a business initiative in Mercer County to a report on the state's economic health. Crime coverage was generally condensed in a brief overview of the day's events.
As NJN News loses state financing, it will also face the problem of chronically low ratings. In the New York market area, which includes 16 out of 21 counties in New Jersey, the 6 P.M. newscast is watched by just 4,000 households, according to Nielsen Media Research, and the 7 and 11 P.M. rebroadcasts by 5,000 each. Bill Jobes, NJN's general manager, said the network would survey viewers to find out what they want to see and what they think of the newscast.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
As Tax Debate Simmers, Senate Counts Dollars

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
June has arrived, which means that the Whitman administration has less than a month to overcome the grumbling among its fellow Republicans in the Senate and get its 15 percent tax cut passed in time for the budget deadline, June 30.
Not to worry, the administration says. Last year's 10 percent cut was not even introduced until the second week in June, and it passed with days to spare. Still, there are only two voting sessions and two committee hearings scheduled for the rest of the month, and there are plenty of worried noises coming from the Republican Senate leadership itself, once again demonstrating the knots that powerful people can tie themselves into while trying to maintain a rigid public posture on an important issue. 
 The drama this month will all be in the Senate, since on the matter of tax cuts, the Assembly's assent is a foregone conclusion. All 80 members are up for re-election this fall, and even the Democrats will swallow their warnings and vote yes, just as most of them voted last week for Mrs. Whitman's Transportation Trust Fund refinancing, after first warning, correctly, about the huge increase in debt the measure will cost.
But the Senate's members are not up for re-election until 1997, and some of the upper chamber's most important members are grumbling loudly about being pushed to pass a tax cut they consider premature and of doubtful fiscal wisdom.
One is Robert Littell, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, the starting point for all fiscal measures, who as everyone knows by now is worried about the potential impact of Federal budget cuts on the $5 billion New Jersey receives annually from Washington.
Then there is Senator Peter Inverso, Mr. Littell's vice chairman and a certified public accountant, who fears that, even without Federal cuts, the numbers don't add up. Almost two months ago the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services issued an analysis of state revenues for the coming year that concluded that New Jersey would take in half a billion dollars less than the amount forecast by the Whitman administration, even if every nuisance tax and fee that the Governor is depending on is enacted.
The disparity was a matter of misunderstanding and methodology that would soon be resolved, said the treasurer, Brian W. Clymer, at the time. And indeed the discrepancy has been narrowed, a little, to $385 million, which is still a huge gap.
Given the uncertainty, Mr. Inverso has been going around asking, "What's the rush?" The tax cut would not take effect until the start of the tax year in January anyway, he reasons, so why not delay passage of the cut until Congress has decided what to cut, the President has decided what to veto, and the economy has decided if it wants to resume last fall's modest rate of growth or if it wants to stall, as some fear?
In an attempt to accommodate Mrs. Whitman's desire to press on regardless, Mr. Inverso has suggested "revenue triggers," a series of 5 percent tax cuts totaling 15 percent that would click sequentially into place as the revenue to cover their cost comes in. But still, the answer from the Governor is "no." Under the constitution, the Legislature may work only from the Governor's revenue forecast, not someone else's, Mr. Clymer reminds the stragglers, and the Governor's numbers say the books are balanced with the tax cut first.
Why such intransigence in the face of such uncertainty? Especially considering that, last fall, the Governor was willing to admit that the economy might not support another tax cut for a while?
One reason is probably just personal -- that after having signed off on Mr. Clymer's assurance that the money would be there, Mrs. Whitman would find it distasteful to climb down and offer a delay. After all, her signature phrase is "I keep my promises."
The Democrats and even some Republicans complain that the Governor is being rigid to protect her national reputation and her prospects for national office, but that hardly makes sense. Mrs. Whitman's standing with the national Republican Party is already cemented, while balancing her liberal positions on abortion, affirmative action and gay rights on a national ticket would take someone so right wing that Mrs. Whitman wouldn't run with him anyway.
No, the politics of Mrs. Whitman's intransigence is local in nature, and its logic is simple: Delaying tax cuts could risk derailing them entirely as the Legislature comes under more and more pressure to maintain the status quo. Public employee unions are driving hard to prevent the layoffs that will pay for part of the tax cuts; the families of patients at the big psychiatric hospitals slated for closing are similarly organizing a counter-offensive, and normally friendly school district officials are eager to pick apart a budget that offers them no new aid money and plenty of aggravation from stringent new fiscal rules.
The ace up the Governor's sleeve is sticking out so far that everyone can see it: the $500 million surplus she has budgeted for. Chances are that when push comes to shove, the Governor will give up some of that money to reassure nervous senators, save a few jobs, and postpone until a little later the final reckoning of what the tax cuts will really cost.

HEADLINE: New York Philharmonic? Not to Worry, Says Caramoor

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: KATONAH

 BODY:
WHEN the news broke that the New York Philharmonic might make its summer home in the fields of Purchase College, the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts here was preparing to celebrate its own milestone: 50 years of summer music making in the county.
Howard Herring, Caramoor's executive director, said he did not fear the competition the Philharmonic might pose. To the contrary, he said: "Their presence would define us even more vividly as an intimate music festival that relies only on the acoustic properties of its theaters and is on a human scale." He added: "If they choose to come to Westchester, we would welcome them to the region." 
 The Caramoor Music Festival, which runs from June 24 through Aug. 13 this year, has long shared artists like Yo-Yo Ma, Kathleen Battle and Andre Watts with other major festivals and has gained new vitality under the artistic leadership of Andre Previn, who is also a frequent guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic. Yet even a short visit to the former Walter and Lucie Rosen estate conveys Caramoor's distinctive tone.
The main house, which displays the late Mr. and Mrs. Rosen's collections of paintings, sculpture, ceramics, textiles and furniture dating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, was opened to the public as a museum in 1970. The estate's 100-acre grounds have been rejuvenated in recent years by the mostly volunteer Garden Guild, under the direction of its administrator, Candida Fitts, and the staff horticulturalist, Eileen Burton. Their efforts can be seen at every turn, in the greenhouse where plantings are cultivated and in colorful beds designed to attract butterflies and yield flowers all summer long.
The Mediterranean-style Garden Guild Courtyard will be open for the first time this year with patio tables, new paving stones and a array of plants for sale. Nurtured by a staff that has felt the sting of cutbacks to the arts, sites like the Sunken Garden and the Italian Pavilion have become popular with concertgoers, who stroll among the begonias at intermission and gaze beyond the lilies at the stars.
The intimacy Mr. Herring spoke of was not hyperbole, despite the seating capacity of 1,650 in the tented Venetian Theater, which surpasses by 300 the largest theater at Purchase College. Mr. Herring runs a tight ship, not permitting picnickers to remain on their blankets once a concert has begun and staging one performance at a time. The festival might prefer to present a chamber music concert in the Spanish Courtyard, which is enclosed by the main house, at the same time as an orchestra is playing in the Venetian Theater, but the acoustics won't allow it. "The sound travels, and you can hear the music in the other theater," the director said.
The Rosens presented concerts for their friends in the Music Room of the house, and in 1946 began to give a limited number of concerts for the public. After Mr. Rosen, a lawyer and financier, died in 1951, his wife remained at Caramoor, taking the music outside to the Spanish Courtyard and initiating construction of the larger Venetian Theater in 1957. When she died in 1968, the couple's daughter, Anne Bigelow Stern, continued the festival and introduced the Orchestra of St. Luke's to Caramoor. The ensemble will begin its 16th season in residence here this summer.
Mr. Previn, a formidable musician whom Mr. Herring described as "a runaway train" of energy and ideas, became part of the scene after moving to nearby Bedford Hills six years ago. Mr. Previn, a conductor, composer and pianist who displays all three facets at Caramoor, heightened the presence of jazz here and began a program called Rising Stars, which provides a chance for emerging talents to work with accomplished classical artists and perform chamber music with them here after 10 days of intensive coaching.
Rising Stars heralded Caramoor's expansion into a year-round arts center with spring and fall concerts, an opera series, book readings and educational events like Renaissance Days, which immerse sixth graders from disadvantaged areas in Renaissance culture at no expense to the students or the schools. One recent morning strolling musicians, jesters and a falconer captivated a group of youngsters from the Bronx.
Mr. Herring said he hoped to replicate Renaissance Days as an arts and education program linked to social studies curriculums nationwide, and as a first step has arranged for the Harvard University Graduate School of Education to evaluate the program.
But even as Caramoor has expanded, raising its budget to $1.9 million today from $1.3 million when Mr. Herring arrived in 1986 and increasing its number of visitors to 60,000 a year from 20,000 during the same period, the center has also faced cutbacks. "With the recession, we tightened our focus," Mr. Herring said. "At a 1993 board retreat we reached a watershed. We said that making music at the highest possible level is what this institution is about -- in the context of the gardens and the house.
"We agreed to be proactive in searching for the best young players. Whatever was outside that focus was left behind. We shortened the staff -- hired fewer in the summers for the box office and grounds -- and used more volunteers. Either we did things with volunteers or we didn't do it."
The center also reduced its marketing budget, cut its advertising in half and scaled back other promotions, convinced that "our product would stand on its own," the director said. "But we didn't cut our artist budget," he added. "It was a strategic decision: the last thing you do is touch your product."
Mr. and Mrs. Rosen left what Mr. Herring called a "modest cash reserve," which dwindled with upkeep of the estate, making an endowment campaign critical to Caramoor's survival. "We are up to $1.5 million now," he said. "Our goal is $3.5 million." Some of the fund-raising events planned for the near future are an anniversary gala on June 15 featuring Tony Bennett and Mariah Carey, a benefit concert on July 15 and an antiques show from Sept. 15 through Sept. 17.
Among the limitations and, possibly, the charms of Caramoor, are its relative remoteness. Situated on a country road off Route 22, it is accessible by car or bicycle. Public transportation is nowhere in sight once passengers alight from the Katonah Metro-North train station two miles away.
The center touts the fact that the American Bus Association named the summer festival "one of the top 100 events in North America in 1995." Surprisingly, though, neither the Caramoor administration nor the County Department of Cultural Affairs has been moved to make the center a stop on the Bee Line.
An attempt was made several years ago to link Metro-North riders from Manhattan with a shuttle bus from the Katonah station, but that effort was "a victim of the recession," Mr. Herring said. "Looking to the future," he said, "I would love to come up with a way to make Caramoor as easy for a New Yorker as Grand Central Station."
As it is, 25 percent of Caramoor's audience drives here from Manhattan, while 50 percent are from Westchester, 20 percent from Connecticut and 5 percent from elsewhere. Cars line the fields on concert nights, as ticketholders move along lighted paths toward their seats in the open air.
Mr. Herring and others here believe music lovers will continue to come for what they call "the Caramoor experience" no matter what new attractions settle in the county. "One of the primary reasons we're still here after 50 years is that we're a whole lot more than just great music," the director said. "Aspen has the mountains, Santa Fe has its sunsets, and here it is verdant and fragrant. We make great music in an extraordinary setting."

To the Editor:
Had Pat H. Broeske bothered to check the Consumer Price Index over the past few decades, she might have drastically revised her list of the 50 highest-grossing films ["The Top Money Makers, for Now," May 14].
Of course, the totals indicated in her list probably include receipts over a number of years (from overseas distribution, videos, etc.), but it is likely that for films of the 1960's and early 70's, most income was generated within a very few years of release. 
 In terms of 1994 dollars, "Close Encounters" made $406 million, "The Sting" made $535 million, "The Exorcist" made $550 million, "E. T." made $614 million and "The Sound of Music" made $790 million.
As for "Snow White" and "Gone With the Wind," keep in mind that a 1945 dollar represents more than $8 today.

HEADLINE: Banging a Tin Cup With a Silver Spoon

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
THERE was a time in municipal finance when troubled cities, like New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland, that teetered on the brink of bankruptcy did everything they could -- cut jobs, raise taxes and issue new bonds -- to keep themselves afloat and pay off their debts.
But Orange County, Calif., is doing something far different -- and, many say, unthinkable. This county, one of the wealthiest in the nation, is seeking to use every legal option to wriggle out of its financial obligations. First, there was the stunning decision to file for bankruptcy to protect itself from those to whom it owed money after the county made a wrong-way bet on interest rates with billions in public dollars. 
 And since then, the county has hired platoons of corporate bankruptcy lawyers to challenge in court the basic underpinnings of municipal finance -- the moral and legal obligation of a municipal borrower to pay its debts. Unlike the Clevelands and the New Yorks, which underwent considerable pain to protect their names, Orange County is trying to avoid both pain and payments.
"Remember when governments paid their debts?" asked Daniel N. Heimowitz, director of public finance for Moody's Investor Service, the bond rating agency. "When New York City had trouble, it was difficult, but it was a neat package. Orange County is just concerned about avoidance. They are part of a new game. They are violating the trust that holds up this market and this will seriously jeopardize all bond issuers and buyers."
Indeed, the Orange County bankruptcy is turning into a broader tale of morality and money, where many experts see primal notions' of honor and duty being ignored. At first, it was thought that Orange County's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 6 was merely a way for stunned officials to gain some breathing room after a sudden financial debacle. But now, analysts say, it is clear that the filing was just the first of several steps in an entirely different direction. So far, no other municipality has tried to emulate what Orange County has done and there is little evidence yet that the overall market for municipal bonds has been drastically altered by its actions. But clearly, Orange County is testing the rules of engagement.
"You are not looking at a destitute entity," said Joseph Deane, a managing director at Smith Barney. "What you are looking at is a wealthy deadbeat. In anybody's mind, they have the ability to pay."
On Friday, Orange County completed an agreement that its short-term noteholders will be asked to accept and filed it with the bankruptcy court. The proposed deal requires investors to wait another year before getting back $975 million in short-term borrowings --if at all -- and to receive less in interest than they expected.
In the world of municipal finance, this is a default: failing to provide timely and full repayment of borrowings. While this pending agreement gives Orange County some immediate financial relief, investors see this as typical of Orange County's dealings with them. Rather than come up with ways to repay this debt, the county came up with a plan that bondholders may have no choice but to accept. Moreover, the plan itself gives them little comfort that they will even be repaid a year from now.
Where other troubled municipalities avoided bankruptcy, Orange County has embraced it. Where other troubled municipalities lacked money, Orange County has plenty. And where many other troubled municipalities never defaulted on their bonds, Orange County already has failed to meet its obligations to some of its bondholders and is threatening to take even more drastic actions against other noteholders.
Shortly after the bankruptcy filing, Orange County began siphoning money that had been set aside to pay off bondholders and used it to cover continuing expenses. With that money gone, the county ha no choice but to seek accommodation with its short-term noteholders. And, in a move many in municipal finance say would be unconscionable, several county officials are also talking about possibly repudiating, or not paying back at all, $600 million in taxable notes the county issued last summer.
This attitude is roiling the municipal bond markets, and it is troubling to many of those intimately involved, including Orange County's chief executive, William J. Popejoy. "I think there is a need to revisit what is right and what is wrong," said Mr. Popejoy, a former savings and loan executive who was brought in after the bankruptcy. "It is right for a county, especially one as wealthy as this one, to pay its obligations."
But that does not seem to be the prevailing attitude within the county and even among some of Orange County's most prominent political leaders. A proposal to raise the sales tax by half a cent to help the county out of its financial mess is unpopular, and its chances of passage in a June 27 election are unclear. Even if the measure is approved, the vote will come too late to stave off the default. And the measure may still not raise enough money to solve the county's fundamental problems.
Add to all that the continuing antitax sentiment in California that first produced the 17-year-old Proposition 13, which placed a 1 percent cap on property tax rates and limited the ability of local governments to borrow for public projects. The result, county officials say, is their hands are tied.
"The county may be wealthy, but the county government is not wealthy," said Bruce Bennett of Hennigan, Mercer & Bennett, which represents Orange County in the bankruptcy proceeding. "Even though the tax base of the county is very wealthy, the county government doesn't have unrestricted access to it. The municipality has the ability to pay, but the county government does not have the power to raise taxes."
The Orange County bankruptcy is being handled much more like a high-stakes corporate bankruptcy than a bailout of a troubled government entity. The county is being represented by top-flight bankruptcy lawyers -- its legal costs have already reached $25 million -- rather than municipal finance experts. Those involved say negotiators for the county, instead of focusing on ways to meet the general obligation pledge to repay all of Orange County's bonds in full when they come due, are pursuing a cents-on-the-dollar strategy.
The treatment of the noteholders serves as an example of that. "It's a cram-down," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a trade publication. "Even at the best, most optimistic interpretation, it's far from a done deal and the county still has to come up with the money a year from now."
Orange County may look like a corporate bankruptcy, but there are some unusual twists. "This is an area that's largely untested," said Paul S. Maco, director of the Office of Municipal Securities at the Securities and Exchange Commission. "What does it mean once you cross into bankruptcy with someone who issues general obligation bonds? What are the municipal bondholders to do? They can't seize the courthouse. All you have is the word of the state or the county behind these bonds."
Orange County's actions turn municipal finance on its head. The entire $1.2 trillion municipal bond market -- which finances schools, roads, sewers and other civic projects -- rests on general obligation debt. This debt, the most common kind in the market, is based on the issuer's promise to do everything within its sovereign power to pay off its bondholders.
General obligation municipal bonds are considered second only to United States Treasury securities as the safest form of debt and are typically bought by the most conservative investors.
Unlike the corporate bond market, holders of municipal bonds have little recourse beyond a municipality's good word. Troubled municipalities cannot go out of business like failed corporations, which then can be carved up, leaving their assets to be used to pay creditors. This concept has been set forth in case law: municipal creditors cannot foreclose on the courthouse or any other essential government service. As a result, issues like trust and honor are more fundamental to the functioning of the municipal bond market than to the market for corporate securities.
"Until Orange County, no one ever questioned the moral obligation of municipal debt," said James E. Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy expert with Chapman & Cutler, a Chicago law firm. "Rather than paying off their debts, they are using the same techniques as high-yield corporate debt bankruptcies of the late 1980's. No one in Orange County is saying that their creditors will be paid in full."
Besides the county's decision to delay repayment on its $975 million in short-term debt, experts in the municipal market are even more concerned by the county's latest maneuver. It has taken legal steps that lay the groundwork for it to repudiate a $600 million taxable note issued last summer. While an option only if the sales tax proposal is rejected by voters, even raising the possibility of repudiation is almost unheard of in municipal finance.
"This story keeps unraveling from worse to worse," said Mr. Mysak. "This is just one big, big mistake. No other municipality has taken this route."
Municipal bankruptcies and defaults are extremely rare. Most took place during the Depression, when some municipalities literally ran out of money. There have been about 120 municipal bankruptcies since 1979, but most were special tax districts or tiny local governments. Even the nonpayment of some of the billions of dollars in debt issued by the Washington Public Power Supply, which was unable to complete construction of some nuclear power plants, resulted from a 1983 court decision and involved bonds backed by specified revenues from running the power plants rather than general obligation bonds.
The celebrated near-bankruptcies -- New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and, now, Washington, D.C., -- affected governments that were practically broke. Yet, even in these cases, the municipalities solved their problems outside of bankruptcy court and avoided the stigma of widespread default by coming up with complicated rescue packages requiring new taxes, severe municipal belt-tightening, and the imposition of outside fiscal overseers. In the case of New York, all short-term debtholders were paid in full, some immediately and some only slightly later.
Institutional buyers of municipal securities have been particularly outraged by Orange County's approach. In a strongly worded letter, representatives of 33 different municipal bond mutual funds, with nearly $25 billion in California tax-free securities, wrote California Gov. Pete Wilson on May 15 that Orange County's "apparent equivocation" in paying its bonds could undermine investor confidence in all California securities.
This comes just as California's "borrowing season" is about to begin -- when hundreds of municipalities borrow for short periods to tide them over between their outlays for government expenses and their receipt of tax payments.
"Orange County is making the whole municipal market less efficient," said Randy Mercer, a senior vice president at the Benham Group, a mutual fund company based in Mountain View, Calif. "Parties that once trusted one another don't any more. All the small cities and school districts won't die. But they will face higher borrowing costs and that will cause them to bleed."
Mr. Mercer predicts that California municipalities that want to borrow may well have to pay higher interest rates in the future to cover this greater uncertainty. As far as Orange County specifically, investors say their future appetite for Orange County debt will depend on how this crisis is resolved. Investors are likely to remain interested -- but at a higher price -- if the county only defaults on its short-term notes. If it repudiates some debt entirely, investors might have a frostier response.
Public finance in California is based on an extremely complicated web of legal theories, most of which have evolved from court decisions over the last century. Nearly three-quarters of all California borrowings do not fall under the state's Constitution, but are done by cities, counties and special districts that offer the same legal protections as Orange County's debt was supposed to provide. Mr. Heimowitz of Moody's said Orange County is "starting to pull on this one thread and by doing so threatens to unravel the complicated fabric of California public finance."
Another big question is what will happen when Orange County seeks to re-enter the municipal bond markets. New York, for instance, could not borrow on its own behalf for six years after its financial crisis. Cleveland was shut out of the market for five years, Philadelphia for three. Meanwhile, all new financings were handled through special financial control boards, like the New York Municipal Assistance Corporation, with the power to intercept tax revenues to pay off recovery bonds. But Orange County is already talking about trying to borrow while it is still in bankruptcy.
Under any circumstances, disclosure of risks, which is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission before any municipal issuer comes to market, would be tricky. "It's the whole issue of willingness to pay," said one municipal bond industry leader, who asked not to be named. "When you borrow money, do you have to disclose that you might not pay it back?"
Jane Eddy, a municipal bond analyst at the Standard & Poor's Rating Group, said that the county's "lack of willingness" to repay debts will haunt it for years. She said the county will face higher borrowing costs and will never regain the trust it once enjoyed. "It would be naive to assume that, once out of bankruptcy the county would never again choose that option should tough times arise," she said.
Already, the county is finding the going tough. A planned $275 million recovery bond issue is in serious trouble. The county was trying to sell these bonds to repay the approximately 200 different school districts, cities and county agencies that lost money in the collapsed investment fund run by Robert C. Citron, the former treasurer, who pleaded guilty to fraud in the matter.
The MBIA Insurance Corporation, however, has refused to insure these bonds because it does not trust Orange County's willingness-to-pay promise. The county now faces the uncomfortable choice of either abandoning the plan or paying as much as $50 million more by restructuring the deal to lure investors to accept the paper.
Some local officials speak of a bailout by the state. And it may come to that if the sales tax increase fails, though any such bailout would undoubtedly include imposition of a strict fiscal regimen by outside monitors. So far, legislators in Sacramento have been reluctant, on moral grounds, to provide aid to a county that has plenty of resources of its own.
With most Orange County politicians unwilling to give up any control to state monitors, reluctant to tighten their belt further or challenge the antitax spirit of local voters, state officials see no reason to help out. "I cannot jeopardize my state's overall credit rating," said Matthew Fong, the state Treasurer, "to bail out Orange County."
That leaves Orange County to the mercy of bond buyers. But why should investors be particularly accommodating toward the county's complex new recovery borrowing plans, asks Mr. Heimowitz of Moody's, when at the same time it "threatens to stab existing bondholders in the back?"

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Once-Humbled Thrifts Are Outrunning the Pack

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY is hot, but savings and loans are hotter.
S.& L.'s? The same institutions whose recklessness personified the excesses of the 1980's? Whose penchant for risky loans nearly caused a financial meltdown? And whose bailout, at last tally, cost American taxpayers more than $200 billion? 
 Yep. Savings and loan companies are enjoying a terrific year, thanks to more predictable interest rates, an increase in mergers and acquisitions and, at last, a recovery in the moribund market for California real estate.
What's more, even though the stocks of these thrifts have come a long way, there are good buys for the investor, said James J. McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a New York investment bank specializing in commercial banks and thrifts.
"A lot of the good news is built into the valuations at these levels," Mr. McDermott allowed. "But there are stocks that are still valued attractively." The takeovers that are accelerating in the industry are another force that can propel stocks upward.
But there is no question that S.& L. stocks have traveled far already. As tracked by Standard & Poor's, the savings and loan industry has gained 39 percent from January 1 through the end of May. That outstrips all of the 87 other industries tracked by Standard & Poor's, except for semiconductors, whose 41.8 percent gain barely edged out the S.& L.'s. And the thrifts' 1995 performance far exceeds both the 27.6 percent gain of those headline-grabbing technology stocks, as measured by the S.& P. high technology composite index, and the 16.1 percent gain of the S.& P. 500.
Of course, financial companies of all stripes got a boost this year as interest rates stabilized after many months of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. But thrifts easily outpaced the 24.2 percent gain so far in 1995 of the broad S.& P. financial industry group, whose members range from banks to insurance companies to specialty financial-service providers.
In part, the thrifts' solid performance this year rests on the rocky one of last year. In the 17 months since January 1994, the savings and loan industry's 11 percent gain is about the same as the S.& P. 500's for that period. But unlike the broad market, S.& L. stocks underwent huge swings in that stretch, losing 20 percent from September through mid-December, then regaining that and more this year.
Thanks to the Federal Reserve, rising rates were responsible for a large part of 1994's difficulties -- and their absence explains much about 1995's about-face. In general, financial institutions cannot raise rates on outstanding variable-rate loans as fast as they must lift the rates they pay on money market deposits. As rates move higher, therefore, profit margins get squeezed -- sometimes very tightly. For instance, at Golden West Financial Corporation, a large California thrift, this phenomenon led to a fall in first-quarter earnings from $1.02 a share in 1994 to 87 cents this year.
More recently, however, interest rates have stabilized. And, for savings and loans, level rates both avoid the squeeze and reduce the pressure on thrift managers as they try to predict interest rate spreads.
The industry has also gotten a boost from mergers and acquisitions, which have accelerated over the past 9 to 12 months, Mr. McDermott said. "Banks view thrifts as entry points into certain markets, and as fillers in markets where banks are already represented," he explained. But whatever the reason, these takeovers add "scarcity value" to the stock prices of the thrifts that remain, Mr. McDermott said.
To stay competitive, S.& L.'s are even acquiring each other. Last week, two large Midwestern institutions, Charter One Financial of Cleveland and First Fed Michigan Corporation of Detroit, agreed to merge in a $1.1 billion stock swap.
Finally, the recent S.& L. stock boom is fueled by the late but large recovery of the real estate market out West.
"The California market has been blistering," Mr. McDermott said. "The state was one of the last to recover from the poor real estate market that plagued so many different parts of the country."
Which S.& L.'s look particularly good for investors? Mr. McDermott recommends H.F. Ahmanson & Company, whose shares were trading at $23.25 at Friday's close. Ahmanson sells at only about 1.1 times its net worth per share, and at about eight times estimated 1996 earnings of $2.70 a share. Both measures suggest the stock is relatively cheap.
He also thinks Great Western Financial Corporation and Golden West Financial are attractive, although they trade at slightly higher valuations than does Ahmanson. At Friday's close, they were selling at $22.50 and $49.25, respectively.
All three of these thrifts are from California, where the industry has come a long way from the regionwide depression that formerly characterized it. In its regional breakdown of thrift-stock performance, SNL Securities of Charlottesville, Va., found that while the whole industry is up an average of 26.5 percent this year through May 31, Western region stocks are up 34.5 percent. The next best-performing region, the Southeast, is up only 23 percent, said Philip Colaco, a senior research analyst at SNL.
Indeed, the three big recommended California thrifts happen to be the components of the S.& P. thrift industry index -- which helps to square that measure's finding of a 39 percent return for the thrift industry through May with SNL's 26.5 percent figure.
The late recovery of California real estate is not the only reason the state's thrifts have done better than other thrifts. Rising interest rates had squeezed the Western S.& L.'s very severely because they are in sharp competition for customer deposits with big commercial banks, including Bank America, First Interstate and Wells Fargo.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Bargain Prices in Bonds, Again

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES opportunity knocks twice. When rising interest rates felled the bond market last year, investors were able to snap up some municipal bond funds at bargain prices. Now, uncertainty in the municipal market -- induced by talk of a flat tax, debate about where rates are headed and Orange County's failure so far to make good on its debt -- has conspired to push the prices down again.
The best deals can be found in closed-end funds, which issue a set number of shares and trade on stock exchanges. Unlike their more plentiful open-end cousins, these funds sell at prices that don't always reflect the value of their underlying assets. 
 When the market is most pessimistic about municipal bonds, as it was toward the end of 1994, the shares of these closed-end funds can trade at sizable discounts to their net asset values. Last year, the median discount on the funds approached 10 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, the New York research firm. Investors could therefore buy a dollar's worth of assets for only 90 cents. If the underlying portfolio increased in value or the fund gained in popularity, those investors could sell at a profit.
Despite the astonishing rebound in the municipal bond market as long-term rates fell this year, the closed-end funds are once again trading at steep discounts. After shrinking to 6 percent earlier this year, the discount is now hovering at 9 percent. Dozens of funds sport tantalizing discounts of 15 percent to 20 percent.
George Foot, a partner in Newgate Management Associates, a New York investment firm, is convinced now is the time to "jump in with both feet and grab everything you can get your hands on."
Why aren't there more eager buyers, willing to pay full freight for these funds? Municipal bond funds are a tough sell on Wall Street right now. For one thing, there's a lot of discussion on the flat tax proposal by Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas. The proposal would exempt individuals from paying tax on any dividends or capital gains. If the measure should become law, municipal bonds, now prized for their tax exemption, would lose their edge over other types of bonds. The possibility that Orange County, Calif., will not make its debtors whole has also sent shudders through the market.
Some investors, who saw bond funds plummet in value last year, continue to be wary of putting money in the market, while others have decided to cash out after this year's rally. No one, it seems, wants to bet too heavily on the direction of interest rates, which could always defy conventional wisdom and head higher again.
People who share some or all of these fears will be rightfully wary of the market. But Mr. Foot peers through the dark clouds and sees dollar signs. He points to much improved net asset values on the closed-end funds and argues that the share prices will catch up sooner or later. Many of the funds' yields are close to those on 30-year taxable bonds, which throw off taxable income.
Even Joe Mysak, the not-so-optimistic editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, concedes the wide difference between net asset values and share prices could be attractive. "Whenever they widen out, you've got to take a look," he said.
But before you rush out to buy, remember that there is no guarantee the discounts will shrink or disappear. While closed-end municipal bond funds have tended toward small discounts or slight premiums over the last few years, investors could see even deeper discounts than now if the talk about a flat tax grows louder or if the overall bond market turns south.
"You may get to buy them cheaper," warned Ron Olin, the president of Deep Discount Advisors, an Asheville, N.C., investment firm. He predicts more discounts of 20 percent in the months to come.
"There's no point in buying anything not in the double digits," Mr. Foot said. But investors should make sure the fund's discount is abnormally large and likely to narrow. The best way to do that is to compare the current discount with the fund's average discount for the last year or so. Plenty of funds trade at a consistent discount. The Municipal Advantage Fund, for example, has traded at an average discount of 13 percent for the last year.
Some funds trade at steep discounts because they are very sensitive to moves in interest rates, meaning significant losses if rates climb. Such funds generally went public within the last few years and have portfolios filled with low-yielding bonds. "The younger the portfolio, the more volatile the fund, the deeper the discount," said Tricia Oehme Rothschild, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the Chicago research firm. The net asset value of the Paine Webber Premier Tax-Free Income Fund, begun in late 1992, had an 18 percent gain in 1993 when interest rates fell. But the fund lost nearly 12 percent of its value last year. It now trades at a 19 percent discount.
Among the funds trading at an unusually high discount and worth considering, according to Mr. Foot, is Intercapital Quality Municipal Securities. The fund, with a yield of nearly 7 percent, is trading at a discount of 17 percent, while its average was 11 percent last year. Ms. Rothschild likes the Muniyield Fund, which has among the best three-year returns of the group. It is selling at a discount of roughly 13 percent, compared with 10 percent last year.
Anyone who decides to buy should check out the prospective fund's borrowing habits. Unlike their open-end cousins, closed-end funds can borrow heavily to add to the cash supplied by investors. "That can really boost returns in a rallying market," Ms. Rothschild said. "But the downs are greater in a falling market."
Most closed-end funds leverage their assets by borrowing and thus are much riskier investments than open-end funds. In the drubbing of the municipal market last year, leveraged closed-end funds fell in net asset value by 10 percent on average -- twice the loss of their open-end counterparts.
Investors who can withstand volatility, though, can make more money with leveraged municipal funds. The average leveraged closed-end fund gained 9 percent annually over the last three years, which included a serious bear market, compared with just 7 percent for the average open-end fund, according to Morningstar.
A leveraged fund may have trouble, though, maintaining its dividend. If the difference becomes too narrow between what the fund pays to borrow and what it makes investing in municipal bonds, the manager may see no choice but to cut the dividend.
Two funds that have already cut their dividends are the Van Kampen Merritt Select Sector Municipal Trust and the Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund. The Van Kampen fund, which has traded at an average discount of 11 percent over the last year, is now available at a discount of 16 percent, which Mr. Foot finds attractive. Ms. Rothschild steers investors to Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund, trading at a discount of 15 percent, almost twice its average discount last year.
If you like bargains but want to skip the leverage, one possibility is the Managed Municipals Portfolio, run by the same manager as Smith Barney Managed Municipals, the top open-end fund over the last three and five years. Investors can tap into Joseph Deane's expertise at a 10 percent discount by buying shares of his closed-end fund.
Although there's no way to be sure a discount will disappear, some bets are better. Mr. Foot recommends shares of Putnam Investment Grade Intermediate Municipal Trust, trading at a 7 percent discount. The funds' trustees have voted to merge the fund into an open-end fund, an action that would entitle investors to a full dollar for a dollar's worth of underlying assets. Shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, and would have to sit tight for at least six months after the merger to avoid a 2 percent redemption fee. Still, it's one good shot at buying low and selling high.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: OFF THE SHELF;
Some Light Summer Reading: Human Failings, Moral Decline

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE 

 BODY:
THE business best-seller list has settled into summer somnolence, with few changes since last month. The naughty American public continues to spend no small portion of its ever-flattening wages seeking wisdom between the covers. The hard covers, that is, of "The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success," which remains at No. 1. 
 Sneaking into the fray, at No. 14, is John Allen Paulos's latest contribution to his innumeracy oeuvre, "A Mathematician Looks at the Newspaper" (Basic Books, $18), in which the author continues to encourage readers to beat up on themselves for having skipped out on higher math. It is a rich, but as the current book shows, exhaustible topic.
Apparently inexhaustible is anxiety over the moral decline and fall of the American people. This concern comes from an unusual source in "Silent Sabotage: Rescuing Our Careers, Our Companies and Our Lives From the Creeping Paralysis of Anger and Bitterness" (Amacom, $19.95). The author, William J. Morin, runs Drake Beam Morin, a "leading organizational and individual transition consulting firm," it says on the book jacket. This means Mr. Morin most likely meets people who are most likely quite fearful about the future -- "organization and individual transition" often being a euphemism for dismissals. He observes rudderless, untrusting and untrustworthy institutions and individuals.
On the plus side, he talks about values without once mentioning Newt Gingrich, the Christian Coalition or the nefarious influence of rap music. On the minus side, he thinks business is the only major institution in a position to salve the nation's soul, curiously underestimating the role the companies have played the last few years in undermining middle-class faith in the social contract. In one way he may be right, however; Americans feel best about themselves when they're fighting a just war or when the economy is booming. In this country, only business can drive that boom.
While we're on a decline-and-fall theme, isn't it enough of an insult to the English language that buzzwords exist? Do we really need a guide likely to encourage their dispersal? Actually, Charles B. Wendel and Elaine Svensson, the authors of "Business Buzzwords: Everything You Need to Know to Speak the Lingo of the 90's" (Amacom, $16.95), do perform a valuable service. They synopsize the work of the leading management gurus, thus sparing readers the cost of going to the sources.
Readers may romp through Drucker, Senge, Handy, Peters and everyone else lickety-split, much as undergraduates once did when they read Bertrand Russell's great "History of Western Philosophy" in lieu of the draggy, impenetrable originals. The book gives instruction on how to recognize a meaningful buzzword as well as how to create one. And you thought great buzzwords were pure inspiration.
The entry on "downsizing" is instructive: related words include "de-massing, denominator management, early retirement, reductions-in-force, re-engineering, restructuring, retrenchment" and, a personal favorite, "right-sizing." George Orwell, phone home.
Employees who feel they have been unfairly right-sized may want to consult "Your Rights in the Workplace: An Employee Guide to Legal Protection," by Richard Strohm (Career Press, $8.95). The book includes a good basic introduction to employment law and includes a survey of workplace regulations. The pep talk at the beginning about hiring a lawyer is probably focused too heavily on potential litigation; most people seeking justice from their former employers would be better off pursuing an equitable settlement rather than litigation. A good negotiator's price is far above rubies.
Clearly, a great deal of energy went into "Cracking the Corporate Closet" (Harper Business, $23), possibly most of it into constructing a subtitle so long that the authors -- all three, count 'em -- must have thought that if they just kept writing, a focus for the book would emerge.
Daniel Baker, Sean Strub, Bill Henning and the gang at the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force surveyed some 200 companies on lesbian and gay issues on whether they provided things like domestic-partner benefits and AIDS education and had gay and lesbian employee groups. The result is typical of "best companies" books: old news, lists, no interpretation and no context. Hearsay is a lot more useful.
Also not very satisfying is Kevin Maney's "Megamedia Shakeout: The Inside Story of the Leaders and the Losers in the Exploding Communications Industry" (John Wiley, $24.95). But it has the virtue of being unsatisfying largely because the story is unfinished. Somewhere out there, people are getting rich on new technology and a vision of a wired world. A whole vast area of wealth is being created by the public's thirst for more talk-show channels! America in decline. Sorry, Mr. Morin. You gotta love it.

Dose of Vitality From 'The Other America'

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
ON the Union Square subway platform, a Zimbabwean opened his duffel bag to show us watches and flashlights. He picked them up in Brooklyn, he said, and was on his way to sell them in the Bronx. In a richly insincere voice that recalled childhood visits to Jewish clothing stores on the Lower East Side, he told us that he was practically giving the flashlights. Such a good deal.
"That man is a red-blood corpuscle," said Joel Millman, once we were on the train to the Bronx. "Immigrants are pumping oxygen and money into the city. They do jobs no one wants to do, they create markets that weren't there, they're replacing older immigrant groups." 
 Mr. Millman, an old friend, is writing a book for Viking Penguin about the impact of immigration. He may call it "The Other Americans," an homage to and an update of Michael Harrington's 1962 classic on poverty in the midst of plenty. Mr. Millman is finding wealth and hope in poor neighborhoods. He took me on a tour of his thesis.
If the Zimbabwean is a corpuscle, Heinz Vieluf is a transfusion. He is the son of a German wurst maker who migrated to the Dominican Republic, married, and founded Cibao Meat Products in New York. The father's portrait hangs in the office of the plant on St. Ann's Avenue. The brass plate reads: Don Siegfried Vieluf, Fundador.
Heinz, 36, was educated in prep schools, married a Dominican and lives in Rockland Country with his three children. The 8,200-square-foot plant employs 25, mostly Dominicans (many at the minimum wage, no union or benefits), and grinds out between 50,000 and 85,000 pounds a week of spiced meats under various brand names to appeal to different ethnic and age groups; Dominicans like it hotter than Italians, said Mr. Vieluf, all people prefer less spice as they grow older. He is alert to the subtle differences between Mexican and Colombian taste buds (so far, Ecuadorians and Peruvians will buy sausages aimed at the Colombian market), and to the nuances of the job market.
"Ten years ago, I'd lose five employees every couple of months," he said. "They could make a lot more money dealing drugs. Now there's a big pool of unemployed, and a lot of dead drug dealers."
Outside, in a gray drizzle, there were no yellow cabs, but we found a licensed old Ford cruising illegally. For $6, which he said he would not share with the dispatcher, the Dominican driver took us to a section of Bathgate that may someday be Golden Krust City. Lowell Hawthorne, who came from Jamaica in 1981 with his entrepeneur father and eight of his 10 siblings, is expanding their bakery and pattie factory, and opening retail outlets.
"If Taco Bell can do it, so can Golden Krust," said Mr. Hawthorne, 35, who attended Lehman College and has the immigrant go-getter's disdain for those on welfare. "It would be degrading to go home and tell people you are getting food stamps."
With the help of a saving cooperative, called a "su-su," Mr. Hawthorne bought a $19,000 home in the Bronx 14 years ago. He has since moved his wife and four children to Rockland County.
The Golden Krust plant has 68 workers, mostly Jamaicans, making seven types of patties; older Jamaicans, he says, need that "ding" on their tongues, younger Jamaicans and Americans prefer milder hits.
It was raining harder, and we couldn't find even an illegally cruising cab, so we got into an unlicensed jitney driven by a Nigerian who recommended a new African Restaurant (that was its name) at 1987 University Avenue. The place was packed with Africans and Mr. Millman, his enthusiasm fueled, talked about the optimism and sense of community that immigrants bring, an essential for American progress. The manager, Mohammed Abdullay, a Ghanian, came out of the kitchen for compliments on the kingfish, the cow's feet and the okra stew.
We worked off lunch ducking into store-front hair-braiding salons. The African women inside were wary; hair-braiding, sometimes done on house calls, is a booming ghetto business that often operates without the burdens of taxes, licenses or inspections.
At a warehouse on Jerome Avenue, Felipe Chavez opened a can of the Del Carmen brand tender cactus in brine imported by his cousin, Felix Sanchez, who came to New York from Mexico 20 years ago and sold tortillas in Brooklyn, door to door. Mr. Sanchez expanded to supply bodegas and on this day was off preparing to confront Gruma, the Mexican tortilla empire, in a battle for the New York market.
Mr. Millman threw himself at the day's first yellow cab, fresh from the garage en route to Manhattan. The driver refused to tell his story, so Mr. Millman described his latest find, a Senegalese who stripped off the European-style clothing from dark-skinned dolls she bought from China and re-dressed them in African fashions she sewed herself from kente cloth. The dolls sold so well on 125th Street that she sent 50 to Dakar to test-market them on American tourists.

When Health Care Cuts Cost More

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REPUBLICANS have boiled down their Medicare proposals to a number and a sound bite: They can wring more than $250 billion from the national health insurance program for the elderly over the next seven years, they say, even while "preserving, protecting and improving" it.
 No big, comprehensive, Clintonesque health care overhaul for them. Just smart, targeted, money-saving reforms of outmoded government programs. After all, the Clinton Administration discovered the danger of over-reaching, right? 
 Right. But now the Republicans face the danger of piecemeal reform, of trimming and tinkering with a program that covers 37 million beneficiaries and is the lifeblood of many if not most of the nation's hospitals, doctors and academic medical centers. It will, like it or not, have big consequences, intended and unintended. Efforts to save money in one part of the program can end up costing money somewhere else.
 "Physicians understand reimbursement realities and they understand their patients," said Mike Brown, the administrator of a tiny, 30-bed hospital in Wahoo, Neb. "They do what is best for their patients."
 In other words, medical needs usually have a way of getting met. And, if they are not, those needs have a way of popping up later -- more serious, more advanced, more expensive to treat. Unlike private employers, who are much praised on Capitol Hill these days for controlling their health costs, the Government ultimately ends up with responsibility for the oldest, poorest, sickest Americans, which are the groups that Medicare and Medicaid cover. Efficiencies do not come easily. Miscalculations matter, immensely.
 As Republican leaders in Congress try to find the huge savings they seek in Medicare and as states struggle to control their own health care costs, nothing exemplifies the challenge facing them more than Medicare's home health program. It offers a case study in the potential ripple effects of seemingly simple little money-saving reforms.
 Every policy maven who looks at Medicare's escalating costs jumps on the home health program as a major culprit. Home health care accounts for about eight cents of every dollar spent on Medicare. But spending on these services -- like physical therapy, skilled nursing or the assistance of a lesser-skilled home health aide -- has soared over the past five years, from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $13.7 billion in 1994. Not only did the number of beneficiaries increase; the number of visits per beneficiary jumped from 27 in 1989 to 58 in 1994.
 In 1995, an estimated 3.46 million people will receive home health care benefits from Medicare; the average visit costs just under $65. Critics warn that what began as a cost-effective way of caring for and rehabilitating people after an illness or an operation has gotten dangerously out of control.
 One answer, to many on Capitol Hill, seems obvious: require clients of home health care to pay part of the bill. As a planning paper from Republicans on the House Budget Committee put it, "Requiring beneficiaries to share the cost of these services would help to discourage over-utilization and reduce the Medicare subsidy." That plan contemplates a 20 percent copayment, with an exclusion for those whose incomes are below 150 percent of the official poverty line (meaning elderly couples, for example, with incomes below $13,446).

 
 
'Quicker and Sicker'
 This, of course, is sound economic theory; it assumes that people will stop requesting or receiving all but the most necessary services if they are forced to pay for part of the costs. And that some of the services being rendered are indeed unnecessary or could be paid for by the beneficiaries.
 But there are big demographic and technological forces behind the rise in home health costs, which are unlikely to change much as a result of simply requiring the client to pay a fee.
 One reason for the increase in home health services was a decision by policymakers over the past 10 years to cut down on hospital stays. People are released from the hospital "quicker and sicker," as some health planners put it, with the understanding that they will get more cost-effective care at home or in a skilled nursing facility.
 "When you have outpatient surgeries and shorter inpatient stays, you'll have more home health care," said Representative Nancy Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, an influential member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health. "We need to be very mindful of rising home health costs as a consequence of other actions we've taken."
 Home health beneficiaries are getting care for longer and longer periods of time. The program's scope has expanded in part because of a lawsuit in the late 1980's, in which the Government was accused of applying this benefit far too narrowly and arbitrarily. But behind the increase, of course, is the growth in America's aging population. Hundreds of thousands of old, disabled and chronically ill people need help to stay in their homes.
 Congress over the years has debated the establishment of a major new long-term care program, but never passed it. Nonetheless, home health care "has become sort of a backdoor way of expanding long term care," said Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis and a member of a Medicare advisory committee.
 Call it the "push it down here, it pops up there" phenomenon, which gives some analysts pause when they think about the implications of simply redefining the home health program to tighten its eligibility requirements. What if squeezing home health care ends up putting more people back into hospitals or into nursing homes, where their costs are picked up by Medicare, which is fully financed by Washington, and by Medicaid, which is only partly?
 And speaking of Medicaid, Joshua Wiener, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, warns that Republican cuts in projected spending for that program fail to take into account the growth over the next five years in the population 85 and older. While Medicaid is usually thought of as a program for low-income younger people, 30 percent of its spending goes for nursing home and other long-term care, in part because people deplete their assets to qualify.

 
 
Kindest Cuts
 It would be simpler if spending could be reined in by cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse -- typically the most popular and painless solution to budget-cutting. But that saves only so much.
 Actually reducing services is fodder for the ripple effects game. What if Medicare payment restrictions force some already teetering rural hospitals into insolvency? What if reducing the Medicare subsidy for medical education is a body blow to the nation's big teaching hospitals? The questions spin on, and help explain, perhaps, what drove Ira Magaziner, the Clinton health czar, to produce a health plan that filled 1,342 pages.

French Annoyance At the U.S. Comes In Several Courses

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THE French have always been prickly allies good to have on your side in a fight but ready to pick one as well, particularly if you come from an Anglo-Saxon country like Britain or the United States.
 These days, Britain is on France's side in the European-American disagreement over what to do about the war in Bosnia, but regarding the United States the French are in a disgruntled mood. 
 They were decidedly unimpressed last week, for example, when President Clinton sent an aircraft carrier to the Adriatic and said he might finally, if only temporarily, commit American ground troops to Bosnia in a plan to better protect the French, British and other United Nations troops already there, hundreds of whom were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs. The daily Liberation said dismissively of the Americans, "Probably they will continue to quietly smuggle arms to the Bosnian Government."
 So what else is new? is the question likely to be asked by anyone old enough to remember how de Gaulle barred Britain from the European Community and kicked NATO headquarters out of France to Brussels.
 De Gaulle's political heir, Jacques Chirac, elected to the French presidency on May 7, has fond memories of a summer at Harvard in 1953, and will be able to use his good American English when he sees President Clinton in the White House this month before the world economic summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
 Mr. Chirac will probably tell him then that France, and Europe, cannot tolerate the United States using the value of the dollar on currency markets as a trade weapon against Japan -- and that Europe doesn't think much of American trade sanctions against Japan either.

 
 
A Threat, Not a Leader
 While Americans lately are fixated on Japan, the French are still fixated on America, which they see not as a leading trade partner -- far more French trade is with Europe, and in particular Germany, than with the United States -- but as a threat to true European independence.
 A truly independent Europe has been the goal of French policy ever since de Gaulle, and it goes without saying that the French see an independent Europe as one guided by their ideas. France led the fight two years ago between the European Union and the United States over European subsidies for farm exports, movies and TV, and France now sees itself leading the fight for an independent European defense policy.
 Germany and other European allies are increasingly aligning themselves with the Gaullist view that the United States cannot be relied on as Europe's main guarantor of security, because America has other interests in Asia and the Western Hemisphere.
 That is why France has its own independent nuclear deterrent and one of the world's most important arms industries. It is sounding increasingly competitive about that industry these days. "The Americans have launched into an enormous effort to restructure their arms industry, accompanied by great commercial aggressiveness that is helped by the fall of the dollar, and they are eliminating us from the world market," said Pierre Lellouche, one of Mr. Chirac's advisers, during the election campaign.
"At the moment, in the trans-Atlantic arms trade, there are six times more arms in the United States-Europe direction, and the Americans control about 60 percent of the NATO market," Mr. Lellouche warned. "Europe is way behind the curve."
 In the past, this competitive urge has often fixed on symbols. France and Britain cooperated in the 1960's to build the supersonic Concorde, only to have the plane declared too noisy to fly supersonically over American soil and thus doomed to economic failure in its most important market. Pierre Cochereau, the late organist of Notre Dame Cathedral, barred American guest artists for years on the ground that up close, the organ was louder than the Concorde and thus too much for tender American ears.
 With the lumbering American-made Boeing 747 dominating the intercontinental aviation market in the 1970's, it took Europe years to catch up, with the Airbus. But one of the biggest problems Airbus Industrie now, and of European exporters generally, is the competitive disadvantage caused by the weakness of the dollar, which makes American exports cheaper.

 
 
Coin for the Realm
 So one of Mr. Chirac's most important campaign pledges was a promise to prepare quickly for European monetary union to free France from dependence on a fluctuating dollar as the medium of international trade. "The day we have a strong European currency is the day we can finally stand up as equals to the United States," said Franc David, a French economist.
 All this French defensiveness reflects a national inferiority complex. Germany, France's real rival for European leadership, does not suffer from it, but the Germans, too, are more inclined than they used to be to define their interests as Europeans rather than as trans-Atlantic partners.
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher tried to respond to these concerns in a speech in Madrid on Friday, emphasizing that political and economic cooperation have to become the binding ties of the North Atlantic alliance in place of military links.
 But in Spain, France and Germany, much like in the United States, political leaders worry more about how to create jobs in their unemployment-stricken economies than about how to keep up the alliances that got them through the cold war.
 For the French and most other Europeans, building up European trade and protecting it from the Americans and Asians is the answer to the jobs question. Mr. Chirac has made jobs the major theme of his Presidency and, like his predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, he is bound to put a Gallic edge of competitive tension on his relations with America in diplomacy as well as trade.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Morality Play;
Now, Social Engineers Design at Right Angles

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
THE phrase "social engineering" has long been a pejorative fired off in the heat of argument to suggest government manipulation run amok. Conservatives have invoked the phrase to attack liberal policies ranging from busing to affirmative action, from health care reform to lifting the military's ban on gay soldiers. Mostly, the charge has been lobbed from right to left.
 But when the Christian Coalition recently unveiled its platform for shoring up the family and re-tethering America to certain moral moorings, some conservatives seemed to be committing the very sin of which they had accused the left. Here were self-styled defenders of individual liberty, proponents of getting government off people's backs, asking the government to subsidize housewifery, decide who -- if anyone -- can get a legal abortion, enable more parents to send their children to private or parochial schools and to let them pray in public ones. 
 "When it comes to government, no one's a pure libertarian," says Jerome L. Himmelstein, a sociologist at Amherst College and the author of "To the Right: The Transformation of American Conservatism" (University of California, 1990). "Another way to say that is: Everyone's a hypocrite. Everyone wants the government to do something. It just depends on what."

 
 
Meddling
 And on when. Last November, Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who is Speaker of the House, assured Republican governors that the party's goals for the economy and welfare would take precedence over potentially more divisive social issues. "We can't be here suggesting the social engineering of the right will be more clever than the social engineering of the left," he said then.
 As some conservatives see it, they are only responding to decades of meddling by liberals in government. Advocating a platform already largely supported by many -- though surely not the most libertarian -- conservative elected officials and politicians, the Christian Coalition weighed in only after having watched the government get involved in moral and social issues that the religious right believes belong outside government's reach.
 "Many fundamentalists and evangelicals got into politics because they felt imposed upon," said Michael Cromartie, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative research organization in Washington. "The debate becomes not whether these people ought to be meddling but what is the most prudent and principled way to be involved."
 Now comes the Contract With the American Family, the Christian Coalition's social and cultural agenda for Congress, billed as "a bold plan to strengthen the family and restore common-sense values." Unveiled in Washington last month, it calls for a constitutional amendment allowing student-sponsored prayer in schools and tuition tax credits to encourage school choice.
 The coalition is also calling for "family-friendly tax relief" to encourage marriage and to honor "the valuable role" of the homemaker in society. It wants to cut Federal funding for family-planning agencies that promote abortion and a "Parental Rights Act" to empower parents in attempting to control their children.
 A number of critics say the contract violates the separation of church and state. But some critics -- many of them liberals -- also say it is hypocritical.
 "They use the rhetoric of small government," said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who contrasts what he calls the "authoritarian right" with libertarian purists. "But in fact they present the most pervasive program of government intrusion into personal freedom."

 
 
Off Your Back
 Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar at the University of Southern California Law Center, called the contract "the antithesis of getting the government off people's backs," adding, "to the extent that they want greater government regulation of abortion, that's putting the government directly in one of the most intimate and important aspects of people's lives."
 And Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said: "There is really a serious contradiction in what they're asserting. It sounds like they want the government to be involved when it supports the position that they believe in."
 Government intrusion, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder. While liberals like to say they use government simply to create opportunities, conservatives describe the liberal agenda as social engineering. And while conservatives say they want government simply to protect the rights of, say, students to organize prayers, liberals see conservatives using government to foist their values on everyone else.

 
 
'Under Siege'
 "Is it government intervention to deny benefits to poor women who need family planning -- or is it government withdrawal?" Rabbi Saperstein said of the Christian Coalition's agenda. He sees it as government manipulation -- using "the power of the purse to prevent women from exercising their right to reproductive health."
 But many conservatives insist the contract would impose nothing on anyone. They say they want only to eliminate disincentives to moral behavior.
 "There is a big perception difference," said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative research group. "I think a lot of the popular culture and elites see fundamentalists and evangelicals suddenly organizing and attempting to impose narrow dogma. But when I talk to people who fall into those categories, they say, 'We've been under siege.' "
 Mr. Bauer calls the conservative "pro-family" platform "a defensive agenda," one, he says, that "merely is trying to reassert what was pretty much the norm as recently as 25 years ago."
 For both sides, it matters deeply which views the government appears to endorse, even if much of what is at stake may be less tangible than actual resources or rights and when some of the behavior being debated may be beyond government's ability to legislate.
 In the end, each side wants the government's endorsement. And it may be just plain disingenuous when the other side indignantly objects. Whatever they call it, most conservatives and liberals alike don't mind social engineering when it is a means to their ends. They don't mind legislating morality as long as it's theirs.
 "Both the right and the left care very much about socializing people to the appropriate moral positions," said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who studies grass-roots politics and the Christian Right. "Whether it's respecting people regardless of sexual preference or honoring God, those are moral positions."
 To which Tom Minnery, vice president of public policy for Focus on the Family, a conservative religious group, said: "Of course government legislates morality. The only question is: whose morality?"

America's Opportunity Gap

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICA'S Jeffersonian ideals of equality and its reputation as a land of opportunity have been battered recently by evidence of a widening gulf between the rich and the poor. And now a growing body of research is showing that, at the same time, it is becoming more difficult to move into the economic elite.
 Social mobility has not risen, the latest studies show -- notwithstanding conservatives' assertions that modern Horatio Algers still abound. Indeed, social mobility has diminished for many, particularly the poor. Most troubling of all, the trends toward widening income inequality and reduced opportunity appear to be more pronounced among young people today, suggesting that the country is headed toward a more stratified society. 
 The most dramatic evidence comes in recent research by Professors Greg J. Duncan of Northwestern University and Timothy Smeeding of Syracuse University. They looked at surveys of the personal finances of 5,000 households, conducted every year since the late 1960's by the University of Michigan.
 Comparing the 1980's and early 1990's with the late 1960's and the 1970's, the researchers found that the poor were becoming more likely to stay poor and the affluent more likely to stay affluent. They found the middle class, defined as households with after-tax incomes of $24,000 to $72,000, is increasingly pulled apart: the odds of becoming affluent or poor have increased while the odds of staying in the middle class have dwindled.
 The study also found that young men's chances of attaining a middle-class income by age 30 is dwindling. While 60 percent of those turning 30 before 1989 managed to do so, only 42 percent have succeeded since then. The pattern applies regardless of race, parents' income or education.
 "What's striking is how uniform this fall in upward mobility has been across all demographic groups in the labor market," Professor Duncan said.
 One possible explanation is that income inequality has become particularly pronounced among the young. A few young lawyers, doctors, financiers or entrepreneurs have prospered while many others struggle for low-wage jobs. People who did not go to college in the 1960's were still able to find high-paying manufacturing jobs and have kept them. But high school graduates today find fewer such jobs as technological advances and growing foreign trade have reduced the need for unskilled and semi-skilled labor in factories.

 
 
'Borne the Brunt'
 "To the extent that the widening of distribution of income has occurred, it really is true among the younger people rather than older, and younger people have borne the brunt of the changes," said Barry Bosworth, a Brookings Institution economist.
 As always in economics, some researchers have come to different conclusions. Professors Peter Gottschalk of Boston College and Robert Moffitt of Brown University concluded in a paper published by Brookings last year that earnings have become much less stable.
 Many people rocket up in the earnings rankings because of a particularly good year of sales commissions or bonuses or consulting contracts. But the same people are also increasingly likely to see their earnings drop dramatically the following year, Professors Gottschalk and Moffitt found. The overall trend remains toward more permanent differences in earnings. And at least for the poorest Americans, those earnings are going steadily down after adjusting for inflation.
 "Your chance of escaping the bottom has not gotten better, but conditions at the bottom have gotten much worse," Professor Gottschalk said.
 In that regard, some other countries are doing better. One study found that the children of poor families in Sweden are more likely to prosper than the children of poor American families. And three Syracuse University professors have concluded that the United States had no greater social mobility than Germany from 1983 to 1988. Moreover, while the gap between well-paid workers and low-paid workers did not change in Germany during those years, in the United States the gap grew. Here, a worker in the top 10 percent of wage-earners had 4 times the earnings of a worker in the bottom 10 percent in 1983. By 1988, the ratio had climbed to 4.33.
 All of this evidence has prompted both Republicans and Democrats to begin quoting their favorite philosophers on matters of wealth and fairness. The Republicans are currently citing Friedrich A. von Hayek, an Austrian-born economist and Nobel Laureate who championed free-market ideals. "All societies have unequal wealth and income dispersion, and there is no positive basis for criticizing any degree of market determined inequality," the Republican majority of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress said in a report on May 9.
 Democrats prefer John Rawls, the American philosopher who contends that a society is fair if its level of inequality appears acceptable to a hypothetical individual who is about to join the society and does not know if the inequality would work for or against him. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said that young Americans who are poor or ill-educated increasingly know that they will occupy a place in society in which inequality works against them.
 If they refuse to accept the inequality, that could strain the nation's social and political fabric, Mr. Reich said. "The moral core at the heart of capitalism," he said, "the faith that if you work hard you can get ahead, is being eroded."

HEADLINE: The Debate on Diversity in California Shifts

SERIES: Affirmative Action: The Issue on Campus

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
The photograph in Sproul Hall of the 10 Cal "yell leaders" from the early 1960's, in their Bermuda shorts and letter sweaters, leaps out like an artifact from an ancient civilization. They are all fresh-faced, and in a way that is unimaginable now, they are all white.
But here on the flagship campus of the University of California system, the epicenter of the affirmative-action debate in higher education today, the popular arguments that often frame the debate in images of black versus white seem as out of date as the ducktails and bouffant hairdos of those 60's cheerleaders. 
 The University of California's Berkeley campus was among the first of the nation's leading universities to embrace elements of affirmative action in its admissions policies, and now boasts that it has one of the most diverse campuses in America, with whites accounting for only 32 percent of the student body. Asian-Americans are the largest ethnic group on campus, accounting for 39 percent of all students. Hispanic students account 13.8 percent and blacks for 5.5 percent.
But Berkeley may soon become one of the first campuses in the nation to abandon the cornerstone of affirmative action in higher education: admission preferences based on race. The university board of regents expects to consider a proposal to prohibit the use of race and ethnicity as factors in admissions.
At their July meeting the regents, who are appointed by the governors on staggered terms, are likely to vote on the proposal being drafted by a black regent, Ward Connerly, to end the affirmative-action admissions policy.
[Gov. Pete Wilson's order last Wednesday curtailing affirmative-action programs in state government does not affect the University of California system.]
There are two unusual twists to the assault on affirmative action in the University of California system that defy stereotypes. First, the race-based preferences are being attacked by a black member of the board of regents and defended by Berkeley's Asian-American chancellor. Second, the racial makeup here has extended the fault line in the debate to minority versus minority as well as black versus white.
Fairness, many Asian-Americans in California argue, demands that admissions be based strictly on merit as defined by grades and test scores.
Many black and Hispanic residents argue that fairness requires sticking with programs intended to counter the effects of racial prejudice.
Some critics of affirmative action assert that the success that Asian-Americans have achieved without being given preferential treatment raises questions about the necessity of race-based preferences as a remedy for overcoming historic prejudice.
These same critics argue that affirmative action to aid historically disadvantaged black and Hispanic students has become a new form of discrimination against Asian-Americans, although black and Hispanic students are still underrepresented at Berkeley as measured by their share of the state's population.
The regents have a good idea of what effect an admissions policy based strictly on grades and test scores would have on racial diversity throughout the university system. A report commissioned by the board and completed recently determined that dropping race-based preferences in admissions would result in a precipitous drop in black and Hispanic freshmen and an increase in admissions of Asian-American and, marginally, white students.
Berkeley's Chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, a Chinese-American and an enthusiastic supporter of affirmative action, said in an interview that the widespread discrimination that still existed against Asian-Americans in the United States should make them especially sensitive to the need for programs to compensate for past discrimination.
But more important, he said, affirmative action at Berkeley represents an essential and healthy adaptation to a changing California and a changing nation.
"People like to say that affirmative action is kind of a way to redress past wrongs; I don't see it that way," Mr. Chang said. "Especially in a university, it's about creating the best educational atmosphere for all students. Affirmative action isn't for underrepresented minorities. It's for the benefit of the larger society."
The debate over how to balance diversity and fairness has already become contentious.
In a broader political arena, a proposed statewide ballot, supported by Governor Wilson, would prohibit all state programs intended to promote race-based preferences in hiring, promotions, university admissions or the award of public contracts.
The last time the regents discussed race-based admissions, on May 18, about 200 student demonstrators showed up to protest any change in the current policy, temporarily disrupting the meeting. While there have been no direct threats of campus disruptions if the system's affirmative-action goals are rescinded, the issue has long been a trigger for volatile passions.
"I'd say that 70 percent of Asians look at affirmative action and see a system in which they get the shaft," said Andrew Wong, Berkeley's student body president in the 1994-95 academic year. "I believe in a meritocracy, not in preferences, and if that produces a less diverse place, well, that's the social cost you pay."
 
The Experience
Who Is Admitted And Who Is Not
 Few places have had more of a commitment to diversity than the Berkeley campus, rated as perhaps the most prestigious public university in America. Beginning with the admission of women in the 1880's and with an early form of affirmative action called the Educational Opportunity Program in 1964, Berkeley has aggressively promoted inclusion.
The University of California was also the target of the lawsuit in the late 1970's that created the current legal standard for affirmative action; Allan P. Bakke argued that he had been denied admission to the medical school at the University of California at Davis because a space had been reserved for a less-qualified minority student. In a 5-to-4 ruling in 1978, the Supreme Court said that it was permissible to take race into account in admissions so long as there were no quotas and race was not the sole or primary factor.
Affirmative action on a university campus can play out in different ways, from recruiting students to hiring faculty. The most contentious questions at Berkeley have had to do with admissions: Who gets the sought-after acceptances? And what are the best criteria for judging applicants?
The university says that it seeks to enroll a student body that "encompasses the broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic and socio-economic backgrounds characteristic of California."
It also says there are no admissions quotas, reflecting the decision in the Bakke case.
Berkeley can afford to be choosy; it attracts more applicants with perfect 4.0 high school grade-point averages than it has slots in its freshman class. But as the university has become ever more selective the competition for admission has raised questions about the costs of diversity. Last year the campus received 22,500 freshman applications. It accepted 8,400 students to fill 3,500 freshman slots.
Administrators say affirmative action in admissions has been a success, maintaining educational excellence as Berkeley has become more diverse.
As late as 1984, whites made up 60 percent of the undergraduates at Berkeley. Now, the student body is 39 percent Asian, 32 percent white, 14 percent Hispanic, 6 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and 8 percent other groups or people who did not identify their race.
In 1984, the mean grade-point average for freshmen was 3.62 out of a possible 4.0, and the mean combined score on what are now known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests was 1,155 of a possible 1,600. In 1994, when whites constituted only a third of the undergraduates, the mean grade-point average was 3.84 and the mean S.A.T. score was 1,225.
Those numbers have risen for every ethnic group, according to data released by campus officials. The percentage of students who graduate within six years is also at an all-time high -- 79 percent compared with 55 percent in the mid-1950's.
"There's the myth that in the course of diversifying the campus we've lowered our standards," said Bob Laird, director of undergraduate admissions. "By any measure, the opposite is true. If you divide the freshman class in five parts and you compare any of the quintiles, the current freshman class is stronger than the one 10 years ago."
Moreover, the proportions of so-called underrepresented minorities -- primarily black and Hispanic students -- are not close to their numbers in the population. Black and Hispanic students now constitute about 37 percent of the high school graduates in California but only about 19 percent of the students at Berkeley.
Many black and Hispanic students complain that Berkeley is drawing back from the kind of outreach and openness needed to attract minorities. Black enrollment, which peaked at at 1,647, or 7.7 percent of undergraduates, in 1989, currently stands at 1,127, or 5.5 percent. Hispanic enrollment, which peaked at 3,158, or 15.1 percent of undergraduates, in 1991, is now 2,800, or 13.8 percent.
"What they call affirmative action is mostly just an appeasement, and now they're taking away what's there," said Mireta Khalil, a black 21-year-old junior from Los Angeles.
Under Berkeley's complicated admissions system, about 95 percent of the freshmen admitted come from the top eighth of high school students. Half of the applicants are accepted on academic merit as measured by high school grades. About 45 percent are picked using a combination of academic merit and more subjective factors, including essays, extracurricular activities and whether the student has overcome cultural or economic disadvantages or physical disabilities.
Up to 5 percent are admitted as "special action" admissions. They are not among the top eighth but are admitted because they are athletes, have special talents or fit the university's diversity needs and are deemed to have the ability to succeed at Berkeley. Of this group, 34 percent are black and 38 percent are Hispanic, 10 percent are Asian and 17 percent are white.
Mr. Laird said it made no sense to say that all the other preferences the university uses are acceptable but that increasing racial and ethnic diversity among undergraduates is not.
But critics of affirmative action point out that the policy means that black and Hispanic students with poorer credentials than whites and Asians are being admitted to Berkeley.
Whites admitted as freshmen in 1994 had a mean grade-point average of 3.86. For Asians the figure was 3.95. Blacks averaged 3.43 and Hispanic students averaged 3.65.
The gap in S.A.T. scores was wider. Blacks averaged 994, Hispanic applicants 1,032, whites 1,256 and Asians 1,293.
Graduation rates differ sharply, too. Six-year graduation rates for undergraduates are 59 percent for blacks, 64 percent for Hispanic students, 84 percent for whites and 88 percent for Asians.
But officials say the differences have narrowed over time, and it is not clear how much they reflect academic problems and how much they reflect differences in financial resources that could lead more minorities to fail to graduate.
 
The Attitudes
Resentments On All Sides
 Troy Duster, a Berkeley sociologist who has studied affirmative action for years, said it was being made a scapegoat for rejection.
"You've got 9,000 kids with 4.0 averages competing for 3,500 places," Professor Duster said. "Now, obviously, they can't all fit. But every one of them who gets turned away believes they got turned away because of affirmative action."
To Professor Duster, the furor over affirmative action is fueled by two illusions. The first is that opportunity today can be divorced from the historical conditions that created huge gaps in resources and achievements separating ethnic groups. The second is that there is a simple, quantifiable way, like test scores, to assess merit.
"There's an arrogance in the idea that you can put people on an ordinal ranking system," he said. "I'm not opposed to people getting straight A's. But I don't want society to see that as the only thing worth talking about."
But if the goal of affirmative action is to move toward a more equal society, many students assert that the effect is to create a campus obsessed with racial and ethnic divisions.
"It's created a stigma," said Darren Cook, a white graduate student planning to go to medical school. "I'm tall. If they decided there were not enough tall people here, I'd walk around and people would think, 'Oh, there's one of those tall admissions.' It sounds cruel, but that's how people think."
Many black and Hispanic students dispute that argument, saying the affirmative-action debate has become merely a socially acceptable way of voicing already existing stereotypes.
"When I was an undergraduate at Yale, there were all these looks that said, 'Why are you here?' " said Kristin Weber, a black first-year Berkeley law student. "When I made it through and graduated with honors, I had people come up and say they didn't know I was so smart. Well, I knew I was smart. There's a lot of hostility that's playing out in this whole debate over affirmative action."
Still, it seems everyone has a story of a friend who is one-eighth Cherokee and was admitted as an American Indian or one parent who is Mexican-American and was admitted while others of similar socio-economic backgrounds and better grades were not.
There are questions whether underrepresented Asian-American groups, like Vietnamese and Cambodians, should be compared with Chinese- , Japanese- and Korean-Americans and whether there should be enrollment goals for each separate Asian-American category.
And some skeptics say affirmative action in admissions contributes to a Balkanized campus of racially divided dorms and friendships that make the benefits of diversity more theoretical than real.
"This place is so racially polarized it's like a Spike Lee movie," said Alex M. Weingarten, a junior from Los Angeles and the outgoing executive vice president of the student government organization. "I'm not deriving any benefit from other groups on campus. I'm a white Jew from Los Angeles living with three other white Jews from Los Angeles."
 
The Proposal
Black Challenges Diversity's Value
 The biggest challenge to affirmative action in admissions is the one being mounted by Mr. Connerly, a black businessman from Sacramento, who says diversity is a worthwhile goal, but not at the cost of fairness in admissions.
Mr. Connerly has called for an end to race-based preferences in admissions, saying it has created unfair and discriminatory standards.
He said he would be more comfortable with taking socio-economic class into account rather than race or ethnicity.
"If you start with diversity as the objective in admissions you can end up doing some rather undesirable things, which is where we are now," he said. "We have a system where we're turning away white and Asian kids with 4.0's on a wholesale basis and admitting blacks and Chicanos with 3.3's."
But critics of Mr. Connerly's proposal say that no university admits solely on test scores and grades, and that none should.
"Who has the more promise, a student where there's been a tremendous economic investment put in by affluent parents, or the poor kid whose G.P.A. may be a little bit lower, who hasn't had the kind of preparation for the S.A.T.'s, but who has struggled and been relatively successful?" asked Ralph Carmona, a regent of Mexican descent. "Which holds more promise for California and America? That's the kind of question the admissions process has to address."
And Mr. Duster and others say race is such a fact of life in America that a youngster from a black middle-class family still faces numerous barriers that a white youth from a similar background does not.
The stakes were raised by the study prepared for the regents that indicated that a plan like Mr. Connerly's would sharply decrease the number of black and Hispanic students at the most desirable schools throughout the state university system.
The study found that across the University of California system, 40 to 50 percent fewer blacks would enroll, as would 5 to 15 percent fewer Hispanic applicants. The number of Asians could increase by 15 to 25 percent.
At Berkeley, if admissions were based on grades and test scores alone, Asian-Americans would account for 51.6 to 54.7 percent of the freshman class, compared with 41.7 percent this year. White freshmen, now 29.8 percent of the class population, would account for 34.8 percent to 37.3 percent. The figure for Hispanic freshmen, who now make up 15.3 percent of the class, would drop to 3 percent to 6 percent. Black freshmen would account for less than 2 percent of entering freshmen, down from 6.4 percent now.
Factoring in socio-economic background would change those figures only slightly. There are relatively small numbers of poor black and Hispanic applicants with academic records and test scores high enough for admission to Berkeley.
Mr. Connerly disputes the findings of the regents' study, saying that since essays are a major part of the admissions decision for half of those admitted to Berkeley, no one really knows how racial balance would be affected.
"I felt the timing was questionable and may have had some political motivation," he said. "They dug in their heels and want to keep the system as it is."
But he said that if the end of race-based preferences meant fewer blacks and Hispanics, so be it.
"If the system is fair, my only response is, 'Let the chips fall where the may,' " he said. "I don't give much of a hoot about diversity for its own sake. I want to see us better educate more kids."
But many board members and most of the leading educators in the state say it would be terrible social policy to have an increasingly diverse state shutting out minorities from its elite schools, particularly from law and medical schools that could prepare them to help serve their communities.
"In a few years, there will be no majority in this state; we're nearing 40 percent underrepresented minorities -- African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans," Chancellor Chang said. "If we don't educate some of the future leaders from that constituency, it's going to be very bad for all of us."
Mr. Connerly, who was appointed to the board by Mr. Wilson in 1993, said he believed that Governor Wilson's position could influence the regents when they take up his proposal in July. As Governor, Mr. Wilson is president of the board and one of 26 voting members.
"It's very close, but I have to believe that the Governor's leadership will help persuade some of my colleagues who may have been on the fence to join us in this journey," Mr. Connerly said.

 Later articles will examine affirmative action in various areas of American life.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Lawmakers Approve Strict New Welfare Rules

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 3

 BODY:
A welfare overhaul that would give Connecticut, the wealthiest state in individual income, some of the toughest restrictions on benefits for the poor, has passed the Legislature and is heading to the Governor's office for signing.
The House of Representatives voted, 132 to 16, on Friday in favor of a measure that would shut off benefits to families after 21 months, roll back benefits to levels of the late 1980's and require all welfare recipients to be electronically fingerprinted. The measure passed the Senate on Wednesday, 21 to 15. 
 The plan, which would save about $133 million over two years, would give Connecticut the shortest time limit on benefits in the country. Earlier this year, Massachusetts enacted what was then the toughest welfare changes by imposing a two-year limit on benefits.
The welfare overhaul in Connecticut was pushed to the forefront earlier this year by Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, who said he wanted to end the cycle of welfare dependence from one generation to the next. The state does not now impose a time limit on benefits.
The most hotly debated amendment, to fingerprint all recipients in a computerized process of digital imaging known as "biometric accountability," passed, 86 to 62.
Proponents said an identification system would help cut down on fraud, particularly among recipients who collect benefits in more than one community.
Critics said fingerprinting anyone, particularly the poor, had Orwellian overtones. They argued that it was just as wrong to consider all welfare recipients as potential cheats as it was to regard all politicians as dishonest.
"Let's not forget what people think of us," said Representative Marie Kirkley-Bey, Democrat of Hartford, who said the four years she spent on public assistance and in a housing project was "one of the hardest things I had to do."
"I was shunned, not because of the quality of my character but because of the source of my income," she said. "Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, don't judge me."
Some critics of the fingerprinting plan in Connecticut said that if welfare recipients must go through the process, so should others who receive government help. An amendment that would have required doctors and others who supply goods and services to welfare recipients to be fingerprinted was rejected, as was a proposal to require fingerprinting of recipients of unemployment compensation.
In New York, the budget currently under consideration in the Legislature includes a proposal for electronic fingerprinting of all welfare recipients.
The Connecticut legislation also calls for scaling back monthly cash benefits to late-1980's levels for families and childless individuals. To encourage recipients to find jobs, the state would enhance its child-care benefits and health insurance coverage.
The bulk of the plan calls for a reduction in the monthly cash benefit to a family of three on Aid to Families with Dependent Children to a range of $500 to $540, from $581. Payments would be cut off after 21 months, but recipients would be given an opportunity to apply indefinitely for six-month extensions.
Childless recipients in the General Assistance program could be on the rolls no more than 16 months total over a two-year period -- 10 months in the first year, and 6 months in the second year.
New arrivals to Connecticut would receive 90 percent of the usual benefit level for their first year in the state.
Women giving birth 10 months or more after going on public assistance would receive $50 extra each month, which is half what new mothers now receive for each additional child.
The state would also increase the amount it spends on day care for recipients from $28 million to $85 million over five years, and it would allow recipients who found jobs and dropped welfare benefits to continue to receive health coverage under Medicaid for two years.

HEADLINE: A Tribe Sees Hope In Whale Hunting, But U.S. Is Worried

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: NEAH BAY, Wash., June 1

 BODY:
The children of this American Indian village at the far western edge of the continent struggle with the usual demons of modern life, drugs, alcohol and violent videos among them. And like parents elsewhere, Makah tribal members say that a return to old-fashioned values might be just the thing to bring their youth around.
But in this case, tradition means going out in fierce Pacific Ocean swells to chase and kill gray whales, which have not been hunted legally in American waters for more than 40 years. 
 Citing an 1855 treaty that makes them the only Indian nation with whale-hunting rights guaranteed by the Federal Government, the Makah have announced plans to kill up to five whales every spring, beginning next year.
A whale hunt, they say, would provide focus for a tribe where unemployment is running at 50 percent and the fishing fleet has been hit hard by declining salmon runs.
"Right now, there's a real frustration among the kids with what's happened to fishing," said Andrea Alexander, general manager of the 1,700-member tribe. "They thought they could grow up and be fishermen, like their parents. With whaling, they would get to participate in something that has real cultural and spiritual value, and they could put food on the table as well."
The Makah plan has caused an international stir, and poses an acute problem for the State Department.
For more than a decade, the American Government has led the campaign to outlaw commercial whaling around the globe. But this week, at the International Whaling Commission's annual meeting in Dublin, the Americans have been on the spot from an Indian nation within its borders.
The Makah say there is a big distinction between their proposal and commercial whaling. The Indians want to take whales for subsistence and ceremonial purposes, not as part of a commercial operation. But opponents say it smacks of hypocrisy to allow one group of people to hunt whales as an indigenous right, but to condemn others claiming the same right, as do those in Iceland and Norway, for example.
All of this comes at time when the campaign to save whales is proving to be one of the major success stories of wildlife conservation. Playful leviathans that weigh up to 40 tons, gray whales, which are found only in the Pacific, are flourishing and have prompted a boom in tourist and recreational services.
There are about 21,000 gray whales -- the highest number in nearly a century -- according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Last year, they were taken off the Federal list of endangered species.
Taking a mere five whales, the Makah argue, would not dent the population. The Government agrees, but has yet to sanction the hunt. Among other things, State Department officials are worried about setting a precedent. In western Canada, for example, more than a dozen tribes can show a tradition of whaling. If the Makah are allowed to kill gray whales, why can't natives in Canada, the argument goes.
The Federal Government is also worried about black-market trading in whale meat, which can fetch high prices in Japan.
The Makah, who have held to this rugged corner of the Olympic Peninsula for nearly 2,000 years, would prefer that they not get enmeshed in environmental politics or international disputes. A return to whaling is simply a way to bring back a sense of cultural cohesion for the young, they say.
Twice a year, thousands of migrating gray whales pass this coast of wind-savaged cliffs and storm-sculpted rocks called seastacks.
"Re-establishing a ceremonial and subsistence whale hunt would be a catalyst which would allow us to instill in our young people the traditional values which have held our people together over the centuries," wrote Hubert Markishtum, the tribal chairman, in a recent letter to the State Department.
Although this reservation, 27,000 acres of heavily logged forests and extensive archeological sites, bans alcohol, there are drinking and drug problems among the young, tribal officials say. Whaling, which wouldrequire months of training and study of ancient techniques, is seen as way to ground youths in a tradition that has been nearly forgotten.
If the Makah do begin taking whales next spring, an environmental group with a record of sinking whale-hunting ships has vowed to intercept the Indians at sea.
"We have a 95-foot vessel and a submarine, and if we have to, we would put them between the Makah and the whales," said Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, based in Marina Del Rey, Calif. In 1986, the group scuttled two of Iceland's four whaling boats.
The Makah have long been known for their whaling skills, celebrated in centuries of native art and the photographs of Edward Curtis from the early 20th century. Up to 80 percent of their food once came from whales. They fashioned eight-person canoes from cedar, and used the crafts to hunt whales on the high Pacific.
Today, with the decline of fishing, this reservation has few prospects for reviving itself. Neah Bay is considered too remote -- about a four-hour drive from Seattle -- to support a casino, a business other tribes have turned to.
The Makah last hunted a whale in 1926, although their treaty specifically grants them the "right to take fish and of whaling," a provision unique among Indian treaties, Government officials said.
The whaling commission passed a global moratorium on commercial hunting in 1986, but Norway, Iceland and Japan continue to hunt. The commission does allow some killings by native people in northern latitudes, where there are few other sources of food.
Opponents say the Makah are a long way from a subsistence life style. They are building a 300-boat marina, and a new general store has just opened. Several small motels cater to fishermen and tourists.
"There isn't anyone alive today on that reservation who can go out there and kill a whale in a traditional manner," Mr. Watson said. "They used to keep slaves, as well. Do we go back to that? I don't see the point in making a distinction between natives having more of a right to kill whales than nonnative people."
But another environmental group, Greenpeace, which made its reputation fighting whalers, does draw a distinction. It is withholding comment on the Makah request, pending meetings with tribal officials.
The Makah say they do not need permission to start hunting next year. But they have filed a formal request to have the United States seek approval for them from the whaling commission.
"We'd like to follow the rules, and have the blessing of all government agencies," said Dave Sones, a tribal fisheries manager.
The State Department has yet to settle on a position, said Eileen Kane, a spokeswoman. But should the Makah end up selling some of the whale meat they take, the hunt is likely to be condemned.
"Our official position is that we are opposed to all international commercial whaling," Ms. Kane said. "We have supported limited whaling by indigenous people, but only for subsistence reasons."
The Makah have not decided exactly how to go about reviving a skill that has not been practiced here in nearly 70 years. They hope to gain some knowledge from oral histories in archives of their grand museum here, a major tourist attraction with thousands of whaling artifacts.
The Makah would hunt with harpoons that explode on impact, which they say is one of the more humane ways to kill whales. And they plan to work with the fisheries service to develop hunting guidelines to help conserve the gray whale population.
For now, this reservation, isolated from the world for so long, seems elated to be on a small piece of the international stage.
"We may look back on this, 50 years from now, and see it as the turning point for the Makah," Mr. Sones said. "People are really excited."

HEADLINE: Reviews by Weekend Moviegoers Are In. Dole Gets a Thumbs Down.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, June 2

 BODY:
It hardly mattered whether they had come to the Showcase Cinema to see "Casper," "The Bridges of Madison County" or rough-and-tumble films like "Braveheart," "Johnny Mnemonic" and "Die Hard With a Vengeance."
Most moviegoers interviewed today as they filed into the theater complex, west of downtown, disagreed with Senator Bob Dole's finger-pointing at Hollywood and the recording industry as causes of a morality meltdown in the United States. 
 If society has gone awry because of "casual violence and even more casual sex," as the Senate majority leader asserted in a speech on Wednesday in Los Angeles, people of all ages were more likely to blame parents and family breakdowns stemming from economic causes than to blame movie makers and recording artists.
And most, as they waited to see one of the 12 films showing, agreed that in general the violence and the sex in movies and songs imitated life, rather than vice versa.
"I thought his speech was really bad," Kristy Larsen, a 17-year-old high school junior, said as she and two friends waited to see "Johnny Mnemonic."
"People can make up their own minds," she said. "I saw 'Natural Born Killers' seven times. I really liked it. But I didn't go out and shoot someone after seeing it."
"Natural Born Killers," the story of a couple on a killing spree as they cross the country, was one example of films and recordings cited by Mr. Dole as "nightmares of depravity" for their depictions of gratuitous sex and violence. He also attacked the film "True Romance" and the rap groups Cannibal Corpse, Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew. Aides to Mr. Dole said he had not seen the movies he cited but had read about them and had also read offending rap lyrics.
Mr. Dole, the leading Republican Presidential candidate, maintained that the entertainment industry's portrayals of sex and violence had so permeated the country that they were eroding morals, civility and, as a result, the family structure.
While many moviegoers interviewed here said they agreed that the country was suffering a moral decline, most also said that little impetus for it was coming from the industry.
But several suggested that the movie rating system should be updated to include more detailed warnings on films with unusually graphic violence and sex. Marlena Mitchell, 28, an optometrist who had just seen "Braveheart," said she would have welcomed such an alert for "Pulp Fiction," which she found too gory. "I would like to have known it was going to be that violent," she said.
Like Mr. Dole, neither she nor anyone else interviewed favored any form of censoring entertainers. Several suggested that film and record producers "tone it down," but none proposed anything stronger. Discretion, they said, should be exercised by individuals, and guidance for young people should be provided by parents.
"Entertainers can't control what you do," said Alex Donovan, a 15-year-old friend of Miss Larsen. "Politicians blame things on movies because they can't control what's going on. They use movies as a scapegoat."
"They want to say it goes back to family values," Miss Larsen said. "But family values have been shot to hell."
"Like with my family," Mr. Donovan interjected. "My mom passed away two years ago, and my father's struggling with a third-shift job, starting work at midnight. I'd like to see him more, but he's just trying to get by, trying to survive."
"Same with my father," Miss Larsen said. "He's a boilermaker. He starts work at 5 P.M. and gets one day off a week. I don't see him much at all. I'd like to."
Marian Tomaszewski, a 40-year-old health and physical education teacher who had come to see "While You Were Sleeping," said she had not read about Mr. Dole's speech. But like other middle-aged people interviewed, she said she agreed with his contention that movies were too violent and that morality in America was slipping. The evidence, she said, is right there in her school, where boys who are not yet teen-agers bring guns into classrooms.
Still, that behavior occurs not because of violent films or suggestive lyrics, she said: creative efforts only mirror the real world, in which she sees parents who have abdicated their responsibility to provide their children leadership, guidance and discipline.
"The breakdown of family life came first," Ms. Tomaszewski said. "When I was younger, there was more of a family life. Parents watched their children more closely. But now there are more single-parent families. Kids do whatever they want, and parents let them. If parents don't want their kids to see these movies, they shouldn't let them."
Annette Shively, 36, said that having three children -- ages 6 years, 5 years and 22 months -- had made her think about what they might become exposed to. Taking them to see "Fluke," a family film about a dog, she said she did not favor any infringement on freedom of speech. But, she added, five years from now, when her children might be less inclined to heed her instructions, she would like to see that the entertainment industry is making more prudent decisions about sex and violence.
For now, she said, "I definitely control, or try to control, what my children see."
William Moore, 40, a supervisor at a children's home, and Darnetta Perry, 38, a retail manager, had come to see "Crimson Tide." He contended that most movie watchers and rap fans could distinguish between real life and the fantasy of entertainment, a point echoed by others.
In any case, he said, the responsibility for young people's exposure to the creative efforts that bother Mr. Dole rests with parents, not entertainment executives.
"You can't blame the movie industry for what children watch," Mr. Moore said. "You need to be doing more as a parent. If you let them watch that stuff, you have to watch it with them and tell them what's real. But a lot of parents just put their children in front of the TV and have no idea what they're watching, no idea what they're ingesting."
A few people said they were certain that art was influencing behavior. Jennifer Jablonski, a 14-year-old student who was seeing "Forget Paris" with three friends, said she had noticed a marked difference in her older brother's conduct since he began listening to rap and watching R-rated movies.
"He changed," she said. "Just from listening to rap, he is starting to use bad words. He calls me bad names all the time, like 'ho' and 'whore.' He never swore like that before."
Ray Kushner, a salesman from McKeesport, Pa., just southeast of Pittsburgh, worked as a volunteer for more than four years in the forensics unit of Mayview State Hospital and said he strongly agreed with Mr. Dole. Mr. Kushner said he was struck by the degree to which young people without parents or those with only minimal adult supervision were affected by what they saw and heard, especially on television.
"I don't believe in censorship, but there should be some ethical standard," he said while walking out of "Die Hard With a Vengeance," which he described as "extremely violent."
"Not that I was squeamish or uncomfortable," he added. "But the problem is with people who see these kinds of movies and want to act out their fantasies. They don't realize that the movies are not real."

HEADLINE: Facing Cuts in U.S. Contributions, U.N. May Rejuggle Its Books

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 2

 BODY:
Aware that United States contributions to peacekeeping and other United Nations expenses are certain to be cut this year, a group representating more than 80 countries is preparing to recommend major changes in the way nations are assessed for contributions.
Among the suggestions being considered is a formula that would return the level of American peacekeeping contributions to the 1973 rate of 27 percent of total costs. For peacekeeping, the United States is now assessed about 31 percent, which amounted to $1.07 billion in 1994, a figure that varies according to the number of operations each year. Like all permanent members of the Security Council, the United States pays a surcharge because of concessions for developing nations. 
 Congress has already passed legislation to put a ceiling on America's contributions to United Nations peacekeeping payments at 25 percent of their total costs this year. There is no certainty that other nations will meet the shortfall created by Washington's lower contributions in the near future. But many diplomats here agree that a number of nations with rapidly growing economies are now underassessed for peacekeeping costs, and ways are being sought to determine appropriate payments.
"A 22-year-old scale does not capture what has been happening," said Ernst Sucharipa, Austria's delegate here and a deputy chairman of the group that is to recommend changes in the assessments. "There is a growing awareness here that something has to be done."
The group was established late last year by the General Assembly and is expected to complete a report by July.
The United States is perennially in arrears on payments to the United Nations, both to the regular operating budget and to the peacekeeping costs. This has generated sharp criticism from other nations, particularly in Europe, where there have been calls for punitive actions.
The European Union -- whose members, along with Australia, Canada and New Zealand, always pay promptly -- has proposed that assessments paid on time could be discounted and that interest would be charged on late payments. Europeans say that the American reluctance to pay its bills is especially annoying given the large number of contracts that go to United States suppliers and contractors every year from a range of agencies and departments. There are some diplomats who propose penalizing countries that do not pay by withholding such contracts.
Time lags also contribute significantly to the problems of assessment, Mr. Sucharipa said. United Nations regular budget contributions are assessed for seven-and-a-half-year periods, based on information that may be a year or two old, so that changes in national economies are not reflected quickly enough.
Countries that emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union argue that they are especially at a disadvantage by this system, since their current assessments are based on inflated Soviet-era economic figures. At the same time, countries like South Korea and Singapore pay at a rate that does not mirror their rapid growth, and China is widely considered to be undercharged.
"If you are a country moving up, you are safeguarded against increases for a period of time," Mr. Sucharipa said. "If your economy is stagnating or going down, you are still paying at the old figures when you should be paying less."
A separate group of financial experts have suggested reducing the period for which payments are fixed to three years.

HEADLINE: A Study in Budgetary Realities

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 3

 BODY:
Throughout last year's campaign for governor, and continuing with this year's budget negotiations, Gov. George E. Pataki promised "dramatic change," "sweeping change," even "fundamental change." And in many ways, he delivered with a budget that will reduce spending and taxes, toughen welfare requirements and lengthen sentences for hardened criminals.
But in a host of lesser ways, many of them central to the process of budget-making in Albany, the more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. 
 Experts on the state's finances said the 1995-96 budget agreed to on Friday is laden with one-shot revenue measures, backdoor borrowing, pork barrel spending, unfinanced spending requirements, a pension fund raid and questionable estimates of revenues and the costs of benefits. These are all, in short, the kinds of fiscal transgressions that have discredited past budgets and that Mr. Pataki vowed would no longer be acceptable.
Cynthia B. Green, a fiscal analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit business group, said the budget could easily fall out of balance. "It's likely that this budget will finance recurring spending with one-shots and gimmicks, a prescription for a future budget crisis," she said. "That's not very different from what we've been used to."
As in each of the previous 10 years, the Governor and legislative leaders missed their budget deadline, this time by more than two months. And despite Mr. Pataki's January declaration that "the practice of back room budget making must end," the budget was negotiated completely in private.
Much else of what happened this year is at odds with the oratory used by Mr. Pataki and other Republicans in last year's campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
It was only 362 days ago, after all, that the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, issued a news release blaming the Governor for last year's budget tardiness. "The bottom line is that as chief executive officer of this state, it's Mario Cuomo's responsibility to give New York an on-time budget," he wrote, adding, "It's time for a change in New York, a Republican change."
When passage of the budget is completed next week, Mr. Pataki may manage to do better than last year's June 8 record, but only by a day or two.
But Mr. Pataki discovered that as long as one house of the Legislature is dominated by the opposing party, a quick consensus is difficult to reach.
And as a Governor who was elected with 49 percent of the vote and without a clear mandate, Mr. Pataki found himself in a poor position to bully the Assembly Democrats into submission. The primary tactic he used, withholding the pay of lawmakers and their aides after the April 1 budget deadline passed, fell flat after it was challenged successfully in two lawsuits.
The need to negotiate with the Legislature, and particularly with the Assembly Democrats, forced Mr. Pataki to compromise his fiscal values on several fronts.
"I pledge to you that as Governor I will not use fiscal gimmicks to close any deficits in operating budgets," Mr. Pataki told the Citizens Budget Commission last year. "I will not sell any more Attica prisons or state highways to state authorities."
Mr. Pataki stopped short of using such egregious quick-fix solutions from the past. But he did agree to use the State Urban Development Corporation to sell bonds to finance $125 million in stadium construction projects and other capital improvements.
Many state officials, including Mr. Pataki, have expressed skepticism about the economic development value of the stadium projects, making them questionable enterprises for the development corporation.
By using an authority as the bonding entity, the state will avoid the unpredictability of a public referendum, as is required for general-obligation bond issues. But while the bonding will save the state money this year (last year's budget appropriated cash to pay for the stadium construction), the additional costs in interest will make the projects far more expensive in the long run.
The budget also calls for the development corporation to sell bonds to finance the state's purchase of two New York City prisons for $120 million. The corporation has been used in the past for prison construction, but many fiscal monitors, including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said they believe it violates the authority's economic development purpose.
Mr. Pataki campaigned last year against "member items," the pork barrel spending appropriated each year in a lump sum and later distributed by legislative leaders to local groups like Little Leagues and museums. But the budget agreement includes $24 million for such projects, which have been given the new euphemism "program initiatives." Legislative leaders have promised to itemize each appropriation in the budget, but they have yet to provide a list.
In another pledge made in hisspeech last year to the Citizens Budget Commission, Mr. Pataki said, "I will not burden local governments with unfunded mandates," requiring them to undertake costly programs but not providing the money.
But a plan to increase pensions for state and local government retirees will impose such a burden on New York City. The plan, which is still being worked out, is expected to require the city to increase pension levels beginning in 1997 or 1998 at an estimated cost of $80 million to $100 million in the first year.
Mr. McCall also said he believes the pension plan may constitute an illegal raid because the state plans to help balance this year's budget by borrowing money from a $360 million fund that is dedicated to increasing pensions.
State leaders, in effect, created other revenue for the budget by devising new projections for anticipated tax revenues and Medicaid costs during the negotiations. Tax revenues were adjusted upward by $335 million and Medicaid costs were adjusted downward by $150 million. It will not be known until the end of the year whether those projections are accurate.
Mr. Pataki has also railed in the past against one-shots, the nonrecurring revenue measures that leave the state with a hole in the following year's budget. He proposed $650 million worth of them in his budget and accepted a total of $900 million in the final $33.1 billion general-fund budget.
Among the one-shots is a new requirement that any company with an annual sales tax liability of at least $1 million must pay actual and estimated taxes to the state by electronic transfer. The previous level for such a requirement was $4 million, meaning that hundreds of additional companies will have to pay taxes electronically.
The key to the measure, which is expected to produce $45 million for this year's budget, is that companies that do not pay taxes by electronic transfer must pay each month's taxes within 30 days after the end of the month. Those that pay electronically must pay before the end of the month. That means that the newly affected companies will have to pay taxes for the last month of the fiscal year, March 1996, in March rather than in April, the first month of the next fiscal year, providing the state with a 1996 windfall.
George W. Leung, managing director of Moody's Investors Service, which rates New York's bonds lower than every state but Louisiana, said his agency will look closely at nonrecurring revenues when judging Mr. Pataki's first budget.
"The use of the one-shots is a measure of the degree of willingness to deal with the budget problem," he said.

HEADLINE: On a Beleaguered Block, Success Never Smelled Sweeter

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
It stands out -- with its tan woodwork facade and its 70-foot mural of cotton fields back home -- as a respite from the strips of pennant-draped auto parts stores and the sullen cinder-blocked windows of Atlantic Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn.
In the 25 years since the Carolina Country Kitchen came into being -- as a hot plate in a storage bin behind a bar -- it has become a source of pride in an otherwise beleaguered neighborhood, a landmark beckoning to people from near and quite far who yearn for a memory and a taste of the South, for hominy grits and ham hocks, collard greens and candied yams. 
 And in a community hobbled by poverty, where residents say there are too few small businesses and too many with plastic barriers between the proprietor and the public, the restaurant's humble origins and years of success offer a glimmer of possibility.
Almost literally, the country kitchen at the corner of Saratoga Avenue fell off the back of a truck.
Its owner, Patricia Lee, 42, was a college student working toward a business degree back in 1970 when her father, George Lee -- a strapping farmer in Magnolia, N.C. -- began loading up sweet potatoes and watermelons from his 200-acre spread for weekly, 12-hour drives to Brooklyn.
There was an old gas station with a rutted parking lot at the corner of Saratoga and Atlantic, and from there Mr. Lee, now 75, would sell produce off the back of his truck.
"He needed a storage room because he didn't want to go back to North Carolina with the stuff," Ms. Lee said last week while nursing a neophyte through the subtleties of soul food in her cafeteria-style restaurant.
There was a storage shed beside the corner bar across Saratoga Avenue, and Mr. Lee rented it. "He couldn't set up early enough in the morning and people would come into the shed," Ms. Lee said.
What started as a small personal convenience for Mr. Lee -- a hot plate to cook breakfast for himself and a hired hand -- became the source of a burgeoning business. "In the morning, he would fry up a piece of ham or something like that," Ms. Lee said. "And when customers came in they would say, 'Oh, can I buy a piece of that ham?' So he would fry a piece and sell it. Word spread, and that's really how we got started."
Mr. Lee and his daughter were about to ride the curl of a wave of immigration from the South, through the 1940's, '50s and '60s, that transformed Brooklyn -- particularly its central and eastern sections -- into one of the largest black communities in the nation. In 1940, there were only 107,000 blacks among the 2.7 million residents of Brooklyn. In 1990, blacks, including a significant number from Caribbean countries, accounted for 872,000 of the borough's 2.3 million people.
By 1972, after the hot plate had been rendered obsolete by two large grills, Mr. Lee bought the building with the bar and hired his daughter away from her job as an insurance agent to run the fledgling business. A year later, after the bar owner missed one too many rent payments, his premises became the North Carolina Country Store -- a produce market across the street from the restaurant that now has hams hanging in net bags, a shelf lined with snuff and chewing tobacco, pecan logs, a "Standardized, Family-Sized, Galvanized No. 2090" washboard on the wall and bin after bin of turnip greens, mustard greens, stone-ground cornmeal and dry sage sausage.
"We still did ham sandwiches, sausages and chopped barbecue," Ms. Lee said. "But more and more people said, 'Why don't you make dinners to sell? We can't find anywhere to eat.' So I started selling dinners to go -- fried chicken, ribs, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, collard greens, corn bread. We had people lining up."
People were also parking in the lot at the old, closed gas station across the street. "One day I thought about a cafeteria, because of the lines in the store," Ms. Lee said. In 1982, she bought the station. "It took me a few years to put it together, getting the loans, getting the drawings and the approvals." The Carolina Country Kitchen opened in November 1988.
And no one could be much more pleased than Minnie Shannon, 42, and her sister, Linda, 40, sitting on the stoop of their building down the block. "It's a neighborhood store," Linda Shannon said. "It brings up the neighborhood. Every day they have somebody cleaning up all the time."
East New York "does have a rough reputation," Minnie Shannon said, "but there ain't no rowdy people here. It helps to have a nice restaurant on the avenue."
It has not always gone smoothly for Ms. Lee. "We've had a lot of downs," she said. And she has been robbed, a fact Ms. Lee does not like to discuss. But her father, up from North Carolina on one of his regular runs, said: "It was black guys, our own people, who did that to her. I don't understand that."
Despite the difficulties, Mr. Lee is profoundly proud of the way his daughter has built a business that employs 45 people. "I never had no dreams of it, that's the truth," he said.
Diane Bonaventure, program director for the East New York Economic Development Corporation, wishes there were many more small and mid-sized businesses in her hard-pressed community. "Unfortunately, there are only 600 or 700 businesses this size in East New York -- little bodegas, mom-and-pop operations," she said, "and really not many African-Americans who own businesses."
"Latinos own the bodegas," Ms. Bonaventure said. "There used to be Jewish store owners along Pitkin Avenue. Now we have a lot of people from the Middle East on Pitkin. Looks like African-Americans got lost in the transition."
So, in more than one way, Ms. Lee's enterprise offers a haven of sorts. James Neal, 47, a trucker, drives over from Red Hook three or four times a week, not just to savor the barbecue, the cheese grits, the salmon cakes, the stewed apples, the hash browns, the chitterlings or the pecan, peach or sweet potato pies.
"I'm from North Carolina -- Raleigh," Mr. Neal said, seated in an airy dining room that is decorated with a wagon wheel, a butter churn, an old lantern, a hay bale and a hoe. "I used to love working in the fields when I was a kid; driving the tobacco sled with the horses after they piled it up, the dirt roads, the country living."
"This place is like being in the country," Mr. Neal said. "All the things that remind."

HEADLINE: Gingrich's Welfare Vision Ignores Reality, Charities Say

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
What America needs, Speaker Newt Gingrich says, is a dismantling of the welfare state, with many of its functions turned over to private charities. But from the Union Gospel Mission of Seattle to the Forest Hills Community House in Queens, charity leaders say they are already hard pressed to meet existing needs.
And they say the Speaker's ideas are unworkable because his vision of what charities do and how they are financed is a page out of Norman Rockwell, a far cry from reality. 
 Although Mr. Gingrich has not offered details on how private charities could take over public functions, he has tossed out some proposals: One calls for every church and synagogue in the United States to adopt a homeless person for six months, while another calls for all Americans to contribute three hours of voluntary service a week.
He argues that helping the truly needy requires nothing less than a transformation of the American culture, shifting the responsibility from bureaucrats to missionaries. "It requires the person who will sit there at 3 o'clock in the morning holding the hand of the person who is about to commit suicide," Mr. Gingrich said.
But the cornerstone of American charity today, his critics in charities say, is not built on neighbors caring for neighbors in tight little communities. Instead, it rests on a vast array of organizations -- from neighborhood settlement houses and soup kitchens to national entities like the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross -- that are run largely by professionals. And the services they are able to provide are but a fraction of what government itself provides.
Also, while most charities depend heavily on volunteer labor and on billions of dollars in donations from the public, they are even more dependent on government money for their survival. Indeed, many charities themselves are major recipients of Federal Government aid that may be eliminated.
Mr. Gingrich and others argue that if government reduced its role in helping the needy, private citizens would pick up the slack, but many experts dispute that contention.
"We don't know for sure that they are wrong," said Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University. "But it seems completely implausible that if you shut down the Government that individuals and charity could compensate."
Government spending for a whole host of social services far outstrips what private charities offer, points out Lester Salamon, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. For example, in a comprehensive study he found that in 1989 Federal, state and local governments spent about $96 billion on basic social services like welfare, housing aid and child nutrition. He estimated that if Social Security, Medicare and other government spending for pension plans, health benefits and education were included, the government spent almost $1 trillion that same year.
And although total charitable giving in the United States amounts to almost $130 billion annually, nearly half of that goes to churches and other religious groups. Last year, less than $12 billion was aimed at human services, where government cuts are expected to be heaviest, and the figure has been shrinking steadily for more than a decade.
Most private charities themselves depend heavily on government money, awarded through a combination of contracts and grants. The Forest Hills Community House, for example, draws $2.1 million of its $3 million budget -- or 70 percent -- from government financing.
Even big national charities rely on government aid. Last year, Catholic Charities USA, a network of about 1,400 social service agencies, received about $1.3 billion, or two-thirds of its revenues, from Federal, state and local governments.
The Salvation Army draws about 17 percent of its revenue from government nationally, although in some areas the figure is 66 percent, or higher, said Raymond Peacock, a lieutenant colonel in the group. He calls a government role necessary.
"This is more than a private charity responsibility," he said. "It is a societal responsibility. We can address some of it alone, but we cannot address all of it."
That view is expressed again and again by leaders of charitable organizations, whether they provide food and shelter, education or counseling. Many contend that government not only has the responsibility to continue to meet the human needs of society, but that in many fields, is the only entity capable of assuming that burden.
Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities, said, "We believe that only government has the resources -- not to mention the final moral and political responsibility -- to promote the general welfare."
The idea that government should contribute to the well-being of those in need is not new. Even in the early 1800's, when Alexis de Tocqueville remarked on the role played by American charitable associations in fulfilling many of the social functions carried on by European governments, government in the United States was already playing a significant role as a partner in supporting private education, hospitals and service for the needy.
Some predict that if government's involvement in these matters fell, people's sense of responsibility, and their giving, would rise.
"The philanthropic urge has been muted because of the growth of the welfare state," said Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty in Grand Rapids, Mich., who asserts that this urge will blossom if the welfare state shrinks. "Do we have it in us? I think we do."
And Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson Institute research group, argues that the close relationship that has grown between charities and the government has been a "dysfunctional marriage." A separation, he suggested, that could leave some groups scrambling for money. But it could also give them more freedom to innovate, he said, and might make it easier for them to raise financing.
Others are more skeptical. While charitable contributions grew in the 1980's, when government cuts were threatened, most analysts attribute the rise to generally increasing economic prosperity. Many predict that while some increase in giving might be forthcoming now, it is likely to be limited.
A recent survey by the United States Trust Company of people with an adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 or a net worth greater than $3 million found that 68 percent of the respondents said they would donate more to charities if government spending and taxes were both reduced. But only 19 percent said they would give more if social spending were reduced but taxes were not.
Even if Americans are willing to give more, there are questions about where it will be directed.
In a study for the 20th Century Fund, Julian Wolpert, a professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, found that higher levels of giving often go to services enjoyed by the donors -- like museums, symphonies, private universities and public television -- rather than for social services. "We haven't had a test yet to show whether there will be a shift if we have stingier state and local governments," he said.
Yet another concern among fund-raisers for charities is that while cuts in government funds are already occurring, raising more money takes time -- years rather than months.
"This has been a 50-year-history of Government taking on added responsibilities," said John Thomas, senior vice president for development for the American Red Cross. "To try to undo that in a year or two is unrealistic."
One way to speed the process, some suggest, is to use tax policy to encourage more giving. But many tax experts consider any tax overhaul unlikely. And some of the tax plans that are under the most active discussion in Washington now, like a flat tax or a consumption tax, would actually raise the cost of giving, by removing the tax incentive that occurs when donors take their charitable contributions as deductions on taxes.
Adding to the uncertainty for many charities is the question of whether tougher rules for welfare and other social services will, in fact, reduce need or expand it. In New York City, for example, Mayor Rudolph Guiliani recently hailed the sharp falloff in the number of childless able-bodied adults accepting benefits when tougher screening for welfare was imposed.
But most executives in social service agencies say the needy are not there simply because money is available, and express doubts that they will simply disappear if the barriers are raised.
"The needs are not going to go away," said Emily Menlo Marks, executive director of United Neighborhood Houses of New York. She said that the 37 settlement houses that are her members have already lost money from New York City budget cuts, and that one of the biggest fears among settlement house clients is the possibility of losing child-care services.
"If they don't have day care, they can't work," she said. "And if they can't work, they have to go on welfare. But the budget cutters don't want people on welfare."

HEADLINE: Fearing for Desert, a City Restricts Mountain Bikes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOAB, Utah

 BODY:
A decade ago, this mining town of 5,000 was rescued from economic collapse by mountain bikers who found gold in the miles of rugged trails in the surrounding rocky desert. But in recent years, residents and the managers of public lands have come to regard mountain bikes as running roughshod over their land. So, Moab is getting tough.
"Something needed to be done," Clark Minson, an assistant manager at Kaibab Bikes, said of the restrictions imposed this spring. "This is where we live. We didn't want to see people trashing our home." 
 For years Moab has attracted the "been there, done that" adventure-sport crowd with events like the Fat Tire Festival in October. While not every one of the 20,000 mountain bikers who may be in Moab on a busy weekend are environmentally incorrect, it takes only a few with the pioneer attitude of continually pushing into new country to cause problems.
Among those worried about the damage is Jayne Belnap, a researcher with the National Biological Survey who studies cryptobiotic soil, or the crust, which is the living web of lichens, mosses and algae that forms the ecological anchor of this desert ecosystem. It is the crust that stores moisture, provides nutrients to plants and prevents erosion.
"If I want really good crust, I'm hard pressed to find it," Ms. Belnap said. "Everywhere I go, all the roads have been ridden off or walked off. It wasn't like that five years ago. It's gotten astronomically worse."
To halt the damage from off-trail riding and camping, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service this spring curtailed mountain bike and four-wheel-drive access to some areas and began monitoring others. Since March, the bureau, along with Grand County, which includes Moab, has been charging riders and campers to use the Sand Flats Recreation Area, where the Slickrock Bike Trail is located. The fees help to pay for the upkeep of the trail and a 120-site campground.
By early May, the fees had brought in $65,000, said Commissioner Bill Hedden of Grand County. The fees are $1 for one person to ride on the trail for three days and $4 for an overnight campsite. Officials expect 120,000 people to use the trail this year.
While a majority of mountain bikers and Moab residents approve of the fees, Bill Groff, co-owner of Moab's oldest bike shop, Rim Cyclery, said that by restricting access and numbers of bikers at Sand Flats, the bureau was pushing problems into other public lands not already degraded.
"I tried to tell them to leave Sand Flats alone." Mr. Groff said. "Let them camp out there. It's been ruined for years. They ruined that when the grazing came through 100 years ago. Leave it for a sacrifice area because it's already sacrificed. This way, people are not going out everywhere else and making camping spots."
Kate Kitchell, the Moab district manager of the land-management bureau, disagreed, saying that illegal camping by mountain bikers and others had been going on for years because there were not enough private and public campgrounds available on busy weekends.
To combat problems of overuse in nearby Canyonlands National Park, a 527-square mile sweep of labyrinthine canyons, airy mesas and remote back roads, officials started a new management plan on Jan. 25, after studies showed environmental damage from recreation.
"I think we took some bold moves to protect the park," said Larry Frederick, a park spokesman, citing the plan's strategies of reducing the number of concessions, like those that rent bikes, in the park, eliminating back-country campsites, closing some natural areas and increasing patrols. At the popular Angel Arch area, for example, park officials have eliminated 24 of 36 campsites and reduced the size of groups allowed at each.
"You talk to park managers today," Mr. Frederick said, "and they will tell you this: they're going to err on the side of protecting park resources because if they don't protect the park resources, 100 years from now there isn't going to be anything for future generations to come back and see."
But Ms. Belnap of the National Biological Survey said she doubted that such restrictions and public education would be enough to preserve the natural integrity of Canyonlands and other public lands. She said her research was finding increasing systemic damage to the desert, beginning with cattle grazing in the 19th century and continuing this century first with mining and now with recreation. Four-wheel-drive vehicles had greatly contributed to the degradation, she said.
"Probably the biggest problem is that people can go a lot farther on a bike than on their feet," Ms. Belnap said. "Bike travel has a lot more potential to wreck stuff. The soils here take 5,000 to 10,000 years to form. The damage we're doing in our management scheme is irreparable. You're not going to get that soil back."
Futile or not, most people around Moab, even mountain bikers, believe that restrictions and public awareness are a step in the right direction.
Dennis Finnegan of Jackson Hole, Wyo., has come to Moab for five years to backpack and explore by mountain bike. On his visit this May, Mr. Finnegan said he was pleased with the stronger emphasis on environmental protection. Still, he said, he knew that any use of the fragile desert could create problems.
"No matter how conscious you are in the back country," Mr. Finnegan said, "you always end up making some sort of impact."

Improvisations Are a la Mode If Money Isn't

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
"WHAT'S the budget? Zero!"
The students in Barry Canovas's visual merchandising class at the High School of Fashion Industries have learned that basic business lesson all too well. With minimal supplies from the Board of Education, students have to depend on fashion-industry angels and their own creative wits in designing and building the school's window displays on West 24th Street. 
 A few months ago, when public school students descended on City Hall in a helter-skelter rally against cuts in the education budget and increases in college tuition, Mr. Canovas's students did the professional thing instead. Like window dressers for their Chelsea neighbor Barney's, they created a six-window tableau of sight gags poking grim fun at the cuts.
A library with four books is open for two minutes a day. A student holds a tray with two lonely beans for lunch. Tryouts are announced for new team sports: kick the can, dots and freeze tag. Mr. Nomo's economics class is taught by one Mr. "Potacky." Say the names out loud. You get the idea.
"Instead of going to City Hall and getting into trouble, the windows were our silent way of protesting," said Lesley Pamblanco, a senior. "We were looking at low-budget games and stuff. We wanted it to be something people could look at and laugh."
THERE has been little to laugh at in the budget figures, however. Charles Bonnici, the principal, told parents earlier this year that the school could lose more than a quarter of its financing next year. Systemwide, he reminded them, $1 billion has already been cut over the last four years.
As far as he's concerned, double-digit markdowns belong in Seventh Avenue back rooms, not classrooms.
The school itself has changed drastically since the era of shoemakers, furriers and milliners whose labor history is chronicled in two impressive Works Progress Administration murals in the auditorium. In the years after its foundation in 1926, the school offered hands-on manufacturing courses in those trades, but it has changed its focus to financial, artistic and marketing instruction.
"Our students are training to be designers, patternmakers and the higher-paid jobs that are still in New York" said Bill Daniel, the school's assistant principal for organization. "The manufacturing jobs are out of the city or are still in the sweatshops."
SCHOOL administrators are concerned that future cuts could claim as many as 15 teaching positions, eliminate many after-school activities and lead to fewer advanced vocational courses. Those are the courses they had hoped would give their students the edge in the job market or college.
Even supplies for those courses sometimes aren't easy to come by, Mr. Daniel said: the merchandising department, which has some 700 students in its courses, gets a yearly supply budget of $6,000. The Board of Education catalogue doesn't exactly meet the needs for special tools and art supplies or finer fabrics.
"They give fabric you use for tablecloths," Mr. Daniel said. "We're making evening gowns here!"
The city's fiscal problems have given students material for humorous windows. But behind the jokes are real fears.
Denise Ruiz, a senior whose play "The King" was among the winners of a young playwright's festival at the Public Theater, insisted that the arts were not a marginal luxury.
"A lot of people come to this school because it's a vocational high school for fashion," she said. "But they want to cut back on the arts."
Many were worried that the students in lower grades would lose their bus or train passes.
"It's going to be really hard for people to get to and from school," said Victoria Evertsz. "Some are going to drop out."
What really upset them was the mixed messages from politicians who urged them to get an education yet want to cut school budgets. Some students said that while Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was telling his youthful critics to get a job, many of them were already working.
Emily Domena said her family would not be able to help her once she graduates, so she has decided to work for a few years and save up college tuition money.
"They want us to be educated for jobs, but I need a job just to stay in school," she said. "The politicians are being selfish. We're supposed to be the leaders of the country. They're just belittling our intelligence."
Ms. Evertsz, her classmate, piped up.
"The next President could be sitting in this class," she said. "Or mayor."

HEADLINE: Hitching His Star to the Bronx;
Ferrer's Career Mirrors Fortunes of His Often-Neglected Borough

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The Bronx is still a reliable punch line in many crowds.
At the Yale Club in Manhattan on Tuesday night, after Fernando Ferrer delivered a lengthy political pitch to the Protestant Lawyers Association, the group's president tactfully wound down the evening by saying that some of the lawyers had long commutes home "to the outer boroughs -- like the Bronx." 
 The lawyers laughed, as if on cue.
Without missing a beat, Mr. Ferrer rose to the defense of his battered borough. "There are those of us who think the Bronx is the center of the universe," he said.
Snickers aside, Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, was surely describing himself. The often-neglected, perennially poor borough is both Mr. Ferrer's pride and his burden.
Mr. Ferrer's life has tracked the ills that defined the borough's reputation. He was raised in the South Bronx, which became the national symbol of urban devastation, and he is a product of the Democratic machine whose corruption disgraced the borough.
But his timing has been impeccable. When he became Borough President in 1987 at age 36, the fires that ravaged the South Bronx had been doused, and city money was available to rebuild thousands of residences. The era of corruption at Borough Hall ended with the jailing of his predecessor, Stanley Simon.
Now, with the city's Hispanic population projected to outnumber the black population by the year 2000, Mr. Ferrer is the city's most visible official with Hispanic roots, and he is considering a run for mayor. But projecting himself citywide will be a challenge. Whatever success he can point to in the Bronx, the borough is still seriously troubled. His vision of the city's future appears to be in its formative stages. And Hispanic New Yorkers can hardly be expected to vote as a bloc.
Mr. Ferrer, known by his disarmingly boyish nickname, Freddy, presents a relaxed image. Invariably well groomed, with a full, neat mustache, sharp suits and matching pocket squares, he is attractive and likable.
Even as a teen-ager, friends say, Mr. Ferrer had political ambitions. After college, he became a soldier in the Bronx Democratic machine, was elected to the City Council at 32, and five years later assumed the borough presidency. With the new City Charter in 1990, the borough presidents lost considerable power, and Mr. Ferrer has clearly become itchy.
Gingerly, Mr. Ferrer, 45, has begun field testing a possible mayoral bid in 1997, speaking to a range of groups outside the borough (from Protestant lawyers in Manhattan to black Democrats in Queens) and, for the first time, aides said, hiring a professional fund-raiser.
His contacts with developers and contractors have proven fruitful. For example, a Connecticut firm, Worth Construction, and its president, was his largest donor last year, giving $10,000. The Worth company recently completed a $25 million school in the Bronx for the Schools Construction Authority.
"I don't obsess about it," Mr. Ferrer said of his plans. "I don't wake up in the morning and shave the next mayor." But, he said, "I'm thinking about it more now. I'm upset about the direction of the city. It's taken a mean and angry turn."
The election is more than two years off, and there is likely to be a competitive field of Democrats challenging Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Yet a strong showing by Mr. Ferrer would signal the emergence of citywide politicians of Hispanic extraction, similar to the earlier political rise of the Irish, the Italians, the Jews and the African-Americans.
"Down the road," said Richard C. Wade, a professor of urban history at City College, "as perfectly as an historian can see things, there's going to be an Hispanic mayor." The Bronx is likely to produce that mayor, he said, since it looks most like the future New York City, with a 40 percent Hispanic population and white and black residents each constituting about 25 percent.
Mr. Ferrer chafes at the suggestion that he is a Hispanic politician any more than the Mayor is an Italian politician. Mr. Ferrer, who was born in New York City, draws support from the Jewish neighborhoods of Riverdale and the blacks areas of the north Bronx.
Indeed, his biggest political challenge will be to unify minority leaders. Some black leaders view Mr. Ferrer with suspicion because of what they saw as his halting support for Mayor David N. Dinkins. Mr. Ferrer and Jose E. Serrano, the South Bronx Congressman, have occasional rifts. And Herman Badillo, a former Bronx Borough President, United States Representative and mayoral candidate, said he would oppose Mr. Ferrer in any mayoral try since Mr. Ferrer did not support his run for city comptroller last year on Mr. Giuliani's ticket.
 
Attacking Those Who Attack Bronx
 Ethnic politics aside, transforming Mr. Ferrer into a citywide figure will take work. If there is such a strain of politics as Bronx-centric, Mr. Ferrer has it.
He tells audiences that the rest of the city can learn from the Bronx how to combat economic disinvestment and physical decay, seemingly oblivious to the popular perception of the borough as a landscape of desperation.
And he seems most animated -- and intemperate -- when attacking those who attack the Bronx. His favorite target is George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, who has threatened to move his team out of the Bronx because, he said, fans are afraid to go there. In Mr. Ferrer's view, the Yankees are holding up city officials for increased and expensive concessions.
"If you have a better deal in New Jersey, George, go to New Jersey," Mr. Ferrer said at the Yale Club last week. "Go to Tampa. Or go to hell."
He promotes the borough with an arsenal of defensiveness and affection collected during his life in the Bronx during its toughest era.
Mr. Ferrer's description of his youth in Hunts Point sounds like a romantic movie about tenement life:
"Four- or five-story walk-ups teeming with people. Candy stores with a jukebox playing. Delicatessen, grocery stores. I shined shoes on 149th and Southern Boulevard. Played stickball."
His parents, both born in Puerto Rico, attended high school in the Bronx. His mother was a bookkeeper at hotels in the city, and his father worked at a variety of jobs from truck driver to insurance salesman. His parents were divorced when Mr. Ferrer was 8, and he and his sister lived with his mother.
At Cardinal Spellman High School, Mr. Ferrer became a member of Aspira, a service organization for Puerto Rican youths, and became a citywide leader.
"What always struck me about Freddy was that we always knew what he wanted to do: he wanted to be a politician," said Gladys Carrion, the former commissioner of the city's Community Development Agency, who knew Mr. Ferrer in high school.
At New York University's Bronx campus, Mr. Ferrer studied philosophy and classics and took graduate courses in public administration. After college, he worked four years on the staff of the State Assembly Committee on Government Operations. In 1978, Mr. Ferrer opened a district office for the Democratic Party in the Soundview section of the Bronx, where his family had moved, and was appointed district leader by the legendary party boss Patrick J. Cunningham.
Mr. Badillo, a longtime opponent of the Bronx Democratic organization, said that when Mr. Ferrer joined the organization, the party "was looking for young Puerto Ricans" as it tried to adjust to the demographic shift.
 
Young, Loyal And Untainted
 In many ways, Mr. Ferrer has played a transitional role in the Bronx ever since.
When Mr. Simon resigned as the Borough President in 1987 in the Wedtech military contracting scandal, Mr. Ferrer, then a Councilman, was picked by Bronx officials to take over. He was everything the party needed -- young, Hispanic, untainted by corruption, and a party loyalist.
When Mr. Ferrer took office, the South Bronx was in ruins and the courthouse, covered with graffiti calling for Mr. Simon's resignation, was a symbol of the borough's physical and moral decay. On the first weekend in office, he went back to where his boyhood home once stood and he found himself up to his knees in weeds.
"I had an incredible sense of anger and frustration about what had happened here," Mr. Ferrer said. "I came from the South Bronx, and I saw it disintegrating under my feet."
The money for rebuilding the South Bronx, and other rundown city neighborhoods, had been dedicated by Mayor Edward I. Koch, but Mr. Ferrer's arrival as Borough President was a significant development. "He had a vision for how the Bronx could come back," said Mark A. Willis, who was a Koch-era redevelopment official.
"He came in with a map and said these are the buildings people see every day from the Cross Bronx and the Deegan, and we need to do these first," Mr. Willis said. "He said no one will believe anything good is happening if we don't do these buildings. He was absolutely right."
Defeats Mingled
Among Victories
But some of Mr. Ferrer's biggest plans remain undone. In 1989, he declared victory in a fight for a new Police Academy to help revive the lower end of the Grand Concourse, but six years later he appears to have lost the fight.
His attempt last year to attract a sizable chunk of the $100 million Federal Empowerment Zone grant for the South Bronx failed, a sign of his subordinate status in the arena of mayors and Congressmen and Federal Cabinet secretaries.
Since the City Charter revisions of 1990, when the borough presidents lost their control over city spending, their jobs have become largely parochial, lobbying City Hall and the Council for the needs of their constituents and doling out a portion of the city's capital budget. Now, said Norman Adler, a political consultant, "Borough presidents are like the public equivalent of Chamber of Commerce presidents."
Mr. Ferrer's hankering for a larger arena is understandable. But on the stump, his vision for the city remains only a sketch. He said he was helped by programs to aid the less fortunate and that the city must continue to "hold the door open" for the poor. His message that there is waste, fraud and duplication in government seems to fall short of addressing the larger problems behind the city's chronic budget deficits.
Back home in the Bronx, however, Mr. Ferrer is lovingly involved in each of his borough's tiny steps back from the moribund.
On a recent day, Mr. Ferrer was called in to check the color of the new bronze doors in the grand ceremonial hall on the ground floor of the county courthouse. Mr. Ferrer's predecessor built temporary office space in the hall, covering murals depicting the history of the Bronx, and installed roll-down security doors on the arched doorways. The bronze doors were the final touches of a renovation that Mr. Ferrer initiated. The defiling and the revival of the room are a symbol to Mr. Ferrer of the struggling Bronx.
"When we get this place finished," Mr. Ferrer said, "people will say, 'This place is not without grace.' "

Politics
 
Mr. Dole Goes to Hollywood
Bob Dole knows a big target when he sees one, so when he went after Hollywood in a speech in Los Angeles on Wednesday it wasn't exactly a big surprise. Dan Quayle tried the same thing a few years ago. Mr. Dole railed against the "nightmares of depravity" coming out of California, at first sounding like he had just about enough of the O.J. trial. He criticized the movies "Natural Born Killers" and "True Romance," but praised such family fare as "The Lion King" and "True Lies." You know, that's the one where the very Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger wins back his estranged daughter by killing lots of bad guys. It sure beats having to sit through her school play. Dole aides said he actually hadn't seen the movie. We could tell. 

Taxes
 
What's in a Name? A Refund
It has been said that a computer is only as smart as the person entering the information into it. So it is sad to have to report that much of the Federal Government is run by computer, and, more crucial, so is the part of the Internal Revenue Service that handles tax refunds. The I.R.S. has decided to use its processing power to match the names and Social Security numbers on tax returns with Social Security computer files in an attempt to combat tax fraud. That is delaying some refunds by up to eight weeks. So if your name is Jon Smith but a Social Security clerk typed John Smith on your file, your check goes into some sort of refund purgatory. Washington bureaucrats gave us much fewer problems when we only let them use pencils.
 
Automotive
 
If at First You Don't Succeed...
Oh, never mind. Investor Kirk Kerkorian used fancier words on Wednesday to end his hostile bid to take over the Chrysler Corporation, but that's what he meant. In the month since he made his $55-a-share offer, Mr. Kerkorian lined up no investors to supply capital and no banks to finance the debt. For a man used to be taken very seriously, Wall Street pretty much had dismissed his offer for lacking, how shall we say, muscle. Well, maybe Mr. Kerkorian just needs more time to pump up his bid. He said last week that, "Withdrawing our offer will permit us to take a fresh look at the situation and evaluate our alternatives." That's a fancy way of saying, "We're still looking for the money."
 
Hot Dogs
 
Permit Me, Please, Say Vendors
So maybe we're all in the wrong business. The entrepreneurs who run the food carts around New York City are seething at the city's plan to limit the permits to run the carts. The city's rather revolutionary plan would allow one permit per customer. Naturally, Frank Cissio, with 200 permits, is upset. So is Dan Rossi. His 499 permits help bring him revenue of between $1 million and $2 million a year. That is not a typo. In the city of Rockefeller and Morgan, there are people who make their millions by selling hot dogs and pretzels to New Yorkers. No wonder David Letterman hasn't moved to Hollywood, he must be waiting for a permit. The last time New York handed out permits people waited in line days to get one. Now we know why.
 
Real Estate
 
King Kong Had a Better Beef
How can anyone resist a story that features both the names Trump and Helmsley, especially if lawsuits are involved. And better, all the fuss is over the Empire State Building, one of the few things in New York that can tower over both personalities. Donald Trump and his partners own the building, and Harry Helmsley and his partners lease and operate it. The Trumps sued the Helmsleys, saying the building was infested with rodents. Helmsley sued Trump on Tuesday for "irresponsible and unfounded actions to disparage" the building and hints that one of Trump's partners is a Japanese gangster. Stay tuned. Now, if we could just find a story with Trump, Helmsley and Steinbrenner.
 
Tobacco
 
Now Will You Stop Smoking?
This may be insignificant, but Philip Morris just said cigarettes can be hazardous to your health. Not all cigarettes, just about eight billion of its own. The company spent the past week recalling several of its brands because of a problem with the filters. It seems they contain contaminants that can form a chemical that is the basis for a pesticide sold as a soil fumigant. Yum. It is unknown whether soil fumigants cause cancer in laboratory mice, but for that macho smoker, pesticide-flavored cigarettes could have a cachet. Smokers who used the tainted filters said they didn't really notice. Anybody surprised?
 
Entertainment
 
Mr. Ovitz, We're Still Waiting
So is he or isn't he? Everyone has been saying, "Of course he is," but Michael Ovitz continues to deny he is leaving Creative Artists Agency to head up MCA for its new owner, Seagram. Word is that Mr. Ovitz and several of his Creative executives are all set to make the move, but they're still haggling ovrt just how rich Seagram is going to make them. Seagram's annual meeting passed last week with still no announcement, so the smart money is betting it will come when Seagram officially takes over MCA this week. Watch this space.
 
Trade
 
Let's Meet at My Place
Can we talk? That's what the Japanese have been asking since the United States imposed trade sanctions against Japanese luxury cars last month. But the Americans are playing coy, telling Japan, "We'll check our calendar and get back to you." The Japanese suggested meeting May 29 in Geneva. The United States said, nope, we're busy, how about June 21 and 22 in Washington. The Japanese wanted a more neutral site. On Friday, the United States agreed to Geneva, which specializes in neutrality, but said it has to be on June 12. And it still wants to meet later in Washington. That's called a compromise. Which is what everyone expects to come out of the talks no matter where they are held.
 
The Economy
 
Sure Enough, It's a Slowdown
Everyone expected Friday's unemployment report for May to show that the jobless rate had fallen to 5.7 percent. It did, but nobody was ready for the sharpest drop in business payrolls since April, 1991. Payrolls, which had been projected to rise about 175,000, plummeted 101,000 instead. And if that weren't bad enough, the Federal Government heaped on more bad news by reporting that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.6 percent in April, the third consecutive decline. That often signals an impending recession. So now we know the train is coming. The question is, will the Federal Reserve ease it into the station or will the train just crash through it?
 
International
 
Giving Peace a Chance
Thirty years ago, it was the staging area for the Vietnam War. The Subic Bay Naval Station housed the Seventh Fleet, and the adjoining town, Olongapo, entertained its thousands of sailors. It was a big business: about 42,000 Filipinos worked on the base. But in 1992, the United States gave up Subic, and there was much hand wringing over what the Philippine economy would do without the United States military. Not to worry. The mayor of Olongapo, Richard Gordon, has turned the abandoned base into a zone for economic growth and development and has attracted such companies as Federal Express, Enron and Coastal. About 19,000 jobs have been created. So there.

HEADLINE: One in Six in County Suffers From Hunger

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
DESPITE Westchester's status as the 11th-richest county in the United States, with a median household income of $48,405, according to the 1990 census, a recently released study on hunger revealed that one out of every six residents faces hunger on a regular basis. This translates into about 150,000 people, 45,000 of whom are children, who used the services of a food pantry, a soup kitchen, a shelter or some other program. In a recent Federal study prepared by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the county's estimated median income of $66,900 for 1995 ranks it third in the country.
The study was commissioned by the White Plains-based Westchester Community Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of the New York Community Trust, which administers a variety of philanthropic funds. The study, "A Growing Hunger: A Study of Food Inadequacy in Westchester County, 1993," was made between January and August 1993 by 180 students and 10 faculty members from the Volunteers in Action/Pace group, a program sponsored by the Dyson College of Arts and Sciences at Pace University. 
 Those researchers conducted close to 500 telephone surveys and more than 400 personal interviews. Food-Patch and the Westchester Coalition of Food Pantries and Soup Kitchens also took part in the research. Kraft General Foods underwrote the printing of the survey.
"Here in Westchester, where the cost of housing is so high, I was really surprised at how low people's incomes were," said Dr. Priscilla Denby, director of the Children's Institute and the Volunteers in Action, who supervised the study. "Seventy percent of the people we surveyed had incomes under $10,000. Only 8 percent were employed, and only half of those were fully employed."
The face of hunger in Westchester is directly linked to other economic factors, including the lack of affordable housing and employment.
"Everything is interconnected," said Dr. Gus Karam, an economist at Pace University in Pleasantville. "Hunger stems from poverty. Either people do not have the job skills they need or they have skills and don't get paid enough. Someone in Westchester who earns $4 an hour would still be in poverty. In an area that is as expensive as Westchester, a full-time job at $4 an hour wouldn't leave someone with enough money to eat. It becomes a vicious circle. Poverty and hunger are not randomly distributed. There is an over-representation among children, women and minorities."
The study found that nearly a third of all households had to choose between rent buying food. "People are spending a lot of income to avoid being homeless," said Patricia Larson, executive director of the Westchester Community Foundation. "They have to make these terrible choices, of giving up medical care or giving up meals. Actually, those who are declared homeless do better foodwise."
Most of those who use emergency food services are elderly, unemployed or single mothers and their children who live in the county's southern cities like Yonkers, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and White Plains. "We knew there was a lot of hunger, but we were surprised at how much like the rest of the country Westchester is," Dr. Denby said. "One out of three people in our survey said they knew of somebody who wasn't getting enough to eat."
More than three-quarters of the adults surveyed reported missing between 1 and 10 meals a month; close to 10 percent missed between 11 and 30 meals. "Almost nobody said that children in the household missed meals," Dr. Denby said.
One of the study's more surprising findings was that many of those entitled to food stamps didn't apply for them. "Only about 52 percent of those who needed them were receiving food stamps," Dr. Denby said. "People don't want to go to the government first. Older people don't get food stamps because of the bureaucracy and the stigma attached. And many fall just above the cut-off line in terms of income."
The study found that most of those who use emergency food services do so at church- or synagogue-sponsored soup kitchens and food pantries. "Houses of worship have been the birthplace of the feeding programs in the county," Ms. Larson said. "Many feel it's part of their mission to take care of neighbors, but people feel that they won't be judged when they go there."
But the plethora of food pantries and soup kitchens doesn't mitigate the growing problem for many residents. "We're lucky in the county to have these resources," Dr. Denby said. "But the lines are getting longer at the food pantries and soup kitchens, and many aren't open full time. It's hard work figuring out how to put food on the table."
Still, Ms. Larson cautioned: "Hunger is a fairly widespread problem in the county. It could be that someone elderly doesn't go to a feeding program in Scarsdale but might go up to one in White Plains."
School lunches, which are currently under attack in Washington, were used by more than 40 percent of those surveyed in this study. "With Washington looking for ways to cut almost any entitlement, it's going to get terrible," Ms. Larson said. "It can't help but get worse."
And however disturbing the study's numbers are, in the current climate of social service cutbacks on the state and national level, few experts are sanguine about the situation's improving.
"Everybody is frightened and waiting for the other shoe to drop in Albany and in D.C.," Ms. Larson said. "Right now is very iffy."

HEADLINE: More Budget Battles;
This Year's Fiscal Fight Is Over in Albany But Squabbling May Be Worse Next Year

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 4

 BODY:
Having just ended one of the longest and most bitter budget fights in state history, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature have now embarked on a course toward an even more caustic and protracted conflict next year.
The reasons lie buried in the budget agreed to by the Republican Governor and legislative leaders late last week. The spending plan fails to address many of the state's long-term financial problems and has created new pitfalls that could significantly worsen future budget shortfalls. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Pataki predicted that the state would have a budget gap of between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion in 1996. The Governor now acknowledges that the shortfall will be larger by an unspecified amount because the Legislature rejected his major welfare and Medicaid cuts, restored nearly $900 million in spending and approved a three-year tax cut that is larger next year than what he had originally proposed.
The new budget, which totals $63 billion for all funds, includes a range of measures to transfer the cost of this year's spending to future budgets, including borrowing to pay for new stadiums and using $900 million in so-called one-shot revenues. For that reason, many fiscal analysts and legislators think next year's shortfall could be as large as this year's $4 billion gap.
Though state spending plans traditionally contain questionable budget-balancing measures, Mr. Pataki had vowed to avoid them this year. But analysts for bond raters and business groups said he has not succeeded.
Without a strong economic recovery, which few economists predict, the Legislature and Mr. Pataki will probably be back at the budget table next year revisiting the most thorny cuts that the Governor proposed but failed to gain this year, particularly in the area of welfare.
"The size of the multiyear tax cut is the largest that we've seen, and it's by the state with the largest accumulated deficit," said George W. Leung, managing director for Moody's Investors Service, which has given New York the second lowest bond rating in the nation, after Louisiana. "It will make the achievement of structural balance that much more difficult and accordingly will necessitate more spending cuts."
Election-year politics are also likely to make next year's budget fight more volatile and ideologically sharp. The state's Republican Party has already singled out 21 seats in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, all of whose members are up for election next year. Those races could affect the budget negotiations by making both parties even more intransigent and the process even more nasty, brutish and longer than this year, which saw the third longest budget negotiations on record.
"This year was a battle; next year is a war," said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat. "You're going to see a whole lot of political posturing."
Mr. Pataki said he is not overly worried about a more protracted and politicized budget battle next year because he believes the state's economy will improve this year, partly due to tax cuts in the budget. Historically, it has been easier to resolve budget fights when the economy has been strong.
"I'm optimistic about it," the Governor said at a news conference on Saturday. "I believe that as the message gets out that New York is serious about cutting taxes, about reducing the cost of government, about lowering the regulatory burden the state places both on the private sector and local governments, that we are going to begin to see us creating the jobs and opportunity that have we've missed out on for the past four years."
But Mr. Pataki's assurances seem to conflict with the expectations of his strongest allies in the Legislature, who foresee a ferocious budget fight in 1996. Assemblyman John J. Faso, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee and a leading party strategist, said the Republicans will seek to close the anticipated shortfall by cutting social programs that the Democrats traditionally protect.
"We'll go after the same things the Assembly Democrats refused to do this year, like setting time limits on Home Relief and making further changes to Medicaid," Mr. Faso said. Home Relief is a welfare program mainly for able-bodied, childless adults. There is currently no limit on how long a person can collect it, and Assembly Democratic leaders rejected Mr. Pataki's proposal this year to limit Home Relief payments to 60 days per year.
State Senator Kemp Hannon, a Long Island Republican, said anticipated Federal cuts for Medicaid this year would make it harder for the state to reduce its Medicaid spending next year, but would increase the likelihood that Mr. Pataki will seek even larger savings from welfare.
"The Governor will definitely push for time limits and benefit reductions next year," Mr. Hannon said. "It's a hot-button issue."
Several independent financial analysts said the new budget seems to be balanced on some precarious assumptions. For instance, it predicts that Medicaid spending will actually drop this year, even though it has risen at double-digit rates in recent years. Several analysts called that prediction optimistic.
Mr. Pataki has also projected savings of more than $245 million from anti-fraud measures in welfare and Medicaid programs, although some of the programs have limited track records and could be challenged in court.
The spending plan also includes costs that will grow significantly in following years. A cut in personal income taxes will reduce state revenues by $555 million this year, but $2.2 billion next year. Reductions in business taxes will grow from $50 million this year to $160 million next year. And the budget calls for tougher sentencing laws that critics say will drive up prison costs, though Mr. Pataki's aides deny that.
In March, an analysis of Mr. Pataki's budget by J. P. Morgan Securities concluded that the state's economy would probably remain flat, that the tax cuts were "too deep" and "ill timed" and that the state "may experience chronic financial imbalances that could match or even exceed those evident at the height of the recent recession."
Since then, the Legislature has only worsened things, financial analysts said, by approving most of the tax cuts while also increasing spending sharply.
"They'll be fighting over the same issues next year," said Cynthia B. Green, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit business group.

HEADLINE: Mandaue Journal;
They Plow the Waves for the Squire of Seaweed

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: MANDAUE, Philippines

 BODY:
Benson U. Dakay hefted a tangled, soggy gray-green clump and shook it slightly.
"This is what it's all about," he said. "Seaweed." 
 The man known in the Philippines as the Seaweed King grinned, glanced around the warehouse piled with bags of the ocean's greenery and declared: "Seaweed is growing. Seaweed is growing fast."
One of eight children who inherited a small trading business and a company that makes mosquito repellent from his father, who was an orphan from Fujian Province in China, the 40-year-old Mr. Dakay has built an empire on seaweed here in the southern Philippines. Not only has he created a family conglomerate involved in the processing of seaweed, but he also owns a California-based food company, marketing and research centers in Canada and Denmark and even the original family business making mosquito repellent.
And like many of the success stories on this palm-tree island, Mr. Dakay has replicated the experience of hundreds of other Chinese-Filipino families, the descendents of those who came here over the last two centuries to make their fortunes, in his family's case a fortune built despite two decades of political uncertainty, occasional upheaval and, until recently, national economic disarray.
Today, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry make up barely 1.5 percent of the country's 70 million people, but Chinese-Filipinos have, as have Chinese throughout southeast Asia, been a dominant presence in the world of business and trading.
"My father was an orphan from Fujian," Mr. Dakay said. "He started the business, trading like everyone in Cebu, like all the Chinese here. Cebu has always been a trading center, a center for export, and that's what the Chinese did when they came here."
But trading alone could only take the Dakay family so far. During the late 1960's, Mr. Dakay said he wondered about the European companies that were increasingly interested in buying seaweed harvested from the ocean, packing it up and shipping it to Europe for processing. Here in Cebu, seaweed had been part of the local diet for generations, but there seemed little use for the stuff beyond an appearance in a salad bowl.
"We were dealing with the Europeans," he said, of his father's trading company. "We were supplying the French and some to the Danish. The Danes were putting up a buying station. I started organizing farmers to gather wild seaweed. But the whole thing became depleted after five years. There wasn't any more seaweed."
About the same time, a researcher from the University of Hawaii was experimenting here with the idea of seaweed farms, examining whether seaweed could be raised like any other crop.
" The Government began providing some support for seaweed farming," said Filipina Scott, who heads the marine biology section at the University of San Carlos here. "It began very slowly, but then began to take off."
For Mr. Dakay, the success of seaweed farming marked the beginning of the real commercialization of the seaweed industry in the Philippines, the transformation from gathering natural seaweed to organized farming. "Farming was the key," he explained.
Beginning with the farmers who had earlier gathered wild seaweed, Mr. Dakay and Government fisheries and aquatic resources agents began urging farmers throughout the archipelego to create and tend sea farms of about two and a half acres each. The farms were created by stringing nylon cord from stakes and tying seaweed seedlings to the cords. By the beginning of this year, nearly 100,000 families were engaged in seaweed farming.
Every day, from dozens of islands across the Philippines, bags of seaweed arrive at Mr. Dakay's sprawling warehouses. The seaweed is dried and processed into a powder called carrageenan, an ingredient in dozens of food products from hams and hotdogs to jellies, breads, beers, noodles, chocolate milk and ice cream. Increasingly, the world's supply of carrageenan is coming from the Philippines, and a growing percentage of that from Mr. Dakay's company, the Shemberg Marketing Corporation, its name derived from the first initial of the elder Dakay's eight children.
While Shemberg is the largest of the seaweed producers and refiners, nearly a dozen other companies here in Cebu are involved in the processing of seaweed. Last year, it commandeered nearly half of the $65.6 million Philippine market in seaweed products, or about 10 percent of the global demand for refined and semi-refined seaweed products.
With seaweed processing at the core of the Dakay businesses, the family has expanded its interests throughout the Philippines, including car-care products, foods and beverages, textiles, plastics and handicrafts.
Mr. Dakay pulled his sunglasses from his shirt pocket. "Finally things are going right in the Philippines," he said, alluding to economic reforms under President Fidel V. Ramos. He turned before heading out into the blazing Cebu sun and added: "Everything has changed in the last three years. Now everyone can do business. That's what we're doing."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Visions for Medicaid and Welfare Run Into Albany's Hard Knocks;
Assembly Democrats Took On the Governor Over Benefits

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Even as other Republican governors are pushing through ideologically charged laws to reduce welfare benefits and strictly limit how long people can stay on the welfare rolls, New York's Democratic-controlled State Assembly has defended the state's liberal tradition and forced Gov. George E. Pataki to settle for incremental change.
To win the Assembly's support for a deep income tax cut, Mr. Pataki abandoned both benefit reductions and time limits. 
 The compromise welfare agreement, outlined by state officials, includes several anti-fraud measures, like electronic fingerprinting of all welfare applicants, as well as a handful of policy changes that range from the significant to the relatively inconsequential.
"The biggest story is what was not done," said Russell Sykes, deputy director of the State Communities Aid Association, a nonprofit advocacy group. "The Assembly drew a line in the sand on time limits and benefit cuts. They prevailed on the two largest, most publicly trumpeted pieces of the Governor's plan."
The most important measure Mr. Pataki won would require 95 percent of the able-bodied recipients of Home Relief, the welfare program that serves mainly single, childless adults, to work for their benefits or lose them. Now, only about 20 percent of such recipients participate in workfare programs.
But Mr. Pataki jettisoned his proposal to nearly double the number of single parents, to 50 percent from 27 percent, who would be required to join job-related programs in the larger welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
He bowed not only to political pressure, but also to the fiscal reality that putting parents to work costs much more than it does for singles because of the expense of child care.
He did, however, persuade the Assembly to require teen-age parents under age 18 to live at home to qualify for welfare unless they can show they have a legitimate fear of abuse -- a proposal that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had endorsed but failed to get through the Legislature.
But the other change in Aid to Families With Dependent Children that Mr. Pataki extracted from the Assembly -- docking the benefits of parents of truant schoolchildren -- appears far more substantial than it is. Mr. Pataki had wanted the new rules to apply to all children on welfare, up through high school. But faced with impassioned opposition in the Assembly, he settled for first through sixth graders, about 180,000 children.
That will make New York the only state with a "learnfare" program that applies only to such young children. Of the 23 states that have Federal permission for such programs, most cover all children on welfare or teen-agers, who have the most serious truancy rates.
State officials say there is no evidence that elementary-school children on welfare have bad attendance records. Poverty experts who have studied such programs say it is likely that only a small fraction of parents will end up being financially sanctioned for their children's truancy. County officials who will have to carry out the new policy say it will be costly and burdensome because of the complexities of matching welfare records with the school attendance files of so many children.
 
Home Relief
 Mr. Pataki had to abandon his push for a 90-day limit on benefits to able-bodied Home Relief recipients, but largely succeeded in fulfilling his pledge to put them to work.
Throughout his campaign for governor, Mr. Pataki held up Westchester County's Home Relief program, which stresses workfare and fraud prevention, as a model for the state. That approach will now be copied statewide.
By the end of next year, local governments that administer the state-regulated welfare program will be required to raise the percentage of employable recipients working on public works projects or for nonprofit groups to 60 percent from 20 percent. And by the end of the second year, 95 percent, an estimated 120,000 people, must be participating.
State law has for years mandated participation in workfare, but the provision had no teeth. The new statute will allow the state to withhold up to 5 percent of state funds for administering welfare programs if a county fails to meet the workfare targets.
Recipients who fail to show up at their work sites and have no documented excuse -- like a doctor's note or proof of a job interview -- will be removed from the rolls for 90 days on the first offense, 150 days on the second, and 180 days on the third.
The state is actually counting on the workfare rules, combined with tougher eligibility screening, to generate substantial savings. In Westchester, the same combination helped the county hold the growth of its Home Relief caseload flat over four years, while it rose 11 percent statewide and by half in New York City.
The city, which began using a program much like Westchester's in January, has already seen large declines in the number of applicants found eligible for benefits.
 
New State Residents
 The compromise would mandate that welfare recipients who moved to New York would continue receiving the level of benefits offered in their previous home state for a year, if it was lower. Whether New York will ever be able to put this new rule into effect is open to serious question.
The Clinton Administration has refused to grant states permission to carry out such residency requirements on the ground that they infringe on the constitutional right to travel. And even if Republican welfare bills in Congress become law, allowing such policies, legal experts say they will certainly face serious constitutional challenges from advocates for the poor.
 
Aid for Children
 New York's learnfare program, which would financially penalize families with elementary-school-aged children who did not attend school regularly, would be phased in over three years. The state would have to obtain a Federal waiver exempting it from current rules before going forward, but such waivers have generally been granted routinely for learnfare programs.
State officials said the number of unexcused absences that would trigger the financial penalty -- from three to six days per quarter -- was still being negotiated. The sanction would lower the welfare benefits for a family of three in the city to $504 a month from $577.
To date, there have been no rigorous evaluations of whether financial penalties against parents improve the school attendance of young children, nor does New York have any data that show such children are, in fact, not attending school regularly.
A 1989 study by the Urban Research Center at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee found that second, third and fourth graders on welfare were in school an average of 165 days a year, compared with 168 days a year for children not receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children, a relatively small difference.
The researchers concluded that poor children would benefit more from additional spending on education than from more intensive monitoring by the welfare system.
But state Republican leaders said they strongly believed that the state should use financial penalties to encourage school attendance by children on welfare and ultimately to lower the dropout rates for poor children. They said they were disappointed that the compromise did not go further.
"You have to start in kindergarten or first grade," said Joseph R. Holland, the chairman of the State Senate Social Services Committee. "You have to educate parents and children that you have to go to school. My desire was to run it through 12th grade."
But many Democrats in the Assembly, particularly those who represent poor and working-class districts in the city, said the learnfare program set up an unfair, stigmatizing distinction between the attendance records of poor and working-class children and gave children too much clout.
"For the first time in the history of child welfare, we're empowering children with the economic security of the family unit," said Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn. "This proposal undermines the authority of parents."
From a more practical standpoint, local officials said they were disappointed that the learnfare compromise focused on the youngest children who were least likely to be truant and furthest from graduation and the demands of the job market.
"It would have been wiser to target teen-agers," said Deborah Merrifield, the Social Services Commissioner in Erie County.

HEADLINE: New York Builders Flouting Wage Law To Increase Profits

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Hard pressed by the deep recession in the construction industry, dozens of New York City contractors are increasing profits by illegally underpaying hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of their nonunion workers.
City officials say there has been a threefold increase in the last six years in the number of formal complaints by laborers contending that construction companies are shortchanging them. 
 And beyond that, labor officials and construction workers say, there are countless other workers who quietly accept wages that are a fraction of what is legally required, because they are so desperate for work that they are afraid to risk losing their jobs by complaining.
Dennis Stawkowski worked as a carpenter for a construction company that renovated a city-owned apartment building in East Harlem and public schools in Brooklyn and Queens. He was paid $12.50 an hour to put up walls and lay tile floors. By law, he was supposed to receive $32.27 an hour.
Worrel Thomas worked for a contractor who installed fire escapes, stairways and fences in 46 city-owned apartment houses being rebuilt in central Harlem. An ironworker, he was paid $10 an hour, but he was supposed to be paid $35.69.
The underpayments are on public-works projects. In New York City, contractors hired for such projects are required to pay predetermined wages, called the prevailing wage, based on state and Federal laws. In New York, the prevailing wage covers more than 100 job categories on billions of dollars of city construction projects that range from school repairs and hospital renovations to the building of new housing, schools, sewers and water tunnels.
Last year, more than 300 complaints of underpayments -- some of which involved 10 or more workers -- were filed with City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who oversees the wage regulations. That was more than triple the number of complaints filed in 1989.
And in the first three months of this year, 103 new claims were placed with the city -- nearly double the 59 cases filed during the first three months of 1993.
More than 30 states have prevailing-wage laws similar to New York's. In several large industrial states, including California and Illinois-- hundreds of complaints of underpayments are filed each year. In these states, though, the number of complaints has generally declined somewhat in recent years.
No one knows precisely how widespread the wage violations are in New York City, but many construction industry officials, labor leaders and municipal officials say the rules are ignored much more often than the number of formal complaints would suggest. Some construction workers and labor lawyers contend that the law is violated at as many as half the small public construction jobs in the city.
"You'd be surprised how many guys are being paid $10 an hour," said a construction worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's a big thing going on."
The contractors' motivation is clear, many labor leaders and construction industry officials said. In the increasingly sharp competition for public construction projects, many companies have sought to win contracts by submitting unusually low bids. They then try to make the jobs profitable by slashing their labor costs, often by ignoring the requirement that they pay the prevailing wage.
Some construction workers, particularly those who do not speak English, are simply unaware of the prevailing-wage scale. Others are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to complain for fear of deportation.
But most workers who accept a wage below prevailing rates are American citizens or legal immigrants who are familiar with the law, many experts say. They tolerate a low wage because they are desperate for work.
Mr. Hevesi said he was surprised when he took office 17 months ago at how prevalent the practice was. "There was widespread cheating," he said.
Besides competing for a dwindling number of government construction jobs, some contractors apparently ignore the wage law because of a more crude motivation: profiteering. Some contractors have found it extremely profitable to accept $41.55 an hour in wages and benefits from the city for a cement mason, for example, and then pay a mason eager for work $10 an hour.
The Comptroller is responsible for setting the wage rates for masons and workers in more than 100 other trades at city construction projects and for overseeing enforcement of the rules. A bricklayer, for example, must be paid at least $29.10 an hour, plus an additional $12.33 in benefits. An asphalt raker must receive a minimum of $25.11 an hour, plus $11 in benefits. The prevailing wage is generally the negotiated union rate for a particular construction trade.
Critics have long argued that the wage laws seriously inflate the cost of public construction, both in New York and around the country, and that they are primarily intended to protect the unions.
But proponents, including some major contractors' associations, contend that the wage scale helps assure a stable and skilled work force. They say the laws prevent unscrupulous contractors from exploiting workers and driving out legitimate contractors by underbidding them on contracts.
"The issue for contractors is a level playing field," said Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York.
Most construction workers actually work only 1,200 to 1,500 hours a year, because of rain and cold weather, Mr. McArdle said. A worker making only $10 an hour, or $12,000 a year, would not be earning a living wage in a region as expensive as New York, he said.
After Mr. Hevesi took office last year, he hired more labor investigators, began clearing up a large backlog of cases and asked city agencies to enforce the prevailing-wage laws more aggressively.
"The notion that we were not enforcing a law is surprising," Mr. Hevesi said. "I really believe in prevailing wage. It's fair and it's the law. It also makes good economic sense."
Some city agencies, trying to keep down construction costs, have been lax for years about enforcing the wage regulations, many union leaders and municipal officials said.
"It's not a priority," said Edward J. Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a union umbrella group. "Their goal is to get the job done, and that's all they think about."
Leonard A. Mancusi, the senior assistant comptroller, who is in charge of enforcing the prevailing wage, said that many city agencies had begun to be more vigilant about the law, in response to Mr. Hevesi's requests.
But many construction workers are afraid to speak up about being shortchanged, because they fear losing their jobs by pressing their legal rights. Even some workers who have filed wage complaints in the past and who have won back pay are quietly accepting underpayments at their current jobs.
A nonunion construction worker said he was currently getting paid $20 an hour -- a little more than half of what he was entitled to. But he was not willing to file a complaint or even talk for attribution about his current situation, he said, because of fears he would be dismissed if he did so.
"There's not a lot of work out there," he said.
Just four months ago, the worker won a large settlement -- more than $40,000 in back pay and interest -- for being underpaid by a previous employer.
The man had been paid $10 an hour for doing masonry and blacktopping on renovation projects in Central Park between 1991 and 1993. He should have been paid $30.08 an hour in wages and benefits under prevailing-wage regulations.
But now he is working for another contractor for $20 an hour. "I'm happy, even though it's not prevailing wage," he said. "All these companies, they try to pay you as cheap as they can."
Many other nonunion workers have made large settlements or have been awarded tens of thousands of dollars in back pay in recent years. During just the first three months of this year, 41 contractors agreed to settle with workers who had contended that they had not been paid prevailing wages. The settlements, which involved more than 130 workers, were worth a total of $486,000.
Seven other construction companies were found by administrative law judges to have violated the wage laws during the first three months of this year. They were ordered to pay a total of $375,000 in underpayments, interest and penalties to 22 workers.
In a case that wound through the Federal courts for three years, 35 Chinese immigrants who had renovated city-owned housing for a nonprofit organization, the Chinese-American Planning Council, said that both their employer and the city were responsible for underpayments. The workers, who were paid an average of $6.25 an hour, contended that they had not received prevailing wages because the city's contract with the planning council had specifically limited how much they could be paid each day.
An appellate court ultimately decided that the workers were entitled to sue both the planning council and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The case was settled last July, with the workers getting $1.7 million in back wages and interest, said their lawyer, James Reif. Some individuals received more than $40,000.
But some construction workers who have won large awards in administrative hearings have yet to collect a penny, either because their former employers are fighting the awards in court or because the companies have gone out of business.
Mr. Stawkowski, the carpenter who worked for a Long Island construction company, Hollywood Commercial Ltd., repairing city-owned housing and public schools, was awarded $80,000 in back pay and interest last November by an administrative law judge.
"I haven't gotten any money yet," Mr. Stawkowski said. Hollywood Commercial has gone out of business, but he still hopes to collect some of what he is owed through a bond the company took out.
"Why should a contractor make out better than the workers?" he said.
In another recent case, an administrative judge ordered the Brooklyn Welding Corporation to pay more than $1.5 million last July to 23 construction workers whom the company had underpaid. The contractor was found to have filed false payrolls with the city to cover up the underpayments, and it was barred from bidding for city contracts for five years.
Mr. Thomas was one of the 23 iron workers who had installed fire escapes and stairways at city-owned buildings in Harlem for Brooklyn Welding. He was awarded $78,000 in back pay and an additional $50,000 in interest, but Mr. Thomas said he had not yet received anything from the company, which is still in business.
"I hope to get it eventually," said Mr. Thomas, who is now working on his own on private houses. "It's a lot of money."

HEADLINE: Shifting Public Opinion by the Turn of a Phrase

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
Advice to Republicans: Don't talk about "cuts" in Medicare spending. Talk instead about reducing the rate of increase. Emphasize the moral imperative of balancing the budget for "future generations." Stress that Federal budget cuts will spare no one and will be felt across-the-board.
Advice to Democrats: Do talk about "cuts" in Medicare spending, and do it often. Emphasize the pain that balancing the budget will cause to "real people" right now. Stress that the wealthy will be getting tax cuts, while children and the elderly will pay. 
 So runs the counsel that pollsters have been providing their clients in Congress these days. It sounds like plain old common sense, yet this sage political advice results from a huge research effort, and it is likely to play an important role in the coming weeks. Analysts for both parties acknowledge that the outcome of the current budget debate -- one of the most consequential in recent years -- will depend largely on which party manages to define the fight in its own words.
The debate, after all, involves complex issues, like whether budget deficits are compatible with long-term economic growth and whether entitlement programs for elderly people can remain solvent at their current benefit levels. But it is assumed by all concerned that Americans will invest only brief attention in these issues, and that they will make up their minds on the basis of key words and phrases that they hear and, for one reason or another, retain.
"It's a great test of communications in America," said a Democratic pollster, Keith Frederick. "Which side is going to be able to tell Americans that they are doing what they want done? And the jury is going to be out until 1996."
In addition to their own polling data, Republicans and Democrats are molding their communications strategies in accord with polls made public by news organizations and with surveys sponsored by lobbying groups. One of the most influential of these surveys, which measured public attitudes toward Medicare, was conducted earlier this year by the American Hospital Association, a lobbying group for hospitals and health organizations.
The challenge facing each party is illustrated by two routine polling questions that consistently yield opposite results. If Americans are asked whether they favor "balancing the Federal budget," more than two-thirds will say "yes." But if they are asked whether they favor balancing the budget if it means "cuts in Medicare," roughly the same proportion will say "no." Members of both parties acknowledge that it will be very difficult to balance the budget without reducing the growth of spending on Medicare.
In their spending plans, Republicans, who have pledged to balance the budget by 2002, call for the Federal Government to pare by more than $250 billion the projected growth in Medicare spending under current policy over the next seven years. For them, the challenge is essentially to convince Americans that this is not a "cut."
Indeed, so concerned are Republicans about the terminology that some pollsters have been calling reporters to try to persuade them to avoid the word "cut" when describing the proposed changes.
"When you say the four words -- 'cuts in projected growth' -- all Americans see is the word 'cuts,' " said a Republican pollster, Frank Luntz. "If it is phrased in those terms, Republicans lose the debate." Instead, Mr. Luntz has been urging reporters and Republican members of Congress to use the phrase "increase spending at a slower rate."
Current projections predict that Medicare spending will increase by about 10 percent a year. The House plan would reduce that to a 5.4 percent increase, while the Senate would hold it to 7.1 percent.
Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster whose clients include Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Presidential candidate, has been urging Republican lawmakers to "individualize" the Medicare debate. She has instructed them, she said, to tell voters that under their budget plan the amount of money spent each year on the average Medicare recipient will still increase to about $6,300 in 2002 from about $4,800 now.
"People know very little about the numbers behind Medicare," she said. "A lot of it is the phraseology and the information you provide."
In addition to looking for new ways to say "cut," Republican researchers have conducted dozens of polls and focus group interviews searching for arguments that would persuade Americans to change their minds about reductions in Medicare. One critical finding has been that voters are much more likely to say they believe change is needed if they are told that the trustees of the Medicare system have determined that, left as is, the system will run out of money in 2002.
"We have to make sure people are aware the system needs to be fixed," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who is working on Senator Bob Dole's Presidential effort. "If they know and believe that, they are much more receptive to a range of options."
For their part, Democratic researchers maintain that Republicans are facing an uphill battle in trying to persuade the public that they are not simply looking to cut Medicare to balance the budget.
"They could talk about restricting growth as much as they wanted," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "It's clear in the research that Republicans don't have perfect credibility in all of this. Voters are perfectly willing to believe Republicans would do mean things."
Some Democratic pollsters acknowledge that their party may seem to be at a disadvantage because it has not yet presented a plan to balance the budget, despite tremendous public support for the idea. But most cite a parallel to last year's debate over overhauling health care, in which many Republican lawmakers attacked President Clinton's proposals without providing concrete alternatives.
"If you had asked people, 'Should Republicans provide their own health care plan?' people would have said yes," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. "And it probably would have been better if they did. But they didn't, and it didn't hurt them."
Democratic pollsters assert that they will win the debate over the budget if they keep it focused on the effect it will have on ordinary people -- for example, the higher out-of-pocket costs for medical care that elderly people will face. "Our challenge as Democrats is to talk about this in terms of real-world impacts," Mr. Garin said. "The challenge for Republicans is to talk about this in every way except that."
Research for both parties shows that Republicans are particularly vulnerable to the argument that they are cutting programs for children and the elderly in order to provide a tax cut that will benefit the rich. That is why Democratic pollsters have been urging their lawmakers to emphasize this theme. And it is why Republican pollsters have been urging their lawmakers to emphasize that their targets are corporate subsidies in addition to welfare for the poor. Some Republicans in Congress, for example, have been pressing for the elimination of tax breaks for mining and timber companies, although other Republicans are opposed.
"At the front end of all this has to be 'corporate welfare,' " said Steve Lombardo, a Republican pollster, referring to the tax breaks and other forms of subsidies given to businesses. In focus groups, he said, "public support unravels when people believe some groups aren't paying their share."
Republican and Democratic pollsters agree that the contest for public opinion is still in its early stages, and it is not yet clear which side is doing a better job of pushing its phrases into the public consciousness.
"Basically we're in the middle of this battle," said Ms. DiVall, the Republican pollster. "We'll see how it plays out."

IN CONSTRUCTION, ILLEGALLY LOW WAGES
Hard pressed by the deep recession in the construction industry, dozens of New York City contractors are increasing profits by illegally underpaying hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of their nonunion workers. City officials say there has been a threefold increase in the last six years in the number of formal complaints by laborers contending that construction companies are shortchanging them. [Page A1.]
 
IS BUDGET A BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE ILLS?
Having just ended one of the longest and most bitter budget fights in state history, Governor Pataki and the Legislature have now embarked on a course toward an even more caustic and protracted conflict next year. The reasons lie buried in the budget agreed to by the Republican Governor and legislative leaders. By many accounts, the spending plan fails to address many of the state's long-term financial problems and has created new pitfalls that could worsen future budget shortfalls. [A1.]
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
SCHOOL POLICING: CONTROL AT ISSUE
In Los Angeles, school security officers are armed and receive as much training as regular police officers. In many other large cities, school systems are working more closely with police departments as parents and educators become alarmed by rising school violence. With school violence in New York City having risen sharply, Mayor Giuliani has called for the Police Department to take over school security. Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines fiercely opposes that plan. [B3.]
 
WAITING . . . AND WAITING . . . FOR THE TRAIN
It may be small consolation to people who found that their subway trains were more crowded than usual, made more stops than usual or did not run at all. But if the riders thought that something was amiss, they were right. The replacement of a major crossover switch in Queens forced changes in service on F, E, G and R trains through much of that borough and between Queens and Manhattan. [B3.]
 
A SUBURBAN ETHOS SCUTTLED RAIL PLAN
Cost alone is rarely the entire reason something fails to happen in New York. The airport railway will not be built because not enough of the political establishment in New York and New Jersey wants to build it. The politics of the time mitigate against it -- a politics of shrinking government, reducing taxes and embracing policies that smile on the suburbs and their mostly Republican voters, not on Democratic cities. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B3.]
 
REGION
 
MANAGED CARE DELAYED A YEAR
In the new state budget, Governor Pataki left undone one of his most sweeping proposals to cut the cost of government: to require nearly three million poor and disabled people to receive their medical care from managed-care plans. While that might initially seem to be a major setback for the Governor, Mr. Pataki ultimately neither wanted nor needed to pick a fight with the Democrats this year on mandating managed care. [B4.]
 
A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SETTLES FOR LESS
Even as other Republican governors are pushing through ideologically charged laws to reduce welfare benefits and strictly limit how long people can stay on the welfare rolls, New York's Democratic-controlled State Assembly has defended the state's liberal tradition and forced Governor Pataki to settle for incremental change. [B4.]
 
CHALLENGING NEW YORK'S ADOPTION LAW
One couple appearing before the state's highest court is heterosexual, the other lesbian. But they have an issue in common: because they are not married, one partner cannot adopt the other's biological child. New York is the fourth state in the country to address the question of adoption by an unmarried mate. And by requesting that the cases of unmarried heterosexual and lesbian couples be heard in tandem, the Court of Appeals has shifted its focus away from sexual orientation and toward the state law's requirement that an adoptive couple be married. [B5.]
 
RAIL OFFICIALS REJECT RUMOR OF WALKOUT
For the second time in 10 days, rumors of a wildcat walkout by Long Island Rail Road engineers raced among commuters and transportation officials. But union leaders and transportation officials insisted that this time there would not be one. [B2.]

HEADLINE: Drug Smuggling Growing In Ex-Communist Lands

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 3

 BODY:
Acting on a tip from a Western anti-drug agency, Polish officials searched a Greek freighter when it docked at Gdansk on May 28. Lashed to the keel beneath the waterline were watertight bags containing almost 480 poinds of cocaine, worth $30 million on the street. It was the second-largest cocaine seizure in Polish history.
Five days earlier, customs officials had searched a fishing cutter and uncovered nine tons of hashish, worth $60 million on the street, secreted beneath a layer of herring. That was the largest seizure of hashish in Poland. 
 And two weeks ago, in the largest drug bust of any kind in neighboring Slovakia, border guards seized 225 pounds of heroin hidden in a panel of a truck crossing from Hungary.
These seizures were small victories in the war on drug smuggling in Central and Eastern Europe.
It is a war that the former Communist countries say they are losing. They have had little assistance from the West, even though these fledgling democracies are up against sophisticated international criminal syndicates that are better organized, financed and equipped.
"It is getting much worse," said Maciek Lubik, a senior Polish customs officer and the regional director of the Customs Cooperation Council, a Brussels-based organization, about drug smuggling in Eastern Europe. "The quantity and variety is growing pretty rapidly. And the big wave is still to come."
Officials say that at the moment, they believe that they are seizing only a small fraction of the drugs passing through their countries -- perhaps as little as 5 percent, Mr. Lubik said.
Most of the drugs being moved across Central and Eastern Europe are destined for Western Europe, not the United States. But American interests are at stake, analysts say, because criminal elements are undermining the development of democracy in these countries.
"We have other concerns besides what amount of drugs reach the streets in the U.S. each year," said Rensselaer W. Lee 3d, an American expert on organized crime in the former Soviet Union, in a telephone interview from Alexandria, Va. "It's not just a drug problem. It's an organized crime problem."
Polish officials say the Colombian cartels have established a beachhead here, which does not surprise Mr. Lee.
"Colombian traffickers are working very hard to develop ties with traffickers in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe," he said.
Polish law enforcement officials said they believed that the cocaine seized at Gdansk had come from Colombia and the hashish from Nigeria.
After reaching Poland, drug shipments are broken down into smaller packages, usually 20 to 45 pounds, then smuggled by individual couriers into Germany, Mr. Lubik said. The Polish-German border is lightly patrolled, part of Germany's effort to create better relations with its neighbor.
Western European and Russian gangs are also establishing themselves here, Polish law enforcement officials say.
Throughout the former Communist empire, from Poland to former Soviet republics like Tajikistan and Georgia, the stability and viability of states are being undermined by these international criminal organizations. The gangs are engaged in everything from car theft to smuggling nuclear materials and illegal aliens.
This could impair the integration of the former Communist countries with Western Europe.
In his speech at the Air Force Academy on Wednesday, President Clinton said combating drug trafficking and organized crime was a top priority, "to enhance our security."
Yet Washington is doing little to help combat the drug trade in the region. The Drug Enforcement Administration has no office in Poland or any other former Communist country in Eastern or Central Europe. The nearest offices are in Bonn and Athens.
Expenditures on combating the international drug trade by all American agencies -- like the Drug Enforcement Administration, F.B.I., Defense and State Departments -- have declined from $523 million in 1993 to $309 million this year.
The State Department's narcotics bureau has requested $213 million for foreign narcotics spending next year; only $4 million of that is earmarked for the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
"The U.S. commitments are minuscule compared to the dimensions of the drug and crime problems plaguing the region," Mr. Lee said. "For remarkably little money we could advance U.S. interests significantly."
Poland is not the only country where drug trafficking is on the increase.
Romania seized 350 pounds of heroin last year, up from about 55 pounds in 1993, said Mr. Lubik, the regional customs officer. Hungary seized almost 1,600 pounds of heroin last year, more than triple the quantity seized in 1990.
All of these countries have inexperienced, poorly trained and inadequately equipped law enforcement agencies. Many Polish police officers do not even know what cocaine looks like, Mr. Lubik said, and the Government has been able to send only 100 of its 5,000 customs officers to a two-week course in drug detection. Bulgaria has only eight dogs trained to detect drugs, officials there said.
Current laws also hamper the war on drugs. In Poland and most of the other countries, drugs must be seized as soon as authorities know about them. That means that officials cannot follow the shipment until it is delivered, which would help the authorities piece together the network and catch higher-ups.
Under these laws, it is also not a crime to possess drugs for personal use, which is a common defense of traffickers.
For nearly two years, a Polish committee has been studying needed changes in the law, Mr. Lubik said, and legislation has been introduced, but he said he did not know when Parliament might act.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
The Train to the Plane Turns to Pie in the Sky

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, the truth will set you free. Other times, especially if you're a public official, it will get you in trouble.
George J. Marlin, the new head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, learned that the hard way last week when he said out loud what everybody in politics already knew: The ambitious plan to build a 22-mile "train to the plane" was dead. Of course it was -- probably had been for years. But saying so miffed Gov. George E. Pataki, because Mr. Marlin, his man, had got out ahead on a controversial issue. And it infuriated Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, being Mayor, would like to see his city treated a little more like the major capital that it is. 
 But thanks to Mr. Marlin's gaffe of candor, New Yorkers now know that they and their visitors won't be getting a cheaper, faster, less congesting rail ride to Kennedy and La Guardia airports. Why not? "We don't have the resources for it," Mr. Marlin said.
The authority expected to raise $2.2 billion for the rail line; it would come from bonds paid for by a $3 tax on all departing passengers out of the New York airports and a related charge from airlines. But estimates of the cost of construction now range from $4 billion to $7 billion. If there were a strong will to push ahead, the Authority could have resorted to several proposed strategies for raising additional money, including Federal transportation subsidies, as well as taxes on taxi fares and higher parking fees to further discourage the use of cars.
BUT cost alone is rarely the entire reason something fails to happen in New York. The airport railway will not be built because not enough of the political establishment in New York and New Jersey wants to build it. The politics of the time mitigate against it -- a politics of shrinking government, reducing taxes and embracing policies that smile on the suburbs and their mostly Republican voters, not on Democratic cities. This is not an era for grandiose government projects.
"This is risky, ambitious and politically difficult," said a former high-ranking Democratic official of the authority, who insisted on anonymity. "You need a whole different philosophy. You need a Bob Moses or a Nelson Rockefeller."
Any large government agency like the authority always has options. It can spend here rather than there. It can subsidize one project, over-tax the next. It can be more generous to New Jersey than to New York, or the other way around. "There's an endless tit-for-tat played at the Port, like an endless Talmudic argument," said Anthony E. Shorris, until recently the authority's first deputy executive director.
Vincent Tese, New York's former director of economic development and an authority board member whose term is about to expire, says that abandoning the project is a clear choice. It is a choice not only against the train to the plane, but for protecting the commuting suburbanites from higher bridge and tunnel tolls and higher PATH train fares. "They're cannibalizing the assets that make you money," said Mr. Tese. "Rather than raising tolls, rather than getting a handle on the PATH line, they're doing away with capital projects."
THE PATH commuter line between New York and New Jersey is heavily subsidized. Riders pay only $1 each way for a trip that would cost them $3.50 each way if not for the Port Authority's subsidy. The tolls on the Authority-run bridges -- which include the George Washington Bridge and three connecting Staten Island to New Jersey -- are $4, charged only in one direction. Most of the bridges and tunnels inside New York City charge $3 in each direction.
Increasing the tolls and PATH fares for trips across the Hudson would not raise enough extra money to pay for the airport railway. But money is money. Abandoning the railway would allow diversion of the surcharges collected for it to other airport projects, like rebuilding the International Arrivals Building at Kennedy. That would relieve the authority's budget, and reduce the pressure to raise the tolls and fares. In other words, canceling the train to the plane benefits the suburban voters who elected the Republican Governors of New York and New Jersey.
The Port Authority may still raise tolls. But Mr. Tese and others suggest that the decision has already been made unofficially, in keeping with a pledge Mr. Pataki made to Staten Islanders during his campaign. Nor is there any plan to raise the fare on PATH, which loses $200 million a year.
"It's politically difficult to raise tolls," said Mr. Tese. "Raising tolls gets people in Staten Island and Rockland County mad at you. Nobody wants to raise tolls. I don't, either. But we got into this box because we're subsidizing PATH to the degree we're subsidizing PATH. The fact of the matter is, Giuliani is absolutely right. We should be spending on mass transit in both places, New York and New Jersey. Otherwise, we're going to cripple the city."

HEADLINE: Trimmer Budgets for Research Worry Seattle Health Institutions and University

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, June 2

 BODY:
For decades, powerful lawmakers sent money from "the other Washington." The money built bombers and a major research university, supported the invention of bone marrow transplants and studies of 18th century English labor poetry, trained doctors for rural Alaska and treated burn victims from Idaho.
Today, as Republicans in Washington seek a balanced budget, the future of those enterprises is in doubt. They were built up by powers like Warren G. Magnuson, a 27-year veteran of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and preserved by Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House from 1989 through 1994. But after last year's electoral changes that heritage is now in the hands of very junior Republicans who are committed to spending cuts, even if they pinch home districts. 
 So the people who run the University of Washington, or Harborview Hospital, or the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are worried. They fear, said Alvin Kwiram, vice provost for research at the university, that the Congressional newcomers do not understand that "research is an apprenticeship on the road to discovery."
Dan Evans, a former Governor and Senator and now a university regent, added, "The money nationally we are spending on basic research is the only thing that is keeping us ahead in the world economy."
As a dramatic marker of how things have changed, David L. Allen will go to the nation's capital next week. The Washington State Division of the American Cancer Society is sending him, its first lobbyist ever, to argue against cuts in cancer research grants generally and in particular to muster support for the Hutchinson Center, created under the National Cancer Act of 1971.
The word "devastation" is used a lot, and some program heads fear for their very existence. Others accept shrinkage as necessary but hope that change will be gradual. If there is an overriding anxiety here, in fact, it has to do with uncertainty.
"We don't really think education and research are well treated by uncertainty and rapid changes," said Lee Huntsman, associate dean for scientific affairs at the university's medical school. "This is not a system where you can turn the valve on and off."
David Jaffe, executive director of Harborview, said when he worked on this year's budget, "I am shooting in the dark."
Although the House and Senate passed similar budget resolutions last month, uncertainty about the budget afflicts both Washingtons. The resolutions present firm overall limits but only suggestions for specific cuts, leaving various Congressional interests to fight over how to slice the shrinking pie. Nor will the story end on Capitol Hill, since President Clinton can veto spending bills.
Yet, even if Seattle's worst fears are realized, this city will be shaken, not shattered, because no budget proposals so far seem likely to have a major influence on its biggest employer, the Boeing Company. Even with a recent increase in space station contracts, about 80 percent of Boeing's business is now in commercial aviation, and it sees tentative signs of improved airplane sales.
Even so, leaders in both parties foresee threats to education and health care programs. Representative Jim McDermott, the combative Democrat who represents the city, said on Wednesday, "If the Republicans succeed in passing the budget proposals that they have put out, the effect will be to decimate the university, the hospitals, the health care delivery system and the common schools."
Representative Jennifer Dunn, who represents suburbs here -- and in her second term is the most senior member of the state's seven House Republicans -- said recently that she would work with Mr. McDermott "on a number of issues involving the University of Washington and other priorities."
"I will work hard to save the truly worthwhile projects," Ms. Dunn said. "However, I do believe we have to put all Federal funding under a microscope. We cannot limit welfare payments to teen-age mothers and then exempt every social science research grant from budget cuts."
But even when representatives agree to defend some element of the $301.3 million the university receives from the Federal Government -- a total second only to Johns Hopkins -- they may lack the influence to prevail.
A year ago, when a lobbyist like Mr. Allen went to Washington, he would have gone to see Mr. Foley and Representative Norm Dicks, a onetime aide of Mr. Magnuson and a senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Even Mr. McDermott, a Foley protege who headed the Ethics Committee and led the fight for Canadian-style national health insurance, had influence.
Now Mr. Foley is gone. Mr. Dicks remains, but is in the minority in a suddenly partisan Appropriations Committee. The only Washington Republican on that committee is Representative George Nethercutt, a freshman. Party leaders appreciate his defeat of Mr. Foley, but that does not mean that other committee members will sacrifice their district's interests to help him. Besides, he represents Spokane, not Seattle.
There may be more support in the Senate. Both Washington Senators are on the Appropriations Committee, and the Republican, Slade Gorton, is the chairman of its Subcommittee on the Interior. He voted against all amendments to the Senate budget resolution, including one to restore cuts in medical research money doled out by the National Institutes of Health, although he might be more supportive later. He serves on the board of the Hutchinson Center and might work to protect it and other Seattle interests, but he and Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat who sharply attacks many cuts, do not like each other.
The worried institutions contend that the issue is not local "pork," and that they have repaid to the nation whatever help Mr. Magnuson once gave them. Bone marrow transplants to treat leukemia, developed by Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, are the prize product of the close ties between the university and the Hutchinson center, which depends on competitive Federal grants for more than half its $150 million budget.
Mr. Kwiram cites other medical advances, like long-term kidney dialysis, hepatitis-B vaccine and a study of the Pacific Ocean that is beginning to yield long-range climate forecasting. He fears that the last is vulnerable in a Congress where the prevailing attitude, he said, is: "That's environmental. Let's whack it."
The Harborview Hospital, run by the medical school, has the most impact on Seattle generally. Though known nationally as a pioneer in fast emergency treatment and burn care, it is also this area's public hospital.
Mr. Jaffe described the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid proposed in both versions of the budget resolution as "humongous," and said he expected Congress to identify, as its first targets, programs in which substantial cuts would not appear to hurt patients and voters. He said Harborview, with 48 percent of its patients on Medicaid, benefits from two such programs: a Federal program that provides extra reimbursement to hospitals with heavy loads of poor patients and a Medicare subsidy to help teaching hospitals pay the extra costs of medical education.
Those programs provide about $2 million each in a $170 million budget that has a cushion, this year, of only $200,000. "If you take the worst case scenario," said Dr. James LoGerfo, Harborview's medical director, "it's a doomsday scenario."
Long before doomsday, spending issues have already created tensions here that mirror those in Congress. William P. Gerberding, the university's president, says the institution could survive a loss of Federal research funds but would be a different, less exciting place. Yet, he said he found a "ray of hope" when in late May the Senate adopted a nonbinding budget amendment designed to eliminate almost all N.I.H. cuts.
But Ernest Morris, the university's vice president for student affairs, said he took little solace in that amendment while the fate of student aid programs remained unknown. Of the university's 25,000 undergraduates, he said, 5,500 depend on Federal Pell grants.

HEADLINE: CHANGE OF POLICY ON U.S. IMMIGRANTS IS URGED BY PANEL

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
A Federal advisory commission will soon recommend gradually reducing legal immigration by one-third and reshuffling visa priorities to speed up the admission of spouses and young children of legal aliens, members of the panel have said.
The proposals, to be presented to Congress later this month, would make the biggest changes in more than 40 years in policies governing the selection of legal immigrants. 
 The panel's plan would clear up a huge backlog of visa applications from the immediate relatives of permanent resident aliens. But it would also eliminate longstanding visa preferences for siblings and adult children of United States citizens, making immigration more difficult for them.
The nine-member advisory panel, the Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas, will emphasize the importance of the nuclear family as the basic unit of immigration, members said.
Under the panel's recommendations, the immediate relatives of United States citizens -- spouses, children under the age of 21 and parents -- would still be allowed to immigrate without a waiting period or limits on the number admitted each year.
But panel members said they would recommend eliminating immigration preferences that have been granted for decades to other close relatives, including the brothers, sisters and adult children of United States citizens. In general, those relatives could not obtain visas to immigrate unless they qualified because of their job skills.
The commission's proposals are likely to be influential on Capitol Hill because Congress created the commission, appointed eight of the nine members and is seeking new ways to overcome deep disagreements on immigration policy.
Since lawmakers have not yet seen the report, there is no way to know how its recommendations will fare in Congress. But it is built on a complex set of trade-offs intended to offer something to all sides in the immigration debate. And it will no doubt further appeal to many in Congress simply because the commission and its report offer some political cover on highly contentious issues.
Many Republican lawmakers favor new limits, but some, like Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, see immigration as an engine of economic growth and oppose new restrictions.
In addition, the recommendations come at a time when many Americans are expressing concern about immigration, whether legal and illegal. In California last November, voters approved a ballot measure that would make illegal aliens ineligible for public education and most social services. Judges have delayed its enforcement while it faces legal challenges.
In addition, the House of Representatives in March approved a bill that would deny welfare, food stamps and Medicaid to legal aliens.
Some members of the immigration panel said they were reluctant to discuss its recommendations because they were still editing the report. But some suggested that public concern about illegal immigration was inevitably influencing public attitudes toward legal immigration.
One member of the panel, Bruce A. Morrison, a former Democratic member of Congress from Connecticut, said: "Current levels of legal immigration are not a problem. But in the context of substantial illegal immigration, there is a problem."
Lawrence H. Fuchs, a professor at Brandeis University who is vice chairman of the commission, said, "In the aggregate, on balance, immigrants have contributed to strengthening the United States." He deplored what he described as a public "fixation on numbers" but added, "We have to have limits because of the disproportionate impact of immigration in some places like Los Angeles."
At a closed meeting, from May 23 to 25, commission members said, they affirmed the value of legal immigration, but voted to recommend that Congress reduce it by one-third over the next few years from its average over the last three years of 830,000 a year. In the transition period, 700,000 immigrants would be admitted annually. After the transition, 550,000 would be admitted each year, and that would become the normal level of legal immigration.
As a corollary, panel members said, Congress should eliminate the large backlog of visa applications already filed on behalf of the spouses and minor children of permanent resident aliens. Congress could do that over three to eight years, they said.
An immigration expert who worked with the commission said: "Both sides of the equation are necessary. Reducing immigration without expediting the entry of immediate relatives flies in the face of human nature. It will only increase illegal migration. But expediting their entry requires the elimination of other categories in order to get the needed visa numbers."
Susan Martin, executive director of the commission, said there were 1.1 million would-be immigrants on the waiting list of spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. About 850,000 are relatives of illegal aliens who gained legal status under an amnesty program created by Congress in 1986. Most others are overseas relatives of recent legal immigrants.
Ms. Martin said it would take at least a decade to work through the backlog under current law. Commission members said it was not in the national interest for families to be apart for so long.
The panel's major recommendations were approved by votes of 8 to 1. Commission members said they were surprised that they had achieved a bipartisan consensus. The dissenter was Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, whose members represent legal and illegal aliens, their relatives and employers.
"This is a short-sighted proposal," Mr. Leiden said in an interview. "I would support revising the priorities for family immigration, but cannot support the commission's proposal to eliminate three of the four existing family preference categories. I also oppose the reduction of almost 30 percent in the ceiling for employment-based immigrants."
The commission recommends that the Government levy substantial fees on employers who want to bring in foreign workers like computer scientists, engineers and health professionals. The fees are meant to discourage employers from hiring foreign workers when Americans are available. Employers willing to pay the fees could import foreign workers faster than they do now.
Mr. Leiden criticized this proposal as a tax on American businesses that use foreign workers. He said it would hinder access to the skills needed to compete in a global economy.
Another panel member, Harold W. Ezell, a former Western regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said: "I believe immigration is good for America. But too much of a good thing can be harmful. I love certain types of candy, but if you eat too much, you'll overdose on chocolate. We've got to have balance."
Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Wyoming Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, has proposed a 25 percent reduction in legal immigration over the next five years, to provide "a breathing space." The current flow of legal immigrants is more than can be "comfortably absorbed," he said.
In September, the commission recommended a crackdown on illegal immigration along the border and at work sites. It said the Government should establish a computerized register of the names and Social Security numbers of all citizens and legal aliens authorized to work in the United States, so employers could verify the immigration status of job applicants. In February, President Clinton said he wanted to test such a system, but many civil liberties advocate, Hispanic organizations, and Chinese and Jewish groups have opposed such proposals, saying they could increase job discrimination.
The argument that illegal immigration would undermine support for legal immigration upsets many immigration lawyers. "In essence, legal immigrants are being made scapegoats for the inability of Congress and the Administration to control illegal immigration," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School.
The proposed changes come just five years after Congress authorized increases in immigration for certain groups, including highly skilled workers. The 1990 law more than doubled the number of immigrants who could be admitted because of job skills, to 140,000 a year from 54,000. The Jordan commission proposes reducing the number to 100,000, on the ground that no more are needed.
Commission members said they would also recommend eliminating the annual allotment of 10,000 visas for unskilled workers seeking jobs in the United States. The commission concluded that these immigrants compete directly with unskilled American workers and young people entering the labor force. In addition, panel members said that hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients would soon be looking for jobs if, as expected, Congress imposes tough work requirements as part of a bill to overhaul the welfare system.
Many unskilled immigrants work in restaurants and home-care jobs, helping people who are elderly or disabled. About 79,000 unskilled workers are on the waiting list in this category. The Government is now issuing visas to people who have been waiting five years.
Ms. Jordan, the chairwoman of the commission, is a professor at the University of Texas in Austin. The other members of the panel, besides Mr. Morrison, Mr. Fuchs, Mr. Leiden and Mr. Ezell, are Richard Estrada, an associate editor of the editorial page of The Dallas Morning News; Robert Charles Hill, a lawyer in Washington; Nelson Merced, a former state legislator in Massachusetts, and Michael S. Teitelbaum, a program officer at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York.

HEADLINE: Acid-Rain Pollution Credits Are Not Enticing Utilities

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
What do you get when you cross a free-market economist with an environmentalist?
First, a Federal law that allows companies to buy and sell the right to pollute. Next, a market for the right to pollute -- and a price tag on the value of that right. 
 But in the end, maybe a lot less than was predicted.
Five years after the system was passed into law, trading in pollution rights is slow, and the price for the right to put a ton of acid-rain pollutants into the atmosphere, which had started low, has collapsed.
In fact, the price is now so low -- a tenth of what some utility lobbyists had predicted -- that it raises questions about the assumptions that Congress used when it established the system and accompanying pollution limits. Another interpretation is that the market is simply not working.
The Clean Air Act of 1990 cut the allowable emissions of sulfur dioxide by roughly half. And it created a new regulatory system to reach that goal, a system described by proponents as bringing the efficiency of a free-market economy to the expensive problem of pollution control.
Here is an example of how it was supposed to work:
To comply with the new Federal sulfur dioxide limits, Plant A and Plant B each have to cut one ton of the pollutant. The reduction would cost $1,200 at Plant A and $1,500 at Plant B, or $2,700 total. But under the system, Plant A is allowed to reduce its pollution by two tons and sell Plant B the right to emit the second ton. The result is equal pollution reduction for $2,400, for a savings of $300. On a national basis, the savings could total billions of dollars on the cost of cutting emissions by about 10 million tons annually.
"It's one of those things that looked terrific in theory," said Peter Jump, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, the Washington-based trade association for the utility industry. "But once you get into the practice of it, some things don't turn out the way you expected."
One clear difference is price. When Congress was debating the emission limits, utilities predicted that a one-ton allowance would sell for $1,000 or more; some said $1,500. The Environmental Protection Agency said $500 to $600.
The price of a one-ton allowance is now less than $140. In 1992, when the first trades were made, it was about $250, and it has fallen every year.
"Everybody was stunned," said Brian J. McLean, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's acid rain division. The industry estimates during debate on the bill, he said, may have involved some "gaming," meaning utility executives picked high numbers in an effort to dissuade Congress from imposing stricter standards. But no one thought the price would be so low, he said.
The economists' theory was that if the price was low, utilities whose costs were higher would rush to buy the right to pollute. But utilities appear reluctant to buy or sell, even though the General Accounting Office said earlier this year that the utilities could cut costs if they participated more.
"The lesson so far is its potential has not been realized," said Peter Guerrero, an author of a December 1994 report by the accounting office on trading pollution rights. "Trading has effectively reduced the cost of compliance, but there are far greater reductions that could result."
According to the G.A.O., the annual cost of compliance in 2009, when the stricter pollution standards are fully phased in, will be about $2 billion, assuming heavy use of trading. In 1990, when Congress was debating the law, the environmental agency put the cost at twice that. In other words, the amount that Congress thought it was committing the power companies to spend -- a cost to be picked up by electricity consumers -- was fiction. The nation will achieve the pollution reduction for far less, while spending what Congress thought it was requiring would have bought far more pollution reduction.
If Congress was striking a balance between environmental toughness and financial mercy, it could have required tougher standards for the amount it had agreed to make utilities spend.
And some environmentalists say that the trades have made the acid rain problem worse than it would have been with a simple order that each plant reduce its pollution. New York State tried unsuccessfully to intervene when one utility cleaned up more than required and made the excess emission credits available to utilities in the Midwest -- a region whose emissions blow back into New York, aggravating the state's acid rain problem.
The unanticipated twist in the market may have implications for other trading schemes that are proposed or now beginning. On Thursday, a New Jersey utility, Public Service Electric and Gas, announced a sale to a drug company, Merck, of the right to emit nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
The E.P.A. is supposed to issue regulations soon on a trading system for nitrogen oxides, and economically minded environmentalists -- or perhaps, environmentally minded economists -- are predicting all kinds of permutations, including entrepreneurs who will generate credits by, for example, buying up and junking old, polluting cars. They would then sell the credits to hordes of waiting buyers.
But if the utilities are an example, that kind of market is far in the future. For one thing, utilities are still choosing in-house solutions, like building scrubbers or switching to cleaner fuel, even if the cost is more than the market price of an emission credit. "You have a lot of really bright engineers who have a preference for technology over financial tools," said Christian J. Colton, a vice president of Cantor Fitzgerald, a New York firm that is a broker for emissions trades.
The engineers have been helped by a drop in the price of natural gas, which produces less sulfur dioxide than coal. Coal producers have also found lower-sulfur sources. And scrubber manufacturers have cut their prices.
This is not bad, said Mr. McLean of the E.P.A. "Trading is not the bottom line," he said. "Tons coming out of stacks is the relevant piece of information. My goal was to reduce emissions at the lowest possible cost, not to see 1,000 trades occur." As far as he is concerned, the cheaper an allowance gets, the better.
But the price means little if utilities are reluctant to enter the market to buy or sell.
They face two problems. One could be called the Robert Citron effect: they fear becoming like the former treasurer of Orange County, Calif., who put public money into complex financial instruments and lost it. If the utilities buy allowances now to stockpile for later use, and the price drops later, state regulators could argue that the purchases were imprudent and the financial loss should not be borne by customers, but by shareholders. Conversely, if they sell now and prices go up later, they could also look dumb.
If utilities cut costs through the trading system, they could lower their rates, or raise their dividends to shareholders. But Mr. Colton said that only Connecticut has so far agreed to let any of the benefit flow back to shareholders. Faced with risking a loss to shareholders and no possibility of benefit, many have apparently decided not to bother.
Second, the industry itself is in turmoil as it moves toward open competition in electricity, where customers can leave their utilities for the lowest-priced supplier. As a result many old plants may be retired in the next few years. "They don't know if they're going to be using the plants in a year or two," said Mr. Jump of the trade group.
The market could pick up in the next few years. Many utilities are believed to be stockpiling allowances for Jan. 1, 2000, when a second phase of the acid rain program takes effect and the emission limits become stricter. But some attitudes may have to change first.
"Toes have got to be stuck in the water," said Mr. Jump, "and that's taking some time to do."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Fans Grit Their Teeth Over the Bigger Parimutuel Bite

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO 

 BODY:
It started innocently enough as Belmont Week opened: the track hostess Mary Ryan sitting with the trainer Lisa Lewis and the jockey Diane Nelson yesterday on the small stage beneath the paddock tote board at Belmont Park, talking engagingly about a woman's life in the world of horse racing.
But after they gave their seats on the stage to Kenny Noe Jr. and Steve Crist, the two ranking business executives at the track, the fantasy of racing's future came to grips with the reality of its present. The first Fan Fair held at Belmont to expose the horse fan to the nuances of the game was transformed into a forum where the horse player could air his gripes. And the chief target was the racing bill approved Friday by the Legislature -- and expected to be signed soon by Gov. George E. Pataki -- that will increase the takeout on a majority of winning bets. 
 "The economics of the business today make obsolete everything you ever learned about racing 20 years ago," said Noe, the president of the New York Racing Association. "The first time we went to Albany last December, they said we don't have any money. You're not going to get anything without giving something."
Crist, the director of communications for the N.Y.R.A., added: "In a perfect world, we'd love to drop the takeout to 10 percent. But we don't have the money."
Both were forced to dodge bullets fired by players incensed by the new formula for paying off bets. Robert Schroeder of East Rockaway, L.I., fired one such salvo when he commented from the audience:
"Nothing will hurt this game more than upping the takeout. Did you go to Albany and ask for an alternative? Did you suggest cutting executive salaries 10 percent?"
"Yes," Noe conceded, "there is a hit. But we hope to make it up down the road."
Another fan called out: "In racing, you have the horses and the public, and that's all that counts. But you don't take care of the public." Another said: "I've been coming to the track for 45 years. You've got to get three winners now to break even."
Actually, the Legislature reduced the parimutuel tax on the N.Y.R.A. to 3 percent from 4 on regular wagers and to 2.5 percent from 4 on bets involving two horses. The tax on exotic bets involving three or more horses will stay at 7.5 percent. The tax will be paid by N.Y.R.A. to the state every 30 days instead of twice a week, and the net gain for N.Y.R.A. is estimated at $7 million a year.
But the change in the takeout, effective when Saratoga opens July 21, is a mixed bag for bettors. On straight bets, involving one horse to win, place or show, the state will deduct 15 cents on the dollar instead of 17 cents. But on bets on two horses, -- exactas, quinellas and daily doubles -- the takeout will increase to 20 cents on the dollar from 17. On exotic bets, it stays at 25 cents per dollar. Two-horse bets, however, comprise 55 percent of all bets made. This means it will cost the fans $11 million over the year.
This money is taken off the top of the win pool before the odds are calculated by computer; the rest stays in the pool. Thus, the bigger the takeout, the worse the payoff, which is where the protests come in. As for the extra money generated by the bigger takeouts, it will be shared by N.Y.R.A., the off-track betting corporations and the horsemen, who will get $8 million in higher purses.
Crist said later that he did not believe the new takeout formula would change betting patterns. Still, he added, "some players may think of going back to win-place-show betting at 15 percent. And it's the best bet in America."
The dialogue on betting was surrounded by signs of a new openness at Belmont embodied in the Fan Fair, a program aimed at the fan who might want to know more. In recent years, race tracks have been losing live fans while gaining others who bet away from the track, but Noe and Crist have made a pitch to the race-track fan.
They instituted the Fan Fair program to coincide with the Belmont Stakes next Saturday, building it around five open-air shows led by Ryan and Tom Durkin, the track's announcer. Their guests this week will include such trainers as D. Wayne Lukas, Allen Jerkens and Bill Mott, jockeys like Jorge Chavez and Jerry Bailey and even Bobby Duncan, master of the starting gate.
In yesterday's program, titled, "A Salute to Women in Racing," Ryan asked Lisa Lewis, "What's your favorite type of horse to train?" Lewis promptly replied, "A fast one."

Reading Boris's Mind

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
So they think I am a drunken bumpkin, manipulated by Korzhakov and my palace guard. No popularity, no future, no political strategy.
It's true that I drink, I take medicine, I stumble, I pass out. But I know how to use what seems like the democratic process to maintain my power. 
 Westerners use political parties to create a government, but I'm using government to create a party.
In the Duma, everybody is in opposition. So I told Chernomyrdin, the rich gas man I made my Prime Minister, to organize a pro-Yeltsin party.
The whole apparat automatically belongs. Every bureaucrat and state worker who wants to keep his job, every businessman happy with his present connections, every policeman and postman -- these people will make up the government party. State television is my party organ. Nobody else has these advantages of democracy.
The Duma wants a legislative election this winter. To create strong national parties, it wants half the candidates to be on national party lists.
But I want opposition parties to be weak. So I vetoed the Duma plan, and call instead for two local candidates for every one on a national list. In that way, I reduce the power of other well-known national leaders. No "coattails," as the Americans say. The local voters would have to choose between familiar local apparatchiks -- my men -- and strangers.
The upper house supports my veto, and Duma members will have to go along. If they don't, fine -- postponement of their elections and then my presidential election next year would be on their heads. But the election schedule will surely force the Duma to cave in. That is how I weaken their parties and strengthen my own -- while telling the world my system is more democratic and less Moscow-elitist.
My government party, despite the gray faces of Chernomyrdin and Rybkin, will get one-fourth of the seats this year. I figure 45 percent to the Communists and Agrarians, the Zhirinovsky nationalists dropping to 10 percent, the women with their 5 percent.
That leaves 15 percent to the reformists, famous for being split. Gaidar and Fyodorov lose votes every time they speak, and Chubais is hated for doing privatization for me. That leaves Grigory Yavlinsky, who finally had the good sense to get a haircut and no longer looks like an intellectual. Clinton must have known something -- he sat Grisha on his right at a breakfast for oppositionists at the Moscow summit.
The polls say Yavlinsky is twice as popular as me. If he gets most of the reformers behind him, he might also attract General Lebed, who agrees with them on the botched invasion of Chechnya. If Grisha's Yabloko Party doubles to 15 percent of the Duma this year, those apples mean trouble in the presidential race next year.
That's why I sent my Rottweiler, Korzhakov, to raid the banker supporting Yabloko, who also owns independent media critical of me. I will charge him with corruption and ruin him. All in the name of democracy.
Now I am down to the nub of the matter. This year's parliamentary elections will be about economic recovery -- about the way to make salaries reach prices. But the issue in next year's presidential election will be fundamental -- about the type of political regime Russia will have.
I see four choices. Strong central control under me, with a press I allow to complain. Two, a return to Communist "stability." Three, the nationalists with their war talk. Four, the democratic reformers.
Zhirinovsky or Rutskoi will get the Russia-firsters. Fyodorov -- not the reformer but the famous eye doctor -- is rich enough to attract a following, like Perot in America. The Communists can make a showing but cannot win. Gorbachev may try a pitiful comeback. Chernomyrdin will run only if I cannot; I know too much about his son's gas dealings. Lebed has no party.
That leaves Yavlinsky -- but like Zhirinovsky, he is half-Jewish, has no gray hair and is not as tall as me.
I am like Clinton in this way: very unpopular until you consider the other choices. But I am unlike Clinton in other ways: I can control the Duma's election process. I can use the Government to establish a political party with patronage overnight. I can use my police power to keep my opposition poor.
In the end, I will use my office to prevent anyone from taking my office from me. And I will call it democracy. Some drunken bumpkin.

The numner of new businesses in the region rose sharply last year, a sign of continuing economic recovery. The trend continued in the first quarter of 1995, in contrast to the rest of the country, where business starts fell 9.1 percent from the same period last year. Start-ups in financial services, insurance and real estate rose across the region in the forst quarter of 1995, compared with the same period last year. manufacturing and construction starts surged in New Jersey and Connecticut. Business start-ups are a good measure of the health of the local economy. Analysts say the biggest benefit to the area is obvious: new firms equals new jobs.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: IN WASHINGTON;
U.N. Bosnia Force to Get U.S. Spy Planes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration promised today to step up efforts to share intelligence with United Nations commanders in Bosnia and to provide them with unmanned spy planes, a move that would increase their surveillance ability without running the risk of having other American pilots shot down.
Defense Secretary William Perry said the United States would set up an intelligence network for the United Nations commanders in Bosnia similar to one that United States forces used successfully in the Persian Gulf war. 
 "Our allies saw that as a very significant move," Mr. Perry told reporters aboard his aircraft after leaving a meeting of defense ministers in Paris.
He said that sending the unmanned surveillance aircraft, known as drones, would be a major benefit to the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia because the planes transmit images instantaneously to ground commanders and because they operate at low altitudes so that they are not hampered by cloud cover, as satellites are.
Speaking about the American F-16 jet fighter that was shot down Friday by a Serb missile while on a NATO monitoring mission, Mr. Perry said the Pentagon has no firm evidence that the American pilot was being held by the Bosnian Serbs. But he said that with conflicting information being received about the fate of the pilot, a search-and-rescue effort was continuing.
Mr. Perry said the Pentagon has found no proof that the pilot managed to eject from his aircraft before it crashed. As for the contention by Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' military commander, that his forces have captured the pilot, Mr. Perry said, "He may be playing some kind of cruel game."
American officials said today that they would ask President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to inquire about the fate of the pilot and to push for his release, if he has been captured.
Mr. Perry announced the increased intelligence cooperation a day after the Administration notified its European allies that it was narrowing the circumstances under which American ground troops could be used to help redeploy United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia.
In a speech on Wednesday, President Clinton suggested that he was prepared to send American ground troops to assist a reconfiguration and strengthening of peacekeepers. But in a radio address on Saturday, he said American troops would be used only if peacekeepers "become stranded and could not get out of a particular place in Bosnia."
After severely criticizing President Clinton three days ago for talking about committing ground troops to Bosnia, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said today that he supported the President's current plans to provide American assistance to help rescue beleaguered United Nations peacekeepers.
Appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Dole said: "I would support the President's efforts to rescue or to remove some of the United Nations protection forces. We are a member of NATO. What I would not want is American troops there under U.N. command with limited rules of engagement and without consulting with Congress."
Taking President Clinton's lead, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played down the likelihood that the United States would ever have to send ground troops to Bosnia to help redeploy peacekeepers there.
Appearing on the ABC News program "This Week with David Brinkley," General Shalikashvili said America's European allies have not asked the Pentagon to help move peacekeepers who find themselves in an untenable situation although "we certainly are now aware that this could come up."
He added, "After our meeting yesterday in Paris, it is becoming more and more clear that this is not an eventuality that stares us in the face right now."
The general said that the United States would not provide ground troops to serve as United Nations peacekeepers or to join the rapid reaction force being established by Britain, France and other countries. He said that the United States would be willing to provide close air support to the quick reaction force and would be willing to fly British, French or other allied troops into the area, if requested.
One senior Administration official said today that an American envoy's talks with President Milosevic in Belgrade were deadlocked, and near collapse, as the Serbian leader had stepped up his demands. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia are pressing Mr. Milosevic to recognize Bosnia in exchange for a suspension of economic sanctions against his country.
"Milosevic is trying to reopen things that we thought we had settled long ago," the official said. He said that Mr. Milosevic was demanding that the United States and other nations recognize Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia, as the official successor state of the former Yugoslavia. The United States has refused to do that on the ground that it would give Serbia a status it does not deserve and would strengthen Serbia's claim over assets that belonged to Yugoslavia.
Senator Dole reiterated his call for unilaterally lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government and for withdrawing the 22,500 United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia.
"I think if you provide the equipment and they're properly trained and they lose, they've given it their best shot," he said. "It's not our problem."
But Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, criticized his position. Ms. Albright, who also appeared on "Meet the Press," said that unilaterally lifting the embargo "is a feel-good option," which "would undoubtedly lead to an Americanization of the conflict." She said the United States would have to supply a large proportion of the arms and train the Bosnian Government forces.
Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican and like Mr. Dole a presidential candidate, said that if American troops are to be used, they should assist in a withdrawal of United Nations forces from Bosnia. In an appearance on ABC's "This Week," he said the Administration should work with Congress to arrange for American troops to help withdraw the peacekeepers, who he said are unable to keep the peace or protect themselves.

HEADLINE: Businesses in Country Music Capital Looking for Help in Faraway Places

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, June 1

 BODY:
Here at the Opryland Hotel, that emporium built on the popularity of country music, business is good, but that has not stopped some executives there from singing the blues.
And several restaurants in the city are forced to close at lunch on some days because they do not have enough employees. Grocery stores, embarrassed by long waits at checkout lines, post apologetic signs to customers, and some fast-food outlets display "Now Hiring" signs as prominently as their logos. 
 Urban areas in the Southeast led the way as the region outpaced the national economic and employment growth rates in recent years, resulting in a shortage of low-paid workers.
The owners of the sprawling Opryland Hotel and theme park became so desperate for workers that in January they began advertising and recruiting about two thousand miles away, in Puerto Rico, where the unemployment rate is about 13 percent. Then the Opryland owners, Gaylord Entertainment, bought a former motel so they could keep their promise that the new workers would get housing for up to 10 months at $50 a week.
"I was kind of surprised because the package offered by Opryland was so good, better than what they were offering at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City," said Giorgio Zayas, 27, an experienced waiter who now works amid the Old South ambiance of Rhett's Restaurant in the hotel and convention complex.
Mr. Zayas and about 300 other Puerto Rican workers live at the former 150-room motel just off a busy thoroughfare here where the faint outlines of Quality Inn bleed through the bright yellow paint recently sprayed on the doorway canopy. Each day an Opryland bus shuttles the workers the five miles to the 450-acre complex.
The hotel's extraordinary efforts to attract and hold workers is a sign of the best of times and the worst of times for Nashville. The economy has expanded so fast that scores of employers said that over the last six to eight months there were not enough workers within 100 miles to fill a host of mostly low-wage jobs, paying from the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour to $7 an hour.
"Summer will help some," said Rhett Smith, the chief executive of Southdown Corporation, which employs 950 people at the 28 Burger King franchises it owns throughout middle Tennessee, as he anticipates a flood of students seeking jobs. "But the problem is deeper than that."
The problem, say a Federal Reserve Board economist, Thomas Cunningham, and others, is not only deeper, but broader, embracing urban areas across the Southeast like Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., Birmingham, Ala., Jackson, Miss., and the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, as well as many Florida cities.
Mr. Cunningham, who is in charge of the Federal Reserve's regional research group covering Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee, said the growth could be sustained as long as there were people migrating to the Southeast from the less prosperous regions of the country.
"But that out-migration from other areas into the South has stopped as those areas' economies have improved," Mr. Cunningham. "The labor crunch is beginning at the foot of the Appalachians and it looks as if it will eventually spread south to Atlanta and other cities."
In some areas where unemployment is running below 3 percent, Donald Ratajczak, an economist who is director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, said some employers of low-wage workers had raised hourly wages 20 to 25 percent in an effort to keep reliable workers. The rate of job growth is starting to slow because the region is "reaching the limits" of its labor market, he said.
But a shortage of labor, unlike a shortage of capital, can usually be easily weathered, said James F. Smith, a professor of finance at the Kenan Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina. He said he did not anticipate the labor shortage's seriously stunting the region's economic growth.
New workers tend to spring up from unlikely places to take entry-level jobs. "It's like 'The Field of Dreams,' " he said of the jobs. "If you build it, they will come."
For the time being, many metropolitan areas in the Southeast boast unemployment rates far below the national rate of 5.7 percent for May. In the Nashville metropolitan area, the rate was 2.9 percent, for Raleigh-Durham, it was 3.1 percent while in the Atlanta area, it was 4 percent.
But such figures can mask higher unemployment in the inner cities. In Atlanta proper, unemployment was at 6.5 percent, and in some predominantly black sections of Nashville, local officials reported unemployment rates as high as 12.1 percent.
"The unemployment in my area is higher than 2.9 percent," said Edith Taylor Langster, a Nashville City Council member as well as a state representative whose district is overwhelmingly black. "Part of the problem is child care and transportation, and no matter what the unemployment rate is, some people can't get a job without those things."
Even as the Labor Department reported that employers trimmed 101,000 workers from payrolls in May, the region's heavy concentration of construction-related manufacturing and automobile assembly jobs helped keep the area's economy booming. Tennessee, with its Nissan and Saturn plants as well as an increasing number of auto parts plants is a prime example of the region's economic health.
But already, job growth in the rest of the nation, fueled largely by rising exports, is beginning to catch up with that in the Southeast.
"Buying a hotel for hotel workers to live in is an interesting and bizarre development," said Mr. Cunningham. "It's clearly not sustainable but it is interesting to watch what employers have to do in a situation like this. Employers are doing a lot of interesting things in this atmosphere, and if you ever want to have a problem, I guess this is the one you want to have."
C. Raymond Waters, the manager of the Opryland Hotel, said the hotel had long found it necessary to provide free bus service to and from some inner-city areas of Nashville and more than 60 miles to the north, to Clarksville, to keep a stable labor supply. They have long provided child care at the complex.
But with the labor squeeze, said Patricia Wright, head of Opryland Human Resources, the organization chose to go to Puerto Rico, largely because the unemployment rate there has been so high, 13.6 percent in April.
In addition to recruiting in Puerto Rico to keep a work force of 7,000, Opryland will have representatives at all area job fairs, recruit part-time workers at centers for the elderly and try to bring in schoolteachers on summer break. Even so, Ms. Wright said, the complex is likely to be 300 to 400 workers short next year when it completes a $175 million expansion to 2,870 rooms from 1,900.
"We're still building because people are still coming, and we'll take whatever steps we have to keep servicing those people," Ms. Wright said.
Pablo DeJesus and his wife, Maria Gomez, from Guayama, on the south coast of Puerto Rico, were the picture of starched crispness as they got off the bus from the workers' housing at the former Quality Inn to start their afternoon shifts at the Opryland Hotel. Pinned to each of their green-and-white cotton uniforms were buttons announcing that they were "In Training."
The two said that they took their $5.40-an-hour jobs as stewards in one of the hotel's restaurants because jobs were so scarce in their town. They have been in Nashville two months and have decided that they will eventually move out of the company-owned housing and get their own apartment.
"We like it here and want to stay and maybe raise a family," Ms. Gomez said. "It's growing, and the jobs are good."

New Rap Hits Outside the Fray

 BODY:
In the recent debate about offensive lyrics in rap songs, Time Warner's labels have been singled out. But this week's highest ranking rap album and single - the "Friday" soundtrack and "I'll Be There For You" by Method Man, respectively - are on other lables. [A look at the economics of rap music appears on page D8.]
 On the television front, "Home Improvement" took the two top slots as ABC led the weekly ratings again, with NBC second. CBS and Fox were also - rans - neither had a series in the top 10.

HEADLINE: Patents;
U.S. proposes guidelines in an attempt to deal more effectively with software inventions.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LAST week the Patent and Trademark Office came a step closer to dealing more efficiently and effectively with software-related inventions. The agency issued proposed guidelines for patenting software embodied in computer hardware or disks. The agency has traditionally equated software with mathematical algorithms and other thought processes that cannot be patented.
Last summer and fall, however, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that several spurned software inventors deserved patents after all because their programming was an integral part of computer hardware. 
 Those decisions were a fundamental challenge to the patent agency's way of doing business, and in another era there would probably have been resistance to immediate change. But Commissioner Bruce Lehman has made a crusade out of reorganizing his agency and reshaping intellectual property law to adapt to new industries like biotechnology, software and telecommunications. But not without controversy. There are still many in the computer industry who argue against patenting software at all. Nevertheless, in March the agency announced it was working on the new guidelines, and just three months later new rules are ready for public scrutiny.
The proposed guidelines were published in the June 2 Federal Register, and the agency wants feedback from inventors, intellectual property lawyers and the public.
The guidelines tell patent application examiners how to categorize software inventions. Each one specifically requires a piece of hardware or a disk.
"A computer or other programmable apparatus whose actions are directed by a computer program or other form of software is a statutory 'machine,' " the rules stipulate. "A computer-readable memory that can be used to direct a computer to function in a particular manner when used by the computer is a statutory 'article of manufacture."'
"A series of specific operational steps to be performed on or with the aid of a computer is a statutory 'process,' the rules add.
"These guidelines are as broad as you'll find in the world," says Peter Trzyna, an intellectual property lawyer with Keck, Mahin & Kate in Chicago. "The Japanese have some, but in Europe and the U.K. they absolutely don't exist. This could give a tremendous boost to software inventions and a secondary boost to the service economy that relies heavily on software like advertising, airline reservations, consulting firms, banking and finance."
"But my guess is that it will take a while before patent examiners come to understand this," Mr. Trzyna said. "They have a momentum going that says software patents are bad, and they don't always understand the science."
With the guidelines, it should not be difficult to understand what cannot be patented as software: "a compilation or arrangement of data" or a "data structure" that have no physical form -- meaning no hardware; "a work of music, art or literature" on disk and "a process that does nothing more than manipulate abstract ideas or concepts," like a method of solving a mathematical problem.
The guidelines also stipulate that claims for inventions must be submitted in English. Computer code does not count when it comes to defining parts of an invention.
The agency is accepting written comments on the proposed guidelines until July 31. Remarks should be mailed to the Commissioner at Box 4, Patent and Trademark Office, Washington D.C., 20231, or faxed to 703-305-8885, or sent via Internet E-mail to comments-softwarepto.gov.
 
Removing Scratches On Compact Disks
 In one way, compact disks are exactly like records -- once scratched, they skip. For either medium, once the music is marred, there isn't much choice but to replace the disk. Unless Joe Born's hand-held CD Saver makes it possible to restore CD's in a way that still eludes vinyl.
Mr. Born, an engineer and owner of the Machine Research Corporation of Chicago, has invented a device that he says permanently buffs scratches out of a CD surface.
His CD Saver is about the size of two side-by-side compact disk cases. A scratched CD is first smeared with a buffing solution and then inserted between a rubber wheel that rotates the disk and a felt buffer that rubs the surface.
"Its an abrasive solution, so in effect it's sanding the CD on a microscopic level," Mr. Born explained. "The coating of polycarbonate on a CD is one-sixteenth of an inch thick. In the buffing process its extremely rare to remove even ten-thousandths of an inch. So you could do this 30 or 40 times."
Even so, there are limits to the machine's restorative powers.
"It won't take out gouges," Mr. Born said. "If a dog puts teeth marks in your CD, you've got a problem."
The buffer operates manually with a rotating handle. It takes about 30 seconds to erase scratches, Mr. Born said.
"By turning the handle you buff the disk radially," he explained. He said he discovered the hard way that the machine is essential -- rubbing a disk by hand with a piece of felt and the same buffing solution can make the scratches worse.
"Anytime you use an abrasive process there can be marks left," Mr. Born said. "I had a roommate who had a scratched disk that was unusable. I did it by hand and it worked, but it also introduced circumferential scratches into the disk. It's very important that the scratches or scuff marks are radial. Compact disks ignore radial scratches. Circumferential scratches are the ones that cause slips."
Mr. Born plans to manufacture several hundred CD Saver's and sell them for about $19.95 before deciding whether to continue making them himself or try to license the invention to someone else. He received patent 5,423,103.

HEADLINE: Stocks Reach Highs Again as Technology Issues Lead Way

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The stock market charged ahead to new high ground yesterday, with technology shares leading the advance.
The gains wiped out the previous session's losses and propelled several popular market measures, including the Dow Jones industrial average, to record closes. 
 Enthusiasm for computer, software and other technology stocks was rekindled by news that I.B.M. was offering $3.3 billion, or $60 a share, for Lotus Development, a price that nearly doubled the software maker's close on Friday.
The bid, combined with a positive performance by the bond market and stability in the dollar created a winning atmosphere on Wall Street.
Investors easily overlooked concerns about the flagging economy that had recently been depressing prices of economically sensitive, or cyclical, stocks.
A. C. Moore, chief investment officer at the money management firm Dunvegan Associates Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif., said, "The glass is definitely half full, as far as the market is concerned."
Investors are ignoring the possibility that corporate profits could suffer if the sluggish economy crawls to a standstill, he added.
Stocks have derived much of their strength from the bond market, which has risen recently on expectations that interest rates are poised for a prolonged downturn.
But Mr. Moore argues that the hopes may not be justified because the dollar's weakness may prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates to reinvigorate the economy. Lower rates would further erode the currency's value against its foreign counterparts.
Lotus Development soared 2815/16 , to 617/16 , and was Nasdaq's volume leader by far with more than 29 million shares changing hands. The issue and rises by other technology issues tht followed suit sent the Nasdaq composite index up 9.88, to 882.85, beating its prior high of 879.64 hit on May 23.
Cirrus Logic, a maker of integrated circuits, was up 1 3/8, to 55 1/4, in heavy Nasdaq volume of more than 1.3 million shares. It announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
The buying was not confined to the technology sector, however.
Kmart, was up 1 3/8, to 14, in leading volume of more than 10.9 million shares at the New York Stock Exchange, as investors welcomed news that Kmart had appointed a longtime retailing executive, Floyd Hall, as its chairman, ending a lengthy search for a replacement for Joseph Antonini. Mr. Hall, 56, is a former top executive with a Kmart rival, Target Stores; the book seller B. Dalton, and other companies.
Boeing was up 2 5/8, to 61 5/8, in heavy volume of more than 3.3 million shares on reports it had won at least two-thirds of a $6 billion commercial jetliner order from the Saudi Arabian carrier Saudia.
Market analysts were impressed with the better than 2-to-1 margin by which gainers outnumbered losers on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board's floor came to 338.4 million shares as of 4 P.M., Eastern time, compared with 366 million Friday.
In reaching a record finish of 4,476.55, up 32.16, the Dow industrials overcame a setback for I.B.M., which shed 2 5/8, to 91 1/4, after announcing the Lotus bid. The Dow improved on the prior record of 4,472.75 set on June 1.
Among other market indicators, Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 3.09, to 535.60, handily surpassing its former record of 533.49 achieved on June 1. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.52, to a new high of 288.05, up from the June 1 peak of 286.73.
The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.87, to 488.71.
Organogenesis, was up 1 1/4, to 11 7/8, in heavy American volume of more than 618,000 shares. It received notice from the Food and Drug Administration that its Graftskin premarket approval application to be submitted shortly would get an expedited review.
Shares in London jumped to their highest levels in about a year amid optimism about British and American interest rates. Markets on the Continent were closed for a holiday.

HEADLINE: I.B.M.'S BIG MOVE: THE TREND -- From Calculator to Communications Tool;
As the Role of the Computer Changes, Companies Try to Keep Pace

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
In his "Dear Colleague" letter to I.B.M. workers yesterday, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. explained his company's $3.3-billion bid for Lotus Development Corporation as a vital step toward the high-tech workplace of the future. The two companies, the International Business Machines Corporation chairman wrote, were an ideal match.
Together, Mr. Gerstner declared, I.B.M. and Lotus Development could hurry the arrival of a better world for workers everywhere by creating "a collaborative computing environment so people can work and communicate across corporate and national borders -- without worrying about things like incompatible hardware and software." 
 Mr. Gerstner's utopian vision, with I.B.M. as creator and supplier, is merely his rendering of what is universally acknowledged as the new wave in information technology: the computer as a communications tool.
The trend comes in many forms, each with its accompanying jargon, but all the variants share one element: People at work and at home are using computers less and less as stand-alone machines and more and more as computers linked to networks that enable them to exchange messages, documents and pictures.
"The industry is going through a major shift to communications," said John McCarthy, director of research for Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "Call it client-server, Internet, E-mail, social computing, whatever. The trends and buzzwords are all part of the same phenomenon."
In corporations, desktop computers are now arrayed in so-called client-server networks, where machines and people collaborate to do work in teams, representing a sharp break with the centralized control of traditional mainframe computing. And Lotus Development's Notes program is the leading software that allows workers in companies to work in teams, sharing the same document, for example, in offices around the world.
Outside the corporate walls, computer networks from commercial on-line services like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy, and more broadly, the Internet, are giving the public a taste for the power of communicating from behind a PC keyboard.
Supplying the hardware, software and services for these networks looms as a huge business for the computer industry. Those who catch the wave will reap growth and profits, while those left behind face inevitable decline.
I.B.M., analysts agree, clearly views its pricey bid for Lotus Development in those broader terms. "This is I.B.M.'s strategic entry into the new world," said Scott Winkler, an analyst at the Gartner Group Inc., a research firm in Stamford, Conn.
The I.B.M. move is part of a flurry of recent acquisition activity by software companies trying to buy their way into stronger positions in network computing. Last month, for example, Computer Associates International Inc., a leading supplier of large-system software, bid $1.78 billion for the Legent Corporation. When the deal was announced, Computer Associates executives spoke glowingly of Legent's attractive client-server software. And last February, Sybase Inc. paid $875 million for the Powersoft Corporation, a producer of client-server programs.
The history of the computer business has been one not only of rapid technological development, but also of new uses for computing that gave people a reason to buy the new technology. Back in the 1950's, I.B.M.'s early computers replaced the old punch-card machines in corporate accounting departments, saving time and money.
In the 1960's, and afterward, I.B.M. mainframes were the industrial-strength calculating tools that were crucial to everything from the space race to mass marketing. After I.B.M. introduced its first personal computer in 1981, it was the financial spreadsheet, Lotus 1-2-3, that became the main reason companies had to buy PC's during the 1980's.
"In the 1990's, the personal computer is becoming more and more a communications device," said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm in New York.
The business opportunity in networked computing, both in the corporate market and beyond, is large and varied. The market for client-server software, for example, has jumped from $197 million in 1991 to an estimated $5.9 billion this year, according to Forrester Research.
The outlook for companies supplying software, services and access to the Internet, the mega-network started by the Defense Department in the 1960's that links millions of computers worldwide, also looks bright, though it is just starting to become a genuine business. Forrester estimates that Internet business will increase from $346 million this year to nearly $10.9 billion by 2000.
Yet fear, as well as opportunity, is behind the scramble by companies like I.B.M. to stake a solid position in networked computing. Any company that does not move quickly, the reasoning goes, will be supplanted by Microsoft. True or not, it is certainly the received wisdom in the computer industry.
"Microsoft is always the backdrop to any move in computing software these days," said Mr. Winkler of the Gartner Group. "And I.B.M.'s inferiority complex in software is always in respect to Microsoft."
Relations between the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M. go back to 1981, when Big Blue chose the fledgling company to supply the operating system for its personal computers. In retrospect, granting such a key role to an outsider was a strategic blunder because it ceded to Microsoft the franchise for the software look-and-feel of the PC industry. In 1986, the two companies were jointly developing I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system. But Microsoft went its own way in 1990, coming out with Windows, which became the popular industry standard, and leaving OS/2 an also-ran.
With Notes, I.B.M. sees a way to grab one of the hottest products in the market for teamwork software, called groupware. And, adding frosting to the cake, groupware is a key slice of the PC software market in which Microsoft has uncharacteristically struggled, giving I.B.M. a rare chance to beat its rival.
The Microsoft offering that is closest to Notes is called Exchange. But Exchange remains in the test stage, and analysts don't expect it to reach the marketplace until sometime next year. Besides, analysts add, Microsoft's Exchange is mainly for electronic mail and other messages instead of being a full-fledged groupware program, like Notes, which encourages collaborative work.
Microsoft is working hard to come up with a groupware offering, but analysts do not expect the company to produce a credible rival to Notes for another year or so.
"The bid for Lotus is I.B.M.'s effort to become a real alternative in software to Microsoft," said James F. Moore, president of Geopartners Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "I.B.M.'s message to its big corporate customers has been, 'We can bring you from our old world of computing into the new world.' And Lotus is clearly part of the new world."
Still, industry executives remain skeptical about I.B.M.'s ability to challenge Microsoft, even with Lotus. Under Mr. Gerstner, who became chairman two years ago, I.B.M. appears to no longer be as slow-moving as it was before. But it still has little but losses to show for its efforts to make money in the quick-paced world of desktop software, after investing an estimated $3 billion in its OS/2 program.
Indeed, several analysts cited another company that in their view would have posed a stronger competitive threat to Microsoft if it were armed with Notes: the Oracle Corporation, a fast-growing Silicon Valley software maker that is rumored to have been interested in acquiring Lotus.
In Redmond, Wash., Microsoft executives had no comment yesterday on I.B.M.'s bid for Lotus. But industry executives doubted that Microsoft was too worried yet.
"At Microsoft, they have to be relieved that Lotus went to I.B.M. instead of somebody else or remaining independent," said Roger McNamee, general partner of Integrated Capital Partners, a technology investment fund in Menlo Park, Calif. "After all, the same guys who bungled OS/2 now have Notes."
 
THE 1960's and 70's
One to One
In the computing model that I.B.M. came to dominate in the 1960's and 70's, a person would type at a so-called dumb terminal, whose only purpose was issuing the commands that operated a room-size mainframe computer. The computer was a number-cruncher -- not a communications device.
 
THE 1980's
One to Many
The introduction of personal computers in the late 70's made it possible to put an entire computer on a desktop. During the 80's communications became nearly as important as number-crunching, as it became popular to link machines in networks for for exchanging files and corresponding via electronic mail..
 
THE 1990's
Many to Many
During the 90's, improvements in communications software have contributed to the rising popularity of the Internet global computer web. And the rise of communications programs known as groupware, like Lotus Notes, have made it easier for groups of computer users to work collaboratively by letting all parties see and work on the same file simultaneously. each icon above represents a different function; clicking a mouse allows users at different locations to access the same data.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Wins the Right To Jury Trial in West Virginia

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
In a ruling with implications for Orange County, Calif., the West Virginia Supreme Court decided yesterday that Morgan Stanley & Company was entitled to a jury trial there over its role in a failed state investment strategy in the late 1980's, and reversed a lower court ruling that had fined the Wall Street firm $56 million.
The decision is on the question of whether Wall Street brokers can be held liable for investment losses suffered by local governments, especially when the losses stemmed from the sale of risky securities. That issue is at the heart of a $1.2 billion lawsuit filed by Orange County against its broker, Merrill Lynch & Company, over the sale of securities that led to the bankruptcy of the county. 
 In the West Virginia case, the State Supreme Court set aside a $56 million judgment against Morgan Stanley that was ordered by a West Virginia circuit court in 1992. The lower court argued that the case against the Wall Street firm was so compelling that no jury trial was necessary -- and Morgan Stanley immediately appealed.
With so little case law in this area, this decision is being viewed as a guide for other states in which similar issues are arising. West Virginia lost about $280 million after a series of trades in 1987, many of which were arranged by Morgan Stanley. Other dealers, including Goldman, Sachs & Company, that did business with the state have already paid $28 million in out-of-court settlements for their roles.
In its ruling, the West Virginia high court agreed with the lower court's reasoning, which it described as "ineluctable," because the evidence "conclusively shows" that Morgan Stanley knew it was selling the speculative securities, which were prohibited by state law.
Still, the state's Supreme Court said it had "great anxiety about the overall equity" of "subjecting" Morgan Stanley to such a large judgment without the benefit of a jury review. In its appeal, Morgan Stanley had argued that it had done nothing wrong and asked that the fine be dismissed entirely or at the least that the firm be granted a jury trial.
The ruling, written by a former West Virginia Chief Justice, Richard Neely, who was recalled to the bench for this case, said: "The people at Morgan Stanley made a lot of money helping the staff of the Treasurer's office play the bond market. But only a jury can apportion Morgan's salesmen's actions between genuine enthusiasm and simple cupidity."
The ruling also took swipes at state investment officials, saying that they "were not potential nominees for the Nobel Prize in economics" and acknowledged that their trades were "rather more risky dealings that was appropriate" for state officials. Still, the decision set forth a new legal notion -- that even if Morgan Stanley was found to have sold illegal speculative securities, if no "intention of wrongdoing" by Morgan Stanley was proved, any losses for which the firm might be held liable could be offset by previous trading gains.
"Certainly, Morgan Stanley never undertook the duties of an insurer," Judge Neely said.
Judge Neely is a leader in the movement to overhaul the product liability laws and has argued against the ability of plaintiffs to come into hometown courts and seek large settlements against out-of-state defendants with deep pockets. In this decision, he said that allowing a jury to offset Morgan Stanley's trading losses with its gains would provide a more level "playing field" between the firm and the state.
James W. B. Benkard, a lawyer with Davis Polk & Wardwell, which represents Morgan Stanley, said he was "pleased" with the decision, which he said was "highly significant" for Orange County.
"We feel that we've been almost vindicated," Mr. Benkard said. "We are not an insurer of losses. When an investor goes to the market, it puts its money at risk. And it's extremely unfair for a dealer to be tarred with losses and get no credits for the win."
Debra L. Hamilton, a lawyer with DiTrapano & Jackson, which represents the state, said she was "perplexed" by the decision because it agreed with the logic behind the action of the lower court but still overturned it.
"Yes, the lower court handed down a big verdict," Ms. Hamilton said. "But the high court didn't disagree with the lower court's application of law. And this is a big case for the high court to send back because it feels anxious. This feels like a very emotional decision."
In a statement, Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, said the firm had not seen the decision. But, he said, it "does underscore the complexity of the issues involved and the length of time it takes to resolve them."
Dale Wainwright, a lawyer in Houston and an expert in this type of litigation, said the West Virginia case, which has been in the courts since 1992, meant that local governments "should not expect a quick adjudication in their favor, and they should be prepared to be in it for the long hard trial on the merits of their cases."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Signed by Central Banks' Move, Traders Keep the Dollar Stable

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady yesterday as currency traders remained wary of a repeat of last week's coordinated dollar purchases by central banks.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve and a dozen other central banks stepped into the foreign exchange market to suport the dollar, buying an estimated $2 billion of German marks and Japanese yen. The concerted action caught traders by surprise, punishing those who had sold dollars in expectation the currency would decline. 
 "The main thing supporting the dollar is that no one has the guts to go short out of fear that the central banks will pull another fast one," said Richard Vullo, currency sales manager at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
To sell short, or to sell dollars that are borrowed, is a bet that the value of the dollar will decline.
Trading was light yesterday, with many markets and banks closed in Europe for a holiday, including those in Germany, France and Switzerland.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.4105 marks from 1.4089 marks on Friday. The dollar rose to 84.77 yen from 84.32.
The dollar's strength was limited by data showing weakness in the United States economy, in particularly Friday's report that the economy lost 101,000 jobs in May. The numbers have led many economists to predict that the Fed's next interest-rate move will be to lower rates. Lower rates often hurt the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in the currency less attractive.
"The long-term downtrend is intact for the dollar, as the numbers are poor and the bias is for the Fed to make a U-turn to ease," said Alex Scarsini, director of currency trading at the Barclays Bank in New York.
Mr. Vullo of Bayerische Hypotheken, however, said fears of recession were overblown, because the recent decline in interest rates would stimulate economic growth.
Falling rates means rising bond prices, and the rally in bonds supports the dollar, since foreign investors must buy dollars to buy the bonds. "So the weak U.S. economy is a wash for the dollar," he said.
Mr. Vullo predicted the dollar would trade stable to higher for the rest of the week, possibly reaching 1.44 marks and 86 yen.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Laura Ashley is spurning offers and hopes to revive itself.

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
OVER the last few years, Sir Bernard Ashley has received a procession of callers asking if he wanted to sell his controlling stake in Laura Ashley Ltd., the retail and fashion company he founded with his wife.
Last week was the turn of Georgette Mosbacher, the New York socialite and beauty products entrepreneur, who saw in Laura Ashley what other potential bidders had seen: a strong but mismanaged brand name and a depressed stock. 
 Sir Bernard politely turned away Mrs. Mosbacher, whose husband, Robert A. Mosbacher, was the Commerce Secretary in the Bush Administration. And today, with Mrs. Mosbacher's approach having been reported by a London newspaper on Sunday and speculation mounting about a possible takeover, Sir Bernard put out word through his advisers that he had no interest in selling his 34 percent stake to anyone, especially not with the stock in the doldrums.
Sir Bernard, his advisers said, is committed to seeing through the latest in a series of attempts to revive Laura Ashley, which until stumbling several years ago had prospered by capturing in its clothes and furnishings an idealized version of English country life. So far, he has the backing of the other big shareholder, Jusco, a Japanese retailer that acquired a 15 percent stake in 1990.
People working with Mrs. Mosbacher and her financial adviser, Paine Webber, said she would not make an offer over the objections of Sir Bernard. But some analysts think other bids will be forthcoming if the company cannot turn itself around quickly. And some industry executives said the 68-year-old Sir Bernard, who retired as chairman in 1993 and now holds the title of life president, might be better off selling now, especially if he could command a substantial premium to today's closing share price of 81 pence, up 5 pence, on the London Stock Exchange. The shares traded as high as 2.40, or $3.83 at today's exchange rates, in 1986.
(In the United States, Laura Ashley stock can be bought in the form of American depository receipts, but they are rarely traded.)
So far, the attempts of the British company to clarify and update its image and to slash its costs have faltered. It parted ways with one chief executive, Jim Maxmin, a year ago and has been run by an interim team since then while seeking a permanent replacement. Matters were not helped when its retailing director, Stephen Cotter, resigned last month.
The company was founded in 1953 by Sir Bernard and Laura Ashley, but it became a big international retailer only in the 1980's. Building on the image of its trademark floral print dress, it expanded into wallpapers, bed linens and other home furnishings, and by the late 1980's had built up a large presence in the United States.
But as it grew, executives said, the company became increasingly fragmented, with the British and American operations each having its own headquarters and merchandising strategy. The company opened lots of small stores -- sometimes three in a single mall -- instead of concentrating on fewer, larger stores. In 1986, the company was badly shaken by the death of Laura Ashley after she fell down a flight of stairs after her 60th birthday party.
When the recession came early in this decade in both Britain and the United States, the company was hit hard by its high costs. Its woes were compounded by its failure to project a clear image of how its fashions were changing to adapt to the needs of women who were looking for something more than floral dresses.
In the last few months, the company has centralized its management in a worldwide headquarters in Maidenhead, England, scaling back its Boston office. And it began closing smaller stores in the United States. It pressed ahead with its effort to reshape its image, concentrating more on popular categories like wallpaper and supplementing its traditional fashions with more slacks, blouses and suits.
But the company's survival efforts have a long way to go, analysts and industry executives said. People who work with the company said it could take a new management team two or three years to whip Laura Ashley back into shape, and several years longer to reap the full benefits of a turnaround. And some analysts even said it was optimistic to believe the company could ever fully recover its luster.

HEADLINE: The Quake That Hurt Kobe Helps Its Criminals

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: KOBE, Japan, June 2

 BODY:
When an earthquake toppled entire neighborhoods here in January, the most striking and impressive thing for many Americans was the almost complete lack of looting.
These days, the looting has arrived -- on a huge scale, but in a very orderly and Japanese way. There are no hoodlums smashing windows, but criminal gangs known as yakuza are muscling their way into the demolition and construction business: knocking down damaged buildings, putting up new ones and hauling their profits to the banks. 
 The reconstruction of Kobe may cost well over $120 billion, making the earthquake the most expensive natural disaster in human history. Japanese police and journalists who follow the yakuza full time estimate that the gangs pocket at least 2 or 3 percent of all construction spending in Japan, and in this case its percentage could be higher.
The biggest yakuza gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi, has its national headquarters in Kobe, where it is already active in the construction industry, and it knows the turf well. Experts say that the yakuza could therefore earn billions of dollars from the rebuilding work.
Thus one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Kobe earthquake, which killed 5,500 people and put the country's busiest port out of commission, could end up being Yoshinori Watanabe, the godfather of the yakuza. Mr. Watanabe, 54, is said to be positioning his gang to rake in a hefty share of the construction spending.
Mr. Watanabe's own home and headquarters, a closely guarded fortress occupying a full city block in a posh residential neighborhood, apparently was unaffected by the earthquake. One of his office buildings in another part of Kobe was burned to the ground, but by and large he emerged unscathed -- but not particularly talkative.
"There is no one here who can talk to you," said a bodyguard whose shaved head gleamed in the afternoon sun as he shooed away a reporter who dropped by the headquarters. The bodyguard, who emerged from behind a steel door guarded with video cameras and floodlights, wore a blue suit with a white shirt, and he bowed -- not quite low enough to be polite -- as he explained that no one would be back that afternoon. Or that evening. Or the next day. Or, perhaps, ever.
Then, as the bodyguard asked, then advised, and finally ordered the visitor to leave, a Mercedes with tinted windows hurtled down the street, and another bodyguard opened a steel garage door to admit it. As the Mercedes entered, a private parking lot with about a dozen luxury cars could be seen inside the compound.
At the other end of Kobe, in the leaning homes and rubble of Nagata Ward, one of the poorest areas of the city, the director of a demolition company watched proudly as one of his shovel cars tore apart a collapsed house to prepare the site for a new home. The man said his company owned six shovel cars and many dump trucks, and he seemed to know a bit about the yakuza.
"There are lots around, because they control plenty of demolition and construction companies," he said, adding, "Of course, I'm not one of them."
His hand, though, suggested otherwise: a fingertip had been sliced off. That usually means that someone is a yakuza, because gangsters show their remorse when they have done something wrong by cutting off a finger at the last joint.
The man said that demolition work is not so profitable in itself, because the city of Kobe set limits on how much can be charged for a truckload of rubble. "But unless you do these jobs, you can't get the construction jobs coming up next, building roads or working as subcontractors on building projects," he explained.
That is what the police worry about most these days.
"They'll do demolition jobs until around the end of the year, and they'll make some money, but not a huge amount," said Akifumi Hyakumoto, a police superintendent in Kobe. "But when they start building highways, ports and buildings, so much more money will be involved. We think the yakuza will go after the big money then."
The police say they have their hands tied, however, because much of the yakuza construction work is legal. To be sure, the yakuza may cut corners -- like threatening rival companies so that they do not offer lower bids -- but the construction business is both lucrative for the yakuza and much less risky than smuggling guns or narcotics.
The Yamaguchi-gumi has about 23,000 members around Japan, controlling the sex trade, gambling, protection rackets and narcotics. They insist that they adhere to a high moral code of protecting the weak, and for that reason they tend to kill only rival gang members and do not normally attack ordinary citizens.
Japan traditionally tolerated the yakuza's existence as an organization, while imprisoning members who became too bold or violent. This may have been in part because the authorities figured that criminals will always be around, so one might as well leave them in organizations that control them.
In the last few years, however, the police have used new laws to mount an offensive against the yakuza. In addition, the gangs were hurt by the economic slowdown that has pinched Japan for several years.
In a concession to the financial difficulties of some of his aides, Mr. Watanabe last year reportedly reduced the honorarium that he expects from each of a select group of lieutenants to about $8,000 a month from $10,000. In all, Mr. Watanabe gets about $1 million a month in such gifts from his aides, the police say.
The police say that the earthquake came at a perfect time for Mr. Watanabe. He has been trying for years to reorient the Yamaguchi-gumi toward business areas that are not blatantly illegal, and the yakuza have a longtime presence in the construction and demolition industry.
In addition to running their own companies, the gangsters are said to disrupt construction sites of other companies unless they receive substantial "greetings fees." The gangs also sometimes supply day laborers for construction sites, in exchange for a fee.
As part of the Yamaguchi-Gumi's effort to improve its public image, Mr. Watanabe ordered his aides in January to hand out free food and water to those made homeless by the earthquake. The police believe that the yakuza bullied businesses into giving them the food free or at a discount.
"Right after the earthquake, the yakuza came here and set up a stand to serve noodles for free, and I was kind of impressed," said one woman who was made homeless in the quake. "But then afterward, they asked for a written testimonial saying how great they were, so they could take it to city hall and get more construction business."
Now, according to that woman and several of her neighbors, the yakuza are quietly going around and buying up land at fire sale prices. With many families now short of money, some property in Nagata Ward is selling for just one-third of its price before the earthquake.
For those who don't want to sell, yakuza loan sharks are offering cash -- but the security is the land that people own. Neighbors said that one mobster is offering loans from his spectacular three-floor colonial-style home, evidently well built, for it is surrounded by the rubble of more fragile homes that collapsed.
"It's too frightening to take money from them," said one middle-aged woman who lived nearby, as she spoke in a hushed voice on her doorstep.
"There was a doctor living over there who guaranteed his brother's loan from the yakuza," she said. "Then the interest mounted very quickly, and they couldn't pay back the debt. So the doctor lost his clinic."
The yakuza found other ways to get money as well. Seventeen members were arrested for applying for emergency relief funds for which they were ineligible. One gangster received funds eight times before being arrested.
"The earthquake ripped apart society," said one Japanese journalist. "It created cracks so deep that you can see things that are normally hidden, like the way the yakuza operate."

Prices of Long Bonds Gain, But Short-Term Issues Slip

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury issues rose yesterday, but without the furor of the previous two sessions as activity seemed to stall and the overall market finished mixed.
The 30-year bond rose 4/32 , to 11415/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.52 percent from 6.53 percent on Friday. Much of the day's strength was focused on the longer maturities. 
 James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, said the market had something of a negative spin even though the yield on the long bond was lower. He said prices of short-term bills retreated substantially, as investors began to realize that their expectations for an interest rate cut were a bit premature.
The expectations, he said, were fueled by Friday's weak employment report. He also cited the comments last week of the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, that there might be some bumpy quarters along the way in achieving a sustainable growth rate of 2.5 percent.
Mr. Hale thought the implications of the price drop pointed toward a rate cut sometime later this year.
"Right now yields on everything from a 10-year note down to a three-month bill are below the 6 percent Federal funds target rate," Mr. Hale said. "And to justify any further gains in bond prices the market will have to get more pieces of news about the economy that would make it more certain about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates."
Yesterday's auto sales figures did not provide the certainty of a weakening economy, Mr. Hale said. While Ford auto sales were a bit disappointing, truck sales for the company and the industry as a whole were respectable. "Which means concerns of weakness in the economy were maybe a little exaggerated," Mr. Hale said.
Earlier in the day the Commerce Department reported that April housing completions fell 7 percent, to a 1.33 million annual rate. Some traders thought the numbers were too old to provide much useful information for the market.
Despite the weakness in housing completions, prices of Treasury securities pulled back from the session's highs on some profit taking by investors who did not want to overplay their hands as the market continued to move forward.
Price gains were probably exaggerated by the lighter-than-average volume of trades, but many market participants say they believe the bond market is still in great shape. And while profit taking did chip away at the day's gains, traders and dealers said overseas investors were once again quick to buy up Treasuries.
Joel Marver, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said that "for once, we are seeing a two-sided market, with neither buyers or sellers having the upper hand in the short run."
At yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills, retail participation came up a bit short. Traders said they were not surprised since after two big days in the market last week after the purchasing management and payroll reports, prices were at a premium, and small investors were finding securities steep. "That may account for the weaker-than-normal retail participation in yesterday's bill auction," Mr. Hale said.
The average rate for a three-month maturity was 5.48 percent, sharply lower than the 5.64 percent posted the week before. For the six-month issue, the average rate was 5.35 percent, compared with 5.61 percent a week ago.
Municipal bond prices gained. The recent surge in Treasury bonds has helped make municipals more attractive, traders said. Since tax-exempt securities have lagged behind the huge gains seen in Government issues, people are starting to believe that municipals are cheap by comparison.
General obligation bonds rated triple-A and due in 20 years were yielding about 5.45 percent, or about 87 percent of comparable Treasury bonds. Investors usually consider municipals attractive enough to buy when they yield more than 82 percent of similar Government issues.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.615	97.295	Discounted Rate	5.48%	5.35%	Coupon Yield	5.65%	5.59%	High Price	98.630	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.42%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.59%	5.56%	Low Price	98.615	97.295	Discounted Rate	5.48%	5.35%	Coupon Yield	5.65%	5.59%	Accepted at low price	72%	76%	Total applied for	$42,350,503	$45,390,533	Accepted	$14,218,041	$14,220,380	Noncompetitive	$1,432,191	$1,327,805

HEADLINE: I.B.M.'S BIG MOVE: THE CORPORATE CULTURE;
Suddenly, the Hostile Takeover Is a Benevolent Act

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
With its stunning $3.3 billion hostile bid on Monday for the Lotus Development Corporation, I.B.M. did not so much alter today's rapidly evolving corporate ethos as lay down an historic marker for the deep changes already at work in an economy obsessed with efficiency and cost-cutting.
The bluest of blue-chip companies emphasized that the gentlemanly days when corporate giants operated through the Old Boy network and extolled the values of corporate citizenship have been replaced by a sense that competing, and competing aggressively, is a corporate executive's highest calling, whatever it takes. 
 Perhaps just as important, the country at large seems to accept the idea. Two other pillars of the corporate establishment, AT&T and General Electric, have initiated hostile takeovers. In neither those nor many other recent cases has there been a public uproar or groan of disapproval from board rooms, as often happened during the last takeover boom in the 1980's. Congress is not demanding hearings or an accounting of how the bids will affect the economy, as it did when the raiders of the 1980's pounced on their prey.
"Today, C.E.O.'s say: 'G.E. did it. AT&T did it. There's no reason we can't talk about it openly,' " said Richard I. Beattie, the managing partner at the Simpson Thacher & Bartlett law firm and a sought-after adviser on takeovers. "They feel it's good for everybody and it's good strategy. That allows them to distinguish themselves, at least in their own minds, from what was happening in the 1980's, when it was financially driven."
Joseph Flom, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and another top takeover lawyer, said: "Hostile takeovers are a normal part of thinking about corporate growth now. Blue-chip companies think this is appropriate behavior."
Indeed, the entire debate has been recast. The question is no longer "Why would you do something so disruptive?" but "What else can you do to reduce costs and provide better returns to shareholders?"
Bill Lewis, director of the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington and an expert on competition policy, characterized the shift in thinking on takeovers as in keeping with the acceptance in the corporate world of other strategies that were once disparaged: rounds of corporate layoffs, the slicing of divisions in the interests of efficiency and the movement of facilities overseas, where costs are lower.
"There is less reluctance, less ambivalence and, frankly, less moral compunction about doing these things," Mr. Lewis said. "You have to do it to survive today. You don't worry about it as you once might have."
But perhaps the most striking aspect of I.B.M.'s takeover bid, and the one that says the most about these times, is that it defies the accepted wisdom on the difficulties of trying to acquire a company whose primary value isn't in its machinery or real estate but rather, in that most mercurial of assets -- people.
Lotus is a leader in producing computer software, an industry that relies on a delicate balance between powerful intellects, unconventional thinking, intense pressure and corporate discipline. It was once believed that the jolt of a takeover could scare off the talent, leaving the acquirer with an empty shell rather than a productive business.
The I.B.M. bid could well prove a landmark in challenging that assumption -- or, as some are warning, bearing it out. Either way, the merger will be watched closely, because it gets at the heart of how companies will navigate the economy as technology turns the markets into an electronic marketplace.
"There's no precedent for this," said L. John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, a venture-capital firm that was one of the first investors in Lotus. "I can't think of a successful hostile takeover in this industry. Making the acquisition is easy. It's execution, making the combination work, that is the hard part."
He added: "Is this intellectual property valuable without the people who created it? Yes, I think to some degree it is. But over all I think the conventional wisdom is probably right. The competition is so great that you want to keep your team for developing these products together."
Still, Mr. Doerr and several other experts said the temptation to acquire businesses that are so dependent on ideas and people, whether hostile or friendly, would only grow. The reason is that the talent to produce good computer programs, or computer games, or music or film is in short supply.
Even traditional hardware companies, like I.B.M., are increasingly focusing their efforts on creating software of all kinds and changing their corporate culture as a result.
"With the growth of the whole information-technology area, increasingly a broader sector of the market has those characteristics," said Jon B. Kutler, head of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a West Coast investment banking firm.
In fact, one counterargument to the belief that I.B.M. risks driving the most talented people away from Lotus rests on the reality of the computer business. It is an industry in which employees leave their companies all the time to form their own firms because of the demand for interesting new ideas and products.
"There have already been at least a dozen spinoffs from Lotus as people have left to form their own businesses," Mr. Doerr said. "The entrepreneurial fever and the entrepreneurial opportunities are abundant still. That's not going to change."
The acceptance of hostile takeovers as a normal part of the corporate repertoire has been bolstered by several important developments.
A key factor is that the country's largest investors -- pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds, which manage hundreds of billions of dollars on behalf of individuals -- have been pressed by regulators and the courts to put returns ahead of corporate allegiances.
Another element is that corporate directors, who long fought to protect management, can face punishing and embarrassing lawsuits if they fail to put shareholders' interests ahead of management's.
There is also a more active market these days in senior corporate managers; it is increasingly rare for a company to be headed by an executive who has spent his or her entire career there. That means executives are less committed to holding onto a company, and the losers from takeover bids can move to other jobs.
That, of course, does not mean any hostile takeover will succeed. Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 12 percent of Chrysler, suffered a huge flop after making a $20 billion hostile bid for the automaker. Chrysler dismissed the offer out of hand and Mr. Kerkorian eventually folded.
But takeovers are still running at their highest level since the peak year of 1988, and far more than technology companies are involved.
An economic downturn could slow the deals, but it appears unlikely that public opinion or Congress will.

HEADLINE: Chairman Proposes Redefining Tax Code

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
With some prominent Democratic support, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, opened a political drive today that he hoped would ultimately lead to the replacement of the Federal income tax with a tax on what people spend.
"Our challenge," Mr. Archer said, beginning the first of three days of hearings into new systems of taxation, "is to do no less than pull the current income tax code out by its roots and throw it away so it can never grow back." 
 Few issues beside taxes draw such swarms of lobbyists, and today's hearing had a standing-room-only crowd, as representatives of the main law firms and trade associations in Washington lined the walls.
Mr. Archer called the session "one of the most important hearing days in the history of the Capitol."
In an interview, he acknowledged that sweeping changes in the tax system were unlikely in the next year or two. But he said his intention was to begin a national debate on the best way to change the system and to have that debate become part of next year's Presidential campaign.
The prevailing view in Washington is that chances are remote that any completely new system of taxation will be enacted as long as the White House and Congress are controlled by opposing parties. It would be something of a long shot even if Republicans won control of both branches of Government next year.
Always working against big changes in the tax system is the large gap between tax theory and political reality. In theory, most Americans want a new tax system that is simpler, fairer and more economically efficient. But it is impossible that such a system would allow everyone to pay less taxes and still raise the same amount of money as the current system.
Theory aside, the people and companies that would owe more taxes under a new system would surely oppose it. And so would the politicians who represented them.
Mr. Archer said that he had not decided exactly what kind of system he favored, but that in general the taxes should be based on what people spent, rather than what they earned.
Presumably, that means either a direct national sales tax or a value-added tax like those in Europe and Japan, in which the tax is applied at every stage of the production process and is eventually passed along to the purchaser of goods and services. Among tax specialists, these are called consumption taxes. Mr. Archer said that such a tax would have to be 16 percent of the goods and services bought in order to raise as much money as the current income tax does.
Another form of taxation -- a flat tax, under which the income of individuals and businesses is taxed at a single, fixed rate -- is championed by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and is supported by many of his fellow Republicans in Congress.
Mr. Archer said he opposed a flat tax because it "leaves the roots of the income tax in the ground, and it will grow again."
The income tax system, Mr. Archer said at the outset of today's hearing, "is too broken to be fixed."
Mr. Archer's position was bolstered today by support from Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. Another prominent Democrat on the committee, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, also offered general support.
In a speech written for delivery on Wednesday morning at the National Press Club, Mr. Gibbons declared that he had long been convinced that the income tax and the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare should be replaced with a value-added tax. The income tax, he maintains, is complicated and unfair and "has not kept pace with the economic realities of the modern global marketplace."
The Clinton Administration remains skeptical about the Archer and Gibbons ideas.
The Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy, Leslie B. Samuels, is scheduled to testify before the committee on Wednesday. In an interview today, he read this topic sentence from the testimony he had prepared: "We are not at this time convinced that the case for completely replacing the income tax with a consumption tax is compelling."
Mr. Samuels said that the suggested benefits of such a change had not been proved and that a consumption tax would likely provide a windfall to wealthy people at the expense of other taxpayers.
Mr. Archer said that among the advantages of a consumption tax were these:
*The cost to American businesses and individuals of complying with the tax law, which he estimated to be as high as $300 billion a year, would be substantially reduced.
*Saving and investment would be encouraged.
*Fewer people and businesses could escape taxation through the underground economy.
*The United States would become more competitive in the international economy.
Mr. Archer said he would tax all goods and services when they were bought, except homes, which he considered an investment, and possibly medical care. Imported goods would be taxed; exports would not.
The debate on the relative merits of income taxes and consumption taxes has arisen often over the years in political and academic circles.
The main argument against consumption taxes is that they tend to be regressive, meaning that they are more burdensome on the less affluent and more favorable to the better off. That is because poorer people must spend a greater proportion of their income on necessities.
Mr. Archer said he was looking for a way to give poor people a tax credit to lessen the burden on them. No form of taxation is as progressive as the income tax, Mr. Archer said. That did not worry him, he said, because the way that progressivity is measured now, no account is taken of the economic growth that will result from his proposal to the benefit of everyone.
Mr. Gibbons said his proposal would include what he called "burden adjusters" -- a rebate to the poor and an additional tax on the rich. "Any new tax system," he said, "should result in the same tax burden on each income group as the current tax system imposes."
Another tax system, supported by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, is a hybrid between income taxes and consumption taxes. Its main feature is that it would allow a tax deduction for all investments. The two Senators are scheduled to testify before the Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Republicans' Welfare Plan Is Again Attacked by Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
With Congress moving aggressively forward on proposals to overhaul welfare, President Clinton today again attacked Republican-sponsored measures, saying they would cut spending on the poor to finance tax breaks for the rich. But he stopped well short of threatening a veto.
In a speech to a National Governors' Association meeting in Baltimore, Mr. Clinton used some sharp words but broke virtually no new ground on an issue he helped bring to national prominence as Governor of Arkansas. Indeed, his cautious remarks were a reminder that the White House has been so far overtaken by the Republican-controlled Congress that Mr. Clinton may be forced for political reasons to sign a bill he does not like. 
 "Don't kid yourself," Mr. Clinton told a special governors' meeting on children's issues. "From the point of view of the Congress, welfare reform has stopped being welfare reform primarily. Primarily, welfare reform is a way to cut spending on the poor so we don't have to worry about it and we can balance the budget in seven years and give a big tax cut largely benefiting upper-income people. That's what this is about."
Senior Administration officials have left no doubt that Mr. Clinton would veto the House-passed version of welfare overhaul as punishing children and being too easy on work requirements, but the President is hoping a plan passed by the Senate Finance Committee could yet be a basis for compromise. Senate Democrats are preparing to introduce their own bill, and many have been hoping for stronger signs of guidance from the White House.
The Senate Finance Committee plan, drafted by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, would replace the Government's main welfare program with a block grant to states and freeze spending at $16.8 billion for each of the next five years. Many governors support such provisions, arguing they would give states new flexibility to deal with their own welfare problems as they see fit.
But among other objections, Mr. Clinton said such measures could hurt states with growing populations of poor people, including California and Florida, "and put every state at risk in the next recession or natural disaster."
Mr. Clinton also contended that the Senate bill would so curb financing for child care, job training and incentives for job placement as to leave all but six states unable to meet its goals for moving people off welfare and into work. He called for a Federal bonus for states that do well in helping move people into jobs.
"We already do less for young children than most of our major competitors, perhaps all our major competitors throughout the world," Mr. Clinton said. "And I just believe that we cannot allow welfare reform to be a race to the bottom."
Mr. Clinton also warned that turning welfare into a lump sum payment to states -- with no Federal requirement that all people meeting certain income and eligibility tests receive benefits -- would leave poor children vulnerable to competition for money made all the more scarce by proposed cuts in the growth of other Federal programs, like Medicare. He said that would sharpen conflicts between generations.
"You tell me how the poor children of your state are going to fare when they have to deal with the nursing home lobby," he said.
Senior White House aides have said they believe that with Republicans in the House and Senate still sharply divided over many details of their own budget proposals, especially the size of tax cuts, welfare may well "sneak up the middle" to become one of the first major bills to land on the President's desk. Having vowed in his 1992 campaign to "end welfare as we know it," they acknowledge that Mr. Clinton would be hard-pressed to veto an overhaul, even one that did not meet all his requirements.
It is a delicate balance, and even with his words today, Mr. Clinton increased public expectations of some bold progress on the issue.
"You could not design a program that would be too tough on work for me," he said. "You could not design a program that would give the states any more flexibility than I want to give them, as long as we recognize that we, our American village, have a responsibility to our children, and that in the end, our political and economic policies must reinforce the culture we're trying to create."
One problem is that neither the Republicans nor Mr. Clinton in his own plan last year is willing to spend anything like the amount that most experts believe would be necessary to pay for the costly job training, child care and other support programs that could assure large numbers of welfare recipients were moved off the rolls.
And Mr. Clinton, who did much to make the issue a political centerpiece and has now found himself overtaken by more stringent Republican ideas, has another problem. "You know," he said today, "sometimes I think my big problem is that I was for some of these things before they were popular."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Scenic Route on the Calligraphy Superhighway

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
FOR two decades, Nicholas Yeager, who likes to think of himself as a sort of medieval hacker, has been deeply committed to an ancient information storage and retrieval system.
"It is called the book," said Mr. Yeager, a binder and calligrapher, in his workshop at 51 Warren Street in lower Manhattan, where, despite the competition of powerful new computer and video-based technologies, he is producing more books by hand and making more money than ever. 
 "It's as if the computer has freed the book to become more of an art object," the 40-year-old craftsman said. "It's like what happened with calligraphy after Johnny Gutenberg invented movable type. Instead of striving for just legibility, calligraphers became free to be more creative."
HE pointed to examples of the calligraphers' art hanging in the space where he works and lives, and showed off bindings he recently fashioned from leather, fabric and metal.
Until about 1890, he said, all books had hand-sewn bindings. Their production was labor-intensive and they were expensive. "Certainly when manuscripts were written by hand they were meant only for the the very rich," Mr. Yeager said. "You know how many animals it took to make the parchment pages of a single book in medieval times? About 200 goats and sheep."
Mr. Yeager, who has a master's degree from Columbia University, knows all sorts of things like this about books, and he is enthusiastically willing to share them.
"The first king who knew how to read was Charlemagne, and that was already in the eighth century," he said.
"You realize the book is a machine," he added, taking out a Slinky and laying it alongside an open book with pages moving back and forth like the undulating stair-walking toy. "It has moving parts, which makes it a machine that is used to preserve and communicate data."
Mr. Yeager described his own romance with the book:
"I was born in Houston. My mother was a librarian and my father was a professor of economics. I was a terrible student. It wasn't until I was in graduate school that I found out I was dyslexic. My last name started with Y and the nuns seated us alphabetically, so I always ended up in the back of the room, where I had trouble seeing the blackboard. But when I was 6 years old, I found a book on my mother's shelf about the history of the book and I read it. In the Boy Scouts, I learned to work with leather and I loved that. All you needed was a needle and thread and a high threshold of boredom."
During the 60's and into the 70's he raced motorcycles and then dropped out of college after one semester. He hitchhiked around the country, making and selling belts and wallets. Eventually, he ended up in Chicago, where he saw medieval manuscripts for the first time. "I was a long-haired hippie who doodled, and when I saw the illuminated pages I decided I wanted to learn how to make a beautiful book."
As the rest of the world seemed to be learning word processing, he apprenticed himself for six years to Bill Minter, a bookbinder. He studied calligraphy and illumination. He read the works of William Morris, the English designer and printer who had advocated making ordinary objects as beautiful as possible. He learned paper making. He went back to finish college in Texas, and after graduating at 32, he went to New York to attend the Library School at Columbia.
Afterward, he worked for a while in the rare books division at the New York Public Library and served as the director of the Center for Book Arts, but he left because of disagreements with the board. By October 1992, he found himself burdened by debts, working as a mover and sleeping on a foam-rubber mattress on a kitchen table in a walkup apartment in Williamsburg.
"All I could think of doing was to make the beautiful books I had always wanted to make," he said. Using bits of copper and leather, he made several notebooks. "Bonwit's ordered 144, each different, and sold them at prices that ranged from $25 to $80."
PHOTOGRAPHERS started coming to him for individualized albums to show off their work. It turned out there were still plenty of people willing to pay for rich bindings for albums or diaries in which to keep the treasured details of private lives. Rolodexes and electronic notebooks may be fine for business contacts, but there are other kinds of numbers, and there will probably always be a demand for little black books, and shouldn't they be the kind of beautifully wrought and artistically designed artifacts that William Morris envisioned?
From little notebooks, Mr. Yeager's business grew. Designers like Donna Karan and Calvin Klein came to him to bind catalogues. He stopped sleeping on the kitchen table. Companies like Sotheby's and brands like Smirnoff commissioned him. He moved to Manhattan. His gross doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
"Now I'm doing what I was always meant to do do," he said, "making books."

HEADLINE: Plea by Judges Fails to Block Sentencing Bill

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 6

 BODY:
Ignoring a last-minute plea from an organization representing the state's Supreme Court justices, the Legislature passed a bill today that heavily revises criminal sentencing laws.
In a letter and attached resolution delivered to the State Capitol late Monday night, the justices urged the Legislature to delay approval of the bill, saying the changes could increase prison overcrowding and sharply restrict judges' control over sentencing. 
 The plan calls for increasing minimum sentences for many violent criminals and ending parole for repeat violent offenders. It would also repeal some laws requiring prison sentences for repeat nonviolent criminals.
The civil and criminal court judges said the proposed changes had been negotiated without their knowledge or advice, and they called on the Legislature to study them more carefully and hold public hearings before acting.
In recent days, other criminal-justice experts have expressed similar concerns. The Legislature passed the bill by a wide margin as part of the budget package.
Gov. George E. Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, agreed to the new sentencing guidelines during budget negotiations, perhaps the most secretive process in Albany.
In an interview today, Justice Norman E. Joslin, president of the Association of the Justices of the Supreme Court, said the Legislature had taken a "backdoor approach" by making the changes part of the closed-door budget talks.
Critics of the bill, who have included Democratic legislators, public defenders and criminal justice experts, said it would worsen prison overcrowding, cause unrest among inmates and force the state to build new prisons. One analysis by Assembly staff members said the state's prison costs would increase by $10 billion to $20 billion over the next 20 years.
In the letter, Justice Joslin wrote: "A move toward rigid determinate sentencing needs careful review in the light of serious economic and correctional realities."
The debate over the sentencing bill came as Governor Pataki and legislative leaders were negotiating several last-minute details on the budget, including how to allocate $9.7 billion in state aid to school districts and how to finance a pension increase for retired state workers.
Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno were also trying to complete their plans to divide up $75 million allocated to each house in discretionary spending. Much of that will go for local pork-barrel projects.
The $150 million total is $125 million more than the leaders had said last week that they would dedicate to so-called member's items. Their aides said today that the larger figure would include new items and old items that had been promised in past budgets but never paid for. The leaders also said they would use much of the discretionary money to restore spending in state programs that Mr. Pataki had cut, such as for alcohol treatment and mental health programs.
Mr. Silver said he would use $5 million of the Assembly's money to help Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and Mount Vernon close budget shortfalls.
But Mr. Pataki and the leaders refused to say how all of the $150 million would be spent, saying a full accounting would not be released until just hours before the final budget bill is passed, probably on Wednesday.
The Senate and Assembly also passed legislation today appropriating $4.2 billion for public works projects, the cost of which would be spread out over several years. The bill provides $115 million to build or repair athletic centers around the state, including a $24 million Olympic swimming center in Nassau County that would be used for the 1998 Goodwill Games.
Assemblyman Greg R. Becker, a Nassau County Republican, said the capital spending bill almost inspired him to sing "Old McDonald Had a Farm," as Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato had done earlier this year in deriding a Federal budget bill from the Senate floor. "I think we all know what that was all about," Mr. Becker said. "It was about a budget bill that was laden with pork."
The Legislature also passed a bill that would require convicted rapists and other sexual offenders to be tested for H.I.V. if their victims requested it. Proponents said the bill would provide vital information to rape victims. But critics said the test results would be useless to victims because the tests might be done months, and possibly years, after the sexual offense was committed.
The sentencing bill passed in the Democratic-controlled Assembly today after an hourlong debate in which supporters called it a deterrent against crime and critics blasted it as a drain on resources.
"This bill is going to put more prisoners in the system, hold them there longer, just as surely as I think anybody can do the math," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "It's going to mean more prison cells and more money to run the prisons than we have anticipated."
Under the plan the Legislature approved today, parole would be virtually eliminated and sentences lengthened for many violent felons. The Federal Government uses a similar system, but many Federal judges, like their counterparts in New York, have objected to it.
Justice Charles A. Kuffner Jr. of State Supreme Court, vice president of the justices association, said many state judges object to any plan that "impacts on our discretion." The new sentencing plan would do just that, Justice Kuffner said, by requiring judges to impose fixed sentences instead of ones with a maximum and minimum.
He also said judges worried about prison crowding. "It would be a concern if conditions are overcrowded," said Justice Kuffner, who handles a large number of criminal cases in Staten Island. "Then it approaches that amorphous concept of cruel and inhuman punishment."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Mixed For Treasury Securities In Slow Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with bonds at times moving in tandem with the dollar and other maturities slipping lower on raised doubts about how soon there might be a rate cut.
Trading was slower than normal, as some investors waited for Friday's producer price data for direction. The 30-year bond was up 6/32 , to a price of 11422/32 for a yield of 6.50 percent, down from 6.52 percent the previous day. Meanwhile, shorter- maturity bills were mixed, and intermediate-term notes were down a bit. 
 Some analysts cite concern by dealers and traders about the market's ability to remain at these high price levels without a quick Fed move to ease interest rates. They say people are looking for the second quarter to be soft, and yesterday investors did receive more signs of a cooling economy that could keep inflation subdued.
Wholesale trade inventories built up in April, suggesting slackening demand that could lead to cutbacks in production and economic growth. The Government said wholesale sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent in April, while inventories for the month surged 1.2 percent. Both numbers were stronger than expected. That report along with private forecasts that balancing the budget could further restrain the economy's growth rate, lifted bonds a bit.
Congressional plans to close the budget gap could increase unemployment by 50 percent and tip the economy into a prolonged contraction, the WEFA Group, an economic research firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said.
Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that yesterday for "the first time in days" the firm began getting queries from retail investors who were interested in selling bond holdings. One reason, he said, is that bonds are now approaching the levels at which they were bought, so investors "want some bids."
"As a portfolio manager, I've started to sell my low-coupon intermediate maturities," Mr. Roden continued, adding that he was either staying with the cash or buying a limited number of higher-coupon Ginnie Maes. "I'm doing this because interest rates have had a big run," Mr. Roden said. "I am talking now as a pure trader."
Mr. Roden said he had instructed his firm's traders to play close to the vest, implying that he does not want to be overly exposed in the event of a sharp unexpected move in rates, in either direction, "but especially upwards."
The Johnson Redbook report on retail activity out in the afternoon showed a 1.8 percent gain for the first week of June over the first week in May. That was considerably higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent gain reported last week and was up 8 percent over the first week in June 1984.
That was a bit stronger than expected, Mr. Roden said, and some traders sold off, but the market managed to close out on a better tone.
Carroll J. Delaney, managing director of Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said his firm still believed that Treasury prices were far too expensive. Thus, he expects a serious correction over the near term. "The lack of upward price movement will gradually encourage liquidation," Mr. Delaney said. "The best things in life are free, or at least cheap, and Treasury securities are definitely not in that category at the moment."
Municipal bond prices, on the other hand, had a fair day, as money managers looking to reinvest money from seasonal bond calls and payments showed good demand for yesterday's new issues. As a result, municipalities were able to sell much of the day's $1.6 billion in new securities at yields below existing issues.
Municipals outperformed Treasury securities for a second day. The yield on a 10-year insured revenue bond fell four basis points, to 5.01 percent, according to the PSA/ Bloomberg Municipal Bond Yield Table, which measures yields on insured revenue bonds. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Largely Higher on Hopes Of Support From Group of Seven

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most major currencies yesterday on optimism that leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations would pledge new support for a stronger dollar when they meet next week.
In April, finance ministers and central bankers from the seven countries -- the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Italy -- said they would continue efforts toward economic cooperation that would stabilize currency markets. 
 Such coordination was evident last week when the Federal Reserve and about a dozen other central banks bought huge amounts of dollars to stem the currency's fall. The dollar has declined 15 percent against the Japanese yen and 9 percent against the German mark since the beginning of the year.
The Group of Seven is to meet June 15-17 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Analysts predicted that the dollar would remain steady until then, anticipating a reaffirmation of a strong dollar. "Many market players are watching their positions ahead of the G-7 meeting because they don't want to get caught too low," said David De Rosa, a foreign-exchange director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "The dollar will be trapped in a narrow range until then."
Yesterday, in late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 84.71 yen, down from 84.77 late Monday, and at 1.4110 marks, up from 1.4105.
Other late dollar rates, compared with late Monday, were: 1.1635 Swiss francs, up from 1.1595; 4.9495 French francs, up from 4.9385; 1,633 Italian lire, down from 1,635, and 1.3818 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3772. The British pound was quoted at $1.5930, down from $1.5968.
The American currency was also buoyed by continuing rumors that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would orchestrate another big dollar-buying campaign before the Group of Seven met.
"The market is reluctant to take a position that's too low for fear that the central banks will move in again," said Christopher Low, a senior economist at HSBC Markets.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
SunAmerica hopes to prosper with annuities for baby boomers.

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
ONE of the leaders in the race to exploit the requirements and interests of baby boomers these days is SunAmerica Inc., a financial services concern that specializes in tax-deferred long-term savings and investments.
As a result of this specialization -- and its corresponding determination to stay away from mortality-based life insurance -- the company has enjoyed five years of strong profits. And analysts are projecting even further earnings increases this year and next. 
 "It is, by far, the strongest buy in financial services on my list," said Charlotte A. Chamberlain, a vice president of Wedbush Morgan Securities. "They run their company to build shareholder value by focusing in laser-sharp fashion on the pre-retirement market."
This segment of the population -- men and women who are now 45 to 64 -- is estimated to total about 61 million by the end of the 20th century. Their perceived need for annuities, both variable and fixed, is the engine that currently drives SunAmerica's growth.
"The demand for annuities is going to be strong for the next decade, while the entitlements for baby boomers are declining," said John Zief, a vice president of Goldman, Sachs. "I believe that savings are inversely related to entitlements."
Operating earnings for SunAmerica, before net realized investment returns, in the year ended Sept. 30, 1994, amounted to $3.91 a share. According to First Call, which tabulates these data, the average of analysts' earnings estimates of operating net is $4.52 a share in the 1995 fiscal year and $5.10 a share in the 1996 fiscal year.
"Over the next five years, we expect SunAmerica's earnings to grow at 15 percent per year," said Weston M. Hicks, senior research analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "Given this outlook, we put the fair value of SunAmerica at $58 to $60." The stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.75, up 75 cents, and near its 52-week high of $55.50.
The company, originally known as the Kaufman & Broad Building Company, was formed by Eli Broad and Donald Kaufman in 1957 to build low-priced houses in California, where it is still based. It spun off the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation to its stockholders in 1989 to concentrate exclusively on financial services and then became SunAmerica, derived from the name of its largest unit, the Sun Life Insurance Company of America.
SunAmerica held its first meeting for analysts last month at its headquarters in Century City. Management is reported to have emphasized a desire to maintain its investment spread between the yield on portfolio assets and credited interest rates at a high level. With an investment portfolio of $9.5 billion, this spread was just under 3 percent in the last fiscal year and moved above 3 percent early in the first half of the current fiscal year.
"In 1993 and 1994, a lot its inflows were in variable annuities," Mr. Hicks said. "In 1995, SunAmerica has been going for fixed annuities in a big way."
Ms. Zief added: "SunAmerica has proven this year that it can shift its focus between variable annuities and fixed annuities. It has been able to convince its distribution system that had been selling variable annuities to sell fixed annuities." The company's annuities are sold by broker-dealers, insurance agents and commercial banks.
Among the factors that could put a damper on the earnings growth rate for SunAmerica, as well as its competitors, is projected new Federal legislation affecting insurance companies. For instance, proposals have been made to tax the income of annuities before the funds are withdrawn -- the so-called inside buildup -- and to establish a flat tax system. But this type of proposal has also been introduced in the past and nothing has yet come of it.
"SunAmerica is the purest play on a megatrend in demographics in the United States," Ms. Chamberlain said. "It is really at the cutting edge."

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Can't Close Japan Trade Gap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell (Economic Scene, June 1) states that the dollar-yen crisis "is really the indirect consequence of Japan's economic stagnation" to explain why the United States trade deficit hasn't fallen in response to the weaker dollar. This conclusion is badly flawed. 
 The dollar-yen crisis Mr. Passell refers to is apparently the weakening of the dollar and rise of the yen, during the last two years, the period during which the Japanese economy has been flat. However, the dollar has been declining against the yen for 25 years, from 360 yen in 1970 to just under 240 in 1985, to the recent level of about 85. The decline in recent years has been only a small fraction of the total in this long period. And before the last two years, Japan's economy grew much faster than the United States economy.
The economist Mr. Passell cites predicts that a modest additional fall in the dollar against the yen will sharply cut our trade deficit with Japan. But he has wrongly made that prediction for years, and the deficit has gone up as the dollar declined.
Not one reference was made in the column to Japan's closed markets and export promotion, which explain the persistence of its trade surplus, and is the only explanation consistent with historical trends.
Fiscal stimulus in Japan will by itself reduce its $130 billion trade surplus by $10 billion at most. Japan should stimulate its economy, but that is no substitute for market opening.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The Big Three's lobbying arm is serious about its business and, apparently, about its gimmickry.

BYLINE: By James Bennet 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THESE days, the business of the United States auto industry is politics. And as the current trade fight with Japan attests, the industry has grown far more adept at that business since the 1960's, when General Motors clumsily hired private detectives in hopes of discrediting Ralph Nader.
The industry's newfound success is owed partly to a reinvigorated Washington lobbying arm, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, which for about 18 months has been conducting a carefully targeted advertising and public relations campaign to alert policy- and opinion-makers to the industry's economic clout. 
 The association's latest attention-grabbing gimmick is a stack of 51 glossy, somewhat silly, cards being delivered by hand to every member of Congress and also sent to media organizations. The size of a postcard, each bears the name of a state and photographs of some treasure or emblem of that state along with an auto part that is manufactured there for the Big Three.
"California Lifeguards," says one card, with four pictures of sun-kissed bay watchers and one picture of a safety belt stretched across a seat. "The 'Golden State' makes occupant restraints for America's car companies," the opposite side of the cards reads in part.
Many of the cards are whimsical: "It's always springtime in Nebraska," says one, over a doctored photo of springs growing in a cornfield. Some confer a rather dubious-sounding distinction. A mock license plate from Connecticut reads: "Connecticut. Tilt-shaft state."
There are 51 cards because, in a bow to Michigan's automotive primacy, that state gets two.
"The postcards are designed to show that what happens to American car companies affects literally every state in the union," said Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the association.
The association started its image-building campaign after it surveyed Washington "decision makers" in 1993 and found a startlingly low opinion of the industry's importance. "That survey found we were rated just ahead of the local construction company," said Mr. Card, who was a secretary of transportation in the Bush Administration.
Meanwhile, facing tightening regulations on clean air, safety, and fuel economy -- not to mention the trade dispute -- executives at the Big Three say the Government has more influence on their business than ever. "The environment we operate in is as important as our overall competitiveness," Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, said last fall, referring to the regulatory environment.
The association has so far spent about $2.5 million on the campaign, and said its recent surveys showed its message was getting across. The total includes $125,000 spent for about 7,000 sets of cards, Mr. Card said. Eisner & Associates, an agency in Baltimore, helped design the cards, which carry the lobby's tag line: "What America drives, drives America."
The lobby's hope is that the cards will catch the attention of people who are flooded with mail every day. To that end, last year the association mailed out thousands of apple pies to the same list, with instructions to cut the pies into 20 equal pieces and eat 19 of them. Those 19 pieces, the association claimed, represented the proportion of American auto jobs generated by the Big Three.
Mr. Card said that George Mitchell, then the Senate's majority leader, wrote to inquire what he should do with the 20th piece. Mr. Card -- who said he never gave Mr. Mitchell an answer -- is betting the cards will generate similar interest. Nine parts suppliers, he said, have requested customized versions of certain state cards to bombard their local opinion leaders with.
It may be hard to imagine that cards declaring "Kansas: Get along lil' drive shafts," or "In Nevada, everything's coming up hoses" or "Virginia is for steering" will ever change hands like Mickey Mantle's baseball cards. But Mr. Card can dream.
"We're already seeing a secondary market of trading springing up," he said.

Goodbye to Green Monster As a Hello to Progress?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If the picture Gene Budig sees for the near future develops as he sees it, his league soon will blossom with new ball parks. Budig's picture encompasses new parks in Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Seattle and Anaheim.
"I am optimistic that there will be commitments for new facilities in all six locations in the next 18 months," Budig, the American league president, said before leaving yesterday for the owners' quarterly meetings in Minneapolis. "I have talked with many community leaders. I have talked with representatives of the clubs. I have talked with representatives of the media. No one debates the importance of new facilities for the long-term well-being of these clubs. I believe the case is persuasive." 
 Enviously eyeing the success of Camden Yards in Baltimore, Jacobs Field in Cleveland and The Ballpark in Arlington in Texas, other clubs want to attain the same economic benefits enjoyed by the teams that play in those facilities. Budig has campaigned on behalf of the teams in those six cities to help sell the idea to officials and residents.
"A new ball park represents an investment in the future," he said in a telephone interview. "It becomes a matter of good business practice. A state-of-the-art facility reflects a community's confidence in its potential. Cities want to be regarded as big league or first-class. It is a matter of pride. Major league baseball remains a significant factor in the quality-of-life equation. No community today wants to lose a franchise. It would send the wrong message to business and industry that might have an interest in it."
Budig did not include the Yankees in his forecast because George Steinbrenner has not asked him to campaign with New York officials to help get the kind of park the Yankee owner wants.
"You'd have to ask them," Budig said when asked what he thought about the Yankees' chances of getting a new place. "I've been working with these clubs. They have invited participants."
The National League also has some teams eager to get new baseball-only parks. Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and San Francisco are in that group. The first three cities opened similar multi-purpose stadiums in the early 1970's. That type of stadium was considered state of the art at that time.
"Things are changing," Budig said. "Fans are demanding new and improved facilities. They want fan-friendly facilities. Camden Yards changed things forever. That facility set a new standard."
One major obstacle to the construction of new parks is taxpayer opposition to the use of tax funds to pay for them.
"Thoughtful leaders favor partnerships involving public and private funding commitments," Budig said. "They favor long-term agreements. A new ball park means security for many working men and women. It provides needed jobs and has a direct impact on the local economy. Major league baseball means millions of dollars for its member communities. Figures vary, but most clubs place economic impact at well over $200 million a year. This, in fact, is a conservative number."
New stadiums will become even more important as clubs struggle to raise their revenues, which have been seriously eroded by the labor dispute. When the owners began discussing revenue sharing nearly two years ago, the Indians would have been thought to belong in the low-revenue group, but their new park has elevated them into the high-revenue group.
The owners will meet in Minneapolis today and tomorrow. The executive council met last night. The owners are not expected to reach any major decisions, but are expected to discuss the comatose labor negotiations and revenue sharing.
The owners emerged from their last meeting on May 10 saying a new collective bargaining agreement was the best way to repair the strike damage. But four weeks later they still don't have a new chief labor lawyer or apparently a strategy to pursue.
Lawyers from both sides have met, most recently last Friday, to discuss possible ways to settle the National Labor Relations Board's unfair-labor-practice charges against the owners, but they are not close to a settlement. If no settlement is reached or sufficient progress made toward one, a trial before an administrative law judge will begin June 19.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Tracing the Routes Of the Irish in America

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Happy groups of immigrants to America are all alike; every unhappy group is unhappy in its own way. "Out of Ireland," Paul Wagner's evocative two-hour history of almost two centuries of Irish immigration, captures the lows and highs of an emigration that depleted the population of the home country as it enriched the United States.
Moving back and forth between Ireland and America, the program finds its way into the lives of a few of the millions of Irish Roman Catholics who made the journey, most of them in the years after the terrible potato famine of the 1840's. The destruction of their subsistence crop seemed the final blow after centuries of political repression and economic exploitation by Protestant landowners under the protection of the British. An Irish historian sings: "She's the most distressful country/that ever yet was seen./For they're hangin' men and women/For the wearin' of the green." From 1845 to 1860, two million people emigrated (or, as many of them felt, went into exile) and their departure, along with the deaths from hunger and disease, reduced Ireland's population by a third. 
 The immigrants focused on here seem to have been selected mainly for their talent as letter writers, which works just fine. The Irish nation cannot be entirely composed of natural stylists, but you wouldn't know it from these resonant passages, read in zesty brogues by Liam Neeson, Brenda Fricker, Aidan Quinn and Gabriel Byrne, and accompanied by energetically fiddled home-grown melodies and rich old photographs from Ireland and America. Now and then Mick Moloney, a folklorist, delivers a song, including a rouser about everybody in America being named Kelly.
The language is so fresh that it makes the routine narration, spoken by Kelly McGillis as if she were competing in an enunciation contest, seem even flatter than it is. Unfortunately, Mr. Wagner does not write as well as he directs, despite his claim to an Irish grandmother.
As is pointed out more than once tonight, many of the immigrants found themselves paving the roads they had dreamed were made of gold. Irishmen became cheap labor for the toughest jobs of an expanding nation: building bridges, railroads and skyscrapers; digging canals, and cutting lumber. In a time of capitalism unconstrained, Ireland's shanties were replaced by America's slums and the newcomers had to endure the sort of discrimination that earlier immigrants have a way of extending to the latest batch of strangers.
The invigorating influence of the Irish-Americans on the Roman Catholic church, the emerging labor unions, the Democratic Party and big-city politics are duly noted. Particular attention is paid to Richard O'Gorman, who started out as a radical nationalist in Dublin and was Americanized as a Tammany big shot at the time of the Tweed ring. A sharp observer as well as an adroit player in the New York City political game, he wrote home that "our countrymen have their share" in what he called "the headquarters of political corruption." He died a judge.
Needless to say, the Irish, who made up the first of the great 19th-century migrations of huddled masses from Europe to America, have, like most of the others, prospered. This spirited appreciation ends with a telling statistic: fewer than 10 percent of these immigrants, much though they cherished memories of home, returned to Ireland. Instead they sent hundreds of millions of dollars back, to bring others to come and make it in America.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE Napa Valley has been called everything from America's last agricultural frontier to an enological Disneyland. And in truth, it is a remarkable place.
An hour north of San Francisco, but really just a few miles beyond the San Francisco Bay Area's creeping urban spread, it presents itself as a bucolic paradise. Sheltered by two striking mountain ranges, the Napa Valley, with its picture-book villages, meticulously groomed vineyards and handsome wineries, seems like some pastoral Shangri-La where every prospect pleases and Martha Stewart heads the zoning board. 
 Yet, there is something schizophrenic about the valley. A commitment to sun, soil and the simple life is a given, but there is also a need for seared tuna and designer mineral water. When it comes to restaurants, St. Helena is as trendy as TriBeCa and just as expensive. Sturdy work clothes are never out of fashion, but they don't sell them at the Brooks Brothers outlet store on Route 29.
The valley, as its denizens call it, is a study in contradiction. The down-home Norman Rockwell aura is misleading. Good land sells for $50,000 an acre, and a disturbing amount of it is owned by multinational corporations and other foreign investors. For many others, the promise of a good life has turned sour or, at least, less sweet. Competition and a sluggish wine market have forced them to work harder and harder just to stay solvent.
In 1942, a novelist, Alice Tisdale Hobart, who is now mostly forgotten, wrote a best seller about the Napa Valley. Called "The Cup and the Sword," it was based on the life of Georges de Latour, the Frenchman who founded Beaulieu Vineyards.
Miss Hobart was not the first to write about the Napa Valley, but she may have been the first to recognize the dramatic potential in that hermetically sealed little world. Following her, writers have been as thick on the land as loan officers from the local banks -- and just about as welcome. Rare is the year that passes without another Napa Valley picture or guide book, history book or third-rate novel.
The latest to try her hand, with "Dreamers of the Valley of Plenty" (Scribner, $25), is Cheryll Aimee Barron, a former business writer and alumna of The Economist who was born in India and lived in England before moving to California about 15 years ago.
Ms. Barron is a sensitive writer of considerable erudition, with a fine ear for dialogue and nuance. She fashions vivid portraits of well-known valley people in search of some common thread or unifying theme. It doesn't happen, and she concludes that "the valley's hybrid society is unlikely ever to stay still for long enough to allow a cohesive and unmistakable local culture to form."
She is dead wrong.
America is a hybrid society; we long ago discovered that hardly anything melts in the melting pot. We have learned to live with that fact, and even to exult in it. Indeed, the Napa Valley is more heterogeneous than almost any community other than a Benedictine monastery. Certainly more so than New York or San Francisco or even blue-collar Vallejo.
People come and go in the Napa Valley, but compared with the average American suburb where faceless corporate types live for a few years and then move on to the next suburb, the Napa Valley is quite stable.
Ms. Barron's subjects include Joe Heitz, creator of the famous Martha's Vineyard cabernet; the Louis Martini family; Jack and Jamie Davies at Schramsberg Vineyards; Robin Lail, a descendant of the founder of Inglenook Vineyards; the late Andre Tchelistcheff, the Russian-born wine maker long associated with Beaulieu Vineyards, and an assortment of later foreign arrivals including Bernard Portet of Clos du Val, Francis and Francoise DeWavrin-Woltner, owners of Chateau Woltner, Christian Moueix of Dominus and Donald Hess of the Hess Collection.
For all her vividly expressed love for California, Ms. Barron is clearly more at ease with the Europeans. Her attempts to draw out the down-to-earth Mr. Heitz on the age of his house verge on the laughable, and she admits to having got nowhere at all with Robert Mondavi.
Mr. Mondavi does tend to talk in sound bytes, but some patience with him would have been infinitely more rewarding than the time spent with, say, the DeWavrin-Woltners, who, like most of the Europeans Ms. Barron interviewed, are decidedly marginal to life in the Napa Valley. Most of them, with the exception of Christian Moueix, don't even make particularly good wine.
Ms. Barron is at her best with the Martinis, a close-knit family that has never sought center stage and has clung to older ways and low prices, only to become lost in all the welter of glitz and marketing hype that currently is driving the wine industry.
She's good, too, on the Mexicans in the Napa Valley, the silent workers who form a rich subculture largely unknown to the wine makers who employ them. And she is good, too, on the fatuous San Franciscans, the "haute weekend crowd" that drifts up to the valley, trailing their decorators behind them.
There is very much of a local culture in the valley. It is made up of old-timers and newcomers who are genuine wine people: men and women who have risked all to be part of the wine business, who have dragged hoses in damp cellars, poured wine at a thousand tastings and helped one another when the need was there.
The culture is there but Ms. Barron seems to have missed it. On the other hand she does bring us Urania Ristow, an haute weekender who, we are told, "is built like a dainty, finely proportioned flower -- a freesia, say," and who displays "a marvel of a nose that is straight, but with the suggestion of being fractionally retrousse."
Now isn't that more fun to read than all that dull stuff about wine?

TASTINGS
Marimar Torres Chardonnay, Don Miguel Vineyard (Sonoma-Green Valley), 1992. About $20.
 
A long name for a bottle of wine? Yes, but that's the way it is in California these days. It's like those Russian dolls within dolls. Marimar Torres, whose family makes wine in Spain and Chile, planted her grapes near Forestville, on the Western fringe of Sonoma County, in a wine-making area called Russian River. Actually she's in a section of Russian River specifically known as Green Valley. And this wine comes from a special 30-acre vineyard within Green Valley named Don Miguel, after her late father. In the end there is something to be said for specificity. This is a first-rate chardonnay: rich, intensely flavored, long on the finish, obviously the beneficiary of the 10 months it spent in French oak. Oh, yes, there is 3 percent parellada, a Catalan grape, in the blend. Proud people, the Catalans.

HEADLINE: Bill Is Signed Raising Limit To 65 M.P.H.

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 6

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today signed into law a 65-mile-per-hour speed limit for 1,100 miles of the state's highways that is to take effect Aug. 1, vowing that the police would enforce the new limit more vigilantly than the current 55-m.p.h. limit.
Mr. Pataki said it has been impossible for troopers to enforce the current law, citing statistics that 96 percent of drivers now violate it. 
 "We think this will help the state police be able to enforce the law appropriately, as opposed to not being able to when you have more than 90 percent of people not complying," he said at a signing ceremony at the Capitol this morning. "We are going to enforce the 65-mile-an-hour limit strictly, and I believe there will be overwhelming public compliance."
When the new speed limit takes effect, New York will become the 44th state to raise its top limit to 65 miles an hour. Before then, the speed limit in Maryland will rise to 65, starting July 1.
Mr. Pataki said the new speed limit would help improve the economy and tourism, presumably by making it quicker for goods and visitors to wend their way through the state. Despite some studies showing an increase in fatalities when highway speed limits are raised -- and more people exceeding 70 m.p.h. -- Mr. Pataki said he thought that would not be the case in New York.
"We believe that with continuing efforts at enforcement, with continuing efforts at improving safety conditions, that we can enact this without seeing an increase in highway fatalities," he said.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had opposed the measure because of concerns that it would cost lives.
At the ceremony, Mr. Pataki held up one of the 610 new signs that will be installed by August. They simply read "Speed Limit," rather than "State Speed Limit" as currently appears. The reason is that the new increase is technically considered an exception to the official maximum speed, 55, still in effect on most rural highways.
The cost of the change will be about $290,000, mostly for making and installing the new signs.
Mr. Pataki said there would be no new state troopers assigned to speed enforcement. But James V. Atkins, a spokesman for the New York State Police, said they would study whether they need to concentrate troopers on certain stretches of highways.
The state police also plan to buy more laser guns for monitoring speed. Laser guns are harder to detect than radar guns and, unlike radar, can pinpoint individual cars.


GRAPHIC: Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law yesterday a 65-mile-per-hour speed limit for 1,100 miles of New York State highways. The change will take effect on Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Images of Lawlessness Twist Russian Reality

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 6

 BODY:
The West has the impression that Russia is rancid with crime, that gangs rule the streets, that few people are safe from a post-Soviet horde of muggers, murderers, racketeers and thieves.
In Moscow, where gangland killings have a cinematic brutality, Russians have the same impression, and the perception of growing criminality, corruption and instability is associated in many minds with democracy and a market economy. 
 The reality, however, is less nightmarish than the perception.
But that doesn't stop Tatyana Fyodorovna, a 41-year-old businesswoman, from walking home from the subway at night with her keys between her fingers like brass knuckles. Or Viktor Klimenko or his wife from meeting their 17-year-old daughter at the subway station at dusk to walk her home. Or Irina Dezhina, a 32-year-old scientist, from bolting her new steel door with five locks.
"People have to protect themselves," said Oleg Brukhis, 30, who works at a Moscow barber shop. "The police occasionally round up a few hooligans and detain them overnight, but our police are lawless. Have you once heard of any big criminals being apprehended here?"
Attitudes like these have important political consequences for Russia's future, giving the old Communist days a retrospective soft focus of stability and order.
Although crime went up sharply after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, as it did throughout the countries of Eastern Europe, it is now leveling off or falling here. The important exceptions are murders, new economic crimes like bank fraud and protection rackets, and official corruption -- with officials often suspected of complicity in covering up major crimes.
Compared with New York, Moscow is not especially crime-ridden. But there have been more spectacularly violent crimes. The Russian murder rate has surged, largely because of gang shootouts and contract killings of prominent businessmen and criminal leaders, and there has been an increase in crimes committed with a firearm.
"Before, we confiscated a handgun once a week," said Mikhail P. Andreyev, head of the Investigation Agency for Organized Crime of the Interior Ministry. "Now we confiscate arsenals."
Most of these big crimes involve businessmen fighting over territory or settling scores, officials say. The situation is exacerbated by a weak legal system and the lack of a body of corporate law.
The killing in March of a beloved television host and executive, Vladislav Listyev, brought thousands of Muscovites into the streets as a protest against crime. Three members of Parliament have died in business-related killings, in addition to 35 bankers and at least one prominent journalist, Dmitri Kholodov.
In April, in another especially horrible case, the 6-year-old daughter of a leading Russian stockbroker, Andrei Orekhov, was killed on her way to kindergarten when his car was riddled with machine-gun bullets by two gunmen in broad daylight. Mr. Orekhov, 29, the general director of a major brokerage house, was seriously wounded; his bodyguard and driver survived with minor injuries.
None of these prominent killings have yet been solved, even though the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, formerly the domestic side of the K.G.B. and now renamed the Federal Security Service, with new powers, says it knows some of the culprits. Of the 47 contract killings last year in Moscow alone, the police say they have solved only 11.
But number of reported murders was the only category of crime in which this capital of some 10 million people outranked New York City, a city of more than 7 million, in 1994. Last year, compared with Moscow, New York had 8.3 times the number of reported rapes and 13.1 times the number of reported assaults.
After having quadrupled between 1988 and 1992, the total of all crime in Russia went down 6 percent last year. By far the largest number of crimes involve property, but the police are making some inroads, helped by new precautions, like better locks, steel doors and car alarms. Thefts were down 17 percent, thefts from apartments were down 14 percent, and robberies in general were down 19 percent.
In Moscow, incidents of rape, assaults, robberies and property crimes were all down last year.
Crime figures in general are viewed with skepticism throughout the world, and some experts on Russian crime, like Joseph D. Serio of Eurasian Business Services, suggest that Russian statistics are massaged to make them seem better.
Russian officials, like Aleksandr Y. Birin, director of the Inspection Section of the Investigation Department of the Interior Ministry, reject the notion, while acknowledging that figures were heavily doctored in Soviet days. "Of course, this creates a problem of perception," Mr. Birin said. "The Soviet days were not as calm as they seemed, and by comparison, today is not as awful."
Yuri Levada, director of the Center for the Study of Public Opinion, said: "Of course people are concerned with crime, even more than in past years. But when we do our polls and ask people whether they or any family members have been victims of crime, they tell us, no more -- sometimes even less -- than in the past. The images of violent crime come mostly from the mass media."
Mr. Levada's polls show that while crime is an important issue, it usually comes after inflation and unemployment in a list of people's greatest concerns. People are shocked by the new types of crime, Mr. Levada said: "Murders tied to racketeering are on the rise, as well as economic crimes involving new economic structures. None of this existed a short time ago."
Aleksandr N. Kulikov, the Deputy Interior Minister, also acknowledges that new kinds of economic crime are flourishing in the new market economy, giving the police significant difficulties. The police do not always understand the kinds of fraud, money laundering and other white-collar crimes that were impossible a few years ago and they lack the training and computer equipment to pursue them.
Often there is no new law on the books that makes certain activities illegal. Anyone, for example, can register as a bank at any address, with little chance of official oversight.
The current criminal code is a much-revised and patched-together document based on a social system that considered private business criminal, and it remains full of contradictory or ambiguous laws. To prove tax evasion, for instance, the police must prove "malicious intent."
Among the new kinds of crime in Moscow have been at least 70 cases of fake banks, which promise high interest but then disappear; fraud with credit cards, which are beginning to take hold among the new rich, and "apartment murders."
In an apartment murder, old people are pressed into privatizing their apartments and signing them over to strangers, sometimes in return for a promised new apartment in the suburbs. Sometimes that new apartment exists; sometimes the old person simply disappears. With ordinary apartments now costing up to $40,000, there are about five such cases a week in Moscow.
Lieut. Roman G. Fyodorov, 32, is an investigator at the militia station covering 130,000 people in the tough Kuzminky district in southeast Moscow. There is one computer for the whole station. Four investigators share three desks in a single room.
He described a recent case: a divorced woman of 45 who had been kidnapped for a month, tortured with a hot iron, raped and beaten to get her to sign over her apartment. "She finally signed, and as they took her to finish her, she got away," Lieutenant Fyodorov said.
The men were arrested. But meanwhile she has disappeared, and the police fear that she has been killed by the gang that sought her apartment in the first place.
"Sometimes old people disappear and we don't know it for a long time," Lieutenant Fyodorov said. "If the papers look proper, they get the apartment. And after someone is deregistered, nobody cares about them." After the new registration, the apartment is sold, "and then we can't track it."
He, like other police and Interior Ministry officials, say that with the collapse of the Soviet Union -- and the overriding fear of the totalitarian state -- there is a vacuum of ethics and a new disproportion of resources between criminal gangs and the state law-enforcement bodies.
"It's all about the new economy," Lieutenant Fyodorov said. "The more people get rich, the more money you want. Before, no professional thief would kill; it was a kind of code. Now the cruelest crimes take place. The society is caught between values. The old ones are gone, and the new ones are not yet formed."
Pavel Lando, 48, is an urbane, well-traveled conductor at the Russian Music Academy. "Right now we're living through a very tough time," he said, sitting on a park bench in Moscow. "Before, there was less crime. But what's happening now is all temporary. It will pass once people get used to the new order of things."

HEADLINE: The Legacy of Boss Daley

 BODY:
Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has assumed control of Chicago's public housing authority and announced ambitious plans for revitalizing the most dangerous and disreputable public housing system in the country. The takeover, the largest yet by the Federal Government, marks a significant test for Mr. Cisneros and for HUD.
Known for its violent housing projects and intractable bureaucracy, the Chicago Housing Authority has defeated its recent chairman, Vincent Lane, an earnest reformer with limited management skills. Mr. Lane's efforts to reshape the Housing Authority made so many enemies that he was given a police escort and a bulletproof vest. The HUD takeover came just after he and the Authority's board resigned en masse, imploring the Government to lend its muscle to the problem. 
 Chicago's violent islands of poverty did not come into being by accident. As the columnist Mike Royko points out in "Boss," his biography of former Mayor Richard J. Daley, the projects sprang directly from City Hall's active resistance to integration. "Containing the Negro was unspoken city policy," Mr. Royko writes. "Even expressways were planned as man-made barriers . . . ghetto walls." Daley didn't invent the strategy, but some would say he perfected it.
Plans for scattered public housing outside the ghetto were quietly scuttled. Instead, mammoth housing projects like the Robert Taylor Homes and Stateway Gardens went up along a lengthy stretch of South State Street, as Chicago began to put together the largest contiguous ghettos in the United States.
For many years, the Housing Authority was a plantation run by machine politicians -- and easy pickings for maintenance contractors who siphoned off Federal funds while permitting the buildings to fall into horrific decay. Four generations of Chicagoans in public housing have grown up cut off from the city proper, isolated in such projects. Of the 15 poorest neighborhoods in America, 11 are Chicago public housing communities.
The Federal Government will now attempt to dismantle Chicago's man-made centers of poverty. Mr. Cisneros plans to gather his ablest managers to shore up the Housing Authority's staff and create new operating systems. He then wants to demolish vacant Authority buildings and replace them with low-rise, mixed-income developments -- things that Mr. Lane also wanted but was prevented from doing, either because of local resistance or HUD's own regulations.
Mr. Cisneros faces treacherous local politics and 100,000 deeply suspicious tenants. But if the takeover succeeds, he will have improved the stature of public housing nationally -- and begun to dispense with Boss Daley's most troubling legacy to Chicago.

HEADLINE: Guest Worker Programs Do a World of Harm;
California's Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Julian L. Simon says that illegal immigrants are barred from receiving most social services except for education and emergency health care. In 1992, the estimated two million illegal aliens in California cost MediCal about $1 billion. That amounts to $500 per capita for emergency health care. 
 As of October 1994, there were 210,807 children of illegal aliens (including a few "amnesty" children) in Los Angeles County who qualified their families for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, food stamps, public housing and a host of other free services linked to A.F.D.C. The annual cost for A.F.D.C. was $495,682,068 -- and that is just one county and one welfare category.
Philip Martin, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, has reported that if the wages of all agricultural workers were doubled, the cost of California produce would rise 10 percent.
Mr. Simon is wrong about illegal aliens on welfare, and he is wrong about a guest-worker program. What should happen is a repeat of Eisenhower's Operation Wetback (which is what really halted illegal immigration in 1954), the sealing of our southern border and a cut in welfare. Labor supply would drop, farm wages would rise and, driven by a need for survival, thousands of young people, including many former illegal aliens who now amuse themselves by killing each other on the streets of Los Angeles, would have the opportunity to burn off their excess energy by earning real money harvesting California's crops.
California taxpayers would rejoice in the knowledge that the social burden migrant farm workers bring to their state would be placed where any self-respecting economist would agree it should be -- in the cost of the produce itself.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
In Trade Dispute With Japan, Both Sides See Misjudgments

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
As the American deadline for a virtual embargo on imports of Japanese luxury cars approaches, both Japanese and American officials now concede that they deeply miscalculated the other country's resolve in their trade confrontation. And so far, they say, neither side can find a way out.
Economic officials and diplomats, in interviews in Tokyo and Washington in the last two weeks, acknowledged that they had failed to recognize critical political signals indicating that neither side was prepared to back down. That happened despite all the intense efforts to study each other, talk to each other and spy on each other. 
 The two sides appear farther apart now than they were a few weeks ago. They cannot even agree on the subject of low-level talks in Geneva that begin next week, nor on the location of a subsequent negotiation that may be the last chance to resolve the issue in time to prevent the 100 percent tariffs on 13 Japanese car models from going into effect on June 28.
Today, Japanese officials hinted that they might be drawing up a list of American products that would be subject to retaliation. And on Monday night, Vice President Al Gore, sitting beside President Clinton during a television interview, delivered a stern warning to the Japanese. "If they in any way misjudge the strength and resolve of the President in pursuing this," Mr. Gore said, "they're making a serious mistake."
But officials on both sides say that a number of such mistakes have already been made.
The United States, some officials now acknowledge, missed the importance of a generational change in the bureaucracy in Tokyo, one that has brought in trade hard-liners who are worried that Japan's 40-year run of surging growth may finally be over.
And in Tokyo, Japanese officials say they underestimated the political importance that the White House placed on proving that it would battle to expand American exports by opening markets perceived as perpetually closed. Both sides agree that another critical element is missing from the confrontation: A back channel to allow straight talk between the political leaders on both sides.
In the fractured Japanese Government, there is no one left to play that role. The senior politicians who felt indebted to the United States for rebuilding the country after World War II have either been forced from power or retired. In Washington, the State Department -- which usually urges caution in trade disputes -- has taken a back seat, realizing that these days, economic imperatives trump everything else.
"For the first time, it is really all right for Japan to say 'No, we're simply not going to give in,' " said a seasoned Japanese official in Tokyo. "We haven't felt that way before, and there is almost a euphoria about it. But what is missing are the safety valves."
For all their second thoughts, American officials said they would have gone ahead anyway with the threat of the $5.9 billion in sanctions, which apply to all the Japanese luxury cars imported since May 20 if no resolution was reached. But a few Clinton Administration officials now concede to being overoptimistic about how Japan would react to an extreme form of "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure.
Rather than force a fractured Japanese leadership to cave in, as Washington hoped, the sanctions have bolstered the influence of the most confrontational member of the Japanese Cabinet, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who serves as the Minister of International Trade and Industry.
"He tends to act like a big shot, that is his style," said Tsutomu Hata, a former prime minister and a political opponent of Mr. Hashimoto. "But fundamentally, everyone has to say that he is right on this, and the United States cannot take unilateral action when it doesn't like the results of our trade relations."
That view, once considered beyond the pale in Tokyo, has become mainstream politics.
What has changed? The American Ambassador in Japan, Walter F. Mondale, said he thought that the answer might be found in the rise to power of a new generation of Japanese bureaucrats, who now argue that after decades of leaning toward America, the time has come for Japan to lean back toward the rest of Asia.
"This is a new group, and finally they have risen to the senior posts," Mr. Mondale said the other day in his office at the American Embassy.
But the bureaucrats themselves say the crucial change is that they are no longer prepared to follow the lead of their predecessors, who usually gave in to Washington's pressure as the price for America's guarantee of Japan's security.
"That linkage has become less convincing to Japanese politicians and the public, and that has a lot to do with the new assertiveness," said Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior official of the Finance Ministry who will soon take charge of its main international portfolio. "The old formula doesn't work; the foreign ministries no longer say the alliance has to take precedence at any cost."
Another crucial change reflects not so much geopolitics as simple economics: The country's hard fall to earth in recent years -- and the prospect of a double-dip recession -- has left it with no room to manuever.
In the past, auto makers have been able to agree to "voluntary plans" to buy more American-made car parts secure in the knowledge that their own suppliers could absorb the loss of business.
That is no longer the case in a country suddenly worried that its lifetime employment system is fraying. By saying no, Mr. Hashimoto can make the case that he is saving jobs in Osaka and Nagoya, just as Mr. Clinton is making the case that he is creating jobs in Detroit and Cleveland.
Breaking the impasse will not be easy. In Tokyo, the Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, is considered incapable of striking a deal with President Clinton when they meet next week in Canada. Asked how Mr. Murayama views the automotive trade issue, one of the country's top economic officials responded the other day with a question of his own: "What difference does it make?"
But Mr. Murayama's weakness may have been misinterpreted in Washington as a sign that the Japanese would quickly fold. Soon after the luxury-car sanctions were imposed, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the National Economic Council, told a group of reporters that "what makes this trade disagreement different is that this time the Japanese are divided, and we are unified."
That proved wrong. In fact, the vacuum of leadership has prevented airing of the usual divisions over trade policy and left the Japanese bureaucracy to press its case that yielding to the United States on targets for the car market would only increase Washington's appetite for similar standards in other markets.
Lurking behind all this is the approaching anniversary of the end of World War II, an event that has stirred a great debate over how Japan should apologize for what many right-wingers insist was nothing more than a "war of liberation" for Asia against the West.
"This is not the moment to be seen giving in to the victors in the war," one of Mr. Hashimoto's political advisers said last week. "That is why this could take a long time."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the trade confrontation between Japan and the United States referred incorrectly to a statement by Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, about Japanese bureaucrats. Mr. Mondale said in an interview that one reason for Japan's increased resistance to American calls for open markets was the rise to power of a new generation of bureaucrats, who had chafed for decades as their superiors gave in to Washington on one trade dispute after another. He did not attribute the new bureaucrats' attitude to a growing movement in Japan to lean toward Asia instead of the United States.

HEADLINE: Clinton Embraces a Proposal To Cut Immigration by a Third

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
The White House today welcomed a Federal advisory panel's recommendation to cut legal immigration by one-third. But the proposals met fierce opposition from Hispanic, Asian-American, Roman Catholic and Jewish groups, as well as from the National Association of Manufacturers.
Barbara Jordan, chairwoman of the panel, the Commission on Immigration Reform, delivered the plan to President Clinton, and he congratulated the panel. "Consistent with my own views, the commission's recommendations are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization," he said. 
 Mr. Clinton said the panel had "laid out a road map for Congress to consider." His press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said that "the President indicated to Barbara Jordan today that he will support such reductions," which would represent the biggest change in immigration policy in more than 40 years.
In addition, Mr. Clinton said the proposal "appears to reflect a balanced immigration policy that makes the most of our diversity while protecting the American work force so that we can better compete in the emerging global economy."
The President's statement places him in the middle of an explosive political debate, at odds with many of his usual supporters, but sympathetic to the concerns of people who want to restrict immigration. Many Republicans, like Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, want to reduce legal immigration. Others see immigration as an engine of economic growth.
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is the House majority leader, said: "The commission fails to tell us why we should so dramatically reduce legal immigration. It is long on recommendations, but short on analysis." He said the proposals were "a misguided attempt to make legal immigrants the scapegoats for America's problems."
The panel said that Congress should initially reduce legal immigration to 700,000 a year and ultimately to 550,000 from the current level of about 830,000. As a corollary, it said Congress should speed up the admission of spouses and young children of legal aliens.
At the same time, the panel said Congress should eliminate visa preferences for siblings and adult children of United States citizens. It would lower the limit on employment-related immigration to 100,000 a year from 140,000, and would eliminate the annual allotment of 10,000 visas for unskilled workers.
The panel also recommended reducing the number of refugees to 50,000 a year, down from the more than 100,000 admitted in each of the past five years.
The proposals drew criticism from a wide range of business, ethnic and religious groups.
Phyllis H. Eisen, a policy analyst at the National Association of Manufacturers, said: "We are distressed at the proposed cutback in legal immigration. It's shortsighted. We got an increase in business visas in 1990 for good reasons. Most manufacturing companies are deeply involved in global markets. They need to seek out talent globally. The scientists and technical experts they bring to the United States create jobs. There is no displacement of American workers."
Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic group, said: "The recommendations are stunningly radical. They're irresponsible. The whole point of establishing the commission was to take the discussion of immigration out of politics. Instead, the commission chose to jump on a political bandwagon."
Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, a civil rights group, said: "We are outraged. This is an attack on the Asian community. There are a million Asians whose families have filed applications for them to immigrate in categories that would be eliminated by the commission -- brothers and sisters and adult children of U.S. citizens."
Maynard I. Wishner, president of the Council of Jewish Federations, an umbrella group for Jewish charities, said that if Congress agreed to cut refugee admissions, the United States would be "turning its back on its moral commitments and its history."

Big Powers Plan a World Economic Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
The United States and its major economic partners plan next week to urge the creation of a worldwide emergency fund intended to bail out countries that find themselves, as Mexico did early this year, on the verge of national bankruptcy.
The fund's creation is described in a draft copy of the communique for next week's meeting of top leaders of seven of the world's largest industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
 The text was released prematurely by an opposition member of the Canadian Parliament, who has denounced the annual meeting of presidents and prime ministers of the Group of Seven as an empty and enormously expensive ritual.
The disclosure of the proposed communique is causing anxiety among American and other officials, who have gone to great lengths at previous summit meetings to keep the final document secret until the end of the talks.
But the plan itself is no surprise. For months, the Clinton Administration has pressed for an overhaul of major international financial institutions -- primarily the International Monetary Fund, but also the World Bank and economic institutions linked to the United Nations -- so that the United States would not foot the bill alone the next time a Mexican-style crisis erupts.
Early this year, the Administration acted on its own authority, offering Mexico $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees, after Congress proved reluctant to act on a special request for funds to rescue Mexico from its severe financial crisis set off by the devaluation of the peso.
The bailout of Mexico, though it seems largely successful so far, has scarred the Clinton White House. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has repeatedly declared his determination to prevent the United States from being thrust into similar situations in the future.
"The United States cannot be the lender of last resort to the world," Mr. Rubin said as recently as Tuesday. "The multilateral institutions need the capacity to deal with such crises."
The proposed communique, which is subject to change before the meeting begins on June 15, calls for the development of "an improved early warning system" that would include requirements that nations disclose to the financial markets a vast amount of information many of them now keep secret or release much later. Such information includes the level of foreign-exchange reserves and other data that Mexico hid from the markets before it devalued the peso on Dec. 20.
That information was available to Clinton Administration officials, who privately warned Mexican officials last year that their economy was headed off a cliff.
The proposed Halifax communique also calls on the International Monetary Fund to reverse its current policy and "establish a procedure for the regular public identification of countries which comply" with the publication of such economic data. That step would place enormous market pressure on countries that fail to reveal their financial condition.
It also declares that the fund, which itself contributed more than $17 billion to Mexico, should tighten its surveillance and "insist on full and timely reporting by member countries of a standard set of data" and "deliver franker messages to countries that appear to be avoiding necessary actions." The I.M.F. has been accused of failing to send such messages to Mexico, becoming a silent partner in its brush with financial disaster.
Officials from several countries said the proposed communique was simply a first step in what is bound to be a long international debate on how to prevent another situation like the Mexican peso crisis, and how to pay for it should attempts at prevention fail.
"This is all still very developmental," said a British official who has worked closely on the issue. "Many of the details are still vague."
In fact, the communique says little about where the money would come from for the new Emergency Financing Mechanism, which would essentially be available for a quick response in case an I.M.F. member was unable to pay its debts. It calls for a doubling in size of the General Agreement to Borrow, a $29 billion line of credit financed by 11 major industrial nations and Saudi Arabia.
In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Rubin was more specific, saying much of the money should come from "the newly prosperous nations of Asia." But those countries have so far expressed almost no enthusiasm for bailing out countries that get into trouble.
American and European officials have for months debated a basic question about the proposed bailout fund: Would it make the effort to persuade countries to act responsibly easier or harder?
Clearly the fund would reassure investors, reducing the chance that a nation would feel compelled to threaten that it might have to stop paying off its bondholders. But in one of the perversities of economic incentives, some economists fear that it could also encourage countries to spend with abandon, secure in the knowledge that they are backed by a lender of last resort within the International Monetary Fund.
Economists refer to that as a "moral hazard," and Mr. Rubin has said it can only be avoided by making any bailout a painful experience, as it has certainly been for Mexico and its people, who are now experiencing much higher prices and interest rates only partly offset by limited pay increases.
All these issues are expected to be debated by the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain and France -- when they meet in Halifax. The hard preparatory work is being done by their finance ministries, and the top leaders may well focus on other issues, from Bosnia to the confrontation between Japan and the United States over auto trade.
Other sections of the proposed communique call for consolidating and streamlining the United Nations, though bracketed language in the proposal indicates there is still considerable debate over how to trim the United Nations organization. Tentative wording declares that the system of assessment "should be reformed to bring it closer to member states' actual capacity to pay."
Canadian officials say they hope to move the summit meeting back to its roots, when leaders talked more informally, when pomp and circumstance was at a minimum, and when at least some real decisions were made at the sessions.
They have not convinced Nelson Riis, the legislator from the New Democratic Party who released the draft, dated May 27. Drafts, which go through several revisions, are prepared in advance to narrow the issues to be presented to the leaders.
Mr. Riis obtained a copy of the draft -- he declined to say how -- and released it to reinforce his point that most major decisions at such summits were "pre-cooked."
While there was nothing surprising in the document, the action chagrined American officials. Still, some diplomats suggested privately that Mr. Riis had a point.
"Now tell me," a Western envoy said this afternoon. "Can you remember last year's communique?"

Securities Take Drop On Comments By Greenspan

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned sour yesterday, as the market reacted to statements by Arthur Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that suggested the Fed was likely to stand pat on interest rates rather than cut them in the near future.
Traders said the market weakened significantly in the afternoon after the Market News wire service said that Mr. Greenspan, at a conference of bankers in Seattle, had indicated that he was not overly concerned about the recent slowdown in economic growth. The report lowered investors' expectations that the Fed would cut short-term rates anytime soon. 
 Earlier in the day, trading was in a narrow range, as many people seemed content to wait for the Government's report on producer prices for May, which will be released tomorrow morning.
"If the Fed is not going" to cut rates, one trader said, "than the two-year is too expensive," adding that he had been told to start selling intermediate notes as quickly as possible.
In earlier trading the long bond had been up about a half a point, on rumors that China's central bank had bought up to $1 billion in bonds.
While traders said the mood was still bullish within the Treasury market, market participants are tracking corporate bond issuance that would compete for investor money.
The 30-year bond fell by 25/32 , to a price of 11329/32 for a yield of 6.55 percent, up from 6.50 percent on Tuesday, with a five-year note down 20/32 to yield 5.98 percent, up from 5.84 percent.
Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, said it was the much larger accounts that were participating in the trading yesterday.
And he confirmed it was the report about Mr. Greenspan that caused the market to react negatively. "In fact," Mr. Ake said, "there were various versions of the story circulating, all with different spins. The one that they seemed to believe is that Mr. Greenspan feels the economy is more in a minor inventory correction, that will be worked off eventually and that it would not require the Fed to ease anytime soon."
In the municipal bond market yesterday, prices were little changed as some California issuers were pleasantly surprised by the demand for notes. There had been some concern that the Orange County bankruptcy might force other California issuers to pay higher borrowing costs.
California municipalities and agencies are expected to bring about $1.4 billion in notes this week, including the day's biggest debt sale, by the Los Angeles Unified School District of Los Angeles County, which priced $300 million of tax and revenue anticipation notes through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company. The notes, which are sold to raise cash in order for municipal government's operations to continue uninterrupted, have a maturity date of July 3, 1996.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Enthralled by President's 'Private' U.S. Trip

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, June 7

 BODY:
For the record, the President of Taiwan says his trip to an alumni reunion at Cornell University is strictly a private affair.
The White House, which granted President Lee Teng-hui a visa to attend the gathering, wishes the world would ignore it. 
 But the visit, the first to the United States by a Taiwan leader since the United States severed relations with Taiwan in 1979, is being hailed here as the "journey of the century" and a diplomatic triumph.
For Taiwan, the voyage is festooned with the trappings of a state visit. More than 300 newspaper, radio and television reporters have descended on the United States to chronicle every minute of Mr. Lee's trip, to broadcast every public word he utters, and glean meaning from every private conversation overheard.
This afternoon, all three Government-controlled television stations carried Mr. Lee's departure ceremony, complete with red carpets, a receiving line of the country's senior ministers, a military honor guard, and lingering pictures of Mr. Lee's chartered Boeing 747 roaring off the runway en route to Los Angeles, where it landed later today to another large press reception.
For 16 years, Taiwan's leaders had not been allowed to so much as step off an airplane in the Honolulu airport for fear that such a step would antagonize the Government of China and violate the official American policy that there is only one China.
On Friday, Mr. Lee is to address alumni at Cornell, where he received a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1968.
"We hope this is a watershed," said Jason C. Hu, the Government's chief spokesman, who traveled with the president to Los Angeles today. "We hope from now on people we see us as what we are."
"This is significant in the sense that we can be seen and heard and not isolated," he said, in an interview before his departure. "We want Peking to understand that we have done nothing with the purpose of irritating anyone."
Because the United States does not recognize the Taiwan Government, Clinton Administration officials have refused to meet Taiwan's president. However, Taiwan officials have said that Mr. Lee expects several members of Congress to come to Ithaca.
Yet despite the cold shoulder the Administration is showing Mr. Lee, Beijing, which regards this island as a renegade province, has reacted with fury to his trip, declaring that Chinese-American relations would suffer as a result.
Since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations in October 1971, the country has fallen into a diplomatic black hole, an oblivion that many thought complete when the United States severed relations in 1979 and granted full diplomatic recognition to the Chinese Government in Beijing.
But Taiwan prospered. Its economy has expanded dramatically, catapulting the country's per capita gross national product from $443 in 1971, the year it was thrown out of the United Nations, to $12,640 today. And after decades of martial law, the country has now embraced democratic politics with a boisterousness rivaled by few Asian nations.
In the last several years Taiwan has trumpeted its economic achievements and democratic credentials as it has sought wider international recognition. Last year, President Lee visited several countries in southeast Asia where he happened to find himself on golf courses with those countries leaders. "Vacation diplomacy," it was called. And earlier this year, Mr. Lee visited Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
But the centerpiece of Taiwan's diplomatic offensive has been the struggle to send Mr. Lee to the United States. For its part, the Clinton Administration had resisted appeals by Taiwan to allow Mr. Lee to visit the United States.
Last year, when Mr. Lee's plane stopped in Hawaii for refueling on a trip to Latin America, the Administration refused to allow him to rest there overnight. Humiliated by his treatment, Mr. Lee refused even to leave the plane. Then last month, only after nearly unanimous votes in the Senate and the House of Representatives expressing support for Mr. Lee's visa application, did Mr. Clinton bow to a rising tide of sentiment and permit Mr. Lee's current visit despite the reported opposition of the State Department, which argued against jeopardizing relations with China.
In Beijing, the trip has been denounced repeatedly. Several official delegations to the United States have been canceled and talks with the United States over controlling the spread of missile technology postponed. Yesterday, a spokesman for the Chinese Government suggested that it would take more steps to express its anger over the trip.
Even as he flew into the political and diplomatic typhoon, there seemed to be unanimity here that President Lee's arrival in the United States would mark a decisive turn in this country's effort to break out from decades of diplomatic isolation.
One of Mr. Lee's bitterest political enemies, Shih Ming-teh, the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, who spent more than 25 years in prison for his opposition to Mr. Lee's ruling Nationalist Party, hailed the trip. "Basically we support the Lee Teng-hui visit," said Mr. Shih in an interview in his office. "I believe there actually is room for the development of better relations between Taiwan and the United States."
The State Department has been vigorously pressing Taiwan to keep Mr. Lee's profile in the United States as low as possible, according to Taiwan officials.
Indeed, Mr. Lee turned down all requests for interviews before his departure, a decision prompted by pressure from the State Department, according to Taiwan officials. And this evening, local news reports announced that a news conference Mr. Lee had been planning on Friday at Cornell had also been canceled under American pressure.

HEADLINE: Republicans Battle Party on Arts Funds

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
A majority of New York's Republican delegation to Congress is breaking with its party for the first time to support Federal funds for a favorite conservative target, the National Endowment for the Arts.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called the N.E.A. "arts patronage for an elite group," and Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, describes it as "an affront to the American taxpayer." Elimination of the endowment is high on the national Republican Party's agenda. In fact, the endowment is threatened with extinction in a House bill and major restructuring in the Senate. 
 But whether the New Yorkers are protecting homegrown pork, as some N.E.A. critics suggest, or rising above partisan politics in the interest of protecting the culture they say is synonymous with New York, most of the state's Republican lawmakers are joining Democrats to support continued financing for the endowment.
The National Endowment for the Arts gave New York artists and institutions $30 million last year -- almost 20 percent of its entire $167 million budget and more than twice the amount any other state received. That money in turn attracted substantial funds from private foundations and corporations that look to the national endowment for guidance -- about $11 for every $1 the N.E.A. handed out, arts groups said.
And even some of the most conservative New York members of Congress say they cannot back legislation that would deal a major blow not only to New York's economy but also to its stature as a cultural center.
"Most Republicans in New York support funding for the arts, for obvious reasons," said Representative Amo Houghton, a Republican from Corning. Nine New York Republicans in Congress favor at least some Federal financing for the N.E.A., while five want to phase out the endowment. One delegation member is undecided.
"We've got to find some way of preserving it, and it's mindless for people to say it could be funded privately," Mr. Houghton said. "This is not just fluffy art; this is the whole concept of making life more meaningful and raising our standards, and it is the Government's responsibility.
One New York Republican who strenuously disagrees is Susan Molinari of Staten Island, a self-described moderate and the only House Republican from New York City. Ms. Molinari said the national endowment should be phased out because the Government simply cannot afford to provide funds for the arts. But she added that she was particularly opposed to endowment grants to individual artists.
"Grown-ups should not have to have the Government subsidize their employment," she said.
However, a spokesman for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Harvey Valentine, said the Republican Senator enthusiastically supports the arts and would fight for New York's fair share of arts funds.
The support of most New York Republicans comes as something of a surprise to Democrats like Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, who said: "These people are showing a lot of courage, putting New York ahead of Newt. It's certainly the first time a majority have done that, and it does surprise me. But it's only going to be saved in a bipartisan way."
And it now seems that the Republicans working to broker a compromise may be best positioned to make continued financing palatable to the majority in Congress.
"You have to be practical and take into account the concerns of people who feel the agency has been used politically," said Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island. "We may have to redefine how we fund -- or just fund performing arts," or find another way to make arts financing less objectionable to critics.
Mr. Lazio said it was not yet clear whether the House Rules Committee would allow a vote on an amendment to restore funds for the N.E.A. But like other New York Republicans who support the endowment, he said the N.E.A. had not always acted in its own best interest. "There's some sense of the N.E.A. being out of touch with Middle America," he said.
A spokeswoman for the national endowment, Cherie Simon, contended that the N.E.A. has worked hard to be more accountable to the public and its critics since a series of public-relations disasters in the 1980's, when works like Andres Serrano's urine-soaked crucifix were included in shows paid for by the endowment.
But most of several dozen N.E.A.-financed artists who were interviewed were dismissive of proposals to offer grants only with more strings attached.
When asked what he would say to those who would ask why the Government should pay for his jazz piano lessons, Nicholas Balaban of Manhattan said: "I don't know what I would say because I don't think people who would ask that question would want an answer."
Republican supporters of the N.E.A. insist that artists and institutions must become more realistic about the changes that may be required to calm opponents and salvage financing.
"You give up a certain amount of artistic freedom when you go for taxpayer support," said Representative Michael P. Forbes of Long Island, a stalwart Gingrich conservative who says he favors continued N.E.A. funds, though at reduced levels. "There is a trade-off, and the artist has to know that."
Mr. Forbes said he was nonetheless disturbed by those who oppose the endowment because they feel the money goes to left-leaning artists.
"I'm troubled by some people who get money, too, but I'm even more troubled by us trying to reward and punish people" for the politics of their art, he said. "That's not the way we should be making decisions."
A compromise will be tricky, Republican supporters say, because critics of the endowment fall into three rather distinct categories: those who believe government has no responsibility for financing the arts, those who believe the Government has been used to promote a liberal agenda, and those who say the arts are just not a priority for funds at a time when Congress is struggling to balance the budget.
Many artists believe individual grants are particularly vulnerable.
"I don't think I'll be getting another one of these for quite a while," said David P. Lopato, who now has his fourth N.E.A. grant, for $6,500, to compose "prepared piano" pieces, inserting bolts between strings of his Steinway to alter the sound of the music. "So, thank God for karaoke," said Mr. Lopato, who makes his living transcribing pop music.
Fears about funds for the future have caused schisms within the arts community. Although arts groups support one another in general terms, the prospect of deep cuts has created strong differences about which most deserve public funds.
Mr. Lopato, for example, said it was much more important to grant funds to individual artists like himself, whose work is avant-garde, than large institutions that can more easily raise money.
"I think the N.E.A.'s purpose is to fund art that's not necessarily commercially viable," he said.
Others feel that programs that preserve culture are most vital.
"All of the folk-art programs are about preserving culture, not avant-garde culture but traditional fiddlers and cloggers," said Steve Zeitlin, executive director of City Lore, a New York agency that develops folklore projects. On a recent morning, the group used N.E.A. funds to pay $300 to a professional storyteller, Roslyn Bresnick-Perry, to tell traditional Jewish stories to kindergartners at Public School 106 in Queens.
Then there are those who say major institutions need public funds just as badly. "The N.E.A. allows us the opportunity to present the best there is to some people who would ordinarily not have the chance to see it," said Chuck Davis, artistic director of DanceAfrica, which through an N.E.A. grant to the Brooklyn Academy of Music performed and offered African dance lessons there.
New York Republicans are not the only lawmakers in their party to support funds for the arts.
But supporters from both major parties in both houses of Congress say they face an uphill battle -- in no small measure because New York, a symbol of liberalism as well as culture, has the most to lose.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Turning the Baby Bells loose on the long-distance market.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SURE, you can get 40 percent off on calls to second cousins after midnight, and even a free diagnosis of why your fax never made it to Boise. But does that prove that the long-distance telephone business is truly competitive?
The question of whether the half-regulated world of long-distance communications can successfully mimic a free market has fascinated economists since AT&T was chopped into seven regional monopolies and one long-distance carrier in 1984. But it has taken on new urgency because the regional Bell operating companies are fighting to get into long-distance service, arguing that the market needs more big players if consumers are to enjoy the full fruits of deregulation. And Congress seems increasingly inclined to go along. 
 It is only common sense that the long-distance phone market is competitive. After all, discount offers abound, television is swamped with advertising and each year one in five customers switches companies in search of a better deal. But William Taylor, an economist at National Economic Research Associates and a consultant to the Baby Bells, thinks that in this case common sense is overrated.
For one thing, he notes, advertising often serves less to inform than to create brand-name identity -- and thereby raise barriers to new entry into the business. The churning of customers for what is essentially a commodity, he argues, only reinforces the case that the phone companies are using marketing lures other than high-quality service at rock-bottom prices.
Most important, Mr. Taylor charges, consumers have yet to reap the benefits of competition where it counts. Declining prices for long-distance calls largely reflect the decline in regulated fees collected by regional phone companies to provide access to local phone networks. His solution? "Let the seven puppies off their leashes," Mr. Taylor says.
But many other economists are unconvinced. It is true that basic rates have not fallen after accounting for the decline in access charges, Peter Pitsch, a former head of the Federal Communications Commission's Office of Plans and Policy, acknowledges. However, the only people who pay those undiscounted rates, he notes, are low-volume callers who were implicitly subsidized by high-volume customers under regulation. And there is nothing inconsistent between competition and higher rates, Mr. Pitsch argues, as long as those rates reflect costs.
It is hard to track the overall price trend because high-volume users never pay retail. Probably the most careful attempt, though, was made by Robert Hall, an economist at the Hoover Institution and a consultant to MCI Communications. He estimates that the average cost per minute of long-distance service, net of local access charges, fell by roughly a third from 1985 to 1993. John Haring, an economist with Strategic Policy Research in Bethesda, Md., and a former staff member at the F.C.C. who has interviewed dozens of corporate users, confirms that "the high end is very competitive."
This should not be surprising, Mr. Pitsch suggests, given the level of excess capacity in the industry and the ease of expansion. He estimates that AT&T's two rivals could absorb 15 percent of AT&T's volume overnight and could "serve all of AT&T's market within two years." By the same token, he argues that the competitiveness of the market is reflected in AT&T's decision to accelerate the replacement of inferior-quality, microwave-based service with fiber optic cable to match the offerings of Sprint and MCI.
If one is left with the impression that the long-distance market is already competitive, that is probably as it should be. For while there are virtually no disinterested voices in this debate -- everybody works for one side or the other -- there are few objective signs of monopoly power.
On the other hand if you turn the question around, asking whether more big players would harm consumers, the case for the Baby Bells looks stronger.
The worry is that the Bells would sell long-distance service below cost to gain market share and recoup their losses by overcharging local customers who do not have a choice. Indeed, it was just this logic that led the Justice Department to conclude that AT&T would have to divest itself of its local service in order to make long-distance competition viable.
But that was before the natural monopoly of local phone companies had been eroded by small carriers offering special deals to big business and -- more important -- before the threat of competition from cable television and wireless systems. The real issue today, one analyst who preferred to remain anonymous suggested, is whether Washington can use its leverage to speed competition in local phone service in setting ground rules for the Baby Bells' entry into long-distance.

HEADLINE: Denver Mayor Is Re-elected After a Runoff

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 7

 BODY:
Mayor Wellington Webb won a second term on Tuesday and promised to mend the wounds from a bitter runoff campaign.
"Now what we want to do is bind the city together," Mayor Webb told hundreds of supporters at a victory celebration on Tuesday night. "There's no north, south, east or west. There's just one city -- Denver." 
 With all 430 precincts reporting, Mr. Webb had 66,884 votes, or 54 percent, and Councilwoman Mary DeGroot had 56,725 votes, or 46 percent, according to the Denver Election Commission.
Mr. Webb had finished 97 votes behind Ms. DeGroot in the May 2 general election, forcing a runoff.
Mr. Webb, 54, campaigned for 36 hours straight before the runoff, shaking hands in front yards and restaurants and greeting motorists on street corners. Ms. DeGroot, 43, also ran hard in the final hours of her effort to become the first woman to run this city of 493,000.
Mr. Webb, Denver's first black mayor, carried all parts of the city except the majority-white southeast, Ms. DeGroot's stronghold. He won 40 percent of the vote there.
Conceding defeat, Ms. DeGroot told supporters she had been beaten by "a formidable political machine." She congratulated Mr. Webb, but urged him to heed the criticism she leveled at him during their divisive five-week struggle.
"I take it at his word that he has learned from his mistakes and we will see change over the next four years," she said. "We are united by our love for Denver, so do well and make us proud."
Ms. DeGroot had accused the Webb administration of practicing cronyism and political favoritism by hiring relatives and supporters for city positions and contracts.
Both major Denver daily newspapers endorsed Ms. DeGroot, citing the cronyism accusations and Mr. Webb's management of construction at Denver International Airport, which opened 16 months behind schedule.
Ms. DeGroot pledged to abolish the city's affirmative action program, and said she would base Denver's minority contracting program on economic need. Mr. Webb favored reforming the contracting program, but did not say how he would address criticism that the program amounted to reverse discrimination.

HEADLINE: Why Is This Surgeon Suing?

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND 

 BODY:
Jack Singer, an ophthalmic surgeon in Vermont, removes cataracts about 250 times a year. It hardly seems the sort of work that turns someone into an industrial pirate. But because he specializes in an incision that eliminates the need for stitches, Dr. Singer has found himself at the center of a remarkable controversy.
Dr. Samuel Pallin, an Arizona ophthalmic surgeon, says he owns the procedure for stitchless cataract surgery. Patent in hand, he has declared that Dr. Singer and any other surgeon brandishing a knife the same way must pay him a royalty. Other ophthalmic surgeons like Dr. Singer, however, argue that Dr. Pallin was not the pioneer of the technique, just the first one to think of patenting it. 
 Dr. Pallin is hardly a maverick. Many entrepreneurial doctors are now winning patents on commonly used methods of practicing medicine -- particular techniques for collecting blood, combining drugs to treat cancer, using eye drops to diagnose disease, intravenous infusion, even the use of ultrasound imaging to determine whether an unborn baby is a boy or a girl.
Patents for pure medical and surgical methods were virtually unheard of two decades ago, and were rare in the 1980's. Now several are issued every week, though no official count exists. While the American Medical Association says it knows of no case in which one doctor has paid another royalties for use of a technique, doctors with patents increasingly say they will seek such fees aggressively.
The idea seems as hard for many doctors to grasp as the notion that a painter can own the way he holds his brush or a golfer the way he grasps his club. "How can anyone claim to own the way one turns one's knife when performing surgery?" asked Dr. John Glasson, chairman of the American Medical Association's Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs.
"This just isn't done in medicine and surgery," Dr. Singer said. "For a surgeon to claim a freely exchanged method as his own property is wrong."
Leaders of the medical community are scrambling to stamp out a trend they think threatens innovation -- and a doctor's freedom to offer patients the best care. The American Medical Association has prepared a report for its June 18-22 convention that condemns the patents. Last winter it asked Congress to make them illegal, and legislation has since been proposed to that end.
"The intentional withholding of new skills and techniques for reasons of personal gain, which would happen with patents, is detrimental to society and is to be condemned," Dr. Glasson said. He said his A.M.A. council had decided patents on medical methods violated the Hippocratic oath as well as A.M.A. guiding ethics that say "a physician shall continue to study, apply and advance scientific knowledge, and make relevant information available to patients, colleagues and the public."
The A.M.A. council fears that patents will restrict access to treatments, obstruct peer review of new therapies, add to the cost of health care and be impossible to enforce.
"We believe doctors have enough incentive through contributing to the care of disease," Dr. Glasson added, "and get enough indirect financial reward by getting to perform procedures and having patients referred to them if they are successful."
But doctors seeking the patents argue that they have just as much right to them as engineers, chemists or computer developers, who often receive patents (and royalties) for methods or processes.
Indeed, even within the field of medicine, patents and royalties are commonplace. Dr. Peter Wilk, a Manhattan surgeon with 140 patents, mostly for devices, noted that for decades medical techniques have been patented as the directions for using a device or machine that was being patented at the same time. No one in the medical community complained about those patents so long as they were integral to a device.
Therefore, Dr. Pallin asked, "How can the A.M.A. rationally take the position that a pure method patent is unethical, while a combined method and device patent is not?"
"People say doctors with an economic interest are trying to exploit an altruistic calling, somehow making money out of what should be community property," said Dr. R. Arnold Smith, an oncologist in Mississippi with three patents for combining drugs and vitamin C to treat cancer. "But that's a socialist concept. That's not the general policy of the rest of the country, so why apply it to medicine? Vested interests like property rights are what spur progress."
Dr. Pallin argued: "The Hippocratic oath says nothing about intellectual property. It does say a doctor shall not participate in abortion, or be paid for passing on teachings to other doctors. But as we know, doctors are paid to do abortions, and to teach in medical schools."
Entrepreneurial doctors blame the medical establishment for forcing them to turn to patents because medical journals and specialty societies have rejected their efforts to publish sometimes controversial work. They say patents turn innovative medical techniques or theories into a commodity that is more appealing not only to the physicians who receive the patents but also to research institutions or pharmaceutical and medical manufacturers that themselves hope to license the methods from the patent holders and profit from them. But as yet the A.M.A. has no record of such licensing agreements.
"Mine is a good example of the patent system at work," Dr. Wilk said. In April he received a patent for an untested method of heart bypass surgery that he said could cost a lot less than current methods. A large research institution saw his patent in a government gazette and wanted to examine his theory.
"We entered an agreement under which they would find out whether the method should be pursued as a potential replacement for coronary bypass surgery, which costs $5 billion a year," Dr. Wilk recalled. "They agreed to spend whatever it took, and assembled a team of specialists from heart institutes around the country."
"After several months of evaluation, they decided it probably doesn't work," he said. "But the idea was only explored because I thought of it, it was patented and protected, so this company felt they could expend themselves because if it proved successful they would be able to recoup their money and make a lot more."
Already, some doctors have sued the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices that are used in procedures the doctors patented on the ground that the drugs or tools encourage other doctors to infringe the patented methods. In the 1980's, a medical group that patented a penile injection method to treat impotence sued several makers of drugs used with the treatment, and an eye surgeon who patented a method of implanting interocular lenses sued several lens manufacturers. In both cases, the manufacturers balked at paying, but both patent holders ended up with settlements reported to range from $100,000 to several million dollars.
Dr. Pallin's suit appears to be the first to name another physician as an infringer. The lawsuit, filed two years ago, named Dr. Singer and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center where he works. Dr. Pallin holds the patent for a curved incision that begins and ends at the border of the iris and arcs through the white of the eye. The cut later seals itself like a trap door, forced shut by the outward pressure of fluid in the eye. In eliminating the need for stitches, this procedure reduces the threat of astigmatism, lowers the chance of infection and shortens recovery time.
Dr. Singer and many of his colleagues use such a technique. The surgery relies on the way each doctor aims the knife and creates the size and shape of the initial incision. In the past, such handling of a knife would have been called proficiency. But Dr. Pallin calls it property.
Dr. Pallin said he chose to sue Dr. Singer and his medical center partly out of anger, and partly because the clinic was a large health maintenance organization. "Dr. Singer has largely taken credit for my idea and I resent it," he said. "And the Hitchcock clinic is a billion-dollar organization that has the legal staff and resources to prepare and pursue this case."
After both sides turned down offers and counteroffers to settle the dispute, and after a Vermont judge rejected a motion from Dr. Singer and the medical center to dismiss the charges, the suit now seems headed for the courtroom.
Dr. Pallin wants to be paid for his invention, and even though he envisions a modest $5 royalty for each $1,000 procedure -- "it should be so nominal that it does not interfere with the ability to do the procedure," he said -- he stands to make a lot.
"The number of cataract surgeries in this country is about a million, and about half those use my technique," he said. "But the royalty wouldn't increase the cost of health care, as some say. Each suture costs me $17. If surgeons are not using sutures, even if they pay a $5 royalty, they're still saving $12."
As for the argument that enforcing such patents would be nearly impossible, Dr. Pallin said collecting royalties would not be difficult in an age of computerized records.
Still, Representative Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, thinks patents for pure methods will increase the cost of health care and limit access of patients and other doctors to new techniques. And he's so sure that medicine should not be treated as a business that he has co-sponsored a bill, now before the Judiciary Committee, to make pure medical methods patents illegal.
In the end, the debate may revolve around whose rights take precedence -- those who think they have a moral right to the free flow of medical knowledge, or those who think they have a constitutional right to patent their ideas.
"Section 8 says Congress shall 'promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries,' " said Dr. Pallin, reading from the Constitution in a college textbook. "I'd argue that 'science and art' is a classic definition of medical practice."

HEADLINE: Japan and Its Past

 BODY:
Fifty years after the end of World War II, Japan can still twist itself into contortions over whether to apologize for its conduct in the war. The latest debate has yielded a feeble parliamentary resolution acknowledging Japanese aggression and colonialism, but only in the context of other countries' offenses. Remorse or reflection about Japan's behavior is offered, depending on the translation, but no apology.
While the whole exercise may seem irrelevant, Japan's tortured reckoning with history is part of a larger internal debate over its role in the world today. Until Japan comes to terms with the destructive role it played in Asia's past, it cannot play the constructive role it should in Asia's future. 
 The historical issue is not colonialism, in which Japan had plenty of company. Nor is it military aggression alone. Imperial Japanese forces massacred millions of Chinese, conducted medical experiments on civilians and forced thousands of Korean and other women into sexual servitude to Japanese troops. This warrants more than vague regret.
Only a tiny percentage of the present populations of China, Korea and the colonized nations of Southeast Asia directly experienced Japanese atrocities. But Tokyo's refusal to apologize has fostered a potentially dangerous psychological breach between Japan and Asian neighbors.
Japan is Asia's richest, most technically advanced power. But it has played only a timid role in building the region's new trade and security systems. By contrast, Germany has played a major role in promoting European unity after accepting full responsibility for its past.
During the cold war, Japan was able to downplay relations with Asia and follow the foreign and security policy lead of the United States. That era is now over. With Tokyo and Washington growing apart over economics and China developing its military strength, Japan must play a more forthright role in the region. It can start by squarely facing up to its record in World War II.

HEADLINE: April Consumer Borrowing Up at 14.1% Rate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose at a 14.1 percent annual rate in April, the Federal Reserve reported today. While the gain was less than in March, it still exceeded analysts' expectations in the face of a slowing economy.
Consumer installment credit rose $11.039 billion for the month, the Fed said, the 29th consecutive monthly increase. Analysts had been looking for growth of $9.7 billion. The March increase was revised to $14.1 billion, or an 18.3 percent annual rate, up from $13.8 billion. 
 "The pace of credit growth is rivaling that of the mid-1980's," analysts at Smith Barney Inc. said in a research report.
And Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., said the growth "could be a sign of distress because people are paying off debt more slowly" as household finances weaken.
Speaking today at a monetary conference in Seattle, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the United States economy was experiencing a "pronounced" slowdown, which he said was desirable because it would keep inflation in check.
Analysts pay particular attention to the Fed's credit statistics because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of United States economic activity. But Mr. Stone said the number tended to be erratic on a month-to-month basis, and should be viewed cautiously.
The Fed said installment credit totaled $953.2 billion in April. By category, credit card use rose by $6.5 billion, auto lending increased by $2.5 billion and other types of installment loans climbed $2.1 billion. The consumer credit figures do not include home equity loans or home mortgages.
While consumer spending fueled the strongest economic growth in a decade last year, demand for loans has fallen after seven interest rate increases by the Fed since early last year.
Last week, for example, a Fed survey of bank loan officers showed consumer loan demand weakened in April and May though major banks are more willing to extend credit to households and businesses.
There are other signs of weakness. The economy lost 101,000 jobs in May, while Americans' incomes showed the smallest gain in five months during April, according to Government figures.
Nonetheless, various forces have been bolstering consumer borrowing. Credit card use has increased markedly in the 1990's as card issuers offer cash rebates and discounts, and supermarkets allow shoppers to use credit cards to buy groceries and other household goods.

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The American Booksellers Association's annual convention is supposedly a literary trade fair, but no one here was debating the merits of "The Unconsoled," Kazuo Ishiguro's first novel since "The Remains of the Day." In this great city for both politics and art, politics won out this time, as the country's two most prominent fantasy candidates for President, Colin Powell and Newt Gingrich, opened their unofficial, undeclared campaigns for higher office by promoting their hardcover wares.
Under the rules of this game, of course, none dared call it "campaigning." Mr. Powell and Mr. Gingrich were, instead, initiating "book tours." But call it what you will, the two literary lions will barnstorm the country for months to come, giving speeches and signing autographs and dominating local news until they butt into primary season. 
 In the kickoff here, Mr. Gingrich had to cope with the ghosts of an actual Chicago political convention, as hecklers tried to drown out his Monday address to booksellers. It turned out to be the Speaker's finest hour. Rather than sputter back in the Hubert Humphrey style of Chicago '68, a poised Mr. Gingrich passionately and articulately defended his and the protesters' right to free speech. A previously indifferent audience ended up giving him a semi-standing ovation.
But if there was a winner in this first head-to-head contest between non-candidates, it was Mr. Powell -- in terms of both numbers and substance.
Mr. Powell's book, "My American Journey," will have a larger first printing than Mr. Gingrich's "To Renew America," and Mr. Powell, albeit with the help of a ringer in the form of co-speaker Hillary Rodham Clinton, drew twice the audience that Mr. Gingrich did.
More important, it was Mr. Powell's words that proved memorable. Even while fighting the dismal acoustics of the hangar-like hall, he won rousing applause when he talked about how the country "cannot lose that spirit of compassion" manifested in "taking care of those citizens most in need."
Is Mr. Powell's political profile really so mysterious? He is known to be an economic and foreign policy conservative, but not so conservative that he would support Oliver North's Senate race. He has described parts of the Contract With America as "a little too hard, a little too harsh, a little too unkind," and himself as "a New Deal kid." His positions are inconsistent with either party's orthodoxy, but who isn't looking for a true independent?
The day before he spoke to the booksellers, Mr. Powell met with a few reporters, deflecting all questions about his political ambitions with a disarming wheeze of a laugh. The biggest surprise in writing his book, he said, was the amount of time he devoted to race. Recalling that he never lost hope as a boy in the South Bronx even in the days of segregation, he has no illusions that such hope exists in inner cities now. And as much as he endorsed "free-enterprise capitalism," he didn't seem to think it alone could save those being left behind. "I have something of a social conscience that puts me to the left of center," he said.
In other words, it's hard to imagine Mr. Powell either dismantling the New Deal, as the Contract Republicans would, or defending every last piece of it, as some Democrats do. Nor would he ignore the racial subtext of the debate. He received cheers here when he called for Americans to "solve this racial problem once and for all."
While Mr. Powell speaks of compassion for others, Mr. Gingrich talks mostly about himself. In a speech at a dinner thrown by his publisher, the Speaker mixed ideological boilerplate and partisan digs with repeated boasts of the number of House votes he has won since January (299) and the number of news organizations (131) covering his mischievous "non-political" trip to New Hampshire this weekend.
Contrast, too, Mr. Gingrich's scolding -- "If we don't turn this country around, it's going to collapse" -- with this vision from Mr. Powell: "We live in a great country -- with all its problems, with all its challenges, with all the noise we sometimes hear. . . . We live in a historic time of change and reconciliation, an exciting time to be alive, to be American and take advantage of it."
On which book tour would you make book?

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Magellan fund's manager bets on lower interest rates.

BYLINE: By Edward Wyatt 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in America's largest mutual fund might not know it, but they are betting that the Federal Reserve is about to ease interest rates -- and sharply.
In a speech two nights ago in New York, Jeffrey N. Vinik, manager of the $44 billion Fidelity Magellan fund, spoke at length about what is, for a mutual fund manager, a risky proposition -- the direction of interest rates. The Federal Reserve, Mr. Vinik predicted, will lower short-term rates "very soon and very rapidly over the next several months." 
 Specifically, Mr. Vinik forecast that the Fed could ease rates as many as "four times by the end of the year" in response to signs of a slowing economy.
The prediction holds significant implications for Magellan shareholders. All of Wall Street knows about the fund's huge bet on technology stocks, which account for more than 40 percent of Magellan's assets. The strategy has paid off so far this year, as Mr. Vinik has guided Magellan to a gain of more than 18 percent.
After technology, the fund's second-largest group of investments, at 25 percent of assets, is in cyclical stocks, including big-ticket industrial manufacturers like Caterpillar, Deere and Parker-Hannifin. Because the earnings of such companies typically fall as the economy slows, a move by the Federal Reserve to extend the economy's growth by lowering interest rates could greatly improve their prospects.
But there is also great risk in relying on lower rates to keep the prices of cyclical stocks moving up. While the Magellan fund's Gargantuan size gives Mr. Vinik an ability to make self-fulfilling prophecies that most mutual fund managers don't enjoy, his influence on Alan Greenspan and company is less of a certainty.
There is no better example of Mr. Vinik's ability to move markets than his bet on technology stocks, which have been on a several-year rally. In September 1992, three months after Mr. Vinik took over Magellan, only 7.8 percent of its $22 billion in assets were in technology stocks. As he has increased Magellan's stake, other mutual funds and institutional investors have followed his lead.
Those stocks have cooled off in the last two weeks, a downturn that Mr. Vinik says is simply the sector's traditional summer doldrums. "I think the best technology stocks could go up for 5 to 10 years," he said. "We're only two years into that bull market."
But the two big sector bets together leave the Magellan fund open to the possibility of a double whammy if, for example, the weakness in the dollar dissuades the Fed from raising rates, undermining his cyclical-stock argument, while at the same time the price of technology stocks cools further.
Mr. Vinik offered no apologies for his outlook, which he admits flies in the face of reason if the economy is indeed taking a breather. "How can you own cyclical stocks when the economy is slowing down?" he asked rhetorically during a speech to subscribers to Worth magazine, a financial monthly published by a unit of the FMR Corporation, parent of the Fidelity mutual funds.
He answered with his interest rate prediction. "As bullish as I am on technology stocks right now, I think the best opportunity in the U.S. stock market is in cyclicals," Mr. Vinik said. While companies like Caterpillar have reported huge earnings gains, "most people think this is the top of the cycle," he continued, adding, "I think we're going to have a pause and then they're going to take off again."
Mr. Vinik distinguishes between what he calls early-stage cyclicals -- industrial-equipment makers, automobile and auto parts companies, and home builders -- and late-stage cyclical companies, including retailers and makers of consumer staples, industries he says suffer from an excess of inventory.
As the latter companies begin to burn off that inventory, built up over the last year as the economy has grown, "prices for those commodities go down, and the stocks follow," he said. "The early cyclicals go against interest rates. When rates go down, the companies I own go up."
If he's wrong, of course, the Magellan fund could be in for a rough stretch.

HEADLINE: Increasing Shift Work Challenges Child Care

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
ANGELA ALSTON, a single parent, is constantly scrambling for someone to care for her two preschool daughters while she processes paperwork and inmates at a county jail in Winston-Salem, N.C. Hers is an unpredictable, ever-shifting schedule. Some days, she picks up the phone and calls in her sister, who's often busy with her own teen-ager. Some nights, she persuades a friend with two little ones of her own to let the Alston girls sleep over. When she's assigned to the day shift, Miss Alston uses a local day-care center that, like most others, is designed for parents who work from 9 to 5.
No one is happy with the arrangement, least of all her children. "My oldest daughter is having some behavioral problems," Miss Alston said. "She throws tantrums and tears up stuff. And tonight the baby threw a fit." The family agony makes her job look less and less desirable. "I've considered quitting several times, but it's not a practical thing to do," she said. "You get pushed up against a wall sometimes." 
 Her predicament is shared by millions of other Americans -- be they assembly-line workers or 911 operators, production managers or air-traffic controllers, from Boston to San Francisco -- who find themselves working long, nonstandard or erratic hours and having to hunt for child care to match.
A study released last month by the Federal Department of Labor reported that nearly one in five full-time workers, or about 14.3 million people, worked nonstandard hours in 1991, and that more than 1,000 different work schedules are in use in what is increasingly a 24-hour national economy. And those numbers have probably grown since then, as more companies emphasize global operations that require people working around the clock.
"We are facing that here, not only with manufacturers, but also with law firms and banks who have clerical people coming in at all hours of the night," said Donna Lambeth, the executive director of the Work/Family Resource Center in Winston-Salem.
Child care, however, has not kept up with the changes. In New York City, as in most of the nation, day-care centers keep hours that correspond to standard working hours, despite the fact that workers have a wide variety of schedules and often have long commutes as well, said Nancy Kolben, the director of Child Care Inc., a large referral agency in Manhattan. "We've found the most difficult thing is finding care on the weekends," she said.
Some parents are able to use the few child-care centers that operate 24 hours a day; others enlist relatives to help, or track down family day care with extended hours, in which people use their own homes to care for small groups of children. And many parents work opposite shifts, sacrificing time together so that one of them can oversee their children for at least part of the day.
Employers do help sometimes, either with subsidies or with on-site child-care centers. But most often parents have to search on their own for child care, sometimes after being transferred to a strange city where they have few connections. The Federal study, titled "Care Around the Clock," was prompted by reports of workers at a food-processing plant in Idaho leaving sleeping children in cars at the plant's parking lot, said Karen Nussbaum, the director of the Women's Bureau, a division of the Labor Department that focuses on working women's issues and that prepared the study.
"I was so horrified and said we needed to do something about this," she said. "We expect women and men to be at work, and yet we've made no provision for their children. We wouldn't expect families to build their own roads to get to work, or pave their own parking lots, and the infrastructure for child care is just as important."
According to the study, 60 percent of women with children under 6 and 76 percent of women with school-age children are in the work force, and in 1990 -- the most recent year for which statistics are available -- 7.2 million of them with 11.7 million children under 15 worked nonstandard hours.
The bureau is holding formal discussionson the need for odd-hour care in half a dozen cities across the country; the next are scheduled in Kansas City, Mo.; Portland, Ore., and Cleveland on June 12 and 14, with Boston and Rochester on June 28 and 29. Various Cabinet members, as well as Hillary Rodham Clinton, are expected to attend.
Some experts think businesses should take the lead. "If employers are interested in 24-hour schedules, they will have to think about providing care themselves," said Sandra L. Hofferth, an adjunct professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, who has found that parents earning the least amount of money tend to work more weekends and rotating schedules -- like a week of day shifts, followed by a week of nights.
Among the mothers on the predawn shift is Merry Crawford of Caldwell, Idaho, who is an accountant with a big slaughterhouse in Boise, 45 minutes away by car. She has to be at work by 3:30 or 4:30 A.M. most days. Her husband, Vince, works from 4 P.M. to 4 A.M., running a cleaning company. Their son, Andy, 10, goes to school, plays baseball and wants to be able to do all the other things children his age like to do.
To help make all this possible, the Crawfords rely on a day-care provider -- Sherry Summers, Mrs. Crawford's sister-in-law, who has five children and is licensed to care for up to 30 others at a time. "My hours are so erratic, but this day care is really flexible," Mrs. Crawford said. "I know people at work who don't have the flexibility I have. And they just stress."
Experts say the demand for child care during nonstandard hours is likely to rise as parents now on welfare rolls are pressured to enter the work force. "If there's a job opening, it's going to be in that second shift in many communities, and that's going to force parents into the dilemma of 'What do I do with my children?' " said Marianne Duddy, a child-care consultant in Boston.
And as demand increases, other changes proposed by the 104th Congress may make it even harder to find family day care, now the most common kind in many communities across the country. The welfare reform bill, passed by the House of Representatives in March and soon to come before the Senate, would slash financing for meal programs at family day-care homes. The program has been an incentive for many providers to become licensed and pay taxes, and the change could drive them out of business or underground.
"It's not very safe or encouraging for the parents," said Yasmina Vinci, the executive director of the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, citing research that has linked licensing to the quality of care.
People seem to need different options, depending on the ages of their children, their work schedules and various personal considerations. Leon Nellinger, a single father, is an electrician at the Saturn automobile plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., whose shifts rotate every 10 days or so, from days to nights. He brings his son, Robert, 9, to Saturn's 24-hour child-care center near the plant, which costs $105 for six nights.
"Our night shift ends at 2:30 in the morning, so I get my son at about a quarter to 3, bring him home, put him back to bed, catch a couple of hours of sleep and then get him back up and help him get ready for school," Mr. Nellinger said. "He likes it pretty well, but he'd rather be home with his own things. We both get a little burned out by the end of our night-shift rotation."
Only about a dozen 24-hour centers exist nationwide, according to a report issued last year by the nonprofit Families and Work Institute in Manhattan. They are costly to operate, and parents often say they would rather have their children at home at night.
For many parents, "tag team" or 'split shift" parenting may be the answer to their child-care needs. But it can mean less sleep for many spouses, said Janie O'Connor, whose Shoreview, Minn., consulting company, Interface Work/Family, specializes in shift-worker issues. She told the story of a man who came home, lay down with his son for a nap and woke up only when a neighbor banged on the door and handed him the child, who had been wandering in the street.
Barbara Henderson is an air-traffic controller and mother of two who works at the Farmington Air Traffic Control Center outside Minneapolis. Her husband, Greg is also an air-traffic controller, and they work opposite schedules so that they can escort their children, ages 6 and 8, to various activities. Even so, it's far from perfect.
"You get the guilt that all working moms get," Mrs. Henderson said, "but you also think, 'My kid is not going to know what normal is.' I have only one parent here at night, Monday through Friday. It gets even harder as they get older, because they get into baseball and soccer and swimming and hockey, and there isn't the time to give to all of that."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Chance Of Recession

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised the possibility today of a brief recession, although he played down its likelihood. He stressed the economy's long-term health in terms that the financial markets took as a signal that no imminent cuts in interest rates are planned.
Commenting on an abrupt economic slowdown, which he called "very pronounced," Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that "as a consequence of the sluggish economic outlook, the probabilities, as some of my colleagues have indicated, of a recession have edged up, as indeed one would expect." 
 But he went on to emphasize that the likelihood of a deep, lengthy recession lasting into 1996 and beyond had "decreased very significantly." Mr. Greenspan spoke in Seattle at a conference of bankers.
Bond traders and financial analysts interpreted the comments by Mr. Greenspan as indicating an intention to stand pat on interest rates. Traders had been expecting a cut in short-term rates, and sent prices down sharply yesterday. [Page D22.]
Such expectations followed a recent string of unexpectedly weak economic indicators, including the announcement by the Labor Department on Friday that the economy shed 101,000 jobs in May. Many traders and analysts predicted last week that the Fed would be forced to lower rates soon to stimulate an economy slowing too quickly.
But if Fed officials believe that the economy is poised to bounce back quickly from a temporary slowdown, they would be unlikely to cut rates, because it takes up to a year to gain stimulation from lower rates.
The remarks by Mr. Greenspan today were particularly noteworthy because he typically chooses his words carefully and does not use a word like recession lightly.
His comments were echoed in a telephone interview this afternoon by Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Fed. Mr. Blinder said the odds of a recession had increased but remained fairly low.
"I do not expect a recession," he said. "Have recent numbers raised the probability of a recession? Yes, they have, but it is still very far from a high probability."
Mr. Blinder emphasized the vulnerability of the economy during the second and third quarters of this year, while stressing that he expected the economy to do better later on.
Both Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Blinder said the recent sluggishness in the American economy was a result of companies choosing to slow their accumulation of inventories instead of ordering new goods.
If the economy falls into a recession, it would most likely be because the fall in new orders and resulting layoffs would produce a slump in consumer spending, Mr. Blinder added. If consumers buy fewer goods, then inventories pile up and a vicious circle of recession can result.
Mr. Greenspan made a rare appearance at a news conference today during the international banking conference in Seattle. Sponsored by the American Bankers Association, the conference was attended by the top executives from 100 of the world's biggest banks, along with Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German central bank, and Akira Nagashima, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan.
Economists commonly define a recession as two or more consecutive quarters in which the total economic output shrinks. So a slight dip in output in the second quarter and again in the third quarter could qualify as a recession in the eyes of professional economists like Mr. Blinder and Mr. Greenspan, even though such a downturn might not bring the wrenching increases in unemployment and other hardships that many Americans associate with a recession.
The overall tone of Mr. Greenspan's remarks today was positive. "I don't see any problems that really disturb me," he said.
He specifically told reporters that he did not see a broad risk to the American financial system from the economic difficulties in Mexico. The Mexican currency and financial markets have stabilized this spring, after faltering last December and in January.
Mr. Greenspan said that a move by companies to slow their accumulation of inventories would be healthy for the economy in the long term. If inventories had continued to build at a rapid pace, there would have been "a fairly high probability of a significant contraction later this year and next," Mr. Greenspan said today.
But he also cautioned that the slowing of the buildup in inventory was still modest and likely to "proceed for some while."
Mr. Blinder, a Clinton appointee who is widely viewed as more willing than his colleagues to use interest rates to bolster the economy, has publicly expressed concern several times in recent days about the prospects for the economy, and Mr. Greenspan appeared to be responding today to those worries.
Edward W. Kelley Jr., another governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said today in a speech in Birmingham, Ala., that the economy was strong. But he described recent declines in auto sales as "scary," and said the job losses in May were worse than he had anticipated.
By contrast, Edward G. Boehne, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, was more upbeat in a speech in New York. And Robert Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview today with Reuters that he was "not at all surprised at the kind of information we've been getting lately."
The combination of the various remarks suggested a reappearance of the Federal Reserve's longtime split between the board governors who worry more about the short-term health of the economy and regional bank presidents who fret more about controlling inflation. It is somewhat unusual for so many Fed officials to speak publicly on the same day, though not unheard of at times when Fed policy makers have recently met and will not have to vote on interest rate policy for another month.
Several financial analysts expressed surprise that Mr. Greenspan used the term recession, and said they believed that it was the first time this year. "I'm a little surprised by that," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board. "I would be careful about using that word."
John Lipsky, an economist for Salomon Brothers, said Mr. Greenspan's choice of words was also striking. "I would be surprised if Alan Greenspan would use a term like that lightly."
But Wall Street economists remained divided this evening about whether Mr. Greenspan was correct in playing down the risks of a prolonged economic slowdown. "The latest figures portray an economy that is slowing gradually but inexorably in the grips of a rather typical inventory adjustment," Mr. Lipsky said. "Several factors suggest the economy will not be returning to trend growth without a new boost from monetary policy."
But David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Government securities dealer in New York, expressed a view more common in the financial markets today when he agreed with the optimism of Mr. Greenspan that the economy would right itself.

HEADLINE: With First Veto, Clinton Rejects Budget-Cut Bill

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
President Clinton vetoed his first bill today, striking down a plan to cut $16.4 billion in spending this year and marking a new phase in his confrontation with the Republican-controlled Congress.
During a Rose Garden ceremony honoring high schools for combating drug use, Mr. Clinton repeatedly struck a lectern for emphasis as he said the bill, which Republicans had offered as a down-payment on their promise to balance the Federal budget in seven years, would strike at an array of education programs while providing new money for building projects. 
 "I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that cuts education to save pet Congressional projects," Mr. Clinton said, as the invited guests applauded. "That is old politics. It is wrong. It wasn't a good policy when we were increasing spending on everything. It is a terrible policy if you're going to cut education to put pork back in."
Republican leaders said they could not muster the two-thirds majority in each house to override the veto, and would reopen negotiations with the White House to seek a compromise.
Mr. Clinton also challenged Congress to resolve the differences between its versions and send him a bill to sign that would give a President the power to veto individual items within bills. In exchange, he pledged that if this year he was given the power called for in the Republicans' Contract With America, he would not use it to kill individual tax provisions, only spending items. But he said he still held out the right to veto entire tax cut proposals.
Mr. Clinton's veto, the first of many he has threatened in recent months, puts his relationship with Congress into a new period of testing. There are inherent political risks and benefits for each side depending on how they maneuver in the coming months over future budget cuts as well as changes in foreign aid, environmental legislation and welfare, among other proposals.
As senior White House aides were quick to point out, the veto put to rest for now questions about the President's relevance after a sustained period in which Congressional Republicans have been setting the political agenda. It also more sharply defined a leader who has suffered from the perception that he is indecisive. But analysts said Mr. Clinton must take care that his veto not appear to be directed against deficit reduction itself.
And many vetoes over a prolonged period would carry the risk for both Mr. Clinton and the Republicans of appearing obstructionist and ineffective. "If there's gridlock, I think it hurts everybody, and hurts everybody equally," said Mark Mellman, a pollster who works for the Democratic leaders in Congress. "It's a partisan draw."
In an effort to shape the legislation last month, Mr. Clinton indicated that he objected only to $1.4 billion of the spending cuts in programs for education, the environment, crime prevention, housing and other social programs. He proposed $1.5 billion in alternative cuts primarily in construction projects, foreign aid and Government overhead.
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said Republicans were prepared to restore $600 to $800 million in spending as the "cornerstone of an agreement."
But Mr. Hatfield said that the President would have to deliver Democratic votes for such a compromise and that Republican support for the bill would diminish in the House and possibly in the Senate.
In the House, Representative Robert L. Livingston, who heads the Appropriations Committee, said, "If we change this bill, we are only going to make some trimming at the edge." The Louisiana Republican added that it would be difficult to persuade some Republicans, especially the freshmen, to support any compromise with the White House. "The more change that the President wants, the more votes we lose," he said.
Mr. Clinton spent his first two years in office striking deals on issues like crime and the budget rather than trying to draw rigid lines or threaten a veto. Indeed, today was the first time Mr. Clinton wielded the tool known as the President's ultimate weapon, after a period without issuing a veto that was in itself a modern record. Not since Millard T. Fillmore left the White House 142 years ago had a President waited so long to cast a veto.
But since the Republicans took control of Congress, Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto several pieces of legislation making their way through Capitol Hill, including foreign aid bills he has denounced as "isolationist," attempts to repeal last year's ban on 19 kinds of assault weapons and efforts to weaken environmental legislation, as well as plans to make the Federal food stamp program into a block grant administered by the states.
Democratic strategists say the President's veto threats have helped define for the public the difference in what the two parties stand for. "He highlights very clearly the key differences with Republicans on key issues," said Mr. Mellman. "That's very important for us."
But the White House, which believes that Mr. Clinton has never received sufficient attention for his deficit-reduction efforts, has also taken pains to make sure that the President is not perceived as a big-spending Democrat. It has sought to strike a constant theme that there is a right way and a wrong way to cut spending. And budget officials have been quietly drafting plans to balance the budget in a decade, so Mr. Clinton will have alternatives to present when Congress reaches agreement on its plan to balance the budget in seven years.
"I do not want to just say no," Mr. Clinton said today. "I have not said no to this," he said, pointing out that he would have been willing to accept the Senate version of the bill to cut spending.
"We must recognize that the only deficit in this country is not the budget deficit," he said. "There's a deficit in this country in the number of drug-free children. There'a deficit in this country in the number of safe schools. There's an education deficit in this country," he said, arguing that Congress could find money to fight such problems as it finds deficit reductions elsewhere.
Republicans lost no time in accusing Mr. Clinton of blocking savings. "It is highly regrettable that President Clinton chose a bill cutting spending for his first veto," said the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination. He added, "For the sake of generations to come it's time for the President to stop being an obstacle in the road and join us in our responsibility to secure our nation's economic future."
Mr. Clinton said recently that he was not looking for a "pile of vetoes" and would prefer to work with Congress. But with the President likely to face more and more veto decisions as appropriations measures move toward his desk in the next months, White House advisers said his challenge was not to allow himself to be painted as the obstructionist. Said a senior White House aide, "It depends on who wins the definitional wars."

HEADLINE: In Cuba, Army Takes On Party Jobs, and May Be Only Thing That Works

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
With Cuba in an economic and ideological crisis over the worldwide collapse of Communism, the role and responsibilities of the Cuban armed forces have been expanding rapidly while those of the Communist Party have been sharply declining.
Diplomats and economists here estimate that units of the army, which has traditionally been one of President Fidel Castro's principal pillars of support, are now producing and distributing between a quarter and a third of the country's food supply. The military has also set up highly profitable tourism, construction and retailing companies of its own, and officers have been put in charge of many state enterprises in an effort to reduce corruption and inefficiency. 
 At the same time, more veterans of the Revolutionary Armed Forces with close ties to Raul Castro, the Minister of Defense and the President's younger brother, are apparently being moved into party posts, especially in the provinces. The state news media have been filled with praise for Cuba's 160,000 soldiers as examples of revolutionary rectitude and competence.
This enhanced role for the military reflects a corresponding decline in the fortunes of the Cuban Communist Party, which has seen many traditional levers of control slip out of its hands. With fewer perquisites of the revolution to be distributed, as a result of the crisis, ordinary Cubans have fewer reasons either to join or to fear the party.
"The reality of Cuba in 1995 is that the military is one of the few, if not the only, institutions that really and truly work," a Latin American diplomat here said. "Revolutionary fervor has vanished, and with it the credibility of the party, leaving only the armed forces to fill the vacuum."
The increased importance of the armed forces has also meant greater prominence for Raul Castro, who is also First Vice President. The younger Mr. Castro, who is 63, is described by foreign diplomats and Cuban officials alike as fiercely loyal to his brother but distressed by the country's mounting economic and political problems and somewhat willing to deviate from Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy.
"His officers all have families," a diplomat here said, and they are experiencing the shortages of food, fuel and consumer goods that have afflicted the Cuban economy since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989.
Another diplomat said, "He is aware of the situation on the ground in a way that Fidel is not and realizes that some changes have got to be made."
The army's higher profile over the last year can be traced to a widely quoted remark that Raul Castro made last July, just before the period when 32,000 Cuban boat people left the country, trying to reach the United States. "Beans are more important than cannon," he said in a speech that was regarded as acknowledging the state's need to adopt a more pragmatic approach.
Soon afterward, Cuba announced a new system of farmers' markets, with Raul Castro and other military officials reportedly taking a direct role in their organization. Cuban consumers and officials say soldiers delivered or sold more than three-quarters of the fruits and vegetables initially available at the markets.
The involvement of the armed forces in agriculture is not new, dating back to the sugar harvest campaigns of the early years of the revolution. But since the end of the Soviet Union and Cuba's loss of subsidies of up to $5 billion a year, the production and distribution of food have been among Cuba's most severe problems and a source of popular unrest. The role of the armed forces has increased in an effort to alleviate that pressure.
"Our specific task is defense, but defense includes everything," Raul Castro said in an interview with the Communist Party newspaper Granma after the refugee crisis ended. "Right now it involves providing food for our people, which along with sugar production has been designated by our Commander in Chief as the main strategic task."
According to diplomats, the number of conscripts in special units called the Youth Labor Army, assigned to plant and harvest basic foods, has increased sharply as a result. To prevent theft, which has become more of a problem than ever, soldiers also guard food shipments from the countryside to the cities.
In an interview in December, Carlos Lage, Cuba's top economic official, said the farmers' markets had been strongly "pushed by Raul, but with the support of Fidel." He said the Defense Minister has "had a very important role in the experiences of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and in bringing that experience into the civilian realm."
Even before the farmers' markets were started, the Cuban military had moved into several other highly profitable business ventures. One is a construction company that has won lucrative contracts for hotels and beach resorts and is involved in several industrial and public utility projects.
The best known military enterprise is a large tourist agency known as Gaviota, or sea gull, which reportedly got its start managing recreation centers for Soviet troops stationed in Cuba. From that humble beginning over a decade ago, Gaviota is now involved in virtually every aspect of tourism in Cuba, including luxury hotels, hunting preserves, marinas, spas, bus tours, fishing excursions, a large taxicab fleet and airplane flights.
To soak up the dollars entering the country, the military also operates a chain of department stores, called TRD Caribe, that sell expensive imported goods, mostly to foreign visitors. TRD stands for "tiendas de recaudacion de divisas," or "stores to collect foreign currency."
Cuban officials have closely studied and openly admire China's state-managed economic opening, which has transformed the People's Liberation Army, or P.L.A., into a prosperous enterprise with many commercial ventures of its own. But diplomats here say they have detected in the Cuban armed forces few signs of the widespread corruption and nepotism that accompanied the P.L.A.'s plunge into the business world.
To a large extent, the army's activities here have been impelled by the economic crisis, which has deprived the military of many of its traditional missions. Like every other sector of Cuban society, the military has also been asked to trim costs and manpower, which has dropped by about 25 percent from its peak of more than 200,000 men during Cuba's African adventures in the 1980's.
"The armed forces are trying to generate foreign exchange so as to be able to sustain themselves as a military force without being a load on the state or a burden on the rest of the economy," said Julio Carranza, deputy director of the Center for the Study of the Americas, an official research institute here. "In that respect, they are playing a highly positive role."
The military is also a source of well-trained administrators with valuable technical skills and experience. As Cuba seeks to attract foreign investment, officers who fought in Angola or who have used market management techniques in the army's ammunition or clothing plants are logical choices to run joint-venture companies.
"Many officers are engineers or agronomists and have run factories or farms," Ernesto Melendez, Cuba's Minister of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, said in an interview here. "They have had to change uniforms and come into the civilian economy, which is something that happens everywhere, including the United States."
Some academic analysts abroad and diplomats and officials here have sought to portray Raul Castro and his associates as leaders of a broader movement to reform the entire Cuban system. They contend that Mr. Castro, often mentioned as the likely successor to Fidel Castro, who is 67, is more flexible ideologically than his brother and less interested in dogma than results.
But the Defense Minister has rejected such suggestions. In a speech delivered in March to an army congress, he referred mockingly to the "Cubanologists," or academic experts at universities in the United States and elsewhere, who have discussed the "reformist" role of the armed forces "in a period of transition" at their seminars and workshops.
"What transition are they talking about?" he asked. "It is clear to us that we want a transition to improve and perfect our socialism, not a transition back to capitalism, as they want."
Even in Cuba, he added, some people have talked of a "project" to reform the system. But that too is mistaken, he said, because the only "Cuban project is called 'socialist revolution.' "
Diplomats and Cuban officials say the country's basic direction is not likely to change, even if the armed forces continue to eclipse the Communist Party. Raul Castro, they said, is anxious to avoid the kind of situation that has often developed elsewhere in Latin America, in which an all-powerful army pushes aside other institutions and eventually takes the reins of power for itself.
"In Cuba, the entire system shares the concept that the party leads things," Mr. Carranza said. "The army is very careful to maintain that principle."
Raul Castro "has always been careful to point out the leading role of the party," Mr. Carranza continued. "There has been great care with this principle in Cuba."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances on Prospect Of Interest Rate Cut by Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A sluggish dollar recovered in late trading yesterday after Germany's central banker said that the mark was too strong and that any movement in interest rates in his country would probably be downward.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 84.88 yen, up from 84.71 yen late Tuesday. It was also trading at 1.4147 marks, up from 1.4118 marks. 
 "It was a very boring, uneventful day up until a half-hour ago," Rick Porter, a vice president in foreign exchange at the New York office of Bank Brussels Lambert, said late yesterday afternoon. "This led to buying of the dollar against major currencies late in the day."
The day began with the dollar trading lower, hurt by nervousness about Argentina's ability to repay debt. The United States is a big creditor of Argentina, where stock market prices dropped sharply yesterday for a second consecutive day.
Late in the day, however, Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's Bundesbank, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made remarks that sent the dollar up.
Mr. Greenspan, one of the central bankers attending the International Monetary Conference in Seattle, reaffirmed his view that the United States economy was slowing down. But he gave no hint the Fed would cut interest rates, a possibility that has weighed on the dollar. Traders bought dollars on the news.
His remarks were followed by those of Mr. Tietmeyer, who said the mark was overvalued and that any coming interest rate move in his country would likely be down. That weakened the mark and bolstered the dollar.
Peggy Reed, a vice president at the New York office of Credit Agricole, said there should be a carry over effect as traders moved their focus from the monetary conference to the Group of Seven meeting next week in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At that meeting, finance ministers from the major industrialized countries are expected to re-emphasize their commitment to a stable dollar.
The dollar also rose slightly against the British pound. Late in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5893, compared with $1.5915 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Microsoft's On-Line Plan Is Scrutinized

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It may not be a full-blown investigation yet, but the Justice Department is giving Microsoft's plans to enter the commercial on-line business in August a hard look. In the last two weeks, Justice Department officials have been asking questions of executives of services like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy and to their lawyers, some of the people questioned say.
So while Microsoft says it knows of no "open investigation" of its coming on-line service, the Microsoft Network, and the Justice Department isn't saying, the inquiries are being made even if the I-word -- investigation -- is avoided. 
 The issue is not that the giant of personal computer software is about to extend its reach into another business, but the way it plans to do so. Microsoft Network will appear as an icon on the screen in the company's new operating system, Windows 95. Click on the icon, and Microsoft Network fires up, offering everything from E-mail to celebrity gossip to NBC News reports.
Loading its on-line service onto its operating system is a big marketing advantage for Microsoft. America Online; Compuserve, a unit of H & R Block, and Prodigy, owned by Sears, Roebuck and I.B.M., can be loaded onto personal computers, but they have to pay PC makers for the privilege. Microsoft Network, by contrast, will get free distribution courtesy of Microsoft's dominance of the PC operating-system market.
In some ways, the on-line issue is broader than the two previous rounds of investigation by the Justice Department. Last summer, Microsoft agreed to alter some licensing practices to end a four-year antitrust inquiry into how it sold its operating system, a settlement now under review in the Federal courts. Two weeks ago, Microsoft abandoned its $2 billion bid for Intuit, the leader in personal finance software, after the Justice Department filed suit to stop the acquisition.
The operating-system inquiries can be seen as an examination of past practices, and the Intuit challenge as a merger case. But Government scrutiny of the on-line business raises tricky questions of what Washington should do -- or refrain from doing -- to insure competition, innovation and consumer welfare in emerging markets.
To make a case for intervention, the Justice Department needs to find arguments to get around what seem to be significant obstacles. Microsoft is a new entrant in the on-line business, and antitrust law tends to give newcomers more leeway than established companies seeking to merge, as in the Microsoft-Intuit case.
And the on-line business is a young industry, with only 7 percent of American households as subscribers. If Washington is to step in, it must make some confident predictions about why its fine-tuning is preferable to letting the market sort out winners and losers.
"All policy should encourage Microsoft to enter the on-line business and bring innovation and customer convenience to that market," said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University. "But there should also be a balancing of interests, Microsoft's and others."
Mr. Hall, 50, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and an architect of the flat-tax proposals embraced by House Republicans, could scarcely be considered an advocate of Government intervention in business. But he advised the Justice Department on both the operating-system investigation and the Intuit challenge. He occupies a middle ground in the Microsoft debate.
In the operating-system case, Mr. Hall justifies the Justice Department's letting Microsoft off with barely a slap on the wrist, saying "there was no remedy that was likely to benefit the consumer or improve the environment for innovation." In the Intuit case, he says the department challenge insured that the strongest rival to Intuit -- Microsoft -- remained a competitor.
Mr. Hall stressed that he had not been asked by the Justice Department to examine the on-line business. But he said that if Windows 95 came with a Microsoft Network "button" on board, he would tend to favor "buttons that make it easier for others to have access."
Much of the controversy about Microsoft's entry into the on-line business hinges on access to the operating system. Microsoft opponents use a telephone analogy, with the Microsoft-controlled operating system being the digital-age equivalent of the telephone dial tone.
"Without the Government stepping in to give MCI and Sprint access to the local dial tone, we never would have had real competition and lower prices in long-distance telephone service," said Gary Reback, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., who has many Microsoft rivals as clients. "It's the same in the on-line business."
Microsoft's backers reply that such an analogy is off base. Instead, they argue, the Government should look to airline computer-reservations systems. In the late 1980's, several smaller carriers sued American and United, saying the two were using monopoly positions in computer-reservations systems as a lever to gain an unfair advantage in the market for air travel.
In 1991, a Federal appeals court tossed out the case, ruling that except in an industry with a long tradition of regulation, like telephone service, the dominant company is not required to provide competitors equal access.
"In competition, fairness is not an issue," said Jerry Hausman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, who has advised Microsoft. "Consumer welfare is.
"For all the complaints about Microsoft from its competitors," he added, "its customers have benefited from Microsoft's strength."

HEADLINE: 3 Are Held in Plot to Sell Material to Iraq

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Three men from Queens and Long Island, apparently in collusion with a Russian general, smuggled nearly eight tons of material used in nuclear reactors from a military stockpile in Ukraine, stored most of it in a warehouse in Queens and spread the word that they would sell it to the highest bidder, Federal officials said yesterday.
The men were arrested after a yearlong sting operation in which United States Customs agents posed as Iraqi Foreign Ministry officials and European arms dealers planning to buy zirconium, a nonradioactive material that is useful in nuclear fission. They are charged with trying to export zirconium illegally to Iraq, in violation of United Nations sanctions against Iraq, augmented by American law, which prohibit all trade with Iraq except for humanitarian items. 
 Lawyers for the men said they intended to plead not guilty.
Officials said that all the smuggled zirconium was recovered and that the seizure was the largest ever in the United States involving nuclear-related components. They said they thought that others were involved, both in the United States and abroad, and that more arrests are possible.
The Government investigation uncovered an intricate scheme worthy of a James Bond movie, involving black market deals, clandestine meetings in a bank in Astoria, Queens, phone calls and faxes to Moscow, a Ukrainian truck heading to a customs warehouse in Germany, and just last week, a final shipment of zirconium on an airplane to Amsterdam and then Cyprus.
While the material seized in the investigation was not itself dangerous, officials said the arrests of the men and the seizure of the zirconium highlighted the availability of nuclear-related material controlled by the military in the former Soviet republics.
In fact, officials said, the three men had apparently agreed to provide the undercover customs agents other, and potentially more dangerous, items, including powdered zirconium, most commonly used in cluster bombs, and nuclear fuel rods.
That such material "can be stored in an ordinary warehouse in Woodside, originating in the Ukraine, and destined for Iraq should serve as a wake-up call for every law-enforcement agent that it's as easy as that to get this material," said James Kallstrom, assistant director in charge of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
"The good news is that the buyer of this material was not a terrorist group or country such as Iraq," he added. "The bad news is, it just as easily could have been."
The men, all Greek immigrants, were identified as Demetrios Demetrios, a 40-year-old importer who lives in Long Island City, Queens; Renos Kourtides, 55, the former president of Marathon Bank in Queens, and Constantine Zahariadas, 50, who the authorities said might be a silent partner in the bank. Mr. Demetrios and Mr. Kourtides are naturalized American citizens; Mr. Zahariadas is in the United States on a work visa. At a bail hearing before a Federal magistrate in Brooklyn yesterday, Mr. Demetrios and Mr. Kourtides were released on $1 million bond. Mr. Zahariadas was not released.
Mr. Kourtides lives in a mansion in Muttontown, L.I. Mr. Zahariadas is thought to live there as well.
Mr. Demetrios's lawyer, Jack Wasserman, said in a telephone interview that his client has "no preconceived intention of exporting anything in violation of the law."
He said that Mr. Demetrios obtained the zirconium last spring by trading dresses with a German businessman, and that he intended to sell the zirconium for industrial use.
"If you were really going to evade the law, why would you bring it to the United States?" Mr. Wasserman asked.
Mr. Kourtides's lawyer, Lou Freeman, said his client "just didn't do anything wrong."
As described by Federal officials, the case involves two schemes, one real and one manufactured by the Government in its sting operation.
The real smuggling scheme, the Government charged, began last year, when at least one of the three men apparently made contact with a Russian general who had access to military stockpiles in Ukraine. Government investigators said they did not know the identity of the general, nor how he had access to material in Ukraine, a separate country. Robert Van Etten, special agent in charge of the New York customs office said that customs attaches were in Moscow investigating the matter.
In May 1994, a truck rolled out of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with 11,000 pounds of stolen zirconium.
The purest zirconium is used to wrap the nuclear fuel in a reactor, and can be used in munitions, including cluster bombs. By itself, it is a harmless metal used to make jewelry. The smuggled zirconium was virtually pure, 800-pound cylinders packed in wooden-slatted crates. The crates were labeled "zirconium" in Russian, the officials said.
The truck arrived in Hamburg, Germany, but the shipment hit a snag, the Federal officials said. German officials held it in a customs warehouse and were asking questions about the origins and purposes of the zirconium. The men thought it best to get the zirconium out of Germany, officials said, so they arranged for it to be put on a freighter and shipped to New York.
Customs agents at the Port of New York took little notice of the zirconium, the officials said. It is not illegal to import zirconium, and the metal, destined for more mundane purposes, enters frequently.
The men took the 15 wooden crates to a warehouse at 71-08 51st Avenue in Woodside, the officials said, and tried to sell it on the black market.
"These individuals had the zirconium more or less in open market," said Kenneth Klug, special agent for the Customs Service in New York. "They were willing to sell it to anyone. They were advertising by word of mouth."
A Government informant heard about the zirconium in May and, in late June, a customs agent posing as a metals broker met with Mr. Demetrios and was shown the zirconium.
Over the next few months, the agent met several times with the three men, and introduced them to another Customs agent posing as an Irish arms broker, the officials said.
In the meetings, according to a Government affidavit, the undercover agents made it clear that the zirconium was going to be shipped to Iraq. In one conversation, the affidavit says, Mr. Demetrios said that he did not "care what they want to do." In other converations, he cautioned the agents not to mention that Iraq was the destination.
In October, the agents introduced Mr. Kourtides and Mr. Zahariadis to an agent pretending to work for the Iraqi Government, the affidavit said, and after much haggling, the final price was negotatiated: $1.6 million.
Everything appeared to be going smoothly. The ingots were to be flown on British Airways out of Kennedy Airport to Italy.
But on Dec. 22, when the zirconium was delivered to Kennedy, Customs officials held up the shipment, telling Mr. Demetrios that he did not have the proper State Department licenses, Mr. Klug said. The men did not get suspicious, Mr. Klug said. Instead, they offered to get the Iraqi buyers another shipment from Ukraine.
"You have to remember they were driven by greed, so their major concern was getting the money that they fully believed we would supply to them," Mr. Klug said.
Another deal was negotiated, and last week, two metric tons of zirconium were flown to Amsterdam, and from there to Cyprus, said Joseph King, a supervisory customs agent in New York. The men were expecting to get money for the zirconium that arrived in Cyprus. Instead, they were arrested at their homes yesterday morning.

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Show a High Rate Of Newborn Deaths

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL 

 BODY:
A New York State Health Department study has found an unexpectedly high number of deaths among newborns in some of the city's busiest public and private hospitals.
State officials have not identified a cause for the high mortality rates, which at some hospitals are roughly 50 percent above the national average. But they have ordered an extensive investigation that is to include a review of the medical records of many babies who died in the last two years. 
 The overall mortality rate for newborns in New York City is higher than the national rate, though comparable to the death rates in other big cities. But among individual hospitals, there are wide variations in the rates, both among different hospitals and among babies of different birth weights at the same hospital.
State officials said the Health Department study did not take into account social and economic factors that might help to explain differences in the rates. But the data shows those factors were not the sole reason for the differences.
For example, some hospitals treating the city's poorest patients, like Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn and Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, had rates that were better than the city average for babies with healthy birth weight, 1 death per 1,000 births. But at the same time, Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, a public hospital that serves a mostly poor population, had nearly the twice the mortality rate for babies of healthy birth weight when compared with the rate of the hospital across the street, University Hospital of Brooklyn.
The state's examination, which began in March, was based on a computer study and was prompted by a series of articles in The New York Times a few days earlier. It essentially confirms the newspaper's own computer study, which showed that the death rate was higher, on average, in the sprawling public hospital system than in the private hospitals.
The Health Department found that some of the city's private hospitals also had infant mortality rates that were higher than the city average. They ranged from lesser-known institutions, like Interfaith Medical Center-Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn and Staten Island University Hospital North Shore, to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, an elite academic center in Manhattan.
Over the last few months, as the state conducted its study, the city's hospital industry, which has a powerful lobbying force, resisted the public release of mortality figures. Hospital officials said yesterday that they believed the state study was inaccurate and misleading, and may be unnecessarily alarming to patients.
Interfaith Medical Center-Jewish Hospital, a private hospital in Brooklyn, had the highest mortality rate over all and the highest rate for babies of healthy birth weight, or 5.5 pounds or more. The hospital said that the state numbers "unjustly portray hospitals which serve distressed communities as providing inadequate care."
"Nobody does a perfect job," said Lars Larmon, a hospital spokesman, "but we are doing an excellent job. Our problems lie in the type of cases we get, the fact that there is often little or no prenatal care. There are things we can't do anything about."
State officials originally planned to adjust their numbers to reflect some hospitals' greater caseloads of sicker and poorer patients, who are less likely to have access to good prenatal care. But the state changed its approach after the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group that represents hospitals in the city, set up a research committee and challenged the methodology.
Ultimately, Health Department officials took a simpler approach whose methodology they believed would be less open to question. They divided all births into three groups by birth weight -- a crucial factor in newborn survival -- then ranked hospitals by their mortality rate within each group. State officials said they dropped the more elaborate model because they were not completely convinced of the reliability of information filled out by doctors on birth and death records.
The Health Department found death rates ranging from 2.3 per 1,000 in the worst case to no deaths in the best case, for babies of healthy birth weight. The overall city average was 0.96 deaths per 1,000; for public hospitals, 1.17 per 1,000, and for all other hospitals, 0.9 per 1,000.
Dr. Barbara DeBuono, the State Heath Commissioner, said that it was important to release the rates even before the reasons were fully understood, to force the medical community to focus on the problem.
"This is the start of a process by which the hospitals and the Health Department will be working closely together to discover the why behind these numbers," she said. "We want hospitals to use this as a tool to zero in on their newborn deaths. We don't think they do that now on a consistent basis."
During the next two weeks, she said, six-member review teams assembled by the state will review medical records, procedures and deaths at 17 hospitals in New York City, searching for patterns. The review, she said, will include all 11 of the city-owned hospitals and the 6 private hospitals hired by the city to provide care in the public hospitals.
Eventually, state officials are to review infant deaths at other hospitals with high mortality rates. Dr. DeBuono said the findings may result in actions ranging from new public health initiatives to insuring that patients at public and private hospitals receive the same standard of care.
The Times's computer study found that the death rate for babies of normal weight born at the public hospitals was substantially higher than the rate at private hospitals. The public hospitals also had higher rates in most categories of serious birth injuries.
The Times's computer analysis was part of a broad assessment of care in the delivery rooms of the public hospital system, the nation's largest. Doctors, nurses and hospital administrators detailed a decadelong pattern in which dozens of babies died or were left to struggle with brain damage or other injuries because of mistakes by inexperienced doctors and poorly supervised midwives and nurses.
The state's review has been circulating through the city's hospital community since last week, leading some hospitals to begin their own investigations. "Every hospital is out there pulling charts like mad right now," said Barbara A. Green, senior vice president for education and research at the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Ms. Green complained the state had repeatedly shifted directions and changed its numbers. "The state study has very little value from a consumer point of view," she said, "but it is a first step in a process that will allow hospitals to take an independent look at neonatal mortality rates."
The state examined the mortality rate for all births within the first 28 days of life in 1992 and 1993, the most recent years for which data are available. The Health Department did not count deaths that were clearly beyond the control of the hospitals, like those of babies weighing less than 1.1 pounds and newborns with certain congenital defects.
Interfaith Medical Center-Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, which fared worse than any other hospital, had 10.6 deaths for each 1,000 births, compared with the citywide average of 4.5 deaths. For babies weighing at least 5.5 pounds, the hospital had a rate of 2.31 deaths per 1,000, compared with the citywide average of just under 1 per 1,000.
New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan had the highest rate for babies with low birth weight, between 3.3 and 5.5 pounds. St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn had the highest rate among babies with very low birth weight, between 1.1 and 3.3 pounds.
The overall mortality rate of the 11 public hospitals was 38 percent higher than that of private hospitals, and 30 percent higher for babies of healthy birth weight. Four of the 10 highest mortality rates belonged to public hospitals.
Dr. Walid Michelen, senior vice president for medical and professional affairs at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, said he believed the state rankings measured "socioeconomic factors more than medical care at the time of delivery" and were not a good measure of hospital performance. Nonetheless, he said that the public hospitals would review their mortality cases.
Across the city, hospital officials contended that some of the state's numbers were simply inaccurate, or based on flawed birth and death certificate information, which is typically submitted by the hospitals themselves. Still others argued the data was meaningless without taking into account medical and social risk factors.
Columbia-Presbyterian had 52 deaths, or an overall mortality rate of 6.2 deaths per 1,000. It had the 12th highest rate for full-size babies and the third highest for babies with low birth weight.
But Dr. John Driscoll, a pediatrician and neonatologist at Columbia-Presbyterian, said he had reviewed all the hospital's deaths for 1993 and 1994 in preparation for a state visit, and did not find any deaths that could not be explained by life-threatening conditions of the newborn, like congenital anomalies or heart disease.
He said the hospital, on 168th Street in Washington Heights, had so many deaths because it was a major center for the high-risk patients who live in its gritty neighborhoods or who transfer to the hospital just before delivery because of their high-risk pregnancies.
In 1992-1993, the years studied by the state, the neonatal mortality rate in New York City was 6.6 deaths per 1,000, compared with the national average of 5.4 per 1,000 and the statewide rate of 5.7 per 1,000.
The state's mortality study excluded some deaths, including those of very tiny babies and babies with fatal congenital defects. When the rates in the study are adjusted to match the national standards, rates at 8 of 11 public hospitals and 9 of 34 private hospitals in the state's study were more than 50 percent above the national average.

HEADLINE: From Democrats, Another Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
After months of debate over Republican plans to revise the nation's main welfare program, Senate Democrats today unveiled a new counterproposal, a plan that would retain guaranteed payments to poor families but limit them to five years.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, outlined the proposal today, and it won immediate support from the Clinton Administration. 
 A similar Democratic proposal was defeated in the House in March, and there is virtually no chance that the Senate will pass Mr. Daschle's bill. But Democrats said they would break off pieces of the bill and offer them as amendments to the Republican measure, with the hope that they might be accepted as part of a centrist compromise.
Republicans want to eliminate a longstanding provision of Federal law that guarantees cash assistance for any families who meet the eligibility criteria, regardless of the total cost to the Government. By contrast, Mr. Daschle said he would preserve welfare as "a conditional entitlement of limited duration." He would also require able-bodied welfare recipients to sign contracts promising to work in return for their benefits.
Mr. Daschle's plan would also guarantee child care for welfare recipients who go to work and would provide vouchers for children's essentials, like housing, in the event their parents forfeit benefits. He said the plan would cost "no new money," but he refused to say how much it would cost or how he would pay for it. He is waiting for cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, he said.
With his bill, Mr. Daschle positions himself to the right of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, an authority on welfare policy, but to the left of Republicans in the House and the Senate.
On May 26, the Senate Finance Committee approved a Republican welfare bill drafted by the committee chairman, Bob Packwood of Oregon. Democrats said today that they believed that some Republican senators believed that measure went too far, and they predicted that some Republicans would support parts of the Democratic alternative.
But the Democrats themselves are divided, and the divisions may hamper their efforts on the Senate floor. Republican senators said today that they expected to win some Democratic votes for their bill without making significant concessions.
Mr. Moynihan will manage the Democratic side of debate on welfare legislation on the Senate floor later this month. But he has not signed up as a co-sponsor of Mr. Daschle's bill. Mr. Moynihan intends to offer his own bill as an alternative to the Republican measure.
Senator Moynihan opposes time limits on welfare benefits. The Republican bills in the House and the Senate, like Mr. Daschle's bill, would impose a five-year limit. The Administration estimated that such a limit, when fully effective, would deny benefits to at least four million children. But Mr. Daschle's bill would allow exceptions to this limit for people who are disabled or caring for disabled relatives, as well as for families living in areas of high unemployment.
Mr. Moynihan's proposal builds on a job program for welfare recipients established with bipartisan support in the last major welfare law, the Family Support Act of 1988. By contrast, Senator Daschle today criticized that job program, saying it did not give states enough flexibility to decide on the proper combination of education and training activities.
Lawrence O'Donnell, Democratic staff director of the Finance Committee, said, "Based on our experience in committee, the Republicans do not seem to need any Democratic votes." In proposing alternatives, he said, "the Democrats may not be doing much more than choosing the way they will lose."
But several Democrats said they would be in a better position to criticize Mr. Packwood's bill if they were offering an alternative. Mr. Daschle's bill won endorsements today from two Democratic Senators who helped write it, John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland.
Senators Daschle and Moynihan agree on one point: states should be required to continue current levels of welfare spending. By contrast, Mr. Packwood's bill, like the Republican welfare bill approved by the House, would eliminate all requirements for states to spend their own money as a condition of getting Federal dollars.
States put up a large share of the money spent on welfare, $10 billion of the $23 billion being spent on Aid to Families With Dependent Children this year.
President Clinton, who promised to "end welfare as we know it" in the 1992 campaign, has said he prefers that Congress preserve welfare as an entitlement. But he has not insisted on it or threatened to veto Mr. Packwood's bill. With the President's position in doubt, it is not clear how many Senate Democrats will fight to preserve the entitlement.
"The President wants to give himself plenty of space," Mr. Daschle explained. "He's not going to be locked into any specifics as to what the final bill will look like line by line."
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, praised Mr. Daschle's bill as "a bold plan to end the current welfare system and replace it with a new transitional program focused on work." His bill, unlike the one approved by the Finance Committee, includes the job training and child care needed to put people to work, she said.
Mr. Daschle would guarantee child care for welfare recipients who take jobs. Neither the House bill nor the one approved by the Finance Committee contains such a guarantee.
Senator Daschle's bill would also set goals for putting welfare recipients to work. By 2000, half of all able-bodied adult recipients would have to find jobs. The Government would pay substantial bonuses to states that exceeded the goals. Fewer than 10 percent of welfare recipients now have jobs.
Republicans would set annual limits on spending for cash assistance to poor people. Senate Democrats would impose no such limit.
The House welfare bill would provide direct cash payments to the states totaling $15.4 billion a year from 1996 through 2000. Under Mr. Packwood's bill, the payments, known as block grants, would total $16.8 billion a year. Under the Senate Democrats' proposal, as under current law, welfare spending would increase automatically with the number of needy people.

HEADLINE: Robert Vesco, Fugitive Financier, Is Arrested in Cuba, the U.S. Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The Cuban Government has arrested Robert L. Vesco, who fled the United States in 1973 to avoid swindling charges, and has approached Washington about returning him here, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The United States has sought the financier's extradition for years on an indictment charging him with swindling mutual fund investors of $224 million. 
 American officials said they did not know what crimes Mr. Vesco had been charged with in Cuba, but they said they suspected he was arrested partly to cultivate good will with the United States as Havana seeks to improve ties and persuade the Clinton Administration to ease the economic embargo.
"He was arrested in connection to things he did in Cuba, not to things he did in the United States," said one Administration official, who confirmed Mr. Vesco's arrest, which was first reported by ABC News.
An Administration official said that the Government was in intense talks with Havana about returning Mr. Vesco and that American law-enforcement agencies were preparing plans to transfer him if Cuba turned him over. Justice Department officials said that the Cuban Government had approached the Clinton Administration about the possible return of Mr. Vesco.
The 59-year-old fugitive has been living in Cuba since the early 1980's, and Federal prosecutors have said they suspected that he was involved in the drug trade since about that time. In 1989 he was added as a defendant in a narcotics conspiracy in Jacksonville, Fla., accused of persuading Cuba to allow planes carrying cocaine to pass over Cuba on the way to the Bahamas.
When Mr. Vesco fled the United States more than two decades ago, he began a great fugitive saga, which was marked by continuous guessing as to his whereabouts. Not only was he charged with skimming huge sums from a Geneva-based mutual fund, Investors Overseas Services, but he was also under indictment for making an illegal $200,000 campaign contribution to President Richard M. Nixon.
Attorney General John Mitchell and Maurice Stans, finance chairman of Mr. Nixon's re-election campaign, were indicted as part of a Watergate-related scandal in which Mr. Vesco was accused of contributing the money as part of a conspiracy to get his legal problems resolved. In 1974, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Stans were acquitted on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice.
One American official said the Administration was certainly happy about Mr. Vesco's arrest, but said he was reluctant to discuss details of the case for fear of spoiling talks with Cuba about the possible return of Mr. Vesco.
In return for handing over Mr. Vesco, Fidel Castro might expect a favor from the Administration, especially an easing of the trade embargo that has sapped Cuba's weak economy. But many Cuban-American groups would attack any move to soften the embargo.
When Mr. Vesco fled the United States he first went to the Bahamas, but then was granted asylum by Costa Rica. He lived there from 1974 to 1978, but left when a new President threatened to expel him. He then returned to the Bahamas, which expelled him in 1981. He spent a short time in Antigua before moving to Cuba.
At the time, Cuban officials insisted that they had not granted entry to Mr. Vesco for him to engage in drug smuggling or to help import American goods in defiance of the trade embargo. They said he was admitted mainly because, in supporting his wife and two daughters, he was pumping a great deal of money into the Cuban economy. Some diplomats suggested that he was paying large sums to Cuban officials in return for allowing him to stay.
In an interview in 1985, Mr. Castro said, "If he wants to live here, let him live here. We don't care what he did in the United States."
During the 1980's, Mr. Vesco divided his time among three houses at different beach resorts and in a 50-foot yacht, Western diplomats said. He also had two private planes and a high-powered speedboat.
Although the swindling charges go back more than 20 years, the statute of limitations does not apply to Mr. Vesco since he has already been indicted.
In 1983, a Federal prosecutor in Brownsville, Texas, linked Mr. Vesco to a conspiracy to smuggle Americans goods, including sugar-processing equipment, into Cuba.
Toward the end of Jimmy Carter's Presidency, Mr. Vesco was at the center of an investigation involving Billy Carter, the President's brother. The investigators accused Mr. Vesco with seeking to provide more than $10 million in bribes to persuade the Administration to release eight military transport planes that had been destined for Libya.

HEADLINE: Teaching Nazi Past to German Youth

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, June 5

 BODY:
In the tranquillity of the Konrad Adenauer High School, no one has to fret about the kinds of things that worry Americans on campus, like guns or drugs, because such things do not happen here, said Heinz Wilms, a history teacher.
Since January, though, he has been nudging his 10th-grade class of 16-year-olds to confront something much more momentous than school-yard discipline: the historical progression from Hitler's rise to power in 1933 to the Holocaust. 
 It is a course, Chapter 6 in a standard German history text, that challenges Germany's young to come to terms with the burden of a collective past far more cruel and destructive than teen-agers anywhere else in the world are obliged to contemplate.
And it is part of the attempt by a postwar generation to explain why the past must not repeat itself to those who will one day run Europe's economic and political powerhouse. The effort, some educators argue, has visibly faltered in the wave of attacks on foreigners and the rise of neo-Nazi groups since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
Yet, in interviews with students, both in Bonn and in a comparable high school in what was once East Berlin, a clear impression emerged that while many young Germans sense no personal guilt for a past generation's crimes, they feel a responsibility to thwart any revival of their history's racism, anti-Semitism, militarism and nationalism.
At the same time, though, they share a nagging worry that their own history hampers what they say should be a justifiable sense of pride in their own nation's achievements.
"The Americans can put their flag out in their own backyard, and no one says anything, but if we did that we'd be accused of being Nazis," said Christian Kreutz, a 16-year-old student at Konrad Adenauer.
Stefan Bohm, in the former East Berlin, commented: "You can't say: 'I'm proud to be a German.' Beethoven was a German, too, but everything now is seen through the Second World War."
Some seemed uneasy with or skeptical at the Government's line that the end of the war in Europe, 50 years ago in May, offered most Germans a liberation from Hitler's tyranny because, some students say, most Germans took part in what happened, one way or another.
In the effort to escape the Nazis' centralization of power, the authorities of the various federal states took responsibility for postwar education, so there is no single standardized curriculum for teaching modern German history. But in 1991, the federal Government's educational-monitoring agency urged that the Nazis be subject to an "intensive and thorough treatment" in schools and that "the memory of the Holocaust is kept alive."
In West Germany during the first postwar decades, Mr. Wilms said, history books were written by Nazi-era teachers, and the urge to repress the past was widespread.
The new text seems to offer a fuller picture. And the chapter on the Nazi era and the Holocaust, taught to 16-year-olds, enjoins them to ask: "Who knew what? Who participated and who kept their distance and in what ways were people's dealings and convictions affected by the National Socialist system of dominance?"
The answers seem to offer a broad indictment: "Membership of the Nazi Party promised influence, professional security, a career." While those who said later that they had joined simply to protect themselves and their families, the school book tells young Germans, the reality was that by joining the party, Germans "strengthened the party and the dominance of the Nazis."
No effort is made to discount the Holocaust or the role played in it by individual Germans, the Nazi regime or German industry. Part of the chapter chronicles the chemical giant I. G. Farben's establishment of a branch called I. G. Auschwitz, near the death camp in German-occupied Poland -- a factory making artificial rubber that used camp inmates as laborers and sent them to the gas chambers when they weakened.
"Every student in Germany must tackle this theme," Mr. Wilms said. "No one can say they didn't know."
They are taught that the Nazis came to power on the wings of economic collapse and humiliation at Germany's defeat in the First World War. They are taught about Hitler's race laws. They are taught that their forebears killed six million Jews. But they also learn that this was history, with a European and a German context, not personal guilt.
"We cannot do anything about it -- it was our grandparents that did it," said Barbara Schuler, a 16-year-old student at Konrad Adenauer High School, in suburb of Bad Godesberg. "But we should not forget it."
For most Germans, education about the war begins at home, in sometimes painful encounters. "If you ask your grandparents if they supported the regime, you don't get an answer," said Matthias Fink, a scholar at the same school.
Not surprisingly, a group of 17-year-olds in the Hans und Hilde Coppi Gymnasium, named for anti-Nazi resistance fighters, in the less affluent Karlshorst district of the former East Berlin had different experiences to recount.
In the depiction of the former Communist education system, said Daniel Hadrisch, a 17-year-old, the East Germans, "were all anti-Fascists" while the Nazi mantle "was given to the West Germans."
Their teacher, Roswitha Quiram, was more forthright. "I don't have a bad conscience," she said. "I don't see myself as responsible. But I would be responsible if it happened again."
Mr. Wilms, the teacher in Bonn, said that "each year, I take a group of students to Auschwitz." On one occasion, he said, his group of young Germans was insulted by a group of young Israelis. "My group was very upset," he recounted. "They said, 'What's that got to do with us? We can't help it.' "

HEADLINE: Only a Paper Boon;
Consumers Aren't Spending Their Profits From Surging Stocks

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
With blue-chip stocks up 16 percent since January, many Americans are a lot richer today than they were on New Year's Day. This year's bull market, the strongest surge since late 1990, has been powered by lower interest rates and rising corporate profits. It has already added more than twice as much to the wealth of America's households as all the money families painstakingly salted away in savings last year.
So now that signs of an economic slowdown are multiplying, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is acknowledging the possibility of a brief downturn this summer, and anxiety is starting to well up, shouldn't all that freshly minted wealth help make the economy safe from recession?
Maybe, but don't count on it. When it comes to the fortune of someone like William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, or the outlook for specific companies, the stock market is a powerful force. But when it comes to determining the course of the overall economy, it is still just a bit player. 
 "People might feel better if the market's up," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, a Wall Street investment house, "but are they really checking their balance sheets?"
By one estimate, a rise in the stock market of the current magnitude -- if it is sustained for a year or so -- could mean a boost to spending of about $22 billion. That is worthwhile, but not enough to make a big difference in an economy that is expected to produce almost $7 trillion in goods and services this year.
Rising prices for assets like stocks, bonds and real estate do deliver a very real impact -- called the wealth effect by economists -- that shows up in a variety of ways. Higher stock prices increase the financial wealth of shareholders, who might be able to afford more, whether a Cadillac instead of a Chevrolet or an Ivy League education for the children versus State U. The most common reaction to a fatter portfolio is to save less from current income, since the market helps build extra savings without sacrifice.
Higher stock prices also enhance the purchasing power of companies. Corporations whose stock is rising face a lower cost of capital and thus have extra resources to invest in new technology or expansion. Wall Street firms, where salaries and bonuses are closely tied to the issuing of new stocks and bonds, turn more open-handed.
Indeed, if the wealth effect is visible anywhere, it is in and around the nation's major financial centers, like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. And those are the same places where there are also heavy concentrations of affluent families with lots of investments in the market.
New York is typical. While the underlying economy in the metropolitan area remains tepid, there are plenty of signs of extra spending money among the upper crust in the crowded aisles at Barneys, hefty sales of luxury cars and expensive four-wheel-drive vehicles at local dealers, and the tighter summer rental market in some trendy beach communities.
"There are a lot of people looking at the higher end, over $1 million," said Patricia Patrillo, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty in Southampton, L.I. "The buyers are ready, willing and able."
And Karen Houghton, an interior designer in Nyack, N.Y., a suburb of New York City, said she saw evidence of the wealth effect in her own business. "Two of my clients who work for I.B.M. have been talking about putting extensions on their homes for five years," she said. "Now that I.B.M.'s stock is recovering, they're moving forward."
Trouble is, relative to the national economy, the impact from these kinds of case-by-case decisions is not enough to be decisive. Compared with other forces at work in the economy, from consumer confidence to changes in personal income to swings in business inventories, the impact of fatter stock portfolios is relatively modest.
How much does all this add up to? Laurence H. Meyer, president of a forecasting firm in St. Louis that bears his name, recently sent a note to clients predicting that the higher market -- provided it does not give back too much of the recent gains -- should inject roughly $22 billion in extra spending power into the economy this year. But while expressing confidence that the economy will avoid a recession, he nonetheless scaled back his estimates of future consumer outlays because of the weak job market.
"The economy would be weaker if not for the stock market," Mr. Meyer said. "But the bigger effect comes from lower interest rates," which are just beginning to work their way through the pipeline.
Economists at the Federal Reserve have developed a similar guideline, estimating that about 4 cents of every dollar in sustainable extra wealth eventually shows up in spending by consumers and business.
Many economists, starting in the 1950's with Milton Friedman, the winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, once thought the wealth effect carried a bigger wallop. But the stock market crash of 1987 changed all that. After a trillion dollars of wealth evaporated overnight, a lot of economists -- particularly those close to the epicenter on Wall Street -- predicted a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, if not an outright recession.
Instead, in part because the Federal Reserve moved quickly to counter the effects of the stock market crash by lowering interest rates, spending kept right on growing, and 1988 turned out to be a banner year in the long 1980's economic expansion.
In response to that event, many forecasters threw their wealth equations out the window or significantly scaled back their estimates of the impact on consumer spending from changes in the stock market.
"Traditionally, we had wealth variables in our models," said David Kelly, an economist at Lehman Brothers in Boston. "But the wealth effect was put to a very significant test in 1987 and failed miserably."
Why doesn't all that new-found wealth prompt more spending? Economists now point to three big reasons.
First, while a majority of Americans may hold stock through their pensions and other indirect means, four out of five households do not own any stock directly. For all the bullishness among investors, consumer confidence readings have been falling this year because most Americans are more affected by their own expectations about jobs and incomes than by reports of riches being reaped on Wall Street.
Second, many households that do own stock do not change their behavior much in response to changes in the value of their portfolios, particularly because they are aware that what goes up can also go down. Most stock is owned by the relatively affluent -- two-thirds of stock and mutual fund shares are owned by the top one-fifth of households -- who already tend to be high savers and do not alter their spending patterns simply because their accountants tell them they are worth more.
Finally, more and more stock is now held in various restricted ways, through individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and the like. The added wealth in those accounts cannot usually be tapped until retirement, unless the owner is prepared to pay a stiff penalty for the privilege.
In contrast to the relatively modest effect from stock market changes, rises and falls in real estate values appear to have a stronger impact. In the 1980's, real estate values and stock prices rose in tandem; that is much less true today.
"The effect of changes in equity prices is less than half the effect of a change in house prices," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. "If your house appreciates, you know it and you can borrow against it. If your debt goes up, you know it and you tighten your belt."
For all the current anxiety about the economy, however, there are other reasons than the buoyant stock market to look to for reassurance. After all, unemployment is still relatively low, income growth remains decent if unexciting, and long-term interest rates have fallen back to levels not seen in more than a year.
"Other things may save us," said Mr. Kelly of Lehman Brothers, "but I'm not sure it will be the wealth effect. Other forces are more important in reviving consumer spending than the gains you see in the stock market."

HEADLINE: Private Company Narrows Its Focus to 5 Hartford Schools

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 8

 BODY:
A private education company that gained national attention after signing a contract last year to manage this city's entire troubled public school system has narrowed its plans and now expects to concentrate on just 5 of the system's 32 schools this fall.
Faced with fierce opposition from teachers and parents, Education Alternatives Inc., has agreed with the Board of Education to take a go-slow approach. City officials said a company spending plan issued last month that called for hundreds of staff reductions and the possibility of larger class sizes sparked a revolt by parents and teachers that could not be contained. 
 "The budget was not acceptable and not do-able," said G. Stewart Murchee, a spokesman for Hartford's Mayor, Michael P. Peters, who supports the city's experiment.
Since Education Alternatives announced that it would take control of this large urban district, Hartford has been at the center of a national debate about whether private profit-making businesses can succeed where traditional public methods have failed. The new scaled down plan, education experts said today, coming on the heels of similar retrenchment earlier this year by another major education company, the Edison Project, underlines just how problematic these private ventures are, and how daunting the educational and political challenges are in big cities.
"They're finding out now what life is like in Hartford," said Henry M. Levin, a professor of education and economics at Stanford University.
Education Alternatives has faced other recent blows, including criticism this spring from the Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt L. Schmoke, who complained that school test scores were not improving rapidly enough in the company's schools there. The company's stock, traded publicly on the Nasdaq market, has also languished.
Education industry analysts who follow Education Alternatives said, however, that as with any emerging industry, a bumpy ride is inevitable.
"The biggest mistake this company makes is trying to do too much," said Michael T. Moe, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "But whether it's a more limited role in Hartford or not, if they can prove what they do, that is the important point."
Company officials said the modification, which still requires school board approval, was not a defeat, but simply a strategic move, and that the city's schools would still all be fully brought under Education Alternatives operation within the five-year contract. Five volunteer schools selected by the board the first year, for example, might be followed by a similar number or more in the 1996-1997 school year.
The company's chairman and chief executive officer, John T. Golle, said that opposition from the teachers' union and the "natural human reluctance to change" were the driving forces behind the move.
"People do not like to change regardless of what it is you're asking to do," Mr. Golle said in a telephone interview from one of the company's nine schools in Baltimore. "The majority of the reasons for an alternative implementation plan has to deal around the simple theory that seeing is believing."
Opponents of the company and its contract here said they believed that the company's whole operating premise, as well as its plans, could now be in question. Education Alternative's contract, for example, which was approved on a 6-to-3 vote by the Board of Education last year, will almost certainly need to be amended to permit a modified plan.
And if the negotiations drag on, the composition and attitude of the board could change. Of the six-member majority who favored the contract, four -- including the chairwoman, Thelma Dickerson -- are up for re-election this fall, according to Mr. Murchee, the mayoral aide.
The Hartford school system, which is expected to have about 24,000 students this fall, has also been shrinking, losing almost 2,000 students over the last two years. Education Alternatives has based some of its proposed budget numbers about staff reductions on those declining enrollments, but also on the expected savings from more efficient technology, like automated floor cleaning machines that can replace janitors using old-fashioned floor buffers.
The change also sets up the possibility of a two-tiered system of education in Hartford and a new arena in the battle that has raged here since talks with the company began last year. The five schools would get the full Education Alternatives package, called the "Tesseract" system, and would be operated as models intended to win over skeptics. But the 27 other schools would still be under the overall financial management of the company under the contract, Mr. Golle said. Education Alternatives would also still have an obligation to make all the schools clean and safe.
That could mean, Mr. Golle said, two different sets of standards for thousands of day-to-day decisions about management, staffing and maintenance. "Our standards as opposed to theirs," he said.
Private education companies around the country have stumbled in recent months. Mayor Schmoke of Baltimore said in calling for a renegotiation of his city's contract that a clause should be inserted requiring that if Education Alternatives was not able to meet certain test score standards, remedial help for students would have to come from the company's own profits.
"He was not satisfied by EAI's own numbers, that they were accomplishing what they in fact led him to believe that they could accomplish in terms of student performance," said the Mayor's press secretary, Clinton R. Coleman, in an interview today.
The Edison Project, founded by the media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle, has also substantially rescaled at least its pace. The company had originally planned to operate private schools around the country and promised that the first 100 would open by the fall of 1996. The emphasis subsequently shifted to managing public schools under contract, and officials said this spring that the company is planning to begin managing only perhaps three or four schools fall.
Believers in the new industry, including Mr. Moe at Lehman Brothers, said that 200 years of momentum and tradition are hard to overcome, but that bringing greater efficiency to local schools is an inevitability that will ultimately benefit students.
Professor Levin at Stanford said he believed it was simply too early to tell because none of the companies has any track record.
"They're learning reality, basically," he said. "But they're learning it at taxpayer expense."
Mr. Golle, Education Alternative's chairman, said the learning would result in a better product.
"Are we going to get to the same place at the same point in time? The answer is yes," he said. "Are we going to get there a different way? Yes, and quite frankly I think a better way."

HEADLINE: Budget Conferees Gather, But Not Really to Confer

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The Senate-House conference committee on the Federal budget met for the first time today, and this much was settled:
*Democrats will have no role whatsoever in working out the differences between the House and Senate budget resolutions passed last month. 
 *Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, does not know how to pronounce the name of his counterpart in the House, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio.
*The senators on the conference committee do not know who many of the House members are.
None of that is surprising. Today's session was not meant for anything but speechmaking. The real work of the conference will take place in private beginning next week.
So what was not settled was any of the difference between the two budget measures, each of which establishes a framework for Government spending and taxes that is supposed to lead to a balanced budget by 2002.
Senator Domenici, who is the chairman of the conference committee because it is the Senate's turn to sit in the chair, said that the committee staffs would work over the weekend to try to pare differences and that the conferees would reconvene when it was convenient for both sides next week.
The overriding issue before the conference is taxes.
The House approved a tax cut of $350 billion over the next seven years, including a $500-a-child tax credit, which would go into effect next year, for all but the very richest and very poorest families.
The Senate's tax cut, estimated at $170 billion, would be contingent on annual findings by the Congressional Budget Office that the promise of a balanced budget had led to lower interest rates and improvements in the nation's economy. Only $3 billion could be cut next year, and most of the tax reduction in the Senate measure would not come until after the turn of the century.
On most other issues, the Senate and House negotiators can probably simply split the difference between the spending figures the two houses approved.
As for the role of the Democrats, the Republican leaders made no secret that the minority would be frozen out of the negotiations, just as Republicans were excluded when Democrats controlled Congress.
"We're not likely to know what's going on until we see a final document," said Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Their irrelevance to the process did not stop the Democrats from making long-winded speeches today. "Both Republican budgets would tilt government radically in favor of the rich and powerful," asserted Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, setting forth the dominant Democratic view.
Senator Domenici's repeated mispronunciation of Representative Kasich's name -- he called him KAY-sitch instead of KAY-sick -- might be seen as a sign of disrespect coming from someone else. But Mr. Domenici, a wizard with numbers, is well known for having a problem with names. For example, he often refers to Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as Senator Judd.
Mr. Domenici is somewhat better with symbols. Referring to Thomas Jefferson's famous description of the difference in roles between the Senate and the House, he held up a cup of coffee and said that the fidgety and frenetic Mr. Kasich was like the piping hot coffee and that he himself was the cool saucer.
But he said to Mr. Kasich, "I am as passionate about this as you are."
While Mr. Domenici was speaking, other senators were paging through Congressional picture books trying to place the representatives who were sitting on the other side of the table.
In the past, only senior lawmakers generally served on conference committees. But these are new times. The Republicans in the House named several freshmen as negotiators, which explains why the senators did not recognize them.
The budget resolutions under consideration by the conference are only a starting point. Once a compromise on the resolutions is approved, the real heavy duty will begin as Congress begins making the actual policy decisions to meet the spending targets set by the resolution.
As a first step in that process, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told each of his 13 subcommittees today how much money they could allocate next year for the programs under their jurisdiction.
At this stage, President Clinton has no role. But he will ultimately have a strong voice in the outcome. Mr. Domenici expressed recognition of that at the end of today's session.
"Mr. President," the Senator declared, "you will be a player, sooner or later, and if you choose later, you can destroy everything we've done with a veto. I don't presume we have votes to override it.
"But we're going to get there," Mr. Domenici continued. "We're going to do something very, very significant."

HEADLINE: Holdup Man Who Killed Is Executed

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HUNTSVILLE, Tex., June 8

 BODY:
An unemployed high school dropout was executed by injection at the state prison here early today for killing a young woman during a holdup at a fast-food restaurant 10 years ago.
The 34-year-old prisoner, Ronald Allridge, had no final statement. But just before they entered the death chamber to be at his side, three of his brothers handed a reporter a note, written by one of them on the back of a lottery ticket, that said, "I hope y'all are happy!" 
 The brothers then stood holding hands a few feet away as the lethal drugs began flowing into the prisoner. After nine minutes, he was pronounced dead.
Mr. Allridge was executed for killing Carla McMillen, 19, who was eating a meal with two friends at a Whataburger restaurant in Fort Worth one night in 1985 when Mr. Allridge and two other men burst in and announced a holdup. Although Ms. McMillen threw up her hands, Mr. Allridge fired his gun at close range.
"His whole appeal was, 'Gosh, it was an accident,' " said Sharen Wilson, the prosecutor who handled the Allridge case. "But it was no accident that he had it pointed directly at the center of her chest. We're not talking about some guy who maybe didn't do it."
Mr. Allridge's final appeal was rejected by the United States Supreme Court three weeks ago, and a request from his lawyer for a 30-day reprieve or a commuted sentence of 1,000 years in prison was denied on Wednesday by Gov. George W. Bush.
Prosecutors said Mr. Allridge, who had previously served less than six years of a 10-year sentence for killing a Fort Worth high school student, had confessed to at least 20 holdups.

HEADLINE: Waging Trade War With Fax and Figures

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
Somewhere in this city there is a lobbyist whose firm has not been hired by one side or the other in America's trade confrontation with Japan. "There is one, I think, but no one knows his name," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said not long ago.
And somewhere there is a facsimile machine in Washington not spitting out dire warnings of a "trade war" and totaling up the "casualties," as if the Bosnians were shooting car parts at one another. Just today Toyota issued its latest count of the "innocent victims" of the threatened virtual embargo on Japanese luxury cars, chiefly the dealerships and employees who handle that company's Lexus line. 
 "The punitive tariff will be fatal," declared Yale Geiszl, the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., opening up all eight cylinders in what has turned into a contest of ever-escalating hyperbole.
This has been going on for weeks, of course, ever since the Clinton Administration set June 28 as the deadline for Japan to relent on opening its market or watch the sales of its most profitable export models come to a screeching halt in the American market. But today the decibel level reached new heights as Mr. Kantor's office held a hearing -- owners of luxury car dealerships called it a "kangaroo court" -- about the economic benefits and the harm of the proposed 100 percent tariff.
By late this afternoon, opponents of the tariffs were swarming on a sidewalk in downtown Washington, angry that after a day of hearings not one of them had yet testified. The trade representative's panel had broken for dinner after hearing nothing but praise all day for Mr. Kantor's strategy, from the Big Three auto makers, from sympathetic members of Congress, even from a retired auto worker.
"They broke to keep us off the 7 o'clock news," fumed Richard N. Kull, who represents the council of Acura dealers, who handle the Honda Motor Company's high-end line. "This is completely rigged."
Mr. Kull is one of the many dealers who argue that the sanctions will hurt Americans far more than they will hurt the Japanese, costing his employees their jobs. Everyone pointed to Sean G. Traynor, the president of Garden State Tanning, a leather-goods maker that produces the seats that Lexus owners sink into when they get into their cars. He has already laid off 650 workers at his factory in Williamsport, Md., but he said today that he might be able to hire back "a few hundred" because Toyota has restored some orders -- perhaps out of faith that the trade dispute will be short-lived.
Missing from the hearing, not surprisingly, were the Japanese. Save for some reporters from the big Japanese newspapers, there was hardly a Japanese face in the jammed hearing room, part of the opponents' strategy of demonstrating that the sanctions are putting people out of work in Chicago, not Osaka.
But the dealers dismissed any suggestion that the Japanese Government should bail them out of their economic troubles. "The Government of Japan, quite frankly, doesn't care about Lexus dealers," one said. "Why should they? It's not their workers."
Mr. Kantor and his colleagues in the Administration anticipated objections to the sanctions, of course, and followed a strategy intended to limit assertions that they were undercutting American jobs. The target cars are all made in Japan and have few American parts. That leaves the dealers as the primary American casualties, and the Administration is betting that they will not attract much public sympathy: car dealers, new or used, rarely do.
No one expects the hearing here, which continued into the night, to have the slightest effect on the decision the Administration must make on June 28. But in the multibillion-dollar game of chicken now under way, it is a means for both sides to increase the pressure on the other.
The Japanese car makers and their business affiliates here have to make the case that Mr. Kantor's effort to minimize the economic impact of the sanctions on Americans has failed. The Administration is out to prove that the economic benefits of opening the Japanese market to American cars and parts vastly outweighs whatever temporary effect the collapse of sales of Japanese luxury cars might have in the United States.
Without question, though, the lobbyists and the lawyers are the great winners so far, at least here in Washington. For them, the ultimate nightmare would be a cessation of trade hostilities between Tokyo and Washington. Fortunately for them, economists agree that the $66 billion trade gap will be little affected no matter how the current dispute comes out.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall Hard Again As Rate-Cut Hopes Recede

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Fading expectations of a cut in interest rates anytime soon caused prices of Treasury securities to pull back sharply for a second consecutive day yesterday.
Lawrence B. Lindsay, a governor of the Federal Reserve, said yesterday that the economy was not likely to slip into a recession though it faced 18 months of slow growth. On Wednesday, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he expected an economic recovery in the second half of the year, and the vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, said he expected a quick adjustment by businesses to the slower economy. The comments have been interpreted by the market to mean that the Fed would not move soon to cut short-term interest rates. 
 The 30-year bond fell 23/32 , to a price of 1136/32 for a yield of 6.61 percent, up from 6.55 percent on Wednesday.
Treasuries sold off a bit after the release of the weekly jobless claims data, and on talk that foreign central banks were selling five- and ten-year notes in the market.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that while the market appeared to be waiting for today's producer price results, "I suspect that even if we get terribly constructive inflation numbers the market will likely not discount them into prices" because of the expectation of an eventual easing by the Fed.
Ms. Schaja said she believed that if people thought the economy was truly weak, then the inflation numbers would be less critical. "Next week's consumer numbers at this moment are more important in the eyes of the financial market than today's producer price data," she said.
The Producer Price Index, she said, looks as if it will be up four-tenths of a percent, with the core rate up two-tenths of a percent. In April, the index was up five-tenths of a percent and the core up three-tenths of a percent.
She said she expected that even if the producer number came in as expected there might still be some nervousness in the market. "There's a general sense that some investors are at a crossroads and so any weak inflation numbers in their eyes would move up the timetable for the next easing," she said.
The jobless claims data yesterday for the week ended June 3 showed 372,000 claims, down by 7,000 from the previous week's figure, which was revised to 379,000 from 382,000. But the four-week moving average rose by 1,000 claims, to 374,500.
Looking ahead, Ms. Schaja said she expected the economic data for May and June to fit the weak economic picture given the recent May employment report and purchasing management reports. "The question is whether it will signal whether the Fed was right about slow growth caused by inventory, or that the data signaled that it is more of a slowdown in final sales," she said.
In the municipal market, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was able to sell one-year general obligation notes at lower-than-expected yields because of a shrinking supply of new short-term securities and even while municipal bonds fell on concern that the rally in the market was beginning to slow.
The $240 million Massachusetts Bay debt offering through competitive bidding that was won by BT Securities, with the notes due June 12, 1996, was priced to yield 3.45 percent, or about 25 basis points better than the Los Angeles County's one-year notes sold the day before.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Growing Inventories of Wood Send Lumber Prices Tumbling

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices tumbled yesterday by as much as allowed in a single day, falling to two-and-a-half-year lows on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Wood inventories are growing in a sagging housing market.
Prices tumbled after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, implied on Wednesday that he did not expect to cut interest rates despite the slowing economy, analysts said. 
 About 70 percent of American lumber is used in building. Mortgage rates have fallen in recent months, but many consumers are not buying homes because of pessimism brought on by seven interest rate increases since February 1994.
"The market's still trying to digest the unfolding reality of a weaker-than-expected housing market," said Michael Young, a partner in the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. "The bottom line is that there's too much wood around and there's no way to hold the price in the face of weaker demand."
On other commodity markets, near-term cotton futures advanced for a second day and gasoline futures plunged. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.08 point, to 233.71.
Lumber for July delivery settled $10 lower at $224.60 for 1,000 board feet, erasing gains made on Tuesday and Wednesday as traders bet that interest rates would decline, which would encourage housing construction.
Futures prices fell to new contract lows in step with commercial prices, which tumbled as low as $185 for 1,000 board feet from highs of about $400 during the construction boom a year ago.
July cotton futures rose 1.55 cents a pound, to $1.13, and the new-crop October contract advanced 1.16 cents, to 90.18 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Prices were affected by an infestation of beet army worms in Texas, and experts fear that the United States may run out of cotton by October because of high demand and extremely tight supplies. But many European and American mills have curtailed production because commercial prices are sharply higher. An analyst, Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch, said record amounts of the crop should be available by December because more farmers planted cotton this year because of high demand.
July gasoline futures plummeted 0.93 cent a gallon, to 60.84 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid waning fears of tight supplies this summer.
Prices climbed to three-year highs on speculation that more Americans will stay in the country this year because of the weak dollar, which means a likely increase in demand for vacation driving. But the higher prices led to increased gas production, a report from the American Petroleum Institute found.
American production climbed 8.2 percent, the institute said, although inventories of reformulated gas fell. Prices also fell on reports of 10 cargoes of imported gasoline arriving for East Coast use in late June.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germans Deflate Rate Rumor, And Dollar Ebbs Late in Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose early in the day, then fell against other leading currencies yesterday, in thin, volatile trading after conflicting signals from European central banks.
It strengthened early in the day after the Dutch and Belgian central banks reduced interest rates, leading some traders to expect that the German central bank, the most influential in Europe, would follow with a rate reduction. 
 Indeed, the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, had hinted at a cut on Wednesday at an international monetary conference in Seattle. Such an action might steer investors away from assets denominated in marks and other European currencies, making the dollar more valuable.
But the vice president of the German bank, Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, said yesterday that there would be no immediate cut in rates. That sent the dollar falling again.
"I think it was clutching at straws," Chris Iggo, an international economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said of the market's behavior. The volatile market, he said, had seen "no real trend," and adding, "We've been moving sideways all this week."
The dollar's movement against the Japanese yen yesterday largely followed the trading in the mark.
Late in the day in New York, the dollar stood at 1.4072 marks, down from 1.4147 marks on Wednesday. It slipped to 84.68 yen from 84.88.
The foreign-currency markets have been groping for direction in the absence of any significant economic data this week. They have also been influenced by the notion that the leading industrial nations of the Group of Seven, which will meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, next week, will reaffirm support for a stable dollar.
David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in New York, said this lack of direction had led some traders to reassess the policies of the Federal Reserve.
On Wednesday the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that while there was a chance of a brief recession, the likelihood of a long one had "decreased very significantly." Currency traders took his comments to mean that the Fed would stand pat on interest rates. The dollar has slumped on concerns that the slowing United States economy would force the Fed to cut rates. Lower rates tend to weaken the dollar by making deposits denominated in it less attractive.
Mr. Greenspan's comments helped drive the dollar higher in Asian trading early yesterday.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall for a Third Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by 7,000 last week. It was the second drop in three weeks.
The Labor Department said today that first-time applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 372,000 in the week ended last Saturday, down from a substantially revised 379,000 a week earlier. 
 Claims in the week ending May 27, originally estimated to be 389,000, were first thought to have risen by 9,000. The revision showed they actually dropped 1,000. The department said initial data reported during weeks that contain a Monday holiday -- such as those reported on Tuesday after the Memorial Day holiday -- tend to be subject to large revisions.

HEADLINE: Give Them an Alternative to the Drug Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Die-hard Congressional opponents of overseas development assistance, and their "doubting Thomas" colleagues, would do well to consider your June 2 front-page report on Mexico's long-ignored Tarahumara Indians.
Once again, the drug trade is filling a convenient economic vacuum created by "poverty and marginalization." 
 It's a familiar story. Yet there are successful alternatives to this sad scenario -- preventive remedies to drug trafficking that deserve the renewed support of Congress.
After all, when it comes to the American people and foreign aid, we advocate "helping people to help themselves," which is exactly what Agency for International Development programs do.
A good example: low-cost initiatives promoting micro- and small enterprises, such as those designed to combat coca-growing in the Andes.
Thanks to a modest investment made just a few years ago in credit, training, technology and marketing assistance, thousands of formerly marginalized alpaca herders are now linked to the very lucrative and legal global market for high-quality fiber -- and are generating close to 10 percent of Bolivia's fiber exports.
As an international traveler and former Republican member of the House of Representatives, I believe in getting the biggest bang for my buck; I also know a good investment when I see one.
For the world to be a safer place for all of us, it needs more development initiatives targeting the world's poor and rural majority, not less.

HEADLINE: City Shortfall Even Worse Than Forecast

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Just hours after lawmakers in Albany finally adopted a state budget, a grim reality settled over City Hall: New York City will receive $670 million less in state assistance than requested -- far less than expected even a week ago.
The shortfall left Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and leaders of the City Council staring down at an enormous and potentially contentious task: Finding other ways to plug this gaping hole in the budget with only three weeks to go before the city's new fiscal year begins on July 1. 
 The Mayor has already proposed $400 million in cuts to highly visible municipal services -- from libraries to day-care centers -- contingent on Albany's failure to give him the money he needs. The Council has vowed to fight most of those. But the new reality is that even if all of the contingency cuts were accepted, the Mayor would still be $271 million short.
"It's a crisis, and it's time to start dealing with it," said Michael S. Clendenin, spokesman for the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat. "No one should pretend otherwise."
At a City Hall news conference Mr. Giuliani declined to acknowledge the scope of the shortfall. And neither he nor Council leaders would detail what additional actions the city would now take to cover it.
"There are a lot of options," the Mayor said, "and when we're ready to announce them we will. Otherwise I pre-empt our negotiations on the matter."
Instead, he tried to put the best interpretation on the news.
He praised Gov. George E. Pataki and the Republicans of the State Senate for delivering "a substantial amount of what we were asking for." He then sharply attacked the Democrats in the Assembly for having failed to come to the city's aid.
The Democrats in Albany, echoing their colleagues on the City Council, in turn chastised the Mayor, saying his lobbying strategy had failed. They said he had alienated the Assembly, which has historically protected the city's interests, by embracing Governor Pataki's budget.
The state budget numbers dealt a serious blow to Mr. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor who first endorsed Mario M. Cuomo for re-election last fall and then embraced Mr. Pataki's budget cutting.
Earlier this year, the Mayor had hoped to save $1.2 billion from the new Governor's reductions in Medicaid and welfare spending, but the expectation has dwindled ever since. Three months ago, Mr. Giuliani insisted that he would still get $1 billion in savings; by late April, it was $950 million, and as late as Wednesday, he said the city stood to receive as much as $600 million, or "not way beyond the range that we anticipated."
Instead, the city received about $400 million in savings, according to the Council's estimate. The state cuts in Medicaid allowed the city to save only $373 million of the $500 million that Mr. Giuliani had proposed. (Each dollar cut by the state allows the city to cut a roughly equal share.)
Nor did the city receive any of $250 million in direct aid the Mayor had sought. And the state cuts in welfare -- most of them from strengthening eligibility screening and rooting out fraud -- saved the city nothing, the Council said, since the Mayor had already assumed savings from those measures.
The rest of the shortfall came from the city's failure to win approval for legislative changes that would limit its liability in lawsuits, among other things.
The size of the shortfall almost certainly means that the Mayor and the Council will have to consider deeper cuts in spending for municipal services. Any new cuts would fall on top of $800 million in reductions to the city's agencies and $600 million in savings from the municipal unions that are already in the Mayor's budget, even though the Mayor's office has yet to negotiate.
The city could turn to one-shot actions used in the past, like tapping surpluses, refinancing debt or selling assets. But a major bond rater, Standard & Poors, has already warned that it will lower the city's credit rating if such measures are resorted to again. And the present rating, A-, is already among the lowest for any major city.
"The one thing everyone agrees on is that the Mayor and the city lost big-time," said City Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn. Of the budget talks ahead, he added, "Now it's back to the same routine we've had for years -- except there are fewer options."
One possible way to soften the blow of the state shortfall would be to revise the city's forecast tax revenues. The Council has urged the Mayor's office to increase projected revenues by $112 million, based on its own economic forecasts, a senior Council official said. And Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Democrat and chairman of the Council's finance committee, said the onus was now on the Mayor to propose alternatives to balance the budget. "They've spoken through their budget," Mr. Berman said of the Mayor and his aides. "Now they'll have to deal with that."
With a state budget now in place, the talks between the Mayor and the Council will intensify in the next few days. Around City Hall, as Council members huddled in internal briefings, the mood seemed relentlessly bleak.
Even the Council's seven Republicans, who are often at odds with the Democratic majority, agreed that the size of the state shortfall meant pain for the city, although they laid the blame entirely on the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver.
The Mayor, despite this large new hole in his budget proposal, said the dire warnings of service cuts were exaggerated. "Although it's going to be tough," he said, "we're not in a position where anything extraordinary will happen."

HEADLINE: Japanese Are in Rush to Sell Their Real Estate in the U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8

 BODY:
Japanese companies, which unleashed one of the biggest international flows of investment ever when they flooded the United States with capital during the 1980's, are selling off many of their American assets with growing haste in a critical area, real estate, a new survey shows.
The trickle of sales of troubled real estate projects turned into a wave of auctions and negotiations last year, according to an annual survey by the E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group here. Japanese investors, according to estimates in the report, sold or were on the verge of selling $6.4 billion worth of American property last year, and could sell as much as $10 billion more this year. 
 By comparison, Japanese companies were net sellers of less than $3 billion of American property in 1993.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the selloff is the fact that Japanese companies are suffering huge losses in the process. The report estimates that the properties being sold, mostly hotels, resorts and office buildings, are fetching only about 60 percent of what the Japanese companies had paid for them.
For instance, Japan's Sazale Group was recently reported to have sold the Hotel Bel Air, a romantic retreat filled with lush ginger plants and bougainvillea, to a member of the royal family of Brunei for about $60 million; Sazale had acquired the hotel in 1989 for $110 million.
That is why some experts say even more Japanese companies would like to unload their properties, but do not because they cannot afford to realize the losses. "Much of what can happen depends on the capability of the company to absorb a loss," said Kenji Ogawa, head of the real estate finance group here for the Bank of Tokyo. "Not all companies are in a position to do that."
The selloff is part of a large-scale retrenchment by Japanese companies. In the span of a decade, many Japanese companies went from ebullient international investors -- paying unheard of prices for everything from universities in Australia to Rockefeller Center -- to financial cripples because of Japan's recession and their reckless practices.
The Mitsubishi Estate Company has thrown Rockefeller Center into bankruptcy court. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company has sold 80 percent of its interest in MCA, the owner of Universal Studios, at a big loss. And the Sony Corporation, which purchasedColumbia Pictures in 1989, has suffered huge losses on the studio and has spoken with other companies about selling a stake.
"This has not left any particularly lasting impact," said Paul Alston, a lawyer in Honolulu who has worked with Japanese companies on several real estate transactions there, particularly hotels. "They came in, paid huge prices and were unrealistic about what they could get in room rates. The market has now taken care of that." Sixty percent of the American real estate sold by Japanese interests last year was in California or Hawaii.
To put the sales in perspective, during the peak years for purchases, 1987 through 1990, Japanese companies acquired $57 billion worth of American property, according to the Kenneth Leventhal estimates.
The Japanese property selloff comes at a time when investment from other foreign countries is rising sharply. The Commerce Department said this week that foreign investors, mostly Europeans, spent $47.2 billion last year buying American businesses and properties, up 80 percent from 1993.
First and foremost, the Kenneth Leventhal report said, the property sales are generally motivated not just by the financial problems at the companies that own them, but by their bankers. And that means the Japanese Government, with great influence over the financial sector, is a major player in the strategy.
For the most part, the properties have been losing money from the time they were purchased, but the bankers were willing to continue to provide financing in the hopes that eventually the property markets here would recover. The Finance Ministry strongly encouraged this strategy because it fiercely resists permitting banks to post losses. Such losses would reduce their tax bills.
But Japan's banking crisis has deepened in the last several years. The Finance Ministry, after long denying the problem was that bad, has now conceded that Japanese banks are carrying more than $400 billion in bad loans. Most of the bad loans involve Japanese real estate.
The Japanese Government has recognized that holding on to the bad loans is paralyzing the banks and squelching their overall lending by keeping their capital tied up in assets that produce no interest income.
Recently, the Finance Ministry has begun to permit banks to bite the bullet, sell off some properties and take their losses to begin the recovery process. That is regarded as a key factor behind the real estate sales in the United States.

HEADLINE: Riots by Vietnamese Erode Plan to Send Them Home

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, June 8

 BODY:
An international plan to end the 20-year sojourn of the Vietnamese boat people and force the last of them back to their homeland is in danger of unraveling after riots by the Vietnamese in detention camps across Southeast Asia.
Refugee workers say the riots show that it will be impossible to deport many of the 40,000 Vietnamese in the camps without violence. The once-steady flow of boat people volunteering to return to Vietnam has evaporated, at least in part because of moves by Republicans in the United States Congress to offer thousands of them asylum. 
As a result, refugee workers say the detention camps may have to remain for years as Asian governments, fearing more bloodshed and an outcry from human rights organizations, give up on their plans to force the Vietnamese home.
Just today, the riot police in Hong Kong fired tear gas at a group of nearly 50 Vietnamese boat people protesting their imminent deportation to Vietnam. There were no reports of injuries, although the kitchen and an adjacent office at the High Island Detention Center were set on fire by the Vietnamese before the protest could be ended.
On Monday, the riot police in Malaysia fired water cannon and tear gas to force back more than 1,000 boat people who broke out of a camp on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, the capital, to protest the Government's plans for their imminent repatriation.
Many of the Vietnamese protesters were armed with knives, and the Malaysian police say that after the riot, they seized daggers, swords, spears, bows and other weapons from the camp, where more than 4,000 Vietnamese are detained.
Twenty Vietnamese were detained by the police on charges of rioting. And while police spokesmen said no one was wounded in the clash, reporters outside the camp saw at least two men with bleeding injuries, possibly self-inflicted. Many of the Vietnamese here have repeatedly threatened to commit suicide rather than go home.
"Until now the situation has been peaceful," said Erika Feller, regional representative in Kuala Lumpur for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "But I think violence, at least low-level violence, is becoming a threat."
The United States has endorsed an international agreement intended to close most of the detention camps by the end of the year by encouraging the last Vietnamese still left in the camps to go back home voluntarily -- and, if that fails, by deporting them forcibly.
Virtually all of the Vietnamese left in the detention camps in Asia -- there are large camps in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia -- have been declared economic migrants, not political refugees, and therefore have no right to asylum under international law.
But the difficulty of carrying out the so-called Comprehensive Plan of Action has been compounded by legislation now under debate in the United States Congress that could result in offers of asylum to as many as 20,000 Vietnamese.
Republican sponsors of the legislation, which has been approved in the House of Representatives but is facing a veto by President Clinton, say many of the Vietnamese in the camps have reason to fear persecution, even imprisonment, if they are forced to return to their homeland.
Some human rights campaigners agree. A study by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, based in New York, found that "hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Vietnamese refugees have been wrongly rejected" for asylum.
The United Nations, which employs investigators in Vietnam to monitor conditions of the 70,000 Vietnamese who have already gone home voluntarily, insists that it has been unable to document a single case of Government harassment of the returning Vietnamese.
News of the recent Congressional moves has begun to circulate in the detention camps throughout Asia, and refugee workers say it has given many of the boat people reason to believe that their protests -- even violent protests -- could help them achieve their dream of citizenship in the United States.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which runs the detention camps throughout Southeast Asia, has blamed the Congressional debate for a huge riot last month in one Hong Kong camp.
Nearly 200 people, most of them police officers, were wounded in the protest against deportation. It was the most violent clash between the Hong Kong police and the Vietnamese since Hong Kong's colonial government opened camps for the boat people in the 1970's, when the Vietnamese began taking to rickety boats and pushing off into the South China Sea in hopes of escaping their Communist homeland.
The United Nations has also blamed the legislation for having ended the flow of Vietnamese willing to volunteer to return home under a program in which they are each given a payment of several hundred dollars.
The United Nations scheduled a charter flight last week for 270 Vietnamese in Hong Kong who had volunteered to go home. But the flight had to be canceled when all but four of the Vietnamese announced that they had changed their minds.
"They clearly told us that they wanted to await the outcome of the Congressional debate in Washington," said Jahanshah Assadi, the chief of mission in Hong Kong for the High Commissioner for Refugees. "I hope the damage to the repatriation program is not irreparable, but we have very tangible evidence of people being affected by what's going on in Washington."
Ms. Feller, the United Nations official in Kuala Lumpur, said she was certain that the American legislation was "an important factor" in the clash here on Monday. "The Vietnamese," she said, "have asked us point blank: Does this legislation mean that we're going to be able to go to the United States?"

Japan Announces Package To Deal With Banks' Crisis

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8

 BODY:
Describing Japan's banking crisis as the worst since the Great Depression, Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura today announced a rescue package aimed at restoring confidence in the financial system, but the plan contained few concrete steps.
Although Mr. Takemura called the package "bold and aggressive," analysts said they were skeptical that the plan would help stimulate lending and investment and thereby re-ignite the sagging economy. 
 "Meaningless, in a word," said David M. Atkinson, banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd. And David Threadgold, a bank analyst at BZW Securities (Japan) Ltd., compared the package to "rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic."
By the Government's estimate, Japan's ailing banking system is awash in bad debt amounting to at least 40 trillion yen, or $470 billion, which would make the banking sector's problems more serious than the savings and loan crisis in the United States. Other estimates put the figure as high as $1 trillion or more.
The rescue package was also billed as part of an overall strategy to stabilize the yen, which has risen 15 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year.
Analysts said the package, which is to cover a five-year period, was useful in that it demonstrated the Government's commitment to the financial system, a commitment that had been questioned recently. Still, the general verdict was that the measures announced today were grossly inadequate to restructure the banking system.
The Finance Ministry did not offer any of its own funds as part of the rescue package. Instead, it said that the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, would be authorized over the next five years to make "special" loans to bankrupt lenders, with conditions attached, such as the resignation of top management.
The use of taxpayer money to finance the banking system has been a sensitive issue because many Japanese blame the banks partly for the current recession and would not like to see public funds channeled to the institutions.
The nation's banks often lent recklessly during the 1980's and helped push speculative property and stock prices to phenomenal heights. But the so-called bubble economy collapsed five years ago, puncturing those inflated prices, and many real estate loans went sour.
The Government's estimate of $470 billion in bad loans represents 5.7 percent of total outstanding loans. The figure is equivalent to 8.5 percent of Japan's economic output in 1994.
While Mr. Takemura, the Finance Minister, did not directly allocate any public funds, he did call for a national debate on the possible use of taxpayer money to bail out banks. But one Japanese analyst said it would be difficult for the ministry to commit to using any public money before the elections in July.
In any case, the special loans would act as a temporary mechanism while the Government expanded the Deposit Insurance Corporation, an agency that guarantees depositors' funds, up to a ceiling, in the event of a bank failure.
The problem with the agency is that it has little money and has never been used. It is expected to take five years to prop up the agency so that it could be used if a bank collapsed.
Financial disclosure by banking institutions in Japan is unusually weak for such a large banking system, so depositors have little means by which to evaluate bank creditworthiness. The ministry said it intended to increase disclosure.
Some analysts interpreted such steps as a sign that the Government was trying to create a system for allowing banks to fail. "It's good they are laying the groundwork," said David Snoddy, a bank analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.
But it is unclear whether the ministry would actually let a bank collapse. Instead, analysts said, the ministry would be much more likely to fall back on the usual methods of forcing healthy banks to acquire ailing ones. In fact, the ministry said it would encourage that option as part of the rescue package.
Japan's financial authorities are acutely sensitive to doubts about their ability to fully support the banking system. That is why Moody's Investors Service last month is said to have angered the Finance Ministry when it put three Japanese banks under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's cited, among other reasons, uncertainty about Japan's ability to safeguard stability in the banking system.
Some banks have taken their own action by writing off portions of their bad debt, and even posting losses for the fiscal year that ended March 31. But many banks have not yet disposed of much of their bad debt.
The ministry indicated today that one-quarter of the nonperforming loans at the nation's 21 money-center banks would probably have to be written off. Nonperforming loans, on which interest has not been paid for six months, total 12.5 trillion yen at those banks, the ministry said.
Analysts said that because today's measures were not likely to solve the banking crisis, they were unlikely to help stabilize the yen. Some analysts argued that because the banks were plagued by a morass of bad debt, they were not very willing to promote lending, especially amid the uncertain economic environment. Lending has declined over the last year.
Without easy credit, the economy cannot fully recover, imports will not grow enough to significantly cut the trade surplus, and the yen will not weaken against the dollar.
Other analysts said that the real culprit in prolonging the recession was the real estate market. Only by reorganizing the real estate market, which accounts for a large portion of the economy, could the authorities then address the banking system, the analysts said. Problems in the real estate market, including prices that are about one-third below their peak and still slipping, are hampering the climate for investment and lending.

HEADLINE: Japan Deserves A Tariff

BYLINE: By Lawrence Chimerine and James Fallows; Lawrence Chimerine is chief economist of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization. James Fallows, Washington editor of The Atlantic Monthly, is author of "Looking at the Sun," about East Asian capitalism.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Although European and Asian governments have complained about the Clinton Administration's regrettable but justified proposal to place tariffs of 100 percent on 13 Japanese-made cars, most agree that Japanese trade barriers threaten the world trading system.
Debate in America on the issue has been more primitive. Many free-market economists, some pundits and lobbyists for Japanese and for some European interests question whether there is even a problem to be solved. 
 Mercifully, most have spared us the old argument that simply driving down the value of the dollar will eliminate trade imbalances. The dollar has lost two-thirds of its value against the yen in the last decade, yet trade between Japan and the United States has been remarkably unchanged, even though American products are much cheaper.
But we are hearing equally tired assertions, which rest on a misleading appearance of economic sophistication. The principal claim is that Americans import too much and save too little and that the Japanese do the reverse. But this supposed insight into the trade imbalance does not tell us which is the cause and which is the effect.
Most economists take it for granted that our low savings rate causes chronic, large trade deficits, because when we spend too heavily, we inevitably buy huge quantities of foreign goods. Yet it is just as proper to argue the reverse -- that the large trade deficits caused by artificial barriers to American exports help create the low savings rate. This happens because reduced exports to, say, Japan mean smaller payrolls and profits at home. With less money earned, less is saved. And less is paid in taxes, driving up the Federal deficit and further depressing savings (because the Government borrows to finance the deficit).
The existence of formidable Japanese trade barriers is indisputable. Studies by the Economic Strategy Institute and other research groups estimate that if Japan's markets behaved like those of other industrialized countries, Japan would import up to $200 billion more in goods each year than it now does; of this, almost $50 billion would come from the United States.

The United States should raise its savings rate to limit reliance on foreign capital and to encourage productive investment -- the key to vigorous long-term growth. But even if we do, we are likely to have a trade problem with Japan unless Japan changes. South Korea and Singapore, whose savings rates are even higher than Japan's, also have large trade deficits with Japan.
Another faulty assertion in the debate over imposing a punitive tariff on Japan is that we're only hurting ourselves. Some claim we should keep our markets open regardless of what anyone else does because any other course would hurt American consumers.
They ask, Why should we punish ourselves by paying more for a Lexus or an Infiniti? And they say, If the Japanese or other Asians want to penalize their own people by running a closed economy, that's their problem. We'll enjoy the benefit of bargain-priced goods.
But Americans need jobs and income to buy even bargain-priced goods. Countries that combine closed markets with aggressive exporting to the United States effectively cut the number of good American jobs and thus consumer income. Closed foreign markets also inhibit our producers from investing, supporting research and development and creating new jobs.
A third argument against the tariffon Japanese luxury cars is that American car companies brought their problems on themselves by being lazy and greedy and not making cars suitable for Japan's left-side driving. This is the oldest red herring of all. Our auto producers make millions of right-hand-drive models for other left-side markets like Britain's.
The real issue is the cartel-like structure that ties Japanese parts makers, auto companies and dealers together in networks that are hard for outsiders to penetrate, no matter how attractive their products are.
In the auto parts business, there is no question of "wrong side" spark plugs, microcontrollers or piston rings. At current exchange rates, many American-made auto parts sell for one-third the price of Japanese-made items. American-made parts are of such high quality that the nation has an auto-parts trade surplus with Europe, where they are heavily used by BMW, Mercedes and other demanding manufacturers.
Nonetheless, American parts have captured only 2 percent of the Japanese market. And Japanese-owned auto assembly plants in the United States use at most only 50 to 60 percent American-made parts.
Finally, the silliest assertion is that the Administration's tariff might lead countries to embrace managed trade -- government manipulation of international commerce for national advantage. In raising this warning, the Europeans and Japanese are being hypocritical -- and they know it.
The Europeans know it because their trade with Japan has long been managed in a Draconian way. Ever wonder why there are virtually no Japanese cars in France or Italy? It isn't because the Japanese are not trying hard enough or have the wrong steering wheels. It is because Europeans sharply limit the number of Japanese cars they will let in each year.
The Japanese know it because their own diplomats and foreign aid specialists advise the Thais, Russians, Indonesians and anyone else who will listen that careful controls on trade and capital are the best way to preserve an industrial base.

 America's economy has its own mass of trade regulations and subsidies. But its markets are the most open of all the big industrialized countries. Japan's are the least open.
Ever freer trade over the last four decades has helped much of the world prosper. If there is a threat to the continued progress of this movement, it comes from those who pretend that problems with free trade -- especially those created by the chronic American-Japanese trade imbalance -- do not exist.
The Administration is at least trying to deal with this problem, which, if unaddressed, will destroy American support for free trade in general. If those who are most concerned about saving the world trade system don't like the Clinton solution, let them come up with a better and more realistic approach.

HEADLINE: A Prince Charming?;
Disney and the City Find Each Other

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
It is not, at first glance, a marriage made in heaven: the Walt Disney Company, the entertainment giant with the family-values image, and New York City, the hard-edged metropolis.
 But a match it appears to be. For the last two years, Disney and New York have been courting, and all signs suggest that flirtation is turning into commitment. 
 Suddenly, Disney seems to be everywhere, with a superstore at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street to open by year's end, a festive premiere of "Pocahontas" tonight in Central Park and plans to help operate a huge hotel-entertainment-retail complex at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue. Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" has been running on Broadway for 14 months, and the company has plans to bring in a major new show every year.
 And next month, in a move that would cement the long-term relationship, the company is to decide whether to proceed with a $29 million plan to take over and renovate the largest abandoned theater on 42d Street, the New Amsterdam.
 A decision to move ahead, which senior Disney executives say is likely but not guaranteed, would be an extraordinary milestone in a two-decade effort by the city and state to reclaim the tawdry, rundown stretch of New York's most famous street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
 Disney's value to New York officials is clear. Although some have criticized the New Amsterdam deal as too sweet when the city is making broad cuts in education and social services, officials counter that Disney would create new jobs and tax revenues as well as provide the catalyst to revive 42d Street. The mere possibility that Disney might weave its wholesome magic on New York's most seamy strip has already caused other entertainment companies to rethink the block's potential.

 
 
A Departure, And a Gamble
 The lure of New York for Disney is more subtle.
 For Disney, New York represents a symbolic new direction, not to mention a calculated gamble with its image. While the company has opened more than 350 retail stores in recent years, including ones in London and Paris, it has not established a strong presence in an old urban center, as it is in New York. Rehabilitating the New Amsterdam Theater, a 92-year-old landmark, and creating a permanent base in the hurly-burly of Broadway would be a significant departure for a company that has preferred to create from scratch its own carefully controlled environments, far from the bustle and chaos of city centers.
 While Michael D. Eisner, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, says there is no formal strategy for New York, Disney's new passion for New York fits into larger plans to expand and diversify an already wide network. That Mr. Eisner grew up in the city -- at Park Avenue and 89th Street in Manhattan -- also figures in the mix.
 The company's most significant ambition in New York undoubtedly focuses on Broadway, where it wants to establish a permanent foothold as part of a broad venture into live entertainment. Disney intends to produce a new show annually, beginning in spring 1997, Mr. Eisner said, and to send touring companies of its latest Broadway hit around the country and beyond. Rather than renting theaters, he said, owning one would be more profitable.
 "We decided that the legitimate theater was a very desirable business for us," he said. "And to be a really legitimate theater producer, you have to be in New York."
 Many people who have tried for years to link Disney and the 42d Street renewal effort say that three people have been central to the effort to bring the company to New York: Mr. Eisner himself; the architect Robert A. M. Stern, who created design guidelines for much of the Times Square redevelopment, and Marian S. Heiskell, chairwoman of New 42d Street Inc., a nonprofit group overseeing the renovation of six old theaters on 42d Street.
 Mrs. Heiskell, an old friend of Mr. Eisner's, had tried intermittently, since he took over Disney in 1984, to interest him in creating a company presence in New York.
 Mr. Stern, also an old friend, first took Mr. Eisner to see the New Amsterdam Theater in 1993. The men had been meeting on a Friday in Mr. Stern's office, going over his architectural designs for a new town Disney is developing in Florida. They began talking about Disney's plans to mount a musical version of "Beauty and the Beast" on Broadway. Mr. Eisner mentioned that, if Disney were to make a long-term commitment to Broadway, it might as well buy a theater.
 "He knew I had been trying to get him interested in 42d Street," Mr. Stern said. The next morning, before the two men flew to Florida, Mr. Stern took Mr. Eisner to see the New Amsterdam. Combing through its crumbling interior, Mr. Eisner said, he sensed its former grandeur and began to get excited about restoring the theater and, with it, the neighborhood.
 Ten months later, Mr. Eisner was back in New York, this time in City Hall, to announce with delighted city and state officials the tentative agreement for Disney to renovate the theater.

 
 
Unfamiliar Waters For a Company
 If the company does sign a final agreement next month, Disney would be entering unfamiliar waters. Nurtured in Walt Disney's animation studios in the San Fernando Valley of California, the company came of age in the orange groves of Anaheim, where it built Disneyland, and in swampland in central Florida, where it created Walt Disney World.
 "They went to Orange County long before it was populated," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "They went to Florida and took a swamp and made it a center. The whole theory of Disney was, 'We will build our own community, with our own people.' Coming to New York is a major change for them."
 Disney has tried before, with mixed success, to assume a different role, as a consultant to cities, said Stacy Warren, a professor of geography and anthropology at East Washington University, who has studied the company. In Seattle, where Disney planners were hired to propose renovation designs for an aging civic center, the company was criticized for excessive control over the project and for failing to involve the public, Dr. Warren said.
 In New York, a handful of officials have raised related concerns.
 This week, the city was criticized for allowing the use of Central Park for the "Pocahontas" premiere, to which 60,000 tickets were given away in a lottery but which is otherwise not open to the public. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch called the screening a misuse of public space. He said the only condition that might have changed his mind would have been a threat by Disney to pull out of the 42d Street development, a theory denied by Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, who is overseeing the event for the city. Disney is donating $1 million for the park's use.
 If it runs smoothly, the premiere would be a publicity coup for a company that, while enormously successful -- revenues this year will probably be $12 billion, industry analysts said -- has had its share of highly public difficulties in recent years, including EuroDisney and an ill-fated proposal to build a park with a historical theme in northern Virginia.

 
 
Putting Up Image, But Little Money
 While Disney executives are taking a gamble with the company image in New York, they are not contemplating a huge initial investment.
 The preliminary plan for renovating the badly damaged New Amsterdam calls for the company to spend $29 million. Of that, Disney would spend $8 million of its own and would receive low-interest loans from the city and state, at the rate of 3 percent, to cover the rest. While the city routinely offers tax breaks, low-interest loans and other subsidies to lure businesses, in an unusual part of the arrangement, Disney would give the city and state part of its gross sales at the theater: 2 percent a year for the first $20 million in sales and 3 percent on sales over $20 million.
 City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge and State Senator Franz S. Leichter, both Manhattan Democrats, have criticized government officials and Disney executives for not making public complete details of the agreement. They also question whether officials have offered Disney too sweet a deal for the New Amsterdam.
 City and state officials, pointing out that the agreement is still tentative, defend the arrangement as potentially profitable, saying it will produce jobs and revenue, and improve the neighborhood.
 Disney can choose to pull out of the arrangement by July 15 if two conditions are not met: final bids for renovating the theater cannot exceed projected costs -- the $29 million already estimated, plus an additional $5 million in potential overruns -- and the city and state must obtain commitments from other companies to come to 42d Street.
 City and state officials said that talks with many companies were under way. When word leaked out in 1993 that Disney had begun talking about taking over the New Amsterdam, once home to the Ziegfeld Follies, other companies began negotiating for some of the eight other theaters on the street.
 "It's totally changed the way people see the street," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a state agency coordinating the redevelopment of Times Square.
 Mr. Eisner said negotiations were continuing, and he noted that Disney has a reputation for scrutinizing its expenditures carefully. But he also left little doubt about what he hoped the outcome would be.
 "I know we are committed and will be committed to the New Amsterdam," he said.
 John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said, "I think they realize the cachet of Broadway, and the ability to market it elsewhere is a very important thing,"
 Disney's participation in the proposed hotel complex on 42d Street would involve a smaller investment. The company is a junior partner with the Tishman Urban Development Corporation, which would raise the money, build the 680-room hotel and operate it. Disney would be responsible only for developing the retail and entertainment portion of the development.
 There is also an option for Disney to develop a 100-room time-share hotel as part of the complex. But Mr. Eisner played down that possibility. "The chances of us going forward on that are only, I would say, fair," he said.
 But Mr. Eisner said he relished the challenges of reviving 42d Street.
 "I know what 42d Street can be," he said, "and it is going to completely rejuvenate New York. I want to be part of that, and I want to be part of that as an executive of the Disney Company and I want to be part of that as a former New Yorker."

HEADLINE: For Mercy College Teachers: Recruit a Student, Get a Raise

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
Like many other businesses facing a fiscal crunch, Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., decided this spring that it had to boost sales -- namely the number of students it enrolled.
 And so the college came up with an audacious incentive system unheard of in academia: it ties the salaries of its professors to their ability to boost enrollment. Like Wall Street investment bankers pushing for annual bonuses, Mercy's professors would receive 7 percent raises if they helped recruit and retain enough students to raise enrollment by about 400. On the other hand, if enrollment remained flat, salaries would fall 7 percent. 
 Since the professors' decision in April to embark on the new incentive program, more faculty members than ever visited high school fairs to trumpet Mercy's virtues and made late-night calls to raise the spirits of students pondering dropping out, the college's president, Jay Sexter, said.
 Apparently, it has paid off. Based on the numbers of inquiries from high school students, college officials predicted yesterday that enrollment at the school will climb by 675 this fall, nearly 10 percent.
 Still, the professors' decision to link their salaries to enrollment, prompted by a looming $2.2 million cut in state tuition assistance, has raised questions among national college officials. They worry that such a strategy might spread and eventually make professors think twice about failing students. After all, each time a student drops out, the prospects dim for a faculty raise.
 "At least since the Middle Ages, institutions have tried to divorce the business side from the academic side," said David R. Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, the umbrella group for the nation's colleges. "The obvious danger is it provides an incentive for a professor not to give a failing grade."
 Mr. Merkowitz said he had never heard of a plan similar to Mercy's. Nevertheless, he said, all but the most selective and well-endowed private colleges have become aggressively competitive as they try to cope with a dip in the number of high school graduates and decreases in state and federal tuition aid. The University of Rochester, he pointed out, is offering $5,000 scholarships to all New York State residents in an effort to attract more students.
 Mercy, founded in 1964 by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy but now nonsectarian, is a nonprofit four-year college with strong programs in nursing, occupational therapy, veterinary technology, hotel management and personnel. It was a pioneer in building annexes close to students' homes and has classrooms in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Yorktown and Port Chester.
 Fifty percent of its 7,135 students come from Westchester County. Thirty-five percent are Hispanic, 30 percent are white, 20 percent are black and 15 percent Asian. Tuition for next year will be $6,600 a year. Salaries range from $26,000 to $81,000.
 Mercy's decision was prompted by the gloomy prospects in Gov. George E. Pataki's budget plans. The college had to present its own balanced budget on July 1, although the precise amount of Mercy's shortfall would not be known until September registration. Raising tuition was viewed as counterproductive. So the college was forced either to issue pink slips to a dozen of its 155 faculty members or come up with a contingency plan.
 During negotiations for an emergency one-year faculty contract, Benjamin B. Weisman, the chairman of business and economics, said it would be wasteful to dismiss people and then find out in September that the layoffs were unnecessary. He suggested that the college model its compensation formula on the business world.
 "There are bonuses if people do well," said Mr. Weisman, who does consulting for Wall Street. "If things go bad, then the business has to survive by cutting expenses."
 The faculty approved the plan by a 4-to-1 ratio. In an interview, another faculty negotiator, Andrew R. Joppa, an assistant professor of business, compared the virtues of the plan to the economics of a restaurant.
 "If you're running a restaurant with great ambience," he said, "you need people to sit there and eat what you're offering. So I believe it's one of our obligations to make sure people are there to receive our services."
 Some college teachers played down the value of the plan -- they denied they were hawking the school on the streets -- and credited any enrollment boost to the marketing ideas, like bus stop advertisements, of the new dean of admissions, Joy Colelli. Yet, others said they were working harder than ever at recruitment and retention.
 Donna Killian Sorkin, an associate professor of statistics, said she had given struggling students her home phone number so she could help them resolve problems. Ms. Colelli brought a dozen science professors to high schools to talk about Mercy's science programs. Other instructors made a point of calling students who signaled their problems about continuing college by not applying for financial aid.
 "We have to recognize that the health of the college as a whole depends on the individual activities of every one of us," Ms. Sorkin said.
 Professors reject criticism that they might inflate grades to keep students from dropping out. "If you're teaching 140 students and two are not doing well, you're not going to consider that by keeping two students you'll protect your job," Mr. Weisman said.
 Still, the plan is a touchy one. Marvin Karp, the president of the college's branch of the American Association of University Professors, maintained that enrollment-linked salaries were an emergency measure that would end next year. But the college's president, Mr. Sexter, saw the proposal's future differently.
 "Let's see what happens and we'll decide if it's one year or a way of life," he said.

HEADLINE: Investors See Trouble; Fed Doesn't

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
With the economy slowing sharply, investors see more trouble ahead. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, doesn't.
 That stark disagreement -- over whether the economy may be sinking into recession or will right itself -- was underscored by today's turmoil in the bond market and a 34-point tumble in the Dow Jones industrial average. In fact, stock and bond prices have fallen for three straight days since Wednesday, when Mr. Greenspan disappointed investors who were counting on the Fed to give the economy a quick shot in the arm through a rate cut. He said he was not particularly worried about the long-term health of the economy, although he acknowledged the possibility of a brief recession. 
 "The markets are disappointed that Chairman Greenspan at this time did not agree with them," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, a New York-based brokerage firm. "The message of the markets is they think the Fed should ease."
 Today, prices of Treasury securities plunged again, fueled as well by speculation that the Japanese might curtail future purchases of Government bonds -- speculation that was subsequently denied by the Japanese Government. [Page 36.]
 Still, the fundamental reason for the turmoil is clear. If Mr. Greenspan is wrong, the economy may have stumbled into a vicious circle of factory layoffs, further drops in consumer spending and yet more layoffs -- all leading to a recession.
 But if Mr. Greenspan is right, then the economy will resume growing later this year, after companies have sold off part of the stockpiles of goods that have built up recently. At that point, they should begin ordering more from factories. In that case, all a cut in short-term interest rates now would do is to add a sharp stimulus to a natural rebound, possibly feeding inflation.
 The markets may batter finance ministers into accepting big changes in currency values, but chairmen of the Federal Reserve are more insulated, thanks to the power they have over the money supply. The danger of the disagreement between Mr. Greenspan and the markets is that a flight from stocks and bonds could erode confidence, stifle consumer spending and turn economic stagnation into a recession. Indeed, Fed optimism is partly based on the expectations that this year's rising stock market and lower interest rates would help overcome the effects of the Fed's yearlong escalation of short-term interest rates, which finally stopped on Feb. 1.
 Unsold goods are at the nub of the debate. Federal Reserve officials and Wall Street economists agree that the key to the economy's health for the rest of this year is what happens as companies try to slow the growth of those stockpiles in response to a slackening of consumer spending.
 The economic theory on the phenomenon, called inventory-led recession, has been a staple of business-cycle analysis for decades.
 "Let's say you're cruising along" with steady economic growth, explained Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor and former economics professor at Harvard University. "Suddenly sales drop. At first, while you're absorbing that information and finding out it's the case, your inventories are going to build pretty dramatically."
 "At some point you decide to shed inventories because they have become too costly to hold," Mr. Lindsey continued. "So you cut production. When you cut production, you lay off workers."
 But when workers lose their jobs, they don't just lick their wounds. They also cut back on personal spending. So do people watching these layoffs, who then start to fear for their own jobs. As all of these consumers demand fewer goods, more companies tend to lay off workers.
 "What you have to do is you have to hope your inventories are drawn down faster than demand declines," Mr. Lindsey said. Once companies have eliminated their excess inventories, they tend to resume ordering new goods, and growth returns.
 Four of the nine recessions since World War II have started with inventory problems. Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues attribute the economy's current weakness to inventory adjustments, but play down their severity.
 "It strikes me that what we are looking at right now is a reduction in inventory investment, which is still modest but is going to proceed, as best I can judge, for a while," Mr. Greenspan said. "Fortunately, the levels of inventories are still rather modest, and as a consequence there isn't in that sense the inventory tinder to create the type of sharp inventory recessions which we've experienced in the United States in the past."
 In interviews over the last week, other Fed governors offered several reasons why they were optimistic that inventories could be reduced without severely damaging consumer spending. Janet Yellen, a Clinton appointee and the board's newest member, pointed out that consumer confidence remained fairly strong, while rallies this spring in the stock and bond markets had made some families wealthier.
 Alan S. Blinder, the board's vice chairman, said that he expected the United States to sell more goods to foreign markets, which would also help reduce inventories here. And Fed officials have noted in recent months that a sizable chunk of the recent inventory accumulation consists of imported goods. If American companies cut back on their import orders while they sell the goods they have, that will have little effect on American factory production and employment.
 Census Bureau statistics show that inventories are fairly high now but not unusually so. The ratio of goods held to sales has not yet reached the levels of 1986, when inventory problems clearly braked the economy. The economy shrank by eight-tenths of a percentage point in the second quarter that year, and grew by only 1 percent in the third quarter and 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
 But the Fed responded in 1986 by cutting overnight interest rates four times, by a total of two percentage points. Many in the market argue that similar Fed action may be needed now. "I think it's going to need some help from the Fed," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company, a Chicago bank.
 Mr. Kasriel and other financial economists point to many signs that the economy's problems may be more serious than Fed officials care to admit, starting with the American economy's unexpected loss of 101,000 jobs in May.
 Without a Fed rate cut, stock prices have deteriorated along with prospects for the economy and corporate profits. Short-term bond prices have also fallen steeply as the Fed seems likely to hold overnight interest rates steady.
 All of which adds to a gloom on Wall Street at odds with the high-flying level of the market. The slowdown in growth, said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, "will not be reversed until there is a boost from policy measures, specifically monetary policy."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Show No Inflation, Reflecting Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Reflecting a slowing economy, inflation at the producer level disappeared again in May, as price declines for food and some energy products offset increases for other types of finished goods, Government figures showed today.
 Price pressures also eased at earlier stages of the production process, with the Producer Price Index for such intermediate components as bolts of cloth posting its smallest rise in a year. 
 "It looks like all we're getting is a modest acceleration of inflation in '95," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at the Shawmut National Corporation in Boston.
 Separately, Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly compilation of the forecasts of about 50 analysts, showed sharply reduced expectations for national output in the quarter that ends June 30. The consensus now predicts gross domestic product will rise at an annual rate of just 1.5 percent, down from forecasts of 2.2 percent a month ago.
 About one-third of these predictions, in fact, were made just before the Labor Department's announcement a week ago that employers cut payrolls by 101,000 last month, a development that prompted widespread reassessment and led some analysts to contend that second-quarter growth would be negligible, perhaps nonexistent.
 G.D.P. rose at a rate of 2.7 percent in the first three months of the year, down from 5.1 percent in the final quarter of 1994.
 The inflation figures reported this morning, which on the whole were a bit better than expected, seemed to have little immediate effect on the bond and stock markets but may have contributed to sharp drops later in the day, specialists said.
 Prices received by producers of finished goods were unchanged in May after a jump of five-tenths of 1 percent in April. That gain was accompanied by hefty increases for intermediate and crude goods as well, according to the Labor Department's report.
 "We may have seen the peak pressures in input prices," said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. He noted that the price of intermediate goods other than food and energy had now risen less over the last three months than over the last 12 months.
 In one of the few negative elements in today's report, the core rate for finished goods, which excludes the wide-swinging food and energy components, posted its second straight rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for last month.
 But analysts said this inflation worry would not dissuade the Federal Reserve from cutting short-term interest rates should the economy soften enough in the Fed's view to warrant such an action.
 "As the economy weakens, the price indexes are going to reflect that," said David A. Levy, research director at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in Chappaqua, N.Y. Citing what he saw as a larger buildup of inventories than is generally recognized, Mr. Levy put the odds at 50-50 that the economy had already slipped into recession after peaking in April.
 The finished goods index was marked by the largest of three straight monthly declines for food, which fell six-tenths of 1 percent, and by a two-tenths of 1 percent decline for energy.
 Fresh and dry vegetables skidded 14.1 percent, reversing an April surge; beef and veal fell less than in April, and fresh fruits and melons soared nearly 30 percent. In energy, declines for residential natural gas and electricity more than offset a 9.3 percent jump for home heating oil and a 2 percent rise in gasoline, the report also showed.
 Elsewhere, tobacco products climbed 2.2 percent to account for one-third of the rise in the core Producer Price Index while heavy trucks were a major factor in a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent for capital equipment.
 Among intermediate goods, which rose over all by two-tenths of 1 percent, the gain for nondurable factory materials like paperboard slowed to six-tenths of 1 percent from 2.5 percent in April.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds Take Plunge On a Rumor

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities, already beaten back by the fading prospects that the Fed would ease credit, were battered again yesterday, as traders speculated that the Japanese might curtail future purchases of United States Government securities.
 However, the Japanese rumor may have served as an excuse for investors to sell in a market that has run too far, too fast on anticipation that the economy will continue to slow, analysts said. No one saw it as indicative of a major new direction in the market. 
 Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Schapiro & Company, a Wall Street investment bank, said he was not buying the rumor, even though the Japanese hold a big part of a now record amount of Treasury securities being held by foreign central banks and official institutions. "If they were to sell their holdings, there is no other market or combination of markets that can absorb that magnitude of money," he said. The bond market was ready to sell and found this a convenient reason to do so, he continued.
 Rusty Vanneman, a senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, agreed, noting that prices have risen 20 percent since the beginning of the year and have been in an upward trend since November. "Essentially it is overbought and just looking for an excuse to sell," he said. "Fundamentally nothing has really changed to alter the picture. Inflation is still in check, and -- simply put -- the market is overbought and overextended and is in need of taking a breather."
 The 30-year bond fell 119/32 of a percentage point yesterday, to a price of 11119/32 , sending its yield surging to 6.72 percent, from 6.61 percent on Thursday. It opened the week at 6.53 percent.
 Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said it was the biggest increase in the long bond's yield since Sept. 16, 1994, when it rose 14 basis points, to 7.77 percent.
 "I think we need to keep today in context with the powerful rally we've had in the market," Mr. Alexy said. The rumor that Japanese investors were being asked to sell Treasury securities had a big impact on the market, he noted, "but here again we have a situation were people have made significant profits and now are quick to defend them."
 Mr. Vanneman, who sees less volatility in the market in coming weeks, said, "We may see the market now move back into a stable environment, with 30-year Treasury yields between 6.5 percent and 7 percent."
 Prices of Treasury securities reacted little to the May Producer Price Index yesterday. Normally bond traders hate inflation and might have been expected to react favorably to yesterday's report, which showed inflation braked at the producer level. The index was unchanged from April, compared with estimates that it would rise by as much as three-tenths of 1 percent.

3-Year Low For Stocks In Tokyo

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 9

 BODY:
Discouraged by the outlook for Japan's economy and the Government's rescue plan for the banking industry, investors today pushed down prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to the lowest level in nearly three years.
 The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 398.12 points, or 2.6 percent, to 15,044.18. That was its lowest closing level since Aug. 19, 1992, when the index finished at 14,650.74. On Thursday, the index lost 237.32 points, or 1.5 percent. 
 "It is no exaggeration to say that we must keep in mind the worst may come in a further fall in stock prices," said Hideo Omura, a senior trader with Dai-Ichi Securities.
 The latest development to pull down stocks was today's release of the central bank's quarterly survey of Japanese business sentiment. The survey found that businesses had become more optimistic, despite the strong yen.
 But instead of encouraging investors, the survey made them more pessimistic. Apparently they viewed the survey as showing an economy that was strong enough to deter the central bank from cutting interest rates but not strong enough to stage a genuine recovery.
 The release of the survey followed by one day the Government's announcement of a package of measures meant to help the nation's debt-ridden banks. By some estimates, Japan's banks have bad debts totaling as much as $1 trillion or even more. But analysts said the Finance Ministry's rescue package would do little to relieve the bank situation. That, in turn, would mean that lending and investment would remain stagnant.
 In addition, investors are worried about the nation's auto trade with the United States, which plans to impose 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars if an agreement is not reached by June 28 on a further opening of Japan's market to foreign autos and auto parts.
 Analysts said the market decline also reflected the sale of a large number of futures and options contracts that became due today.
 Pointing to yet another factor weighing down share prices, Bloomberg Business News reported that Japan's big life insurance companies, once considered staunch supporters of stocks, have become some of the market's biggest sellers.
 Insurers sold 340 billion yen, or $4 billion, of stock in May, twice as much as in any month before, Bloomberg said. Most of that stock, analysts said, was sold by Japan's eight largest life insurers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers From Sharp Fall Over Rumors of Japanese Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar recovered from a sharp loss yesterday after currency dealers concluded that a rumor that large Japanese investors were selling United States securities was groundless.
 By the end of the trading day, the dollar was only slightly lower against the Japanese yen and German mark, and mixed against other leading currencies. Traders called it one of the more chaotic days in the foreign exchange market in some time. 
 "It's been a bit of a frustrating run," said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager with ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
 The dollar selling began on a rumor that Japan's Finance Ministry was privately telling investors and banks in Japan to avoid American securities. The Japanese are major buyers of American stocks and Treasury securities, and a selloff would diminish demand for the dollars needed to buy them.
 The rumor also helped send bond prices down sharply and contributed to a stiff drop in the stock market. But Japan's Finance Ministry later denied the rumor. At the same time, traders themselves were reassessing the wisdom of selling dollars over hearsay that seemed so unlikely.
 "Once we realized what the consequences would be, we saw how ridiculous that would be," said Kevin Harris, an international economist at MCM Currencywatch Inc., a foreign-exchange analysis firm.
 Many traders started buying dollars they had sold earlier, creating a supply squeeze that bolstered the currency further in what is known as a short-covering rally.
 In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.4053 German marks from 1.4072 marks. The dollar slipped to 84.29 yen from 84.68 yen.
 There was no significant economic news to influence dollar trading, analysts said. The Labor Department's report showing that wholesale prices steadied in May helped substantiate other evidence that the United States economy is slowing, but that already had been built into market expectations.
 "In fact, we are having a hard time finding any new direction," Mr. Harris said.
 The dollar has been supported in recent days by the expectation that finance ministers of the industrialized nations meeting next week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, will reaffirm their commitment to a stable dollar.

HEADLINE: Mobutu, Zaire's 'Guide,' Leads Nation Into Chaos

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
For the three decades that the West backed Zaire's dictator, President Mobutu Sese Seko, one rationale was consistently invoked: Whatever his evils Mr. Mobutu, a wily billionaire, was the only figure who could bind this vast, chaotic country together.
But with the cold war over, the West is no longer interested in supporting a once strategic ally. And the outside world is awakening to the fact that far from being held together, Zaire, which is as large as the United States east of the Mississippi, is drifting dangerously close to disintegration. 
 Since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in May, Western diplomats, officials from neighboring countries, international public health experts and economists have begun to say aloud what many of the 41 million Zairians concluded long ago: "Zaire doesn't really exist anymore as a state entity," is how one European diplomat here put it.
He cited the separate arrangements that each of the eight provinces has made to assure its survival: "Kivu lives from informal trade with East Africa, East Kasai refuses to accept the national currency, Shaba has become a virtual extension of South Africa and to visit Equateur, even though it is the President's home, is to see things just as they were in the time of Stanley."
The diplomat, who recently toured each province, said he was shaken by what he had found.
"Such roads as exist won't allow you to travel more than 15 miles an hour, and everywhere you go, people tell you stories of the things that used to exist but are no more," he said. "People can't afford beer anymore, so they drink palm wine. There's no soap, so people wash their clothes with papaya leaves."
The few reliable statistics paint a frightening picture. According to the World Bank, Zaire's economy has shrunk 40 percent since 1988. Per capita income has fallen 65 percent since 1958, two years before the country gained independence from Belgium.
The Government is a concoction born of political improvisation and Western-coerced compromise. Mr. Mobutu was pressed by the West to accept Kengo wa Dondo, an advocate of austerity and privatization, after he dismissed another Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, under questionable legal circumstances.
These days Mr. Mobutu has little to do with actual governance. Isolated for months at a time in his native village, Gbadolite, inaccessible except to those he summons, he controls only his vast security apparatus and foreign policy. Diplomats say the President also retains enough clout to protect lucrative business ties, particularly in diamond mining.
Mr. Kengo, who runs the Government, has had to fight Mr. Mobutu each time his economic changes have threatened the President's interests.
The President recently resisted Mr. Kengo's attempts to replace the president of the Central Bank; before the Prime Minister got his way, diplomats say, business executives thought to be in league with Mr. Mobutu imported at least three planeloads of counterfeit currency.
Even though two planes were seized at Kinshasa airport, the state prosecutor, a Mobutu appointee, declined to press charges, saying there was not enough evidence.
For state employees, who go months without pay and often steal Government property or resort to bribery, the counterfeit scheme provoked little surprise.
"We have grown accustomed to the blurred line between real and fake in Zaire," said a Government ministry worker in Kinshasa, "so used to it that we can't tell the difference."
For many, that the Ebola outbreak should have occurred in Kikwit is among the clearest signs of Zaire's steep decline.
Kikwit, less than 300 miles east of Kinshasa, sits astride what was once a major transcontinental highway. Unlike other cities that live from little more than river traffic and small-scale agriculture, just two decades ago Kikwit was home to the world's largest palm-oil plantation.
But the highway to Kinshasa, which cuts across one grassy plateau after another before plunging through steep river-cut valleys, has deteriorated so badly that only a handful of intrepid truckers ever take it anymore.
Foreign doctors with long experience in Zaire say that in a sense, it was fortunate the epidemic occurred in Kikwit, and not in any far more remote and even poorer area, where other epidemics are common.
"Ebola brought a response, but the people of Zaire face a very fundamental health crisis," said Dr. Dan Fountain, an American missionary physician who practices in the Kikwit region. "All over the place you find a population that suffers from malnutrition and has severely deficient immune systems. Measles outbreaks kill 300 people all the time, and AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis and malaria are ever present."
Like nearly every region of Zaire, which was once the largest copper producer and a major exporter of coffee, Kikwit, a city of 500,000, now lives without industry.
Fuel for the few cars in circulation is sold by the whisky bottle at the roadside, since there are no gas stations. Young people set out barefoot to reach the nearest diamond area, 200 miles to the south, where crude mining provides the only hope of earning a livelihood.
"There is just no work here," said Jean Mpongo, 24, who recently returned home from a season of mining. "If you stay here, you live by the land or you live from charity. One thing is sure, though: you live without money."
With the cold war over, there is little real disagreement between Western diplomats and Mr. Mobutu's opponents in describing the President's recipe for holding on since he took power in November 1965.
Mr. Mobutu's first trump card was his reliability as an ally of the West. For years he allowed Zaire to be used as a base for Jonas Savimbi, Washington's ally in the civil war in leftist-ruled Angola. For France, Zaire, which shares borders with nine other countries, was long an invaluable staging ground for military operations to prop up former French colonies.
Several Western military operations have rescued Mr. Mobutu from being toppled. For example, Western military assistance helped put down rebellions in Shaba that began in 1977. As recently as 1991, France and Belgium intervened there, ostensibly to rescue their citizens during rioting by soldiers who had not been paid.
Mr. Mobutu is a master of co-opting would-be opponents. Diplomats say he has systematically let his enemies feed at the state trough, rotating them in and out of office and encouraging many to become wealthy in order to neutralize them.
Like many African dictators, Mr. Mobutu has also constantly played ethnic politics. While filling the army with members of small tribes from his native Equateur Province, he has fanned hatred between several large ethnic groups, preventing them from challenging him. Several regions are embroiled in tribal wars.
Mr. Mobutu's last rampart has been a myriad of security organizations that run from the army and the gendarmerie to several layers of secret police and an autonomous presidential guard. In every major city there are soldiers and police officers on nearly every street.
The security forces have become a law unto themselves. In what has become a common occurrence as unpaid agents have turned to preying on residents, four secret policemen recently abducted two American journalists visiting a tuberculosis sanatorium in Kinshasa. After an hour's drive, during which the journalists were taken to the gate of a prison and threatened with jail, the agents made off with $350 and several rolls of film.
After a diplomatic protest was lodged, something truly odd happened: A Zairian Army general from Equateur turned up at the journalists' hotel with the lost money and film, and with this apology: "That is what happens when people insist that we have democracy here. There is no more order in the country anymore."
Despite Mr. Mobutu's unpopularity, he has recently been pressing to hold elections, to end his diplomatic isolation and, many suspect, to get rid of Prime Minister Kengo, who has been slowly cleaning house by removing Mobutu cronies.
Diplomats say there is another reason Mr. Mobutu is eager for elections. With the opposition badly divided and with Mr. Kengo, who is of Zairian-Rwandan heritage, unable to run for president because candidates must be of pure Zairian heritage, some diplomats say Mr. Mobutu could very well win.
Still, in places like Kinshasa, a city of five million where huge garbage heaps line major roads that dissolve into muddy lakes at the first rain, it is hard to find anyone who would support Mr. Mobutu.
"They talk about holding elections, but that is not the people's problem anymore," said Ernest Lutumba, a worshiper at an evangelical church in Kinshasa. "The people know that elections are for Mobutu. Our problems lie elsewhere."

HEADLINE: Colombian Drug Lord Captured In Police Raid in His Hometown

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
A principal leader of the Cali cocaine and heroin ring in Colombia, regarded as the world's largest drug-trafficking gang, was captured yesterday in a raid on a luxurious house in the southern city of Cali, Colombian Government officials said.
The officials said the raiding party had been on the verge of leaving the white stucco house without finding the man, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, when some officers discovered him hiding in a secret compartment. 
 Bogota television stations quoted the police officers who arrested him as saying that as they confronted him, Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela shouted: "You won. I surrender. Calm, boys. Don't kill me. I'm a man of peace." Two leaders of the rival Medellin cocaine ring, Jose Gonzalo Gacha and Pablo Escobar Gaviria, were killed several years ago as Colombian police officers and soldiers closed in on them.
Mr. Rodriguez-Orejuela and four bodyguards were handcuffed, taken to the airport in Cali and flown directly to Bogota, the capital. They were transferred by helicopter to national police headquarters.
President Ernesto Samper announced the arrest on Colombian national radio and television and proclaimed that it marked "the beginning of the end for the Cali cartel," which is estimated by the Drug Enforcement Agency to provide 80 percent of the world's cocaine and increasing amounts of heroin.
Officials in Washington, who have been pressing Mr. Samper to aggressively pursue Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela and the other Cali drug leaders as they have flaunted their power and wealth for years with little official interference, praised the capture.
"My hat is off to the Colombian Government and the Colombian people," said Lee P. Brown, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and President Clinton's top aide on drug policy.
In the last year or so relations between the United States and Colombia had sunk as Washington had criticized Colombia for failing to take action against the Cali ring.
United States officials had been shaken by tape recordings in which people identified as leaders of the Cali cartel were heard discussing contributions of millions of dollars to Mr. Samper's presidential campaign.
Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Comittee, had sought to cut off United States economic aid to Colombia unless more was done to crack down on the drug trafficking.
In the last two months, however, Colombian authorities seemed to have begun seriously trying to catch the Cali leaders.
In April the Colombian police announced rewards of $1.25 million for help in capturing Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela and his brother Miguel, another of the Cali drug ring's leaders.
Last month President Samper added 1,600 people to a joint army-police unit fighting drug trafficking. It was that unit that arrested Mr. Rodriguez-Orejuela yesterday.
Shortly after arriving at police headquarters in Bogota, handcuffed and wearing slacks and a striped sport shirt, Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela, who is 56 years old, requested a doctor check his blood pressure, the Colombian police said.
Mr. Rodriguez-Orejuela is a banker who became known in drug circles as "the Chess Player" because of his shrewdness. He and his brother and a circle of close friends quietly built the Cali operation into the world's largest drug-trafficking gang as their rivals in the Colombian city of Medellin became increasingly violent and devoted its energies to fighting the authorities.
While the Medellin Cartel was trying to undermine public confidence in the Colombian Government with bombs in shopping centers and attacks on police officers, the Cali traffickers were shipping more and more cocaine and beginning to cultivate opium to give them entry to the world's heroin business.
Though the Cali gang members were regarded as quiet businessmen who belonged to civic clubs and tried to gain influence through bribery, they nonetheless often relied on murder to displine the ranks of their own organization.
Gunmen paid by the leaders of the Cali ring sometimes flew into New York or Miami to carry out a killing, law enforcement officials said. It was the Cali cartel that three years ago ordered the death of a New York journalist, Manuel DeDios, who had written about the drug traffickers in Spanish-language publications and books. The investigation and publicity surrounding his slaying tarnished the popular image of the Cali gang.
