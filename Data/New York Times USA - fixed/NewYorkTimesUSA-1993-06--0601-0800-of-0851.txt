HEADLINE: Finding a Trend Amid the Calm

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With the Treasury market apparently safely back in its tight trading range after recent reassuring news on inflation, traders and portfolio managers are wondering how to play the market.
Not too many money managers want to bet right now that yields, either long or short, will move sharply lower soon. 
 Short-term rates are expected to be steady or higher because of the belief that the next policy change by the Federal Reserve will be to raise the Federal funds rate, the interest rate the central bank uses to implement monetary policy. The yield on the two-year Treasury note closed at 4.12 percent Friday, up from 4.03 a month ago.
 
Weighing the Variables

 
 Long-term rates are not expected to burst above 7 percent. But if the economy turns out to be growing at a 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter and is holding on to that trend in the summer, it may be difficult to test new lows soon. The yield on the 30-year bond finished at 6.80 percent Friday, down from 7.02 percent a month ago.
All this does not mean that the market lacks a trend that can be played. What many people are betting on now is a flattening of the yield curve.
Flattening occurs when the spread narrows between the yield on the 2-year Treasury note and the 30-year bond. This means that the price performance of the bond is better than that of the note.
The spread -- 2.68 percentage points Friday, down from 2.99 percentage points a month ago -- can narrow in several ways. Short-term yields can rise and long rates hold steady. Long-term rates can fall. Or there can be a combination of both.
 
Devising a Strategy
 Dung Vu, a managing director at Core State Investment Advisers in Philadelphia, believes this is the trend to play. A normal way to do this is to sell two-year notes short and to buy bonds. As the spread narrows, the long-term securities give a better return.
But Mr. Vu recommends another way: buying zero-coupon bonds. These bonds are sold way below face value because no interest is paid. Instead, the investor receives the full face value of the bond when it matures.
The price of zero-coupon bonds is highly volatile, so while they expose the investor to greater risk of loss, they also offer much more gain than regular interest-paying bonds if the yield curve does flatten.
Mr. Vu said the return from zero-coupon bonds could be better than from regular bonds even if the flattening of the yield curve occurs, because short-term rates rise while long rates remain steady. And that kind of flattening from the bottom would be the immediate response if the Federal Reserve raised interest rates.
A rise in short-term rates would give a small upward push to the yields on 10-year notes. Based on an analysis of the relationship of zero-coupon bonds and the spread between 10- and 30-year Treasuries, the value of the zero-coupon bond rises if this happens.
The gain from the zero-coupon strategy is even better if the flattening of the yield curve comes from the top down, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling.
Gerald A. Guild, manager of fixed- income trading at Advest Inc., said a narrowing of the yield curve by half a percentage point, combined with a decline of half a percentage point in the yield on 30-year bonds over the next year, would produce a 31 percent return for the holder of a 20-year zero-coupon bond.
But the return for a holder of a 30-year interest-paying bond, counting the interest and the price rise, would be 12 percent.
This strategy is a mistake if the yield curve steepens with the spread between the 2-year and 30-year widening and if rates across the board move higher without the spread changing. A jump of one percentage point in the yield on the 30-year bond would mean a 9 percent loss.
But the fundamentals in the market and the outlook seem to indicate that the likeliest trend is for a flattening of the yield curve. Legislative approval of President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would at least steady long-term rates, if not push them lower. The plan would raise hopes for a declining deficit while the tax increases would slow consumer spending and keep the economy from picking up the kind of speed that would raise inflation fears.
The coming cut in the issuance of 30-year bonds by the Treasury, a move that should begin to have an impact after the August auction, should also help. And the leaning of the Fed toward higher interest rates should keep upward pressure on short-term interest rates.
 
Trump Bonds
 Why were money managers rushing to buy Donald J. Trump's junk bonds last week?
Margaret D. Patel, a senior vice president at Boston Security Counselors in Boston and a buyer of some of the bonds, has one explanation.
"Since we haven't felt pain in this type of paper for a couple of years people are ready to play again," she said.
Fears surrounding the junk bond market, which crashed at the end of the 1980's, have been eased by the bonds' good performance over the last two years. And portfolio managers have not failed to notice, she said, that "the best performers have been the most distressed securities."
But she also noted that the scooping up of the Trump bonds might be a warning sign for investors.
"People are willing to take more risk for a higher rate of return and that is a characteristic of a frothy market, a toppy market," she said.

The Price of Weakness

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
When I asked Cyrus Vance how he was feeling, I meant it as a telephone formality. But his answer was about Bosnia. "Sad," he said.
President Clinton had just signaled that he might accept a three-way partition of Bosnia, allowing Serbs to keep the fruits of their aggression. In light of all that had happened, I asked, was that now the best that could be done? 
 "I wish we hadn't been put in a position," Mr. Vance replied, "where people say this is the best thing that can be done."
Did he mean that it would not have come to this if the United States had provided more forceful leadership?
"Yes, it took leadership," Mr. Vance said, "and I don't think we've demonstrated that."
But can partition at least stop the killing? I asked.
"I'm not at all sure that it can," Mr. Vance said. "I hope and pray that somehow we will get peace. But I don't know that the Muslims will go along with partition. They don't like it, and I understand why they don't."
Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, working together as mediators, tried to preserve Bosnia as a federal state with ethnic cantons. They warned against allowing destruction of a country that was internationally recognized and a member of the United Nations.
"Right from the beginning," Mr. Vance said, "we always said, 'There can be no partition. It's wrong. It's the equivalent of endorsing ethnic cleansing.' "
Coming from Cy Vance, a man of understatement, those were strong words: a cry of pain at the fact that the United States and its European allies have now essentially accepted the result of ethnic cleansing. Cities where Muslims were the majority or lived in peace with Serbs and Croats, often intermarried, will be Muslim-free, their historic mosques reduced to rubble.
Even Lord Owen has given up hope of saving much from the human and political disaster. He advised the Bosnian Government to "look very seriously" at partition, which would mean giving most of the land to Serbs and Croats, leaving a landlocked rump -- or perhaps some uncontiguous bits -- for the Muslims.
At a crucial point this spring, President Clinton failed to support the Vance-Owen plan, apparently believing that the cantonal arrangement would leave Bosnia too weak. He said he wanted to use air power against the Serbs, and lift the arms embargo on the Muslim victims.
But Mr. Clinton did not press his position on the Europeans: did not lead. When they said no, he gave up his proposal and agreed instead to a plan for United Nations forces to protect six Muslim "safe havens" in Bosnia. Having put down Vance-Owen as not strong enough, he opted for something distinctly weaker.
In the week since the safe haven plan was agreed in Washington, it has turned out to be a bitter joke. The Serbs, undeterred, have devastated one of the supposed havens, Gorazde, killing many refugees. They have resumed shelling Sarajevo. The United Nations has had difficulty finding any troops for the supposed protective role.
The safe haven plan is in fact nothing more than a Western cave-in to the aggressors. The havens will be, at best, overcrowded refugee camps with no viable economic life. Serbian forces, not disarmed, will still surround them. And U.N. relief convoys will still have to bargain with Serbian gunmen for permission to go through.
Partition would complete Serbian humiliation of the West, and especially of the United States. The Serbs will have had their way not only in Bosnia but in Croatia, where Serbian militia hold 20 percent of the country. The ugliest elements in Serbian political life, modern-day Fascists, will have been proved right in calling America a paper tiger.
President Clinton inherited an appalling problem because of George Bush's weakness on Yugoslavia. But he made it worse -- dramatized the weakness -- by calling for stronger action and then giving up. The precedent is a terrible one, for other areas of ethnic tension and for American prestige.
His political advisers urge Mr. Clinton to avoid involvement. Americans didn't want it, they said. But the failure to lead on this painful problem -- the failure to act against murderous aggression -- will haunt Bill Clinton for the rest of his political life.

Stop the Roller Coaster

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
We have to cut out the business of pulling Bill Clinton up by the roots every week to see how he's doing.
"Another Failed Presidency"; "Incredible Shrinking President"; "What Went Wrong?" America went to the pollsters and delivered a ringing vote of no confidence; if this were Japan, we'd be holding new elections. 
 But wait -- "What a difference a week makes" gushes a New York Times editorial. Two press conferences in three days; Senate Democrats spare Clinton from ignominious defeat on his tax bill and go along on an Incumbents' Protection Campaign Subsidy; seven days go by without a White House blunder.
Up we go on the roller coaster clinging to the Comeback Kid. Hot after a fresh lead, we flagellate each other for so hastily despising the Only President We've Got; we find a poll showing he's bottomed out; we marvel at the new maturity shown by a President whose message to Congress is now an other-directed "do it your way -- where do I sign?"
The broken-field runner in the Oval Office (mixed metaphors are allowed when the stately pendulum turns into a propeller) encourages this man-to-media coverage. The First Clinton Administration, marked by the surprise leftward lurch, is presumably over; the Second Clinton Administration, or S.C.A., is upon us; centrism is in the saddle, its outriders focus and programmed self-confidence, its lodestar the changeability of change.
Can't we get off this symbiotic roller coaster and try something easier on the stomach, like the old-fashioned, non-interlaced .28 dot pitch merry-go-round? Let others be with-it; this contrarian department will be determinedly without-it, at least until such time as the long view becomes the in thing.
Here are three real-world developments that are more reliable indicators of direction than any barking from the Presidential seal:
1. Dennis ("Strongly Condemn Israel") Ross, James Baker's closest adviser on the Middle East -- supposedly held over for a few months in the transition -- has been appointed Mr. Clinton's man in charge of imposing a settlement in the Arab-Israeli talks. This is called "change."
Mr. Ross's Bakeresque advice this year was to pressure the Saudis to resume their financial support of the P.L.O., suspended after Yasir Arafat's avid backing of Saddam Hussein; as that bribe was extracted, Arafat permitted the Washington talks to resume. If Mr. Ross is the "full partner" in the negotiations, can a P.L.O.-dominated state on the West Bank be far behind -- and has Israel been told that this is the ordained outcome?
2. When the Senate Finance Committee Democrats slipped in a capital gains tax increase as part of their revised economic plan, President Clinton responded with an incredibly passive "let's see what comes out of the conference report."
Reducing rather than raising that tax would encourage investors to take long-held gains, thereby increasing tax revenues; but raising it with a 10 percent surcharge would do the opposite, increasing the deficit while putting a new drag on investment. Bill Clinton has no position on this issue other than supine; could it be he never met a tax he didn't like?
3. The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice -- which should be the heart of U.S. law enforcement -- has gone headless for five months. Why? Primarily because Bruce Lindsey, the Clinton crony in charge of personally-loyal personnel, was unable to resolve a dispute between the First Lady's First Friend, Susan Thomases, and Attorney General de jure Janet Reno.
Ms. Thomases wanted the plum to go to one of her New York law partners; Ms. Reno, already surrounded by Clintonians, wants a less well-connected prosecutor. Meanwhile, Federal law enforcement suffers as embarrassing investigations are shut down; doesn't anybody care?
These are the choices and decision-duckings that get administrations in trouble. Proclaiming a new centrism is fine; bringing in new old hands is useful; compromising is often necessary; postponing health reform by a year is realistic.
But like God and the Devil, governing is in the details. Although items like these do not cause polls to fluctuate or pundits to switch thumbs, they contribute to the voters' cumulative, long-term judgment. They do not power the roller coaster of trend-addicts demanding their weekly fix of fresh angles; all they do is determine whether a Presidency stumbles along or settles down.

HEADLINE: Study on Soviet-Era A-Plants Says Replacement Is Feasible

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 21

 BODY:
A confidential report on nuclear energy in the former Soviet bloc says it would be economically feasible to close 25 of the most dangerous nuclear reactors during the next few years and replace them with gas-fired power plants.
But the report says the former Communist countries oppose such a plan and want to keep their nuclear plants going as long as possible, a choice that could prove more dangerous and costlier for the West. 
 The report, drawn up by the World Bank and by the International Energy Agency in Paris, is to be presented to President Clinton and the leaders of six other major industrial democracies at their summit talks in Tokyo.
 
Attractions of Nuclear Power
 Until now, both Eastern and Western specialists have maintained that nuclear reactors, while posing threats, were indispensable because a number of former Communist countries were heavily dependent on nuclear-generated electricity.
Russia, which will require almost half of the West's multibillion-dollar plan to improve nuclear safety, insists on nuclear energy because it wants to reserve its natural gas supplies for export in order to earn hard currency, the report says. Other former Communist countries resist importing natural gas because such imports are more expensive than nuclear energy.
The report was ordered by the Group of Seven at their last summit meeting, in Munich in July 1992, when they called for extensive Western contributions to alleviate the serious threat of nuclear accidents in the former Soviet bloc. The leaders meeting in Tokyo are expected to discuss the strategies laid out in the World Bank report.
 
High and Low Estimates
 The report, which is dated March 1993 and is to be updated in July, estimates that $18 billion will be needed between 1993 and 2000 if the "higher-risk nuclear plants" are shut down as soon as possible and replaced by gas-fired plants; the less dangerous nuclear plants would be refitted with modern safety features. The report says it would be technically feasible to do this "by the mid-1990's."
Alternatively, the report says, it will cost about $24 billion to improve "all the higher-risk and other nuclear plants" to keep them operating "until the end of their planned design life," and to finish those under construction.
For each alternative, the huge investments now estimated are considerably higher than those discussed in Munich, where Germany said such a program would cost about $9 billion and the United States suggested that costs would range between $11 billion and $20 billion.
The study refers to the cost of meeting electricity needs in only six countries -- Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia -- because these six have the reactors that Western experts have repeatedly described as the most dangerous.
The report represents the first time that Western economists and energy experts have officially maintained that the former Soviet bloc could shut a number of nuclear reactors and find quick alternatives without paralyzing their economies.
"This dispels the myth that Eastern Europe would freeze in the dark if their nuclear power is shut down," said Anthony Froggatt, of Greenpeace International, which first made the confidential report available.
 
The Economies of Gas
 Building new gas-fired plants, the report says, can be done much faster than building or outfitting nuclear plants with safety standards acceptable in the West. And, it says, gas-fired plants "can be brought on stream in smaller slices versus the lumpiness of large-scale nuclear plants."
Because future demand is uncertain, enormous investments such as those needed for new nuclear plants thus "present additional investment risks."
But in the six countries concerned, it says, various reasons "lead many decision makers to resist a gas-oriented scenario." Among them, it says, decision makers in the East have "different attitudes" -- meaning less concern -- about the safety risks of various designs.
In addition, the report says, "In Russia, there is a widely held view that gas should be accorded priority for export." In other countries, "reliance on additional gas-fired plants means larger fuel imports."
The World Bank report says former Soviet bloc countries also worry about job losses if nuclear plants are shut down or nuclear investments are cut back. For example, Lithuania fears losing earnings from electricity exports if it shuts down its two Chernobyl-type reactors, which the West regards as highly unsafe.
Moreover, the report says, if the high-risk nuclear reactors are shut down in the next few years, the six countries will have to spend a total of $3 billion more annually on fossil fuel, mainly natural gas. About half of this additional cost would be paid by Russia and about one-fourth by Ukraine.
But even if countries have to spend such large amounts on fuel, the report suggests, this is safer than spending such amounts on fixing up risky nuclear plants.
 
The Plants Involved
 The reactors that have caused most concern make up 7 percent of the region's generating capacity.
They involve two types: one is the large graphite reactor of the kind that exploded in Chernobyl, of which there are 15 operating. The other is the oldest type of the pressurized water reactor known as VVER 440-230. Ten of these early reactors are still in operation. Armenia, citing safety reasons, closed its reactors of this type when it became independent, in December 1991.
In the last two years, the International Atomic Energy Agency has called for the closing of the the reactors that pose the most risk. A number of European countries, led by France and Germany, fear that a nuclear catastrophe would not only affect Europe but also worsen the political climate for the beleaguered nuclear industry.
But the full costs of providing the former Communist countries with safe energy are still unclear and estimates are preliminary, the report says. For example, the current plans do not calculate or include the cost of disposing of the reactors' nuclear fuel.
This month, the first funds from the Group of Seven's pledge to help improve the safety of the nuclear reactors were approved -- a grant of $28 million to improve the reactors at the Kozloduy plant in Bulgaria.
The nuclear-safety account set up by the Group of Seven has received pledges of $120 million, far short of the $700 million that the seven leaders estimated last year were needed for short-term safety measures.

HEADLINE: U.S. MAY LET HANOI GET I.M.F. FUNDING

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
President Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers have concluded that the Administration should no longer attempt to block loans to Hanoi from the International Monetary Fund, senior Administration officials said tonight. The recommendation could presage an easing of the relationship between the United States and Vietnam.
In a meeting last week, members of the National Security Council decided to recommend to the President that the United States raise no objections to a plan by France and Japan to pay more than $140 million in arrears that Hanoi owes to the fund. Such an action would free the monetary fund to approve new lending to Vietnam during its next board meeting in July. 
 Officials said tonight that no decision has been made by the President as yet. In addition, it is unclear whether Mr. Clinton's advisers have reached a consensus on whether to recommend that the United States end its 18-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam.
 
Subsidizing Vietnam
 Proponents of a rapprochement between the United States and Hanoi say that once the fund begins lending to Vietnam, it would be harder for the Administration to justify the continuation of a trade embargo. The extension of the fund's loans to Vietnam would mean that United States taxpayers would, in essence, be subsidizing Vietnam's economic development, but at the same time United States companies would be precluded from concluding contracts that are a part of that economic development.
Asked about the proposal, Secretary of State Warren Christopher would only say today that, "It's under intensive review, and hopefully we will be having a decision on that in the near future."
The Clinton Administration, citing Hanoi's increased cooperation in helping to determining the fate of 2,260 American servicemen who are unaccounted for from the war in Southeast Asia, had been strongly considering easing its opposition to new monetary fund loans to Vietnam when the lending agency met in April.
But, just prior to the meeting, a Harvard-based researcher, Stephen J. Morris, brought forward a document he discovered in the Russian archives alleging that Hanoi had many more Americans prisoners than it had acknowledged capturing.
 
Created a Sensation
 Though a number of specialists on the war say the Morris document contained a number of inaccuracies, it created such a sensation in Washington that the Administration was forced to postpone any plans it might have had in moving to allow the lending program.
Meanwhile, a bipartisan group headed by former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie came out today in favor of ending the embargo.
Following a trip to Vietnam in April, a majority of the 10-member delegation concluded that interests would best be served by lifting the embargo, Mr. Muskie said in a statement.
Earlier today, officials in Hanoi announced that Vietnam would apply for observer status, and later for membership, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a world trade body.

HEADLINE: A Battle Between Cities May Scuttle Navy Base

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INGLESIDE, Tex.

 BODY:
With its tiny fleet of rusty shrimp boats, screeching sea gulls and wind-blown resort homes, this small community on the muddy tidal flats of the Texas coast seems an unlikely battlefield in the bureaucratic wars over shrinking dollars for the military.
But as a result of voting by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission beginning this week, the brand-new $440 million Naval Station Ingleside nearby may be ordered closed, victim of a sophisticated lobbying campaign in a tug-of-war whose stakes are thousands of jobs. 
 The lobbying campaign against Naval Station Ingleside focused on environmental concerns and was undertaken by a city half a continent away: Charleston, S.C., which, faced with the Defense Department's plans to shut down virtually all Navy operations there, responded in a way that demonstrates the increasingly effective strategies pursued by communities struggling to protect their economies from Pentagon cutbacks.
It appeared earlier this year that Ingleside had escaped the ax. The Pentagon's "hit list," the first step in a process by which the nation determines the military centers that are expendable in an era of tight budgets, had scheduled 43 major bases and 122 smaller installations for closing but had spared Naval Station Ingleside.
Indeed, the Navy planned for the base to become operational next month as the nation's center for mine warfare. Eventually it was to be home to 12,000 military and civilian workers and 25 mine-sweeping vessels, among them as many as eight ships to be moved from the Charleston ports that the Pentagon recommended be closed.
 
Charleston Fought Back
 But in the meantime Charleston, trying to save 18,000 jobs in its own backyard, had hit upon its strategy. Because operations at sprawling Navy bases like the one at Charleston are often so tightly linked, city officials believed that if they could save one, they might well save the others. And the most effective way to save the mine-warfare operations would be to demonstrate that Ingleside was unfit for them.
"It was a domino effect we were trying for," said Rik Dilgren, a former submarine commander who led the environmental research team that spearheaded Charleston's attack on Ingleside. "If we could save mine warfare for Charleston, we could save the Navy base, which would keep open the hospital there."
The result was a highly polished political and public relations campaign so effective that it may have killed not only Naval Station Ingleside but also two naval centers in the nearby Corpus Christi area.
"It's the classic zero-sum game," said Frank Mankiewicz, who was press secretary to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and who now, as a member of the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton, has Charleston as a client. "In order for someone to get off the base closure list, someone else has to get on it."
Charleston hired public relations specialists and Washington lawyers, and it formed eight technical research teams manned primarily by volunteers. The city was armed with a $1 million war chest and two General Accounting Office studies, ordered by the South Carolina Congressional delegation, that were critical of the Pentagon's base-consolidation process. And it spent $480,000 on consultants to help prepare a presentation that would be made to the base closure commission when the panel was ready to begin public hearings around the country.
By the time the commission met in Charleston on May 1, Barry Steinberg, a former chief environmental litigator for the Army, had carefully rehearsed the city's witnesses on environmental issues and the criteria by which the commission decides which bases should be closed. The witnesses told the commission that the Ingleside base was riddled with environmental hazards, a peril that Ingleside supporters vehemently deny.
In a slide presentation to the commission, Mr. Dilgren said the Ingleside base would threaten nine endangered species, including the sperm whale, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, Arctic falcons and the bald eagle. He also said wetlands dredging, required if the Navy's plans to expand the base were to be realized, would harm the Flower Gardens, a coral formation in the Gulf of Mexico.
Within weeks, the commission had added Ingleside and two other bases in the Corpus Christi area to the list of centers being considered for shutdown.
A commission spokesman, Tom Houston, said in a later interview that the panel had felt it only fair to consider Ingleside for closing once the questions about it had been raised, notwithstanding that "it's agonizing to hear these cities plead for their economic lives."
Charleston had spent months preparing for its day and a half of hearings before the commission. By contrast, the Corpus Christi region had to defend its bases in a two-hour session only 14 days after learning that they were threatened.
And the presentation went badly from the start. The commission's chairman, Jim Courter, a former Republican Congressman from New Jersey, stressed in his opening remarks that the panel was "fiercely independent" and "not rubber stamps for the Pentagon." But former Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, Corpus Christi's prize witness, asked the commissioners to "give additional weight to the experience and judgment of the Navy's uniformed leaders," who, having already invested many millions of dollars in Naval Station Ingleside, clearly wanted it saved.
In other words, after being told that the commissioners were not a rubber stamp for the Pentagon, Mr. Garrett asked them to become precisely that. The commissioners immediately began interrupting witnesses with questions about the Ingleside base's environmental effects. A stormy exchange between one commission member, Hansford T. Johnson, and the Texas Land Commissioner, Garry Mauro, ended abruptly when Mr. Johnson pressed heatedly for answers regarding a required environmental permit and then cut off Mr. Mauro's reply. The assembled crowd gasped, then booed.
Environmental experts here say that none of Charleston's accusations about peril to wildlife are accurate. "There are no sperm whales in our area," said one such expert, Dr. Joe Mosely. "Ridley turtles nest 300 miles from here, not in Corpus Christi Bay. There are no bald eagles here. And, as to a dredging operation damaging the Flower Gardens, they're 200 miles away and wouldn't be affected."
Whether Charleston has been ultimately successful will not be certain until after the commission decides on a final base closure list, in voting that begins Wednesday. By law, President Clinton and Congress must accept all of the commission's list or none of it; no modifications are permitted.
Though he would not be specific about either Charleston or Ingleside, Mr. Courter said in an interview that some communities would necessarily face devastating economic news.
"We want to make sure the suit fits the man," he said of the commission's task. "We need the right size suit to support the force structure. Now, we're looking at a 30 to 40 percent defense function reduction in five years' time, so obviously the man is going on a diet. We need to tailor the suit to fit the man."

HEADLINE: Clinton Looks to Conference Panel to Restore Budget to His Liking

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
President Clinton and his top aides spent the day whipping up citizen support for his five-year, $500 billion budget package, but not entirely out of fear about its chances in the Senate.
To the contrary, Democrats are confident that the Senate will pass the plan after it is introduced on Wednesday.
They are less certain about their prospects in the legislative conference that follows, which promises to be a drawn-out effort to fuse the Senate's bill and the more liberal version that the House passed last month. 
 Neither the White House nor its supporters in Congress yet know how, or even whether, they can pull off such perilous surgery. In the House, many liberal Democrats held their noses and voted for Mr. Clinton's budget, even though it included what they considered unacceptable proposals to cut Medicare and to restrict spending on Federal benefits.
 
Areas of Contention
 Senate Democrats are preparing to pass a version that cuts Medicare and benefit programs further and removes the one tax break that liberals actually liked: an incentive for businesses to move into rundown areas.
It is not clear to some Democrats where the twain will ever meet.
"I'm optimistic that something can be worked out -- I don't know how -- that would allow us to support the President and his budget," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat. "I can tell you right now that we will not be signing off on what we see coming from the Senate."
Mr. Rangel is both a leader of the 38-member Congressional Black Caucus and a likely member of the House-Senate committee that will wrangle over the two versions of the budget once a bill passes the Senate.
A senior Senate aide suggested that the arithmetic was no easier on that side of the Capitol. "Just look at how different these two packages are," he said. "Just look at how different the politics are on each side."
 
Paths Do Not Converge
 In a broad sense, the Senate and House both seem to have given the President pretty much what he asked for: a package that would reduce the growth of Federal debt by $500 billion through 1998, raise taxes on wealthier people and lower them on the poor, and snip mostly around the edges of popular Federal benefits like Social Security and Medicare.
But because the two chambers got there in distinctly different ways, a conference battle looms.
In the House, a bloc of liberal Democrats provided the tissue-thin six-vote margin to pass a budget very much like the one the President submitted last spring.
In the Senate, a bloc of conservative Democrats who hold the balance of power shaped a package with a more pro-business bent. The sticking points in conference bargaining are likely to be these three:
*An energy tax. Mr. Clinton proposed, and the House passed, a tax that fell on virtually all sources of energy, though unevenly, to raise $71.5 billion through 1998. Under pressure from oil and gas interests, among others, the Senate cut that to a $24 billion tax that falls almost totally on gasoline, diesel and kerosene for transportation.
*Social programs. Mr. Clinton proposed, and House liberals swallowed, a plan that would reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $50 billion over five years. The House version also greatly increased the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, by $28.6 billion, and raised spending for food stamps. The Senate cut Medicare by another $19 billion and pared back the earned-income credit by about a third, to $18.2 billion.
*Empowerment zones. Mr. Clinton and the House agreed to a scaled-back version of President George Bush's "enterprise zone" concept, under which businesses would be awarded tax breaks if they located in disadvantaged areas and employed people who lived in them. The Senate omitted the proposal.
 
A Shotgun Wedding
 "There is not a human being alive who can tell you what the outcome of the conference will be," the Senate's majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said last week.
But the prospective merger of the Senate's pro-business program and the House's social-services agenda is being viewed by both sides with the sort of enthusiasm that might be reserved for a shotgun wedding of Adam Smith and Eleanor Roosevelt.
In radio interviews today in five major cities, Mr. Clinton repeatedly endorsed the House version of the budget plan and suggested that he and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had worked to soften the flintier version now emerging in the Senate.
At a broadcast news conference last week, Mr. Clinton assailed politicians who he said would balance the budget on the backs of the poor and elderly, and he declared that he was drawing the line at further such changes in his economic proposals.
But in their appearances today, neither he nor Mr. Bentsen was quite ready to say just where that line is being drawn.
"We'll just have to see what comes out of the conference. I don't know what'll happen," Mr. Clinton said when asked whether he could live with the Senate's version of the energy tax.

HEADLINE: From Tumult, New Visions Of Japan Inc.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 21

 BODY:
For four decades, Japan Inc. has been supported by a triad consisting of a single political party, a powerful bureaucracy and wealthy business organizations.
Now, one leg of the stool, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is on the verge of splintering and perhaps losing power, ending a period of political stability widely believed to have been conducive to business growth.
Reflecting the concern about this, the Tokyo stock market today suffered its sharpest drop this year, with the Nikkei average plummeting 592.11 points, or 3 percent, to 19,212.43.
 
Yen Is Also Weaker
 The Japanese yen was also pounded in Tokyo trading today, closing at 110.48 yen to the dollar, about 3 yen weaker than it closed on Friday, before legislators approved a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that will almost certainly drive him from office. 
 Despite the uncertainty, many executives here welcome what might evolve into a two-party or multiparty system.
"We were very happy that we have had a stable period in Government in the past 20 to 30 years, but it's been too long," said Hiroo Kinoshita, a senior managing director at the Sumitomo Corporation, the large trading company.
In business, there is a feeling that Japan's industrial strategy of control of business by Government and policies aimed at catching up to the West has succeeded as much as it can and that new strategies are needed.
Political reform, some say, could help speed needed business-related reforms like deregulation, lowering of land prices by improving supply, promotion of entrepreneurship and moves toward consumerism.
Business deregulation and consumerism in particular could also be good for America by making it easier for American companies to do business here.
 
'Constrained' Potential
 "The potential of the Japanese economy is obviously constrained by an old system that has lasted from the postwar period," said Haruo Shimada, professor of economics at Keio University. "Inability to reform itself will seriously undermine the flexibility of the Japanese economy."
In the short run, the turmoil sparked by Friday's rebellion will mean confusion in the economic area and a power vacuum. Important decisions, including those involved in trade negotiations with America and next month's Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo are likely to be delayed.
Beyond that, what happens will depend on how the political situation turns out. The Liberal Democratic Party might retain a majority after the July 18 elections for the lower house of Parliament.
But a faction of the party led by the former Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata and the power broker Ichiro Ozawa is planning to break away and start a new party. It is discussing forming a coalition with existing opposition parties, including the Japan Socialist Party. Ultimately, a two-party system or a system with coalition governments might evolve.
 
Socialists and Deficits
 One worry for business is that the Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, will end up gaining power. "In any country, Socialists are bad for business," said Kazuo Nukazawa, a managing director of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying group, which will continue to support the Liberal Democrats.
Another potential problem, Mr. Nukazawa said, is that if there is a system of competing parties, each might try to win votes with spending programs that will drive Japan into a national budget deficit.
Still, Mr. Nukuzawa said that on the whole, Japan might be better off with two moderate parties because the one-party system has tended to breed corruption.
The three-legged stool has worked like this: Bureaucrats in powerful agencies like the Finance Ministry and the International Trade and Industry Ministry have had strong control over business. It is the bureaucrats who actually draw up most new laws and submit them to Parliament. The bureaucrats also interpret and enforce the laws.
But the politicians, meaning the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, influence the bureaucrats and make some big decisions like whether to send troops abroad or change the tax system. And businesses, particularly through lobbying groups like Keidanren, give contributions to the Liberal Democratic Party in order to gain some influence over the bureaucrats.
 
Builders and Farmers
 Two of the industries that contribute most to the Liberal Democratic Party are the construction industry and agriculture; these are two Japanese industries that are most protected by the Government.
The Liberal Democratic Party draws much of its support from farmers, who have voting power out of proportion to their relatively small number because voting districts were not adjusted as the nation became urbanized. Urban consumers pay high prices for some products, like produce and rice, because of bans on imports to support the farmers.
But if new parties come to the fore, analysts say, more attention will have to be paid to city dwellers, who make up the bulk of the population. That might make it more likely for laws to be passed to allow imports of agricultural products.
That could also speed adoption of policies to make more farmland available for development, easing high prices for land and housing. Lower land prices could also help make it less expensive for foreign companies to set up shop in Japan.
 
Thinning Red Tape
 Another potentially big change could be a weakening of the bureaucracy. Until now, the bureaucrats have gone on their course regardless of who happened to be in the Cabinet.
But the bureaucrats have thrived under a single-party system. If there are two parties that will alternate in power, the bureaucrats might have to repeatedly change course. "I think it will make the agencies weaker," said Taizo Yokoyama, a managing director at the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and a former official at the International Trade and Industry Ministry.
Whatever happens, however, it is almost certain that change will be slow. "There's real evolution going on, but I don't think we're going to see a revolution," said Gregory W. Noble, assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley.
One reason for this is the opposition parties are not too different in their policies from the Liberal Democrats. Even the Socialist Party is not really antibusiness and has been drifting toward the center.
 
No Guarantee for U.S.
 Hopes that a Japan run a group other than the Liberal Democratic Party would help the United States could also prove to be wishful thinking.
The Socialist Party, for instance, is as staunchly opposed to opening up Japan's rice market as the Liberal Democratic Party is, if not more so.
Moreover, the political reform will sweep into power more quickly a new generation of leaders that is not as beholden to America as the generation that came of age during and immediately after World War II. That generation, which includes Prime Minister Miyazawa, feels obligated to America for the role it played in Japan's recovery from the war and has been willing at times to bend to meet American demands.
"We've had a credit running with the older generation," said James Abegglen, chairman of Gemini Consulting. "The last of that group just bit the dust. That credit line has just run out."

HEADLINE: New York City Census Profile Shows Stark Changes in Decade

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Even as real income rose in all but three of New York's neighborhoods in the 1980's, one of the city's poorest places -- Hunts Point in the Bronx -- grew poorer by 30 percent. On Staten Island, the most suburban borough, the number of foreign-born people increased four times faster than in the city as a whole. And the number of New Yorkers with college degrees increased more than 44 percent.
Fleshing out a stark profile, a new portrait of New York City drawn from the 1990 census reveals broad demographic changes along with striking contrasts in neighborhoods that have reinvented themselves to accommodate newcomers. 
 Immigration remade much of the city. In 1990, New Yorkers born abroad constituted a majority of the residents in five neighborhoods, compared with only one a decade before. Puerto Ricans, though barely constituting half of the Hispanic population, surpassed people of Italian and Irish heritage as the single largest ethnic group.
The statistical portrait prepared by the City Planning Commission offers a wealth of census data for all of the city's 59 community districts, areas created for purposes of planning and delivery of services.
The commission's data confirmed profound disparities between poor and rich and in educational attainment. Citywide, nearly 7 in 10 people 25 and older had high school degrees, but in 10 of the city's 59 community districts a majority of the adults were not high school graduates.
Over all, nearly 1 in 4 New Yorkers 25 or older -- 1.1 million in all -- had college degrees, compared with about 1 in 6, or 776,000, 10 years before. But the figure varies graphically by district: from nearly 2 in 3 on Manhattan's Upper East Side to fewer than 1 in 25 in the Bronx sections of Melrose, Mott Haven and Port Morris.
Some social and economic indicators showed perceptible improvement, but a portion of those gains may have evaporated since the census measured income four years ago. In three disparate neighborhoods -- Canarsie in Brooklyn, Tottenville on Staten Island and Hunts Point in the South Bronx -- the percentage of women working or looking for work had nearly doubled. Citywide, a majority of women were working or looking for work.
"Economics," Joseph Salvo, director of the Planning Department's Population Division, said of the trend. More families need two-earner couples to survive, he said, and more separated, divorced and unmarried women have to make ends meet on their own. The census also found that nearly half the city's renters spend more than 25 percent of their income on housing.
 
Vivid Differences
 If the overview is largely unsurprising, demographers are reveling in the details, which demonstrate how individual neighborhoods changed during the 1980's and how vividly many of them differ from each other.
In the South Bronx, which includes the only community districts in which inflation-adjusted income declined, 1 in 2 households were receiving public assistance. On the Upper East Side, 1 in 50 were. During the 1980's, the percentage of poor people dropped by 20 percent in Jamaica, Hollis and St. Albans, Queens, where more and more members of minority groups have graduated to the middle class. But in the Longwood and Hunts Point sections of the Bronx, the number of poor people leaped by 30 percent.
In Elmhurst and South Corona, Queens, more than 6 in 10 residents were born abroad and nearly half of the people 5 years old or more have trouble speaking English. In Chinatown and Washington Heights in Manhattan, Hunts Point in the Bronx and Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn, 4 in 10 people did not speak English well.
Immigration changed virtually every neighborhood. In the southern half of Staten Island, the number of foreign-born people increased 43 percent, but only to 9 percent of the population. In neighborhoods flanking the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, the percentage of foreign-born people rose during the decade to 29 percent from 17 percent.
In Flatbush in Brooklyn, more than 1 in 3 people are of West Indian ancestry and Italians constitute seven-tenths of 1 percent of the population. In Bensonhurst and Bath Beach, Brooklyn, half the residents are of Italian origin and only three-tenths of 1 percent are West Indian.
Among the residents of Manhattan's Washington Heights section, more than 4 in 10 are Dominican. In Brooklyn's Sunset Park, the largest Hispanic group is Mexicans, who made up 3.5 percent of the population.
 
Dramatic Contrasts
 Contrasts between the South Bronx and the Upper East Side were most dramatic.
In Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris in the South Bronx, more than 1 in 4 households reported income of less than $5,000 a year and the median was $9,725 -- down from $11,191 a decade earlier in 1989 constant dollars. Nearly 6 in 10 renters spent more than 25 percent of their household income on rent. More than half lived below the poverty level, including nearly two-thirds of the people younger than age 18. And 63 percent of the people 25 and over had not graduated from high school.
In the South Bronx neighborhoods, more than 1 in 4 teen-agers between the ages of 16 and 19 are neither enrolled in school nor a high school graduate and among those, three-quarters are unemployed or not even looking for work. Nearly 1 in 5 of the employed people work for local government, while 2 in 3 of all workers depend on public transportation and more than 8 in 10 do not own a car.
Among the anomalies found by the census, 18 people, or one-tenth of 1 percent of the population in those Bronx neighborhoods, reported median household income of $150,000 or more a year and 187 said they owned three or more vehicles.
 
More High School Graduates
 On the Upper East Side, 3.2 percent of the households reported annual income of less than $5,000 and the median was $53,000 -- up from $37,383 in 1979. About 4 in 10 renters spent more than 25 percent of household income on rent. Fewer than 6 percent of the people are poor. Under 8 percent of those 25 and older were not high school graduates.
Fewer than 1 in 20 Upper East Side teen-agers between 16 and 19 are neither enrolled in school nor high school graduates. Fewer than 1 in 10 of the employed people work for local government. Urban living creates several common denominators, though: nearly 6 in 10 workers from the Upper East Side use public transportation and 7 in 10 have no car, while in the southern half of Staten Island, only 1 in 10 residents has no car.
Still, 19,705 households, or 16 percent, reported median income of $150,000 or more, and 702 residents reported owning three or more vehicles.
An analysis of the "Socioeconomic Profiles," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the City Planning Department, shows that "new immigrant communities have emerged in parts of the city where older immigrant groups once resided."

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Edge Up in Dull Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose moderately yesterday in lackluster trading. But the broader market was mixed, displaying pockets of strength, as investors moved cautiously.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.05 points, to 3,510.82, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange at 223.7 million shares, down from the 300.5 million shares traded on Friday. 
 The broader Big Board composite index also gained, rising 1.25 points, to 246.19, with gaining issues outnumbering losing issues, 1,119 to 837. And the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks increased 2.54 points, to 446.22.
But the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues fell 0.85 point, to 688.74, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.18 point, to 436.64, and the Russell 2000, a measure of smaller issues, lost 0.70 point, to 228.32.
Nike and Caterpillar weighed on the blue-chip indicators, keeping them from making major gains. Nike announced late Friday that it expected 1994 earnings to be well below estimates. Its stock fell 4 1/8 yesterday, to 57 7/8. In after-hours trading on Friday, the stock had plunged 5, to 62.
Caterpillar suffered from what traders said were reports that the company had indicated May orders in overseas markets were softer, even though the trend was not unexpected. Its shares were down as much as 3 yesterday, closing at 75 3/4, down 1 1/2.
Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and technical analyst with Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc., Charlotte, N.C., said yesterday's market was reflective of its selloff on Friday, when "triple witching" expirations of options and futures pulled the Dow down better than 27 points.
"Earnings forecast to the negative side by some of the larger companies like Apple and 3M have kept the market in a tight trading range over the past few weeks because interest rates are relatively stable and mutual funds are still with a bit of cash on hand and no alternative investments they can call attractive at this time," Mr. Harrington said.
General Motors increased its projection of 1993 domestic car and truck sales yesterday to 14 million from 13.7 million, based on an "improving market." Its stock jumped 1 1/4, to 43. Traders said the auto maker was also thought to be considering spinning off or selling its Electronic Data Systems unit.
Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony, says his firm's objective is for G.M. stock at 44 or 45.
Pfizer fell 1 3/4, to 70 3/8, after Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons cut her rating on the stock to hold from buy. Traders said her office had cited Pfizer's growth as already having been discounted.
Shares of American Pacific fell 1 1/2, to 13 1/2. The company said a shareholder complaint had been filed against the chemical company and some of its officials contending that inadequate information was disclosed concering agreements with Thiokol, a major client.
Briggs & Stratton, the lawn mower engine manufacturer, was the subject of a report in Barron's that it may have earnings for the year ending June 30 that are higher than analysts' forecast of $4.40 to $4.50 a share. The stock jumped 2 1/2, to 63 7/8.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen And Mark as a Rally Builds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged by nearly a yen yesterday in an extension of Friday's powerful rally touched off by political uncertainty in Japan and economic stagnation in Germany.
The dollar's new bullish tone has put a halt to more than four months of appreciation in the Japanese yen, and traders expect the United States currency to rise even further this week as it breaks above key resistance levels. 
Gold was mostly lower on world markets. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery, the most active contract, declined $1.40 a troy ounce, to $371.10. The Republic National Bank quoted a late spot bid of $369.60 a troy ounce, off $1.40.
 
No-Confidence Vote
 On Friday, the dollar rose more than two yen and more than two pfennigs after Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan lost the support of members of his own party as many of them joined in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. He dissolved the lower house for early elections, a vote that is expected to be held in July.
The dollar continued to build on that momentum yesterday in Tokyo, where world currency trading starts its day. The dollar closed there at 110.48 yen, up 3.08 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 110.95 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar fetched 110.65 yen, up from late Friday's 109.75 yen.
The dollar also gained new ground against the German mark. In European trading, the dollar broke above the key resistance level of 1.6850 marks to close at 1.6855 German marks, up from 1.6805 late Friday.
It continued to rise in New York before slipping somewhat in late trading to close at 1.6875 German marks, up from 1.6805 late Friday. The slight pullback apparently was due to traders cashing in on the dollar's run-up.
 
Interest Rates Favor Dollar
 Global interest rates also favor the dollar's appreciation. The Federal Reserve has indicated its willingness to raise interest rates to combat inflation, if necessary. Higher interest rates would raise demand for dollars by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
Conversely, the German Bundesbank has a policy of slow but steady reductions in rates to help its stagnant economy.
The British pound fell to $1.4850 in London, from $1.5000 late Friday. By 4 P.M. in New York, the pound fetched $1.4886, down from late Friday's $1.4970.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices to Decide if Ash Is a Hazardous Waste

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
In a case that could help determine the economics of municipal waste disposal, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the ash left from the burning of municipal solid waste must be treated as hazardous waste, requiring special treatment that could increase the cost of disposal by as much as 10 times.
The issue has been one of the more disputed aspects of Federal environmental policy in recent years. It has split the lower Federal courts and has produced an agonizing series of policy changes within the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued a policy statement last fall stating that the ash should be exempted from hazardous waste regulation. 
 But the Federal appeals court in Chicago later ruled that the ash was hazardous waste after all. The opinion, by Chief Judge William J. Bauer, declared that "the E.P.A. has changed its view so often that it is no longer entitled to the deference normally accorded an agency's interpretation of the statute it administers."
The problem stems from a vaguely worded Federal law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which governs the disposal of hazardous waste. The law contains an exemption for incinerators designed to recover energy, like steam or electricity, from the burning of municipal solid waste: the incinerator itself is not to be regulated as a hazardous waste facility.
But the law says nothing about the residue of the incineration. If the ash can be buried at low cost as ordinary landfill, the energy-producing incinerators would make economic sense for many cities. If the ash has to be stored under the special conditions required for hazardous waste, the cost would increase dramatically, making it cheaper for cities to bury their waste.
The Court granted an appeal filed by the city of Chicago, which owns and operates a resource-recovery incinerator, the Northwest Waste-to-Energy Facility. The incinerator handles 14 percent of the city's solid waste and produces $1.5 million worth of steam a year, which the city sells to industry and utilities. The ash is buried in an ordinary landfill in Michigan for about $23 a ton; it would cost about $210 a ton to store the ash as hazardous waste.
Chicago was sued by the Environmental Defense Fund, which argued that Federal law required the ash to be treated as hazardous waste. The Federal District Court in Chicago ruled for the city in a decision that was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
In its appeal, Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, No. 92-1639, the city said its costs would grow by $20 million a year if the incinerator's ash was treated as hazardous waste. There are 137 municipal energy-recovery incinerators in the country, with dozens more being planned.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
Belated Evidence
The Court agreed to decide whether an employer can avoid liability under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for discriminating against an employee if, in the course of the employee's discrimination lawsuit, unrelated evidence emerges that would have provided independent grounds for dismissing the employee.
In this case, a woman who was employed as a security officer for a university sued her employer under the Civil Rights Act for sex discrimination and sexual harassment. During pretrial discovery, the university's lawyers learned that the woman had stated falsely on her employment application that she had never been convicted of a crime; in fact she had pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol.
There was no dispute that the false statement would have been grounds for dismissal; the question for the Court is whether this "after-acquired evidence" absolves the employer of liability for its discriminatory conduct. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, found that although the employer violated the Civil Rights Act, it was entitled to win the case because the plaintiff had obtained her job through fraud.
The Clinton Administration urged the Court to hear the woman's appeal, Milligan-Jensen v. Michigan Technological University, No. 92-1214, on the ground that the appeals court's approach to the case had a "vast potential for abuse" that would encourage employers to defend discriminatory conduct with irrelevant evidence. The belatedly discovered evidence "does not negate the discrimination that actually occurred," the Administration's brief argued.
 
Lingering Segregation
 Thirty-nine years after the Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that the schools of Topeka, Kan., were unconstitutionally segregated, the Justices let stand a ruling by a Federal appeals court that the school system had still not completely erased the vestiges of segregation.
The old lawsuit was revived in 1979 by Linda Brown, the original plaintiff, on behalf of her two children. It has been in the courts since then, producing several rulings. In the latest decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled last October that the system was still not desegregated in student and faculty assignments. While there are no all-black or all-white schools, several schools are identifiable by race.
The school board's appeal, Unified School District v. Smith, No. 92-1568, argued that the appeals court had ignored recent Supreme Court rulings under which formerly segregated school districts were not to be held accountable for all lingering racial imbalances. The Federal District Court in Kansas must now devise a remedy for the remaining segregation in Topeka.
 
Solicitor General Introduced
 Attorney General Janet Reno went to the Court today to introduce the Clinton Administration's new Solicitor General, Drew S. Days 3d, to the Justices in a brief courtroom ceremony. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist welcomed Mr. Days, who will be in charge of preparing all Government cases in the Court, and also thanked William C. Bryson, a career Justice Department lawyer, who served as acting Solicitor General for the Administration's first five months.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Minority Firm to Manage Offering

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The New York City Water Finance Authority has selected a minority-owned securities firm, W. R. Lazard, Laidlaw & Mead, to handle today's $375 million offering of notes due next April.
The selection of W. R. Lazard marks the first time that a minority-owned firm has been the lead manager in New York financing of this size since 1987, when city officials began insisting that those firms be made part of the underwriting groups. 
 With interest rates for short-term municipal securities nearly as low as they have ever been, analysts said late yesterday that they expected the notes would be offered with a yield of less than 2.50 percent. The notes, which carry the top short-term rating from various agencies, will be repaid with proceeds of bonds the authority expects to sell next spring. If new bonds are not sold, repayment would come from the water and sewer charges the authority collects from 807,000 businesses and individuals in New York City.
 
Usually a Co-Manager
 W. R. Lazard is no stranger to large municipal financings, but like other minority-owned firms, it has been relegated to a role as one of many co-managers. Because W. R. Lazard was the financial adviser to the Water Finance Authority for many years, it was a leading contender earlier this year when the authority selected three Wall Street firms to handle its securities offerings for the next two years.
Mark Page, executive director of the authority, noted that the authority had very little of its borrowing in the short-term market, and that today's financing was a way to take advantage of the low interest rates and strong demand for short-term securities. Most short-term tax-exempt notes are sold to mutual funds or other institutions, the group of investors which have had prior contacts with W. R. Lazard, he noted. Broader distribution to individuals, if necessary, will be available through Paine Webber and Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Company, the two co-managers for the deal.
Breaking the hold of large securities firms on the role of lead managing underwriter for such a large prominent issuer as the Water Finance Authority helps win business from other issuers. It is a more profitable position than co-manager since the lead manager generally earns most of the underwriting fees and has the authority to allocate securities among other members of the syndicate.
 
Treasury Market
 In the Treasury securities market yesterday, prices rose as much as 3/8 point for long-term bonds, while shorter maturities were unchanged to slightly higher.
Interest rates at the regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills were little changed at 3.10 percent and 3.19 percent respectively. One-year Treasury bills were traded at around 3.37 percent.
While concerns that the Fed would soon push short-term rates higher have subsided in recent days, Treasury bill rates remain higher than the levels that prevailed from late January to mid-May when the three-month issue traded below 3 percent. The fact that one-year interest rates on Treasury bills and interbank deposits are a quarter to half a percentage point higher than three-month interest rates is a reminder that credit market analysts still expect short-term rates to rise in the coming year.
In advance of today's auction of new two-year Treasury notes, securities dealers traded the issue in the wholesale market with a yield of 4.17 percent, down from 4.18 percent. The five-year issue to be auctioned tomorrow was traded among dealers at 5.19 percent, down from 5.22 percent.
 
Long-Term Benchmark
 The benchmark for the long-term bond market, the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent issue due in 2023 was offered late in the day at 10415/32 , up 3/8 point, or about $3.75 per $1,000 bond, to yield 6.77 percent.
Securities dealers said they were preoccupied during the day with preparing for this week's two note auctions. They said that while the supply of notes was heavy, demand was good, including sales to municipalities that are buying Treasury securities to use as collateral for "defeased" municipal bonds. Such bonds remain outstanding but have been refinanced so they are backed by pools of Treasury securities rather than the issuers' promise to repay.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: The Unknown Devil

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The temporary hold on health-care change has been greeted with relief by many health-care professionals who prefer the devil they know to the one they don't. More surprising, perhaps, is that the postponement is also generating relief among some economists who worry that reform would take too big a slice out of the economy at a time when it could ill afford it.
Whatever form the final proposal takes, a fresh start on the way care is delivered and financed is bound to set off wrenching structural changes and job cuts in an economy already reeling from industrial retrenchment. And it is likely to slow the development of technology that generates billions of dollars in exports. 
 But even as the recognition grows of the economic price attached to reform, most economists agree that the cost of delay would be even greater. Unchecked escalation in medical costs is already a serious drag on living standards of the majority of workers who, knowingly or not, pay for their own health insurance.
Equally important, procrastination would foil even the most resolute plans for balancing the Government budget. Since Americans have yet to show that they have the will "to stop and say 'gosh we should raise taxes,' " to cover exploding Federal medical outlays, points out Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, the failure to contain costs could send the deficit soaring by the end of the decade.
It is no mystery why the $800 billion industry is worried about the deals Hillary Rodham Clinton and company must have cut in smoke-free rooms. Any reform that Washington deems successful, notes Joseph Newhouse, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is bound to put pressure on both the incomes and job security of health- care providers.
Thus far, the public's attention has been focused on the princely earnings of physician-specialists. But by Mr. Newhouse's calculation, the surplus gleaned by this medical and surgical royalty is a modest fraction of total expenditures. All physicians' earnings after expenses amount to just one-tenth of the national health bill.
Those most vulnerable to cuts, he reckons, will be the hundreds of thousands of semiskilled hospital workers whose services do not seem critical to saving lives. The pressure to perform triage on health-care jobs could hardly come at a more awkward time.
While the employment picture looked less gloomy in May, the Great American Job Machine remains stalled. The 1.1 million health care jobs created over the last four years represent half the jobs created in the economy.
 
Job Picture Not Good
 Although a full-fledged recovery would remove some pressure, the streamlining of the giant defense, construction and financial service industries will no doubt keep unemployment offices busy.
By the same token, successful cost containment might dull the sheen on America's bright successes in key areas of high technology: drugs and medical equipment. While the reformers will no doubt aim at what they see as marginally useful tests and treatments, the introduction of expensive drugs and machines will surely also be slowed. "It is far from clear we would cut the least valuable technologies," Mr. Newhouse said.
The most significant impact would be on the quality of medical care, at least for those who can afford the best. But reforms could also undermine earnings from exports and foreign royalties, at a time when Washington is fixated on regaining world leadership in high technology.
That is hardly the end of the story. Cost containment will be aimed at slowing the growth of medical outlays, says Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, not stopping it. And the effort will be accompanied by an expansion of health-care coverage for the poor. Thus, while there is likely to be a churning of jobs among regions and among institutions providing care, Mr. Bosworth acknowledges, "we are not talking about total cuts in employment."
 
Impatience With Jobs Focus
 In any case, economists who take the long view are impatient with the focus on jobs alone. "You can be a flat-earth person" and mourn labor-saving in health care, Mr. Reischauer says. But from that perspective, replacing telephone operators with automatic switches, was a step backward.
These economists are also quick to point out the doleful consequences of failing to check the growth of medical outlays. The most important of these is the least appreciated: the drag on workers' living standards. While Americans generally receive health insurance as a job benefit, Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University argues that "costs are mostly shifted back to take-home pay." The premiums generally come out of workers' incomes, whether or not they see an itemized deduction on their pay slips.
The mere fact that Americans are spending more on health care -- and thus have less to spend on other goods and services -- need not mean their living standard is suffering. Nobody, after all, would argue that rapidly escalating outlays for fresh fruit, compact disks and vacation travel are signs of falling personal welfare.
 
Buying Too Much Health Care
 But health care is different, Mr. Newhouse argues, because there is no competitive market in which consumers make informed choices with what they perceive as their own money. As one might expect, health-care buyers tend to buy too much because someone else is footing the bill.
In a famous experiment performed by the RAND Corporation, people with hefty annual insurance deductibles spent one-third less on medical care than those with first-dollar coverage, with no measurable loss in health. Economists thus have reason to believe a substantial portion of the nation's health-care dollar is wasted, and at the expense of the average insured wage earner.
This does not explain why big corporations, notably those providing the most comprehensive health insurance, are chomping at the bit for a financing system that spreads the cost over a broader base. In some cases, they may simply share the misunderstanding that the burden falls largely on profits, not pay. But Mr. Bosworth says there are important exceptions to the rule that workers foot the bill.
The Big Three car makers, for example, have much higher medical insurance bills than their foreign-owned competitors in America because their workers are, on average, much older. Thus the costs cannot be passed on to buyers without the risk of losing market share. What's more, the car companies long ago agreed to cover the insurance costs of retirees, an albatross now attached firmly to the necks of their stockholders.
 
Burden on the Budget
 But the biggest time bomb buried in the health insurance system -- the one driving a reluctant Washington to face the political risks of reform -- is the burden on the Federal budget. If Congress passes something close to the President's proposed budget, the deficit will absorb about half as much of the nation's income in 1996 as it did last year. And since virtually all expenditure categories in the budget are growing less rapidly than revenues, one might expect the deficit to continue to fall thereafter.
There is a multitrillion-dollar catch, however. If costs are not checked, the budget office estimates that Medicaid and Medicare outlays will rise to $672 billion in 2003, from $226 billion in 1993. In fact, projected increases in Medicare and Medicaid outlays plus the increase in interest payments on the accumulating Government debt attributable to medical spending would probably add up to more than 100 percent of the deficit a decade hence.
The country could muddle along with big deficits in the next decade as it did in the last. But it would torpedo the Clinton Administration's hopes for making a difference in the lives of the less privileged. To abandon health-care cost containment, Mr. Reinhardt concludes, is "to say the hell with education, infrastructure, welfare reform and everything else."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Soybeans at 12-Month High; Grain Prices Are Also Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Soybean futures shot up yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade to the highest price in more than a year as fears grew that too much Midwestern rain would reduce production.
Grain futures also rose. On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures ended mixed and oil futures weakened. 
 Soybeans for July delivery surged 15 1/4 cents, to $6.20 1/2 a bushel, the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since June 10 of last year. The contract traded as high as $6.26 during the session.
The November contract, representing the new soybean crop, climbed 15 1/2 cents, to $6.21 1/2 a bushel.
The soybean rally extended last week's 16 1/2-cent gain and followed a weekend of rainy weather in Midwestern states west of the Mississippi River, the region where the excessive moisture problem is most severe.
"You have a unique, bizarre circumstance developing here of a bull market because it's too wet," said Doug Jackson, a grains analyst with the Farmers Commodities Corporation in Des Moines. He said several million soggy acres in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota remained unplanted.
A weekly Agriculture Department report released after the close of trading showed that 83 percent of the American soybean crop had been planted as of Sunday, compared with a five-year average of 89 percent. Ninety-two percent of the crop was in the ground at this time last year.
"With weather forecasts calling for heavy rains midweek and this weekend, there is a possibility those acres will not planted until at least July 1," Mr. Jackson said. Soybeans planted in July can lose up to 40 percent of their yield potential, he said.
Light sweet crude oil for July delivery fell 5 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $18.62 a barrel; July heating oil dropped 0.25 cent, to 51.95 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline fell 0.19 cent, to 54.66 cents a gallon, and July natural gas fell 6 cents, to $2.195 for each 1,000 cubic feet.
Cattle futures ended mostly lower and pork futures mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in advance of a monthly Agriculture Department report on frozen meat supplies. The report, released after the markets closed, showed 78.9 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage as of May 31, compared with 92.7 million pounds a year earlier.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Nike Stock Off on Lower Growth Outlook

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 21

 BODY:
Shares in Nike Inc. took a beating today after the athletic shoe manufacturer's disclosure late Friday that it expects 1994 fiscal year earnings to be well below Wall Street estimates.
Nike's shares fell $4.125 today to close at $57.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. Nike made its announcement late Friday after the stock market close. In after-hours trading on Friday, the stock plunged $5, to $62. 
 Since reaching a 52-week high of $90.25, Nike's shares have lost roughly a third of their value.
Philip H. Knight, Nike's chairman, said in a statement Friday that the continued weakness in several European economies, and a sluggish retail environment in the United States, have prompted the company to scale back its growth projections for the 1994 fiscal year, which ends May 31, 1994.
"We believe the best response to these short-term economic conditions is to continue our relentless strategy of investing heavily in Europe and other developing international markets to strengthen the Nike brand and to gain market share," Mr. Knight said. "When one combines all these factors, it appears our earnings for fiscal 1994 will be significantly below the current mean of Wall Street analysts' expectations of approximately $5.50 per share."
Analysts rapidly readjusted their estimates to $5 a share or lower, and some said further reductions might be necessary. While the long-running trend toward more active life styles remains positive for Nike, discretionary purchases like athletic shoes are very vulnerable to economic weakness, they said. Analysts estimate Nike will post 1993 fiscal year earnings of around $4.78 when it reports final results in July.
"You're looking at a company that was supposed to grow by 13 percent, which will now grow by 5 percent only if things improve," said Alice A. Ruth an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
 
A Weak Retail Environment
 She said Nike was feeling the combined impact of the weak retail environment in the United States; the maturation of the athletic shoe industry, which meant more discounting to maintain market share, and the continued economic weakness in Europe. "Investors really don't have anything to hang their hopes on" with Nike, she said.
Josephine Esquivel, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said the timing of the announcement by Nike had irritated investors and perhaps prompted a greater decline in its shares.
"There was a meeting a month ago with analysts where they indicated some of the numbers on the Street were high, but not to this degree," she said. "The reality is they don't know to what degree 1994 is going to be bad; it's anybody's guess," she said. "If you're betting on no recovery in any of these pressed economies, they could go below $5," she said.

HEADLINE: The Economics of a Sports Cliche

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Pat Riley couldn't coach the New York Knicks past the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association playoffs this year, but in an ironic twist, he will benefit from the Bulls' third straight N.B.A. title.
With their 99-to-98 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday night, the Bulls earned the right to capitalize on a new merchandising wrinkle: the "three-peat" and "3-peat" trademarks. Those phrases were registered by Mr. Riley in 1989 when the Los Angeles Lakers, his former team, were thwarted in their quest for three straight titles. (An optimist, Mr. Riley also registered "four-ward.") 
Retailers expect "three-peat" and "3-peat" merchandise to add extra juice to sales of Bulls' championship merchandise. In 1991 and 1992, an estimated $45 million in licensed merchandise celebrating the Bulls' titles sold within 10 days of each season's final game.
"The Bulls have been our best-selling team for the last few years in licensed merchandise," said Bill Marshall, vice president of licensing for N.B.A. Properties. "I think we'll do significantly more this year."
 
Higher Total Royalties
 Although Mr. Riley was never able to use the trademark for the Lakers, now he and N.B.A. Properties, the licensing arm of the league, will share the royalties, an undisclosed percentage of the wholesale price of "three-peat" merchandise. Mr. Riley's prescience means companies will have to pay higher total royalties.
Forty-five of N.B.A. Properties' 120 licensees are making championship products, but only 15 are licensed to use "3-peat" or "three-peat" on products ranging from T-shirts, caps and pennants to backboards, towels and posters.
The goal has been to rush the merchandise out within hours of the final buzzer to capitalize on fans' euphoria.
At Wincraft Inc. in Winona, Minn., workers started churning out hundreds of thousands of pennants, pins and buttons immediately after the game. "We didn't change to a '3-peat' design until last week when it became apparent that it was a possibility," said Dick Pope, the company president, "and quite a few of our customers increased their pre-sale orders."
But not everyone is happy. The extra cost of licensing caused Huffy Sports to limit its production of "three-peat" backboards, said John Gallun, the Milwaukee-based company's manager of marketing and advance design. "It makes it too expensive," he said, noting that higher royalty payments will cut into his profit margin. "But Pat Riley is going to go home with a nice little piece of change."
Typically, companies are combining "3-peat" or "three-peat" with a variety of traditional championship and team designs and graphics on Bulls goods for the prime selling period -- between five and 10 days after the final game.
Logo 7 Inc. of Indianapolis was prepared to produce as many as 60,000 caps and 400,000 T-shirts, most of them featuring "3-peat" or "three-peat." Production started last night at plants in Chicago, Indianapolis and Massachusetts.
"Three-peat probably has the most sex appeal of any trademark I've been associated with," Matt Mirchin, vice president of sales for Logo 7, said, "because other teams have gone for it recently, but only the Bulls did it."
"If you don't have an item with 'three-peat' on it, why have it?" said Craig Van Orden, product development manager of Peter David Inc. of San Diego, which has initial orders for 10,000 collectible pins.
Some companies waited for the Bulls' final victory before producing goods, but others manufactured a quantity, running the risk of having to destroy items.
Magic Johnson T's, a company owned by the ex-Lakers' star, decided last week to take the gamble. By Thursday, it was producing shirts with four "3-peat" and "three-peat" designs at plants in Chicago and Gardena, Calif., in quantities exceeding several hundred thousand, according to Lon Rosen, Mr. Johnson's business manager.
Although most of the Bulls merchandise will sell in the Chicago area, the national and international renown of the team and its star, Michael Jordan, will probably generate substantially more sales outside the local market than if the Suns had won.
But so far, Mr. Marshall of the N.B.A. said, no one has asked to license "four-ward."

HEADLINE: China Breaks Ground for World's Largest Dam

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: YICHANG, China

 BODY:
THE bulldozers are scooping out the yellow earth along the Yangtze River in preparation for the world's largest hydroelectric project, a dam that will create a lake 350 miles long, fuel China's industrial revolution and save millions of people from the constant threat of flooding.
Or perhaps the project will simply create the world's most colossal mud pie. 
 Critics say that silting behind the dam may result in a $30 billion bog that would inundate China's finest natural scenery and stand as one of the most monumental and vexing legacies of Chinese Communism.
The disagreement is no surprise, for people have been debating the merits of the Three Gorges Dam since the idea was proposed in 1919. But while the debate seems endless, one thing has changed: work on the dam is finally beginning.
"The way things look right now, I don't think it can be delayed any more," said Jiang Xueyuan, the white-haired spokesman for the Three Gorges Project office here in Yichang, the nearest city to the dam site in central China. Mr. Jiang, like many other engineers who have spent their careers designing the dam, is delighted that the supporters finally seem to have won the battle.
Those whose homes, farmland and heritage would be flooded are naturally less enthusiastic. Among the 1.2 million people being forced to move to make way for the project is a furniture vendor in Wanxian, a grimy Yangtze River port.
"None of us want to leave, because our lives depend on this port," said the man, who identified himself only as Mr. Gao, between efforts to interest a foreigner in a $4 wicker chair. "Officially, everyone has to support it, but no one wants to go. What'll happen to us?"
A five-day journey down the Yangtze, through the area that will be flooded, found not everyone so opposed to the project, with some peasants so poor that they seem happy to move. The more optimistic -- or perhaps credulous -- believe the Government's promises of fertile new farmland, prosperous new factories, fancy new homes and lucrative new jobs.
The Three Gorges Dam, sometimes described as the most important construction project in China since the Great Wall, was formally approved last year. It involves a 607-foot-high dam stretching 1.2 miles along the third of the Yangtze River's three famous gorges.
The gorges, which are as famous in China as the Grand Canyon is in the United States, would be partly submerged. The Yangtze in its middle reaches would look more like a lake than a river.
The Three Gorges Dam would not be the highest in the world, nor would its reservoir be the biggest. But its hydroelectric output would be 17,680 megawatts, by far the biggest in the world and nearly three times as much as the output of the Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest in the United States.
The project has a special resonance in part because it would transform the Yangtze, the mightiest river in the nation, known in Chinese simply as the Chang Jiang, "the long river." The Yangtze River basin is home to 35 percent of all Chinese, accounting for nearly 8 percent of all humanity.
Among them is a hefty 60-year-old man with a crew cut who sells dogeared magazines -- mostly with covers of big-breasted women looking either sultry or anguished -- on a patch of ground along the main street in the town of Wanxian.
"We don't want to move," the man said slowly, speaking Mandarin with a thick local peasant accent. "But what can you do? The water's going to come, and then you've got to go."
Still, he accepted the Government's logic that the project was fundamentally good for China. While official propaganda is often regarded with skepticism in the cities, the peasants and workers who will have to make way for the dam seem to accept the official line that it is necessary to control flooding and generate electricity.
"People can't help but feel a bit unsettled in their hearts," said Guo Qinglu, a 60-year-old retiree in Wanxian. "Generations have lived here. Their ancestors are buried here.
"But the dam is a good thing," Mr. Guo added, nodding his head slowly as he stood in a small restaurant. "It'll produce lots of electricity. So while some people here support it and some are against it, most are in favor of the dam."
Apparently only a few hundred people have been evicted so far, although every official seems to have a different estimate. In any case, the bulk of the work in relocating 1.2 million people will not take place until late in this decade.
 
The Dam's Twisted History
 So far the work on the dam is all preparatory. Laborers with heavy equipment are building access roads on each side of the dam site and are beginning construction of a bridge just downstream to facilitate construction. Workers are also digging a new channel to divert a creek.
Housing for the workers and engineers is already in place, and work will begin later this year on a cofferdam, to divert the Yangtze slightly so that work can begin on the main dam.
Still, the history of the project has had more twists and turns than the Yangtze itself, and it could be killed -- or, more likely, postponed indefinitely.
Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old senior leader, supports the project, but he is ailing and a growing number of Chinese are beginning to accept that he may be mortal after all. Several other top party elders who were among the dam's strongest backers -- Wang Zhen, Wang Renzhong and Li Xiannian -- have died since the project was approved early last year.
One of the strongest supporters of the dam among China's younger leaders is Prime Minister Li Peng. But Mr. Li apparently suffered a heart attack in late April, and he has appeared in public only once since then. The state of his health, physical and political, remains uncertain.
"If Li Peng remains out of commission, then I don't think the Three Gorges Project will go very far," said a Chinese who circulates among some of the leaders.
For now, the official news media are talking about plans to accelerate the project. It was supposed to take 18 years to complete, but the leaders are now talking about 17 years or fewer.
Progress reports on the dam are regular front-page news in China, partly because of the historical intimacy here between society and water. Few Chinese can name many ancient emperors, but everybody knows of the Great Yu, the ancient hero who conquered a flood and then built the dikes and water projects that nurtured Chinese civilization.
It is difficult to separate myth from history in those ancient times, about 2200 B.C., but some experts believe that Yu, who later founded China's first dynasty, was a real individual. If so, he is one of the first people in human history, outside ancient Egypt, who is known by name.
In the United States, presidents may hope to be remembered for a foreign policy doctrine or a social program. But in China, the best chance for an emperor, past or present, to be remembered is with a huge water project.
And that, say critics of the Three Gorges project, is the problem.
"It's a political project," said Dai Qing, a Chinese writer and environmentalist, as she nibbled on a salad the other day, studiously ignoring a state security agent eavesdropping from the next table. Ms. Dai, who was imprisoned after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and lost her job, has emerged as the leading opponent of the Three Gorges project.
 
Fear of Flooding
 Critics like Ms. Dai say that the push to build the dam has less to do with the need for electricity than the desire for a grand monument, which they say, is likely to turn into a white elephant. Gigantic projects have often served a political role in China, as a national show and tell that can unite people in pride, just as construction of the Aswan Dam served a similar role in Egypt and the drive to put a man in space did in the United States.
The main argument in favor of the dam is not the need for electricity, because it would be cheaper and simpler to build several smaller hydroelectric dams. Rather, the primary argument is flood control.
The Yangtze River, like the Yellow River, has gradually filled in much of its channel through silting. Over the centuries, people responded by building dikes on either side, and when silt raised the bottom of the channel they raised the dikes even higher.
As a result, in some places the Yangtze is known as a "hanging" river, because it is higher than the towns on each side. Only the dikes keep the water in place, protecting the millions of people living on lower ground.
One of China's worst nightmares would be a devastating flood like the one of 1870, the worst in the last 1,000 years. If the dikes burst unexpectedly in the middle of the night, hundreds of thousands of people could die.
"If we don't build this dam, then who will take responsibility for the flooding?" asked Cui Zhihao, a senior engineer at the Three Gorges head office in the city of Wuhan. "A single flood would cause far more damage and dislocation than the Three Gorges Dam."
Proponents of the dam say that the existing Jinjiang dike can withstand only a 10-year flood, meaning the worst that can typically be expected in a decade. But it may be in their interest to exaggerate the risk, so as to make the construction of the dam seem more urgent.
The engineers grumblingly acknowledge that no recent flood has burst the Jinjiang dike, not even the 1954 flood, which is believed to be a 100-year flood, meaning the worst that can be expected in a typical century. When pressed, some engineers say that the Jinjiang dike can withstand at least a 20-year flood, or a 40-year flood if several catchment areas are deliberately flooded to ease the pressure.
The major technical debate over the dam is the question of silting. The Yangtze sometimes resembles soup more than water, and it carries 523 million tons of sediment each year. Critics charge that the dam will cause the water to slow down and drop silt on the bottom of the reservoir, gradually turning the lake into an unnavigable mud puddle.
Government engineers say they have licked the silting problem. They say that tests show that the lake will be navigable for as long as the dam lasts.
For all such technical complexities, the major reason why the project might still be postponed is easy to understand: cost. While official estimates are $10 billion or less, inflation and cost overruns could make that much higher. The Gezhouba Dam, built in the 1970's and 80's a bit farther downstream on the Yangtze, ended up costing more than three times the initial projection.
At a time when the Government has a budget deficit and the economy is already overheated, some economic officials apparently think it is mistake to tackle another huge construction project.
Some Western environmental groups are calling on the World Bank not to finance the dam, but China believes that in any case it can attract foreign lenders and investors to help pay for the project. And supporters still express confidence that they will see the Three Gorges Dam built in their lifetimes.
"This has been discussed and debated for decades," said Luo Shixiao, a 56-year-old engineer who helps run the Three Gorges project office in Chongqing. "There've been lots of different opinions, lots of research, lots of discussions. But the consensus is that building the dam is better than not building it, and that building it earlier is better than building it later."
Mr. Luo paused and offered a fleeting and slightly triumphant smile: "I'm confident that construction will go ahead quite smoothly."

HEADLINE: Japan: How Clean a Break?

 BODY:
Politicians continue to defect from Japan's Liberal Democratic Party in the wake of last Friday's no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Some of these are honest reformers, outraged at the Liberal Democrats' failure to meet the public demand for a cleaner system. Others are opportunists, betting on political realignment as the quickest ticket to the rewards of high office.
It's high drama -- the fracturing of a system of one-party rule that delivered remarkable economic growth and endured for almost 40 years. But beneath the choreographed rituals of Japanese party politics lie even more dramatic changes in public opinion. A new generation of urban Japanese, raised in affluence, is now turning against big-money politics while it seeks a better balance between producer and consumer interests in Japanese life. 
 In the short run, the upheaval could lead to even weaker governments. That could make Japan a still more frustrating ally and trading partner -- and complicate next month's Tokyo economic summit meeting. But if the party realignment now under way gives voice to this new urban constituency, both Japan and its partners could benefit.
The Liberal Democratic debacle has been brewing for a long time. Four years of "money politics" scandals and two years of recession battered the party's popularity. And the end of the cold war removed the original anti-Communist rationale for its existence. Still, as long as the only alternative was the doctrinaire and discredited Socialists, the Liberal Democrats stayed on top.
What changed matters was the revolt launched six months ago by two top Liberal Democrats, Ichiro Ozawa and Tsutomu Hata. Mr. Ozawa, a protege of Shin Kanemaru, the deal maker who now symbolizes political corruption, and Mr. Hata, a former Agriculture Minister who once championed crude protectionism, improbably declared themselves champions of the new Japan.
Suddenly there was a safe, center-right alternative to the Liberal Democrats, especially after the Ozawa-Hata faction started negotiating alliances with reform-minded opposition groups. To build a new majority, this prospective coalition will have to appeal to urban consumers, whose sense of prosperity is undercut by the high land, housing and food prices of a producer-oriented economy.
Besides political reform, Mr. Ozawa stands for a more assertive foreign policy and for building up the power of elected leaders at the expense of Japan's powerful bureaucrats. That might appeal to Americans frustrated by Tokyo's overcautious diplomacy and bureaucratic sabotage of negotiated agreements. For years, Washington preferred dealing with the Liberal Democrats, but changed conditions call for re-examining that preference.
President Clinton will now be attending the Tokyo summit conference in the midst of a hotly contested election campaign. Without any discourtesy to his host, he must take care to demonstrate America's scrupulous political neutrality. By the time Washington's newly named Ambassador, Walter Mondale, takes up his post, Japan's political direction might be clearer. More than any of his predecessors, Mr. Mondale will need to look beyond the rituals of party politics to track the emergence of a new Japan.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton, Iraq And Iran

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In the winter and spring of 1993, the Clinton Administration quietly worked out an important new policy toward the two countries that could involve the United States again in Mideastern war.
Since Europe was busy boxing Mr. Clinton's ears about not taking over its job on Bosnia, and the American press and public were out getting a haircut, the Administration managed to squeeze in some useful thinking on Iran and Iraq without being belabored for it. 
 But it has to do two things to give reality to the policy it calls "dual containment." It has to keep the U.S. militarily strong and politically steadfast. Second: It has to persuade its allies to show the same sense of purpose, even though it will hurt at the weapons-trade cash register.
For more than a decade, Iraq's power grew under a dictator who never hid his intention to rule the Mideast. Meanwhile Iran's mullahs saw themselves as the crashing wave of Islam, sweeping all, and were developing the military power to match their dreams.
High-devastation weapons, nuclear power, terrorism and religious extremism had changed international equations and dangers. But under Presidents Reagan and Bush, U.S. policy makers reached into the past to come up with the idea of creating a "balance of power" by playing Iran and Iraq against each other.
Iran received missiles through the courtesy of the U.S. and Israel. Iraq was stuffed with American loans and Western arms. The result was that Iraq felt strong enough to risk war with the U.S. while Iran sat back and garaged late-model Iraqi warplanes.
Saddam Hussein lost the war but not his throne or his ambitions. He makes war against millions of his own countrymen, and constantly tests the resolve of the West.
"Dual containment" recognizes the continuing reality of the Iraqi danger without giving in to the temptation to build Iran as a counterbalance.
Because of the failure to oust Saddam, the U.S will be in a state of war with Iraq until he is overthrown. Containment may be the best the U.S. can do meanwhile, but to hold the line against him it must be real.
Right now, it is Saddam's internal enemies who are being contained at least as much as he. In their "safe havens" the Kurds are being squeezed economically by Saddam's blockade and harassed by his nearby armed forces. Throughout the world, his representatives are recognized as speaking for the people he oppresses while the dissident Iraqi National Council hunts for diplomatic crumbs.
Containing Saddam must mean more than responding to his violations of U.N. resolutions. It should mean ordering him to pull back the troops that threaten the Kurds, and ending his blockade. And from the West the Kurds should receive economic aid and basic military equipment to protect themselves when he attacks in strength -- when, not if.
The council of dissident Iraqis should be recognized as the first step in creating a counter-Saddam provisional government.
And for Iran: The Clinton Administration believes containment is impossible without ending the sale to Teheran of weapons and dual-use materiel. This is equipment and technology that are supposed to be for peaceful purposes but can be converted to military use. Washington puts Iranian nuclear power as no more than five years away.
Since there is no U.N. arms embargo against Iran, the Administration will have to be hard and mean with its friends. Does anybody think that Western corporations, including American, that fattened Saddam Hussein militarily are not ready to do the same for Iran if their governments permit? Or the Japanese or Russians?
The Clinton people see "dual containment" and Mideast weapons control as two steps in a three-part Mideast strategy. The third is an Arab-Israeli peace.
But Iraq and Iran will not sit around waiting for containment handcuffs. Iran will call out all fundamental forces in the Mideast to destroy any Israeli-Arab peace. And Iraq and Iran could become nuclear allies, with Iraqi nuclear specialists taking up residence in Teheran.
Dual containment, as the Clinton people know, is not a solution, simply a policy that might restrict two dictatorships to home ground. But it is a lot better than balancing one tyranny against another -- the old recipe for strengthening both.

HEADLINE: Albany, Not City Hall, Holds Purse Strings for Transit Upgrade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Find Money for the M.T.A." (editorial, June 12) faults the New York City administration for not bearing its share of the cost of improvements on subways and buses. 
 However, you fail to state the already significant contribution Mayor David N. Dinkins has committed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital and operating budgets. Mayor Dinkins committed $1.2 billion to the M.T.A.'s 1992-96 capital plan and $91 million in operating funds to maintain the New York City transit fare at $1.25 in 1993 and 1994.
While the M.T.A. continues to press for $500 million more in capital contribution from the city, it is important to note that the city has maintained virtually the same level of support for the M.T.A. as provided in the 1987-91 plan ($1.2 billion, as opposed to $1.3 billion). The request to increase the city's capital contribution beyond this amount comes at a time when the city's own capital budget is stretched to the limit, as many fiscal monitors have noted.
When the city reviewed its capital program last year, we found that tighter management of commitment schedules and optimizing the opportunities in the construction market allowed us significantly to increase the efficiency of our capital spending. This allowed the city to minimize the impact of the 26 percent reduction in our capital spending plans since 1991.
Based on this experience, and the fact that approximately 4.5 percent of the M.T.A.'s funds from the previous plan were not committed by the end of the five-year period, it is reasonable to estimate that between $400 million and $450 million could be saved in the current plan.
The Mayor presented a plan to the M.T.A and the New York State Legislature that would have increased the city's capital contribution by $65 million annually. The plan depended on action by the Legislature to reallocate subsidies, which would not necessitate the use of the city's $65 million for operating purposes.
Since the State Legislature failed to do the right thing, the city was forced to contribute funds to the Transit Authority's operating deficit to save the fare in 1993 and 1994.
The problem is not the level of the city's commitment, but rather the lack of equity in the distribution of other subsidies to the M.T.A. -- inequities that have resulted in a growing misallocation of toll revenues from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the continued emphasis in capital planning on strict funding ratios over actual need.
The State Legislature can still redress these larger equity issues and return the M.T.A. to the regional authority it was intended to be.
User-friendly subways and buses are an essential component of economic development in New York City. But there are ways to improve the efficiency of the program without disrupting vital service initiatives, including needed station repairs. This will insure that scarce taxpayer dollars are used in the most effective manner.

HEADLINE: If He Runs, D'Amato Has His Platform

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERICHO, L.I., June 21

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said today that he would decide this fall whether to run for governor next year.
But he told a luncheon meeting here that if he were elected, he would sell the World Trade Center, the New York City airports and the state's Offtrack Betting system. He also said he would support the death penalty and require able-bodied welfare recipients to accept public-service jobs. 
 Mr. D'Amato made his remarks at a luncheon of the Real Estate Practitioners Institute of Long Island University.
Asked when he would decide whether to run for governor, Mr. D'Amato, a Long Island Republican, said, he would first confer with his brother Armand, a lawyer and former assemblyman who was convicted of mail fraud last month in connection with payments he received from a military contractor to lobby the Senator.
"Truthfully," Senator D'Amato said, "I have to talk to my political expert. I have not had the opportunity to talk with Armand D'Amato yet. But it's something we're looking at."
During his speech, he attacked Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and President Clinton for policies that he said were hurting the Long Island economy.
"We hear the kind of proposals that come out of Albany," he said. "And those proposals are not how to cut spending, the proposals are how do you raise more revenue. I'd suggest to you that we got it backward. I'd suggest to you that President Clinton has it backwards. And Governor Cuomo has it backwards."
Senator D'Amato argued that government spending must be cut for Long Island's economy to improve. He outlined his budget plan, which he said would save taxpayers $250 billion and call for freezing Federal spending for two years, eliminating new spending programs, putting the space station and supercollider projects on hold and killing the C-17 cargo plane.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 23, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato misidentified the person with whom he said he would confer about running for governor. It was his mother, Antoinette, not his brother, Armand.

HEADLINE: SENATORS BRACING FOR FIGHT ON PLAN TO INCREASE TAXES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
With some of their careers and perhaps the eventual success of Bill Clinton's Presidency on the line, senators prepared today to begin voting on raising taxes and curbing popular programs.
Senators from both parties agree that the budget package will pass by the end of the week on a party-line vote with almost all the Democrats in favor and all the Republicans opposed. 
 But the near certainty of the outcome has not lessened the anxiety that pervades the Capitol and the White House.
Democrats believe they must prove that when their party controls the White House and Congress, they can begin to solve the nation's problems. But some wonder whether they can survive the politically painful votes they will cast this week to raise taxes.
 
Political Calculation
 Republicans have made the political calculation that it is to their advantage to vote against all new taxes. But they will be forced either to vote for deep cuts in popular benefits programs or to show that they are not serious about wanting to lower the deficit. And by always voting no they open themselves to the charge of fomenting gridlock.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, reflected the anxiety when he was asked this afternoon whether the main motivation behind the various votes this week would be support or opposition to the President. "It's not the President; it's the class of '94," he replied, referring to the election pressure all senators face, but which will be felt soonest by the 20 Democrats and 14 Republicans up for re-election next year.
At the White House, the main concern is that the bill get through the Senate in one form or another. The budget bill passed by the House last month is more to the President's liking, and he hopes that he can get more of what he wants in the House-Senate conference that will try to resolve the differences.
Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, put the White House position this way at a news conference today, "The key right now, the fundamental point is that we've got to pass this through the Senate to get it to a conference."
 
Feel the Arm Twisting
 The President met with some wavering Democratic senators to administer one final half-nelson. "I could feel my arm being twisted," said Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama.
In a speech to the United States Conference of Mayors this morning, Mr. Clinton challenged his Republican opponents. "If you want to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy, where will you make up the money?" he asked. "What will you do to reduce this deficit? Are you willing to make the same kinds of decisions that I have?"
For the time being, Republicans have no answer. Republican senators met this afternoon and announced afterward that on Wednesday they would offer their own budget plan to lower the deficit by more than Mr. Clinton's plan without raising any taxes. They refused to provide any details of how they would accomplish that.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, conceded that the Republican proposal would be defeated, but he said that would prove the point that the Democrats merely favored higher taxes and more spending.
Democratic Senators met over lunch, and sniped at the budget measure from the right and the left. Some like Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut want more tax breaks for business to stimulate the economy. Others like Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Tom Harkin of Iowa worry about the limits the legislation would place on the growth in spending for Medicare.
But most said afterward that they would eventually agree and vote for the package.
"It's going to pass in the end," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, "but it's going to be a high wire act getting there."
 
Disputes on All Sides
 The only statement about the budget today that went completely unchallenged came from Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the chairman of the Budget Committee. Asked after the Democrats' lunch about all the senators who were speaking out against one part of the package or another. Mr. Sasser said, "I think there's a lot of ventilating going on."
Under the budget rules, the measure cannot be filibustered, and a final vote is expected on Thursday night or Friday.
But the legislation, officially called a reconciliation bill, can be amended. And the Republicans, in addition to offering their overall deficit-reduction plan, are expected to offer individual amendments that would require Democrats to cast votes that can be used against them in their next election campaigns.
One such amendment, for example, would remove the section of the bill that raises the amount of Social Security benefits on which middle- and upper-income retirees must pay income taxes. As might be expected, this provision in the bill, which would raise $26 billion over five years, is unpopular among retirees.
Another amendment the Republicans will probably offer would remove the 4.3-cents a gallon gasoline-tax increase from the bill.
Over five years, the Democrats' bill would raise taxes by about $250 billion and lower spending by about $100 billion.
If the President and the Democrats have their way, another $100 billion in spending cuts over the next five years would be locked in with a freeze in programs that get annual appropriations. And if all this comes to pass, the Democrats have calculated, more than $50 billion will be saved over the five-year period in lower interest costs on the national debt, for a total deficit reduction of about $500 billion.

HEADLINE: Aristide Likely to Meet Army Head This Week

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 22

 BODY:
Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is expected to meet with his country's military leaders this week in what diplomats say could set the stage for a settlement of the long political crisis.
Diplomats involved in organizing the talks say Haiti's military commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, agreed to the meeting late Monday in response to sharply increased international pressures for a negotiated settlement. 
 Although the site has not yet been determined, the meeting between Father Aristide, who was ousted in 1991, and General Cedras is expected to be held in another Caribbean country by week's end.
Last week the United Nations Security Council ordered a worldwide oil embargo of Haiti, a freeze of assets of top Haitian business executives and officials and a prohibition on arms sales to the country. The sanctions are to take effect on Wednesday.
In a letter to the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo, published late Monday, General Cedras requested that talks on the "survival and life of the nation" be convened urgently, on "neutral ground."
Apparently hoping for a stay of the new sanctions, General Cedras said "the imposition of these measures is not justified at this precise moment against a country where life is more terrible than death."
Although diplomats said the talks were intended to devise a "definitive solution to the crisis," including the transfer of power to a government to be named by Father Aristide, officials involved in mediation efforts said General Cedras's letter would not bring a postponement of United Nations sanctions. Diplomats said that after repeated shows of bad faith by Haiti's military authorities in nearly two years of negotiations, only an agreement on a settlement and the start of its implementation could halt the sanctions.
The announcement of General Cedras's willingness to meet Father Aristide follows the initially defiant reaction of Haitian authorities to the United Nations sanctions.
As they neared passage, the measures appeared substantially weakened by a last-minute motion led by Brazil for the removal of language authorizing the enforcement of the embargo by American and other ships off Haiti acting under United Nations authority.
Diplomats said that in recent days, however, Haitian military leaders had come to understand that the United States would enforce the sanctions unilaterally, if necessary, to insure their effectiveness.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Easing of Vietnam Trade Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is considering allowing American companies to bid on contracts in Vietnam that are financed by loans from international lending agencies like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, officials said today.
If accepted by the President, such an action, combined with an Administration decision not to block a plan that would give Hanoi access to loans from multilateral lending institutions, would be the most far-reaching easing of the 18-year-old United States trade embargo against its former wartime enemy. 
 An official familiar with the Administration's deliberations said the idea of allowing American companies to bid for projects financed by international lending institutions is considered a compromise between simply allowing Vietnam to access to loans and completely lifting the embargo.
Senior Administration officials say President Clinton will probably decide on the issue this week. One official stressed that he may not make any change in policy.
Representatives of business groups seeking trade with Vietnam say that permitting American companies to bid on development projects financed by international lending institutions would only allow a narrow range of American companies access to Vietnam's potential market. For example, American petroleum companies, seeking to exploit Vietnam's offshore oil fields would not be permitted to execute contracts with Hanoi. Nor would trading companies seeking to import rice or textiles from Vietnam.
Mr. Clinton has come under increasing pressure by groups on all sides of the question of whether the United States should ease tensions with Vietnam. All sides agree that the main issue is Hanoi's cooperation in determining the fate of 2,260 American servicemen who are listed as unaccounted for from the Southeast Asia wars.
Some veterans groups such as the American Legion, and their allies in Congress, argue that no improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam should be undertaken.
"We've urged him not to approve the loan by the I.M.F. because of the fact that Vietnam has not cooperated with respect to the P.O.W./M.I.A issue.," said John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion. "They continue to dribble out a document or two relating to missing Americans when it suits their purpose or when they are seriously criticized for not cooperating."
Others, such as Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who headed the Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, say some reciprocal action is needed to insure Hanoi's continued help in the search for unaccounted for Americans.
Maj. Gen. Thomas G. Needham, the Pentagon official in charge of the search for unaccounted for Americans, has told Administration officials and lawmakers that Hanoi's cooperation in the search "is at its highest level."
With Hanoi's help, 104 of the 196 American servicemen who were considered to have had the best chance of survival after being captured or shot down over Vietnam have officially been determined to have died, Department of Defense officials said. Investigators have also checked 66 cases of Americans whom defectors or other individuals have reported seeing alive in the years since the war. According to Mr. Kerry, no evidence has been discovered that the Americans were alive.
Hanoi has also produced new documents that have been demanded by American investigators and allowed interrogation of top military leaders.
Administration officials also say that pressure is building on them from allies such as Japan and France to at least not stand in the way of new lending by the monetary fund.
In April, the two countries asked the United States how it would view a plan to lend Vietnam $140 million to pay off debts incurred when Hanoi conquered the South and as a result assumed loans that had been granted to the old South Vietnamese Government. Once Hanoi becomes current in its loans to the monetary fund, it would be eligible for new World Bank and Asian Development Bank loans.

HEADLINE: Punitive Tariffs Raised Against Foreign Steel

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
In a move angering European and Asian steelmakers, the Clinton Administration announced steep penalties today on steel from 19 countries that the Commerce Department said had been sold at less than fair value.
The ruling would more than double the price of some imported steel -- and, for many foreign companies, significantly increase punitive duties beyond the levels of the preliminary penalties announced in January. 
 American manufacturers hailed the ruling. They have been hurt by a worldwide glut of steelmaking capacity and by foreign makers' efforts to maintain their share of the market by selling steel here for less than what they charge at home. "Today's decision confirms an egregious distortion of the international marketplace by foreign steel producers," said Curtis H. Barnette, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. "We applaud the Commerce Department for enforcing the trade laws."
 
Negative Views Abroad
 Trade officials from other countries assailed the action while American officials denied their assertions that it was protectionist.
According to American industry experts, the average punitive duty under today's ruling will be 36.45 percent, up from 27.04 percent in January. They range from 1.47 percent to 109 percent, with Brazil and Britain facing the highest punitive tariffs.
Argentine producers of cold-rolled steel saw their penalties jump to 51 percent from 20 percent in the preliminary ruling on Jan. 27. For a Belgian company, Cockerill Sambre, the penalty on hot-rolled steel soared to 62 percent from 5 percent.
The penalties could be eliminated if the United States International Trade Commission concludes within 45 days that the American industry has not been hurt by the foreign steel companies' practices.
Besides Britain, Brazil and Argentina, steelmakers were found in violation in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden.
 
Subsidy Penalties
 The Commerce Department also ordered duties, ranging from five-tenths of 1 percent to 73 percent, on steel from 12 countries that, it said, received improper subsidies from their governments.
Nations cited here were Austria, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and Britain.
Foreign officials soon deplored the action taken in Washington. Among the voices from overseas condemning the American decision was that of Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner for External Economic Affairs of the European Community. Sir Leon said that the American industry's woes come not from overseas but from excessive production capacity at home.
"It is unacceptable that steel imports from the European Community and 13 other countries should be used as a whipping boy for problems arising largely from domestic competition within the United States," he said.
Charles H. Blum, an adviser to European steel companies, saw another set of consequences. "These results clearly mean at least a temporary end to shipments to the U.S. for a lot of foreign suppliers, including some big ones," Mr. Blum said.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, trying to deflect charges that the Clinton Administration was being protectionist, said that the decision today was a technical, legal one, rather than a political judgment.
"The Administration," Mr. Brown said, "fully supports the rights of the domestic industry to obtain relief from unfair trade practices under U.S. law, and will make certain that these laws are enforced in fair and effective manner."
Since the preliminary penalties were announced, the Commerce Department has gathered detailed information on foreign-made steel, including selling prices, production costs and subsidy levels.
Some foreign steelmakers got moderately good news today. For the South Koreans, penalties declined, with the punitive duties on plate steel and hot-rolled steel now about 8 percent.
Thomas J. Usher, president of the U.S. Steel Group, said the dumping showed that foreign manufacturers were "exporting unemployment to the United States."
To buttress their arguments, American manufacturers filed papers with the International Trade Commission on Monday, asserting that Japanese and European steelmakers had set up a cartel, restricting steel trade.
They contended that the Europeans and Japanese had signed an agreement assigning specific spheres of influence in the Eastern Hemisphere to European and Japanese producers, with the line of demarcation running through Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma. This agreement, they said, distorted the flow of trade and imposed a handicap on American steelmakers.
Industry officials in European countries and South Korea issued statements in response today, saying that instead of resorting to penalties, the United States should help push for an international steel agreement that address the industry's complex problems, including overcapacity.
Alan Wolff, a lawyer representing the American industry, maintained that it had done more than its competitors to reduce excess capacity.
"The U.S. industry has rationalized," Mr. Wolff said. "We are now the most competitive in man-hours per ton. It's utter nonsense to say we are trying to pass the burden of adjustment onto others."
The case was filed a year ago by nearly a dozen American producers. In addition to USX, the parent company of U.S. Steel, and Bethlehem, those bringing the action were Armco Inc., Geneva Steel, Gulf States Steel, Inland Steel, LTV Steel, Lukens Inc., National Steel, Sharon Steel and WCI Steel.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Senate Passes a Smaller Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
The Senate today approved by voice vote a far smaller version of President Clinton's ill-fated economic stimulus package, with fresh financing for summer jobs and child immunization and an unexpected last-minute Republican addition on welfare.
The supplemental appropriations bill is a diminutive orphan of the original $16 billion stimulus package, which was killed on April 21 after a Republican filibuster. The new $1.9 billion bill is not proposed as an economic stimulus because it includes a few million dollars more in cuts than added expenditures, but it will bring some relief to hard-pressed cities. 
 Reflecting growing support for imposing restrictions on welfare aid, the Senate also approved by voice vote an amendment proposed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, requiring that state and local governments institute workfare programs for able-bodied welfare recipients without dependents or risk losing their Federal share of welfare funds.
Under the amendment, states would be required to enlist 10 percent of qualifying welfare recipients in workfare programs after a year. About 20 states already have such programs.
 
Moynihan Motion Defeated
 The proposal by Mr. D'Amato passed after a motion to kill it, offered by his Democratic colleague from New York, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, was defeated by a vote of 64 to 34. A similar amendment was approved last year but did not survive a Senate-House conference committee, and a similar fate is expected for this year's version.
Mr. D'Amato said the measure would simply put into effect the President's own ideas on welfare changes. But Administration officials have said they are in only the early stages of what is bound to be a broad and complicated effort to translate those ideas into legislation.
The appropriations measure provides $200 million in Justice Department grants to local governments to expand law-enforcement programs, $360 million in financial aid to students, $175 million in loan guarantees for small businesses and $200 million in summer jobs. But most of the money will go to the military, with $750 million for the Somalia operation.
The measure is expected to create 160,000 summer jobs nationwide, 12,500 of which will be filled in New York State, roughly half of which will go to New York City. New Jersey will be allotted 6,500 summer jobs, and Connecticut 1,600 more.
 
Democrats Disappointed
 While support for the measure was bipartisan, Democrats largely expressed disappointment with the bill while Republicans praised it.
"It's better than nothing, but it's not the son of stimulus," said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. He complained that cities would receive funds too late in the summer to plan an adequate summer jobs program.
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, said the Senate's decision to reject more deficit spending and pass a more modest measure showed that "Congress has gotten the message: We have to make cuts first."
The bill must still be reconciled with a House version that includes $120 million more for summer jobs and $290 million for construction of waste-water treatment plants.
 
Gain for Abortion Rights
 Abortion-rights advocates won a modest victory today when the House passed the $22.7 billion Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill without language barring Federal employees' health-care benefits from covering abortion.
The prohibition had been included in the spending bill every year since 1983.
The bill, which passed by a party-line vote of 241 to 171, largely followed President Clinton's spending objectives for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and the President's executive offices.
Abortion opponents chose to fight another day. They plan to make their stand in the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday when they try to reinstate a provision prohibiting Medicaid from covering abortions. An appropriations subcommittee dropped the ban on Government payments for elective abortions for poor women, reversing a policy that has been in effect since 1977.
 
Loss for Ex-Presidents
 An amendment to the spending bill passed today would be unpleasant news for the five living former Presidents.
Pushed mainly by deficit-hawk freshmen in the House, the amendment limits the former Presidents to five more years of Government financing for clerical staff, mail services, office rentals and travel. Mr. Clinton would be limited to five years of such services once he leaves office.
Such clerical and office expenditures now cost the Treasury $2 million a year. That is a small fraction of the amount it costs for the Secret Service to protect former Presidents, a service that will not be touched by the measure.
Representative Karen Shepherd of Utah, a Democratic sponsor of the amendment, said the amendment was symbolically important because "this is simply a case of saying that the Federal budget deficit is forcing us to take a tough new look at all Federal spending." Lifetime financing for these offices, she added, "is something we just cannot afford."

HEADLINE: Finding Strong Allies for Foreign Aid

SERIES: SPECIAL PLEADERS -- A Periodic Look At Lobbying

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Back in May, when political analysts and even the White House budget director were making dire predictions about the fate of President Clinton's Russian aid package, David Nagle, a former Iowa Congressman, figured about 40 people would come to a meeting to put together a lobbying strategy for the program.
About 90 showed up. 
 There were Jewish groups and Ukrainian groups, labor groups and manufacturers, farmers, arms-control advocates and environmentalists, as well as businessmen and foreign trade organizations.
Mr. Nagle, a Democrat and a nervous, chain-smoking lawyer who likes to joke that he works out of a "shack" off Main Street in downtown Waterloo, knew that foreign aid bills could win support, having once put together a similar group to help President George Bush move his aid proposals for Russia through Congress. But the turnout exceeded even his wildest expectations.
"We were astounded," said Mr. Nagle, adding that the attendance at his meeting suggested what subsequent events were later to prove: Contrary to the conventional wisdom that foreign aid has no natural constituency, the Administration's Russian aid package would not have a bit of trouble in the House.
 
Victory by Wide Margin
 Indeed, last week, when the votes were taken, the bills providing $13 billion in foreign aid, including $2.5 billion in assistance to the republics of the former Soviet Union were approved by a surprisingly wide margin. The bill authorizing the Administration to spend money on foreign aid passed by a voice vote, while the appropriations bill was approved 309 to 111.
One major reason for that vote is that while American people generally view foreign aid as a giveaway, such bills are in the political, and, more important, economic self-interests of a large assortment of interest groups.
Among the 58 groups that lobbied members of the House for the foreign aid bill were farmers who would benefit from increased agricultural credit for grain sales to Russia. Manufacturers saw a potential market for their products overseas; Jewish organizations were concerned that political instability in Russia would foster anti-Semitism there, and peace groups worried that a return of a bellicose Russia would lead to a new arms race. Ethnic groups like Ukrainian-Americans were worried that chaos in the former Soviet Union would worsen ethnic tensions.
"At one meeting we had pork producers sitting next to the Jewish groups, which I thought was kind of ironic," Mr. Nagle said. "At another meeting we had the Armenian-Americans sitting next to Azerbaijanis" even though their cousins in the former Soviet Union are warring with one another over territory.
 
Using Pledge of Support
 Under what were called Nagle's rules, members of the coalition were free to pursue their own narrow interest in the foreign aid bill. But each had to pledge to support the final version. The idea was that once support was mustered for foreign aid in general, and aid to Russia in particular, it could last for years. So if a group did not win what it wanted this year, it could return to the issue next time around.
The group also decided to steal a page from the Pentagon's past lobbying efforts and used the argument that aid to Russia would produce jobs for Americans.
"Historically, the former Soviet Union was the third-largest importer of pork in the world," said Alan Tank, vice president for public policy and trade for the American Pork Producers Council. "Knowing that our competition, most notably the European Community, are very aggressively pursuing that market, raises the interest in our minds of trying to provide impetus for Russia to deal with the United States over the long run, rather than dealing with someone else."
But backers of the foreign aid bills did not rely solely on the economic advantages of helping Russia. The committees that wrote the bills produced lean pieces of legislation that actually reduced foreign aid both from the Administration's request and from last year's levels. The House leadership was able to persuade their counterparts on the Republican side, including the minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, and the minority whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, to support the measure.
Business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers were attracted by a transfer of $300 million from the Agency for International Development to a pilot program run by the Trade Development Agency that would guarantee loans for overseas capital projects. Jewish groups were kept on board by insuring that aid to Israel was not cut.
 
Different Groups, Same Result
 Because of the defeat in the Senate of the Administration's $16.3 billion package to stimulate the economy and President Clinton's withdrawal of Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus had threatened retribution by defeating the foreign aid bill. But a $100 million increase in aid to Africa helped mollify the caucus.
In the end, members of the black caucus voted 31 to 6 to defeat an amendment in the authorization bill that would have drastically slashed Russian aid and voted 20 to 17 against a similar, less drastic amendment in the appropriations bill.
"This was the most smooth-running expeditious treatment of this issue that I've seen," said Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who was in charge of lining up votes on the Democratic side before the vote on the floor. "Certainly this year, with all the fights on a partisan basis, this was a stellar exception."
But in the end, supporters said the day was won by the economic argument, coupled with a coalition of interest groups that would hold representatives accountable for a rejection of foreign aid. That was especially the case, they said, among the freshmen, many of whom ran on platforms arguing that the nation needs to pay more attention to domestic needs, and not be responsible for curing the world's ills.
"We really leaned on the freshmen," said one Congressional aide involved in the lobbying effort. "We made it clear that if they thought this was going to be an easy no vote, they were mistaken. They had to understand that this is the reason you come to Washington, bud. If you just want to vote to fix potholes, you could have stayed home. Now you can vote no to foreign aid, but with all these groups, we can assure you that there will be somebody in your district who will remember and will call you on this."
In the final vote on the appropriations bill, freshman from both parties voted 89 to 23 in favor of foreign aid.

After dominating Detroit politics and government for two decades, Coleman A. Young, the first black Mayor of the nation's eighth-largest city, said today that he no longer had the vitality to campaign for office or run a big city and would not seek re-election this fall.
Mr. Young, who is 75 and suffers from emphysema, had kept everyone guessing about his intentions until a news conference this afternoon. For weeks he had told reporters and confidants that he had not decided whether to run for a sixth four-year term. 
 On Monday night he made his decision, he said at the news conference, which began a few minutes after the 4 P.M. filing deadline for the mayoral primary on Sept. 14.
"I have had many people tell me that they would help me campaign, should I decide to run," he said. "But I don't campaign like that. I campaign all out."
 
'It Would Be a Disservice'
 During his last year in office, he said, "I have not been able to put out the effort."
"Should I win another term," he went on, "I do not think I could put as much into the job as I believe it deserves or demands. It would be a disservice to my own standards to be able to deliver anything less than 100 percent."
Mr. Young becomes the latest recent political retiree among a group of blacks whose election and longevity as big-city mayors brought a new era of black urban enfranchisement beginning in the 1960's. Tom Bradley, who decided last year against a re-election campaign, will leave office on July 1 after 20 years as Mayor of Los Angeles, and Maynard Jackson announced only two weeks ago that he would not seek election to a fourth term as Mayor of Atlanta.
Here in Detroit, Mr. Young's decision provides an opportunity for fresh leadership and political initiatives in a city that suffers from a high rate of crime, extensive blight and vast unemployment. More than a dozen candidates have filed for the primary, a nonpartisan election whose two top vote-getters will meet in a runoff on Nov. 2 if no one wins a majority.
 
Conyers Files to Run
 Among the candidates is United States Representative John Conyers Jr., a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus who was routed by Mr. Young in the mayoral primary four years ago and who filed at the last minute today to run again.
At least four of the candidates are Young supporters or former proteges: Dennis Archer, a former Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court; Sharon McPhail, a former prosecutor; Arthur Blackwell, chairman of the Wayne County Commission, and Paul Hubbard, onetime head of an urban coalition.
But the Mayor did not immediately anoint a political heir today, saying that "I have to review the situation after the smoke clears."
 
A Battling Chief Executive
 Mr. Young, a onetime union organizer and State Senator who first won election as Mayor in 1973, became a feisty, frequently contentious chief executive who was also a symbol of black enfranchisement and opportunity. With the onset of the Young administration, the Police Department, which during that first campaign he had called "an army of occupation," began to diversify, offering an increasing number of jobs to blacks and women.
Extolling his record today, Mr. Young told reporters that in the year before his election Detroit "issued fewer than $20,000 worth of contracts to minority-owned businesses" and that since 1988 "we have averaged more than $125 million a year" to minority-owned concerns.
He also pointed to development efforts along the city's riverfront, to an expanded convention center and to industrial policies that had resulted in construction of two automobile assembly plants within the city's limits.
But it was also during his administration that this city of 1.2 million people, 70 percent of whom are black, declined by many standard measures of economy, education, public safety and public health. Drug abuse is rampant here, and much of the housing is substandard. Abandoned buildings dot the city.
Mr. Young often blamed racism and outsiders for Detroit's problems. He pointed to whites' flight to the suburbs, a Federal Government unwilling to channel enough money to projects that would improve the city and an auto industry whose declining job base had depressed the income of Detroiters. His relationship with the City Council was rocky, marked by repeated fighting over budget deficits.
Further, his administration was not without taint of corruption among his appointees. Just 13 months ago, for instance, a jury convicted William Hart, whom Mr. Young had appointed Police Chief, of embezzling $2.6 million.
And the Police Department that the Mayor had tried to make reflective of the city's people suffered a further blow last year when three police officers were charged in the fatal beating of a black motorist. The officers are now on trial.
For much of his administration, Mr. Young was a target of criticism by news organizations here, lampooned in editorial cartoons and faulted in investigative articles. He, in turn, was often reclusive. During infrequent meetings with reporters, he lashed back at critical questions with attacks of his own, often laced with profanity.
The acrimony has not been without the press's appreciation for his impact on the city's political life. Last weekend Thomas J. Bray, editorial-page editor of The Detroit News and a critic of the Mayor, wrote that he hoped Mr. Young would run again, for in that case "the winner would not be mayor by default, but mayor in his or her own right."
"The new mayor would have bested not just another candidate," Mr. Bray said, "but a foe with a formidable political reputation and record."

HEADLINE: Japan Scorns Fund for Russia

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 22

 BODY:
Japan's Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto, said today that a Clinton Administration proposal to create a $4 billion fund to help turn Russia's state-owned enterprises into private companies was "preposterous," and added that an agreement had been reached to scale the fund back to about $500 million.
The proposal was made in April during a meeting here of the finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies. The meeting produced an agreement to provide $28 billion in aid to support Russia's transition to a capitalist economy, but the $4 billion fund was not part of that total. 
 Clinton Administration officials said they wanted the fund to finance the purchase of state-owned enterprises by private interests. But the other countries failed to support the proposal.
Today, Mr. Muto called the fund "a preposterous suggestion" and said it was too early to finance privatization, arguing that Russia still did not have the basic ingredients of a capitalist system, such as entrepreneurs, office workers and other employees trained in the basics of a market economy and willing to work hard.
Mr. Muto made his remarks at the monthly meeting of a study group on international affairs, which was attended by businessmen and journalists. The comments were quoted by the Kyodo News Service and the general content was confirmed by Foreign Ministry officials.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen acknowledged today that it "would be very difficult to achieve" the goal of $4 billion for the privatization fund. But Administration officials disputed Mr. Muto's assertion that the Group of Seven had agreed to scale back the fund to $500 million, saying that exact funding levels have not yet been set.
Mr. Muto said today that Japan would divert money already promised for Russia to the privatization fund, not provide new money.

HEADLINE: Budget in California Shuffles Taxes to Close a Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 22

 BODY:
California appears to have avoided a state budget crisis this year. But the price will be steep, in health care, parks, libraries, welfare and still higher college fees -- and the possible outright defiance of county governments at what they consider the illegal expropriation of their property taxes by the strapped state government.
Under enormous public pressure to avoid the kind of stalemate that forced the state to pay its bills with i.o.u.'s for more than two months last summer, the State Senate early this morning narrowly passed a Rube Goldberg-type of budget meant to get the recession-racked state government through another year. 
 The State Assembly had fallen into line a day earlier, dragged kicking and screaming by Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., a Democrat, and Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, who both said there was no other choice for the state. California faces a $9 billion gap between spending and expected revenue in the $52.1 billion budget that starts July 1.
In essence, the budget robs Peter to pay Paul, but then allows Peter to rob somebody else.
 
$2.6 Billion Tax Transfer
 The plan would balance the state budget, as required by law, in part by transferring $2.6 billion in property taxes raised by counties, cities and other local governments to pay the state's obligation to support public schools. But to offset the loss to the local governments, the plan then extends a "temporary" half-cent increase in the state sales tax. The increase, which was to expire next week, will remain for half a year until the taxpayers vote in November on making it permanent.
If they do -- a big if -- that would replace about $1.4 billion a year of the lost local taxes, but it is all earmarked for law enforcement and fire protection. In addition, the plan would relieve local governments of about $500 million a year in spending mandated by state laws for health, welfare and transportation, among other programs.
 
'It's a Shell Game'
 The property tax transfer is the biggest part of the Governor's plan to make up the $9 billion shortage. The rest of the gap will be filled by methods ranging from raising fees at community colleges by 50 percent to cutting grants to the aged, blind and disabled by 3 percent.
"It's a shell game," said an angry Ed Edelman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County, which will suffer half the losses faced by the state's 58 counties. "It is an assault on local governments' home rule." Lifting the state-imposed mandates on counties to feed and house the indigent, he said, was illusory.
Mr. Edelman said he expected Los Angeles County, the state's largest county, to lead the fight against the property-tax transfer. In an interview after returning from lobbying the Legislature, he said: "We are going to refuse to send our property taxes to the state. Let them solve the state budget but not on our backs."
But all over California, local leaders were preparing for the worst. In Northern California, Alameda County, which includes Oakland, expects to lay off 1,200 workers next week. The property tax transfer would sap $96 million from the county's $1 billion budget.
Governor Wilson, facing a tough re-election fight next year, is expected to sign the budget after the Legislature passes 19 separate bills that carry out the various taxing and spending changes. While the details of the bills will be hard fought, legislators and their aides said there was little doubt that they would pass by July 1, given the unusual alliance between Governor Wilson and the two legislative Democratic leaders, Speaker Brown and Senator David A. Roberti, president pro tem of the Senate.
Last year, a standoff between Mr. Brown and Mr. Wilson led to a 63-day crisis in which the state had no budget and ran out of cash, leaving many businesses unpaid for goods they had supplied. Politicians at the Capitol were saying today that Mr. Brown was willing to back most of Mr. Wilson's budget, hoping the voters would blame the Governor for the pain.
 
Trying to Avoid Gridlock
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Brown, Darolyn Davis, said he simply wanted to avoid the "gridlock" of last year. "The Speaker realizes we are in the worst shape California has been for years," she said. "This is the best we are going to come up with."
Recession-scarred Los Angeles County alone stood to lose $273 million in property taxes, which would force a 16 percent budget cut across all departments except for law enforcement. The county would face the loss of another $150 million if voters turn down the sales-tax extension. Overall, the cut from the current year would be 11 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Harry L. Hufford, the county's chief administrative officer, said the budget would mean closing one or more of the county hospitals and health centers, curtailing residential care and outpatient programs for the mentally ill, closing 10 libraries and reducing hours by half at other libraries and ending the purchase of new books, magazines and newspapers. In addition, he said, lifeguard service at eight state beaches would be terminated and three-fourths of all swimming pools at 23 parks would be closed.
But according to District Attorney Gil Garcetti, police and sheriff departments and prosecutors came out "safe" in the budget, assuming voters approve the sales tax in November. "No doubt law-enforcement appears to have come out O.K.," he said, speaking of statewide enforcement.
In Alameda County, Supervisor Don Perata described an atmosphere of "community depression."
"All our pleading, all of our cajoling, all of our protests got us nowhere," he said. "We didn't expect miracles, but the legislators absolved themselves of public responsibility."
 
Court Challenge Is Seen
 Governor Wilson had originally proposed to have each county vote on whether to extend the sales tax locally, but the final budget plan calls for a uniform statewide vote this November in which a majority vote will be sufficient. This is likely to be challenged in court by anti-tax groups.
As for the property-tax transfer, Governor Wilson has argued that the state was only reclaiming money it had given to bail out local governments after their ability to raise taxes was limited by the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978.
There were few people defending the budget agreement vigorously, least of all Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of San Jose, the lone Assembly Democrat to vote against it. As the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he had proposed using the sales taxes to pay off state debts rather than financing local services.
The budget does little to solve underlying fiscal problems of the largest state, problems brought on by a combination of the recession and years of limits on taxing and spending voted by Californians.

Canada Rate at 20-Year Low

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 22

 BODY:
Canada's official interest rate fell today to a 20-year low, paving the way for prime lending rates to dip below those of the United States for the first time since 1984.
The Bank of Canada rate, which sets the trend for short-term interest rates, dropped to 4.88 percent from 4.94 percent at its weekly setting. 
 Andrew Pyle, chief economist for MMS International, said that Canada's leading banks could follow sometime this week with a cut in prime lending rates from 6 percent to their lowest levels since the mid-1960's.
United States prime rates are currently at 6 percent as well.
But unlike the United States, where interest rates have bottomed, Canada's sluggish recovery and negligible inflation give interest rates further room to ease, economists said. The recession hit Canada twice as hard as the United States, they added.
Inflation is practically nonexistent in Canada. The country's consumer price index fell by two-tenths of 1 percent in May after rising by the same rate in April.
Mr. Pyle said the Bank of Canada rate could fall another 25 to 50 basis points, or a quarter to half a percentage point, during the summer.
The central bank's anti-inflation policy, worldwide deflationary pressures and the recession have caused the Bank of Canada rate and prime rates to fall sharply from the spring of 1990.
The Bank of Canada has exceeded its tough inflation targets of 3 percent at the end of 1992 and 2.5 percent by mid-1994.

HEADLINE: Beyond 'Jurassic Park': Few Jobs in Old Bones

 BODY:
Michael Kass forges through intensive courses in geology, mathematics and chemistry. He spends summer vacations searching for ancient bones in hot, dusty quarries. Words like "Mesozoic" and "velociraptor" roll easily off his tongue.
But Mr. Kass, a graduate student in paleontology at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, worries that he will not find a job once he leaves school. After all, few paleontologists have the luxury of hunting dinosaur fossils for a living, like the adventure-seeking duo in the movie "Jurassic Park." Other opportunities, including museum work, teaching and research, are almost as scarce. 
 "You can be very interested, motivated and qualified and still have a hard time finding work," said Mr. Kass, who hopes to teach at a university.
Thanks in part to the dinosaur mania that has swept the nation in recent years, more college students than ever are studying prehistoric life. Last fall, almost 600 students took an introductory dinosaur class at the University of California in Berkeley. And at the University of Michigan, 300 students take a survey course on dinosaurs each semester.
 
Who Will Pay?
 But intimidating course requirements and bleak employment prospects limit the number of students who actually major in paleontology, said Daniel C. Fisher, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
"There is great intellectual interest in the history of life," said Dr. Fisher, who advises 12 graduate students in paleontology. "But who is going to pay for people to study it?"
Only 30 undergraduates listed paleontology as their major in a nationwide survey of geology department heads conducted last year by the American Geological Institute in Alexandria, Va. There were 182 candidates for graduate degrees in paleontology.
But in the wake of "Jurassic Park," paleontology departments across the country are bracing for an influx of new students, said Robert S. Cox, an adjunct lecturer at the University of Michigan who has taught a survey course titled "Dinosaurs" since 1985.
"I haven't seen the enrollment figures yet, but I'm sure they'll be through the roof," Mr. Cox said.
"A lot of these kids have loved dinosaurs since they were little," he said. "Virtually everyone I've known in this field grew up exploring the natural world."
Mr. Kass, who loved dinosaurs as a child, forgot about them for years and studied business administration in college. But one day, he bought a toy dinosaur in a gift shop. "After that, I was totally hooked again," he said.
In a telephone interview from the paleontology laboratory at Brigham Young, where the bones of a giant Ultrasaurus tower overhead, Mr. Kass was eager to discuss Mososaur, the dinosaur he is studying for his master's thesis.
"I tend to like carnivorous animals, and Mososaur was the swimming version of Tyrannosaurus rex," he said. "Take the lions on the African plain and picture something 10 times bigger, faster and meaner."
 
More Need for Protection
 Although some paleontologists grumble about the flood of publicity "Jurassic Park" has brought their field, students hope it will expand their career opportunities. Several paleontologists helped design the mechanized dinosaurs for "Jurassic Park," and theme parks and traveling exhibits featuring life-size dinosaur models are in the works.
If the movie promotes a national interest in dinosaur hunting, there will also be an increased need to protect fossils, said Peter Robinson, a professor of natural sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The Federal Bureau of Land Management hired several paleontologists this year to help analyze and preserve fossils in Western states.
"There are an awful lot of amateur fossil collectors out there, and someone needs to regulate them," Dr. Robinson said.
Even so, many paleontology students make sure they have backup plans. David Varricchio, a graduate student at Montana State University in Bozeman, will receive a Ph.D. in biology next year and teach anatomy. "I figure I can get a job teaching premedical students and do dinosaur research on the side," he said.
Since the Western states have some of the best fossil reserves in the world, many paleontology students apply to graduate schools there. In the summer, they work "in the field," extracting delicate bones from quarries. Field projects, some say, are the best part of their studies.
"Dozens of students want to go on the digs, but we can only take a limited number," said Wade E. Miller, a professor of geology and paleontology at Brigham Young. "With so few opportunities, we need to be very selective and weed out talent."
Mr. Varricchio said he is looking forward to July and August, which he will spend unearthing fossils in northwestern Montana. "Compiling the data back in the lab can be frustrating," he said. "But digging up bones is never boring."

HEADLINE: Health-Care Chiefs' Pay Rises at Issue

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
The pay of the chief executives of 26 top health-care corporations is rising rapidly and is unrelated to the size or success of their companies, according to testimony scheduled to be delivered before a Congressional subcommittee Wednesday.
Graef Crystal, an expert on executive compensation at the University of California at Berkeley, will say in his prepared testimony, which was released today to certain news organizations, that compensation for health- care executives ranged widely in 1992 at the 26 companies he studied. 
 According to Mr. Crystal, these salaries ranged from $696,000 for the chief of Beverly Enterprises, David R. Banks, to $8.8 million for the chief of Merck, Dr. Roy P. Vagelos. If the value of cashed-in stock options is included, the highest pay was $127 million to the chief executive of the Hospital Corporation of America, Thomas F. Frist Jr.
The median pay for the chief executives of the 26 companies Mr. Crystal studied was $2.9 million. In 1985, the median pay of the chief executives of the 26 companies was 97 times higher than that of a janitor. By 1992, the pay was 192 times higher, Mr. Crystal asserts. In 1985, the ratio of chief executive pay to a nurse was 54 to 1, and in 1992 it had risen to 85 to 1.
 
Similar to Other Industries
 Mr. Crystal said the scale of pay at American health-care companies was similar to that of executives at companies in other American industries, but far higher than companies in nations such as France, Germany, Japan and Britain. He said that the ratio of executive pay to that of other workers in those countries was in the range of 20 to 1 to perhaps 33 to 1.
Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a trade association of some 1,400 investor-owned hospitals, said today in a telephone interview that he could not dispute Mr. Crystal's economic analysis. But, he said, "there are two values here that are important: the value to the stockholders, and to the customers."
He said that health-care stockholders have done well by their investments, adding that executive compensation goes unnoticed by consumers because, spread over all the products and prices, the compensation costs consumers "pennies."
"I just don't know where the problem is here. No one is getting ripped off in this," he said. "The rhetoric Mr. Crystal is using is old populist rhetoric. The compensation sounds exorbitant to anyone. But Americans are getting good value."
Mr. Crystal is expected to testify Wednesday before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is looking into Federal health-care costs.
In a telephone interview today, he disagreed with Mr. Bromberg. He said that the difference between other companies and health-care companies was that the main customers of the health companies were the taxpayers in the form of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. "It is the taxpayers who are getting ripped off," he said.
To compare compensation with performance, Mr. Crystal measured a chief executive's direct salary, bonuses and the present value of stock options against stock appreciation plus dividends of a company.
He said that while some companies reported they linked bonuses and stock options to company performance, there were too many loopholes in compensation packages for those links to be effective.
Also at Wednesday's hearing, the General Accounting Office will offer testimony about the Hospital Corporation of America. The corporation, which includes some 500 hospitals worldwide, was audited by the G.A.O. in an attempt to discover how much of its cost would be disallowed or found questionable under Federal rules of health-care cost reimbursement.
Most of the $2.6 million in administrative expenses reviewed by the accounting office in its audit of the company's fiscal year that ended September 1991 had not been charged to Medicare programs, but rather was distributed widely among costs to be paid by private insurance.
Only about $10,000 of that found to be unallowable by the G.A.O. was actually charged to the Government, corporation officials said.
 
Amount Is Unallowable
 However, in looking at questionable expenses in general, whether they were charged to patients or Medicare, the G.A.O. found about $1.1 million of the $2.6 million reviewed to be unallowable or questionable. This included everything from $51,000 for trips, tickets to performances and other entertainment to $26,000 to counteract negative publicity from an investigation by Texas authorities into the practices of some psychiatric hospitals.

Little Movement in Treasury Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Interest rates were little changed yesterday as securities dealers concentrated on digesting a large supply of new Treasury issues while awaiting more economic data to provide clues to future rate moves.
At the regular monthly auction of new two-year notes, the Treasury sold $16 billion of 4 1/8 percent notes with an average yield of 4.14 percent. The average rate was little changed from 4.17 percent a month earlier and closer to the bottom than the top of its range for the last six months. Since late 1992 the two-year issue has ranged from a high of 4.72 percent on Dec. 22 to a low of 3.88 percent on April 27. 
 In advance of today's auction of $11 billion of new five-year Treasury notes, dealers traded the issue at about 5.18 percent, down from 5.19 percent. The bellwether of the long- term bond market, the 7 1/8 percent Treasury issue due in 2023, was offered late in the day at 10416/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 6.77 percent, unchanged from Monday.
After repaying maturing securities, the Treasury would raise a total of $5.4 billion of new cash through the sale of new two-year and five-year issues. Although the Treasury's plan to sharply reduce sales of long-term bonds requires larger offerings of shorter maturities, the size of the two-year and five-year issues have not prevented those issues from rising in price and declining in yield so far this week.
In the short-term market, Treasury bill rates were unchanged from Monday's auctions at 3.10 percent and 3.19 percent for three-month and six-month issues, respectively. In advance of tomorrow's $15.25 billion auction of new one-year bills, the issue was traded by dealers at 3.38 percent.
The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, a closely watched barometer of the Federal Reserve policy, traded between 215/16 percent and 3 percent during the day. That rate was little changed from recent days, an indication that the Fed was not in the midst of any adjustments to monetary policy.
 
Tax-Exempt Bonds
 Demand remains brisk for tax-exempt issues as securities dealers tap a large reservoir of individuals who are buying directly or through mutual funds. Investor appetite is large, both because higher income tax rates proposed by President Clinton make tax-exempt bonds more attractive, and because the heavy volume of refunding by local governments has put billions of cash in the hands of investors who are now looking for new investments.
John F. Lahive, the head of municipal bond trading for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company in Baltimore, noted that prices of new and recent issues have benefited by a noticeable decline in the supply of new issues expected over the next month. The expected supply for the next 30 days, compiled by the Bond Buyer, was about $6 billion yesterday, down from $8 billion two weeks ago, and a peak for the year of $9.9 billion on March 24.
Because offerings of new issues usually become scarcer in late June and early July, Mr. Lahive said there was a good chance that prices of tax-exempt bonds would stay strong, and possibly improve in relation to the Treasury market in coming weeks. Investors who receive large sums from the early retirement of bonds should buy new issues now, he said, rather than wait until mid-July when they will receive their checks.
 
Short- Term Issues Offered
 Among short-term issues, the New York City Water Finance Authority's $375 million of notes due in April 1994, were offered at 2.40 percent through underwriters led by W. R. Lazard Laidlaw, Mead. A $1.5 billion issue of Los Angeles County one-year notes was offered at 2.55 percent through Lehman Brothers.
Among long-term issues, demand was good enough that underwriters raised prices slightly to reduce the interest rates by five-hundredths of a percentage point to as much as 20-hundredths for various offerings. Even at lower yields, underwriters said large new offerings of revenue bonds for Seattle Light and Power and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were sold out.
After prices were increased and rates cut, a $452 million issue of Seattle Light and Power revenue bonds was offered through Lehman Brothers with yields ranging from 2.55 percent for bonds due in 1994 to 4.35 percent in 1998, 5 percent in 2003 and a maximum yield of 5.70 percent for 2018. The Port Authority bonds were offered through Prudential Securities with yields ranging from 2.40 percent in 1994 to 4.10 percent in 1998, 4.80 percent in 2003 and 5.30 percent in 2011 and 2012.
Though the Port Authority bonds were rated A-1 Moody's Investors Service, or slightly lower than the Aa rating for the Seattle bonds, the Port Authority issue was offered with lower yields because it was a smaller issue and it appealed to New York investors seeking bonds exempt from state, city and Federal income taxes.
Following are results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: A Nudging Up of Rates Is Considered by the Fed

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After rising unexpectedly in the beginning of the year, inflation seemed to have abated in May, but the Federal Reserve remains haunted by its specter.
Another inflationary spike this year strikes most economists as unlikely in an economy that remains subdued. But the Fed's policy makers say they are toying with the notion of nudging up interest rates anyway to make doubly sure that inflation does not return. 
 "The logic is impeccable that inflation should not be a problem," said David W. Mullins Jr., the Federal Reserve's vice chairman. "But it has risen in recent months anyway, when it should not have. If inflation were to become re-established in the minds of the markets, with no timely response from the Fed, that could be damaging to the economy."
For the Fed, a "timely response" means an increase in rates before the end of the summer -- a possibility that Mr. Mullins and other Fed policy makers are for the first time discussing openly, in effect calling the strategy a pre-emptive strike against resurgent inflation. At least one high Administration official, declining to be named, said the Administration was prepared to accept a mild rate increase.
"At this point, a one-quarter of a percentage point rise in interest rates would have more of a psychological impact than an economic one," the Treasury Department official said.
The surge in inflation early this year led many economists to speculate that the Fed would respond by raising interest rates. At a policy meeting in May, Fed officials reportedly passed a resolution that in effect expressed a greater willingness to raise rates than to lower them, but the minutes from the meeting will not be made public until next month. Only now are Fed officials beginning to speak openly of raising rates soon -- as if preparing the American public for the change after nearly four years of pushing rates down.
Part of what makes the focus of the Fed on raising rates significant is its belief, shared by the Treasury Department, that the economy is growing at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annual rate, or strongly enough to withstand a mild blow, such as a small interest rate increase. "There is good, solid economic growth," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said, noting that job creation has risen in recent months.
Federal Reserve policy makers talk of pushing up interest rates on short-term loans as a way of getting people, particularly bond traders and businessmen, to stop expecting inflation at a time when labor is plentiful and inexpensive, and the nation is oversupplied with goods, conditions that make it difficult to raise prices. When people stop counting on inflation, the Federal Reserve argues, then interest rates fall on their own, which helps the economy, mainly by making mortgages less expensive and reducing the cost of the bonds that companies sell to modernize or expand their operations.
That sort of talk elicits various reactions. One is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are right: a small rate increase -- less than half a percentage point -- while sending the central bank's anti-inflation message, "won't make any difference at all in the slow upward drift of the economy," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a research organization supported by corporations.
Then there is the view that a window of opportunity has opened, one that will close by early fall, and this window is the Fed's last chance for a while to deal with what it considers the inflationary potential. Once the budget bill now before Congress takes effect, bringing the nation higher taxes and less Government spending, the impact of these actions is likely to weaken the economy, at least temporarily. The Fed might even be forced to resume lowering rates again.
"You in the media are getting this spiel about higher rates because it is one of the Fed's potential strategies," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economic consultant. "They are looking for an opportunity to raise rates, but they have to have the right economic support, and if they don't get it, at least they have made their point in the press." He suggested that another jump in inflation or strong employment growth would help give the Fed the opportunity to raise rates.
The justification for a rate increase originally developed when inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, jumped to an annual rate of more than 4 percent from January through April.
The Fed's policy-making committee -- composed of Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, the six other Fed governors, and five of the 12 presidents of Federal Reserve regional banks -- voted in May in favor of a resolution that in the Fed's formulaic language predisposed the policy makers to raising interest rates.
But then the Consumer Price Index rose only slightly in May, the Government announced last week, and with that announcement, the inflation scare seemed to have passed.
Fed officials, however, are troubled that they still cannot adequately explain the inflation surge. Mostly they blame inflationary expectations, which they say are still embedded in public thinking as a holdover from the double-digit inflation of the late 1970's and early 1980's.
"If the reason for this inflationary spurt were judged to be a function of this psychology, then you would want to send a signal that you are not going to let it get out of hand," said John P. LaWare, a Fed governor. "But who knows at this stage of the game."
Administration officials express similar puzzlement. "The Treasury, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Fed, everyone is trying to find out what is going on with these price numbers," said Alicia Munnell, the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy.
But Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Mullins, if not Mr. LaWare, appear to be convinced that inflationary expectations play an important role. Anticipating a stronger economy and rising inflation, Mr. Mullins said, many executives may have tried earlier this year for price increases they had not been able to get in 1992.
The strong yen may also have played a role in the inflation surge, Mr. Mullins said, forcing Japanese auto makers to raise car prices, for example, and allowing the Big Three to follow suit -- again in the expectation that higher inflation might allow the price increases to stick.
Then there is the Labor Department's seasonal-adjustment formula for determining the Consumer Price Index. It may artificially overstate price increases in the early months of the year, Mr. Mullins said. Many Government officials agree, noting that inflation also surged early last year and then petered out, leaving the 1992 inflation rate at a mild 2.9 percent. "The seasonal adjustment factor may have added almost half a percentage point to inflation earlier this year," Mr. Mullins said.
Finally, some companies may be pushing for price increases in anticipation of Clinton Administration programs, Mr. Mullins said. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, may be acting before a health bill limits price increases for prescription drugs.
 
'Capital Markets Will React'
 "Whatever the reasons, if inflation should persist, unchallenged by the Federal Reserve, then the capital markets will react and they determine the level of long-term interest rates on which the economy depends for stimulus," Mr. Mullins said.
The links between interest rates, inflation and economic growth are convoluted. The Fed, for example, has the power to raise or lower short-term interest rates. A quarter-point rise in short-term rates would mean that the tens of thousands of Americans who buy 30-day Treasury bills might earn 3.25 percent interest instead of 3 percent. That would put a bit more income in their pockets, which is good for the economy.
But the rates that banks pay to borrow money for short periods would also rise to 3.25 percent. Banks constantly borrow big chunks of short-term money that they then relend to the public, at higher rates. To maintain this profit margin, the banks may feel compelled to raise their prime rate to 6.25 percent from the present 6 percent. All sorts of other loan rates rise and fall with the prime rate, among them home equity loans and most loans to companies. So a higher prime rate might discourage this vast borrowing, hurting the economy.
But Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Mullins, along with other Fed policy makers, look beyond what they consider this temporary damage to a different goal. Raising short-term rates, they argue, will help convince people that the Fed will be vigilant, and that inflation will be held down over the long run. So the really important people -- the bondholders and others who lend money for 15 to 30 years -- are more willing to accept lower interest rates, satisfied that the income from their bonds won't be destroyed by inflation.
 
Tonic for Economy
 And it is low long-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve argues, that really keep an economy growing. They influence mortgage rates in the all-important housing market, and also the rates companies pay to finance investments in new machinery that make Corporate America more efficient and profitable. The 30-year Treasury bond, a guidepost of long-term rates, is currently at 6.8 percent, down from more than 7 percent in January. Some Fed officials, however, say it should be still lower. The key is to keep downward pressure on long-term rates, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, suggested in a speech last week.
The Federal Reserve's great concern over long-term interest rates is partly shared by Treasury Secretary Bentson. "At the present time, low long-term rates are the main source of stimulus," he said. "But they are not the only operating force; sales and demand play a major role."
To stimulate sales and demand, President Clinton had asked Congress to approve a fiscal stimulus, nearly $20 billion in Government spending intended to spread new wages through the economy, mostly through public works jobs.
"Congress did not give us the stimulus and everyone is now resigned to this fact, so we need to go on from there," a senior Administration official said, adding: "Long-term rates have come down and in this sense, the 'gamble on interest rates,' as this policy is now being called, has so far been won. But I want to emphasize the 'so far.' The low rates are what is to make a contractionary budget next year less contractionary."

HEADLINE: Arthur H. Kunz Is Dead at 59; Guided Long Island Development

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Arthur H. Kunz, a government planner who helped guide Long Island's development as one of the nation's largest suburban areas, died on Saturday at a hospital in Smithtown, L.I., where he lived. He was 59.
His family said he died of a heart attack after making a good recovery from a transplant of a kidney donated by his daughter six weeks ago. 
 Mr. Kunz was Suffolk County's Planning Commissioner and the planning coordinator of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. In his 35-year career, he also served as the chief planner for neighboring Nassau County.
 
Sought a Balance
 As the region's population grew to nearly three million, Mr. Kunz sought to balance the pressures for development with the need for preservation. He analyzed economic, demographic, environmental, transportation and housing trends and helped formulate government responses.
He became an expert on such diverse topics as duck farms, property taxes, birth rates, North Shore estates, multiplex movie theaters, water supply, golf courses, real-estate prices, sewers, hurricane patterns, car ownership and shopping malls.
Serving under Republican and Democratic administrations in both counties, he gained a reputation as a nonpartisan professional. Politicians did not always follow his advice. He made unpopular recommendations, for example, for more apartment zoning and public housing.
Assessing last winter's severe beach erosion, he said, "My guess is a lot more houses are going to fall, and we can't stop that." He opposed proposals to spend public money to save "houses that shouldn't be there."
 
Long Island Native
 Mr. Kunz was born in Floral Park, L.I., and grew up in Hempstead, L.I. At Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's in architecture, with a specialization in planning.
Early in his career he met Lee E. Koppelman, who became his mentor. Mr. Koppelman preceded Mr. Kunz as Suffolk County Planning Commissioner and is now executive director of the regional planning board.
Survivivors include his mother, Lydia Juckes of Boynton Beach, Fla.; his wife of nearly 35 years, the former Sharon White; a son, Scott of Lake Grove, L.I.; a daughter, Tracey Femminella of Coram, L.I., and a sister, Linda Ann Kunz of Manhattan.

Dollar Soars Against Mark But Advance Slows vs. Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a 20-month high against the German mark yesterday and rose against other leading currencies.
But the dollar posted only slight gains against the Japanese yen, indicating that the American currency's recent rally against the yen may be faltering, some traders said. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6958 marks, up from 1.6875, its highest close since October 1991. The dollar also rose to 110.90 yen, up from 110.65 on Monday.
 
Gold Off in New York
 Meanwhile, gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold for August delivery closed at $369.70 an ounce, down $1.40. The Republic National Bank quoted a late spot bid of $368.30 an ounce, off $1.30.
Traders continued to buy dollars on political unrest in Japan and economic uncertainty in Germany, which have sent the dollar soaring more than 5 percent against the yen and nearly 4 percent against the mark in the last week.
"The dollar is rallying more by default, more by what is going on in Germany and Japan, than what is happening in the U.S.," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the consulting firm IDEA. "But there is more room for the story to play out."
After flirting with the key resistance level of 1.7000 marks in New York trading yesterday, the dollar retreated a bit after negative comments from an official of Germany's central bank.
Hans Tietmeyer, vice president of the Bundesbank, said that the bank would "do everything to preserve" the mark's long-term stability and that German officials must show better fiscal restraint to bring inflation below its current 4 percent annual rate.
Jay Wertheimer, a senior trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, said he had sold marks around the 1.7000 level after he heard Mr. Tietmeyer's comments. "If anything, I was surprised it didn't trigger more of a wave of buying," he said.
Many traders expect the Bundesbank to lower its discount rate, an important short-term interest rate, by 0.25 percentage point at one of its policy-making meetings next month.
The speculation has driven the dollar sharply higher because lower rates in Germany would hurt the value of mark-denominated investments.

 BODY:
Incumbents in the top leadership positions of the National Organization for Women are routinely challenged in elections, and this year, when 3,000 delegates to the annual convention are expected to cast ballots in Boston on July 3, will be no exception.
Contending that the administration of PATRICIA IRELAND has lost touch with the grass roots, a team headed by EFIA NWANGAZA, a lawyer from Greenville, S.C., is seeking office. 
 The other challengers on her Everywoman NOW slate are PATRICIA LASSITER, an abortion-clinic director from Gainesville, Fla.; LINDA OSTEN, a restaurant manager from Norwich, Conn., and KATHLEEN WILSON, a member of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission.
Lauding her group as diverse -- Ms. Nwangaza, Ms. Lassiter, Ms. Wilson are black; Ms. Lassiter and Ms. Osten are lesbian -- Ms. Nwangaza said that NOW "must attract a broader cross section of women."
"Our slate grew out of the administration's insensitivity to its membership," she continued, "and its inability to deal in a substantive way with racism, homophobia, class bias, economic injustice, religious intolerance and environmental destruction."
Ms. Ireland, who became president when Molly Yard stepped down in 1991, said, "There is not one of us who doesn't want to end oppression of race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, but where are their concrete proposals?" She added, "More than one-third of our national board are women of color," and she noted that one of her running mates, ROSEMARY DEMPSEY, is a lesbian. Ms. Ireland herself has both a husband and a female companion.

Harazin Victim of a Brave New World

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
As a man whose baseball upbringing was on the business side, Al Harazin knows the significance of the bottom line. Simply but economically painfully put, if the Mets had been the contender and perhaps division champion Harazin and many others thought they would be last season and this, as many as 3 million fans who haven't gone and won't go to Shea Stadium would have bought tickets.
That converts to $36 million lost, which could have paid for nearly all of the Mets' $39 million payroll this season. That is why Harazin is the latest victim in the increasingly volatile world of general managers. 
 Dallas Green, the Mets' manager, who previously served as general manager of the Chicago Cubs, called the job "the worst" in baseball. "The g.m.," he said yesterday, "now gets fired as quickly as the manager does, and with the complexity of baseball you'll see more and more of it."
Harazin is not a victim in the sense that he was fired, because he was not. He quit because his pride would not allow him to accept half the job he has had the past 21 months. But he was a victim nonetheless.
"In the nature of baseball today," Nelson Doubleday, one of the Mets' co-owners, said at Shea yesterday, "it is so big and so complicated one man can't handle everything."
If Doubleday and his partner, Fred Wilpon, can be faulted for anything, it is for not following through on their original plan in the post-Frank Cashen era. They planned three years ago to have Harazin run the business and administrative end and Joe McIlvaine the baseball part, but McIlvaine defected to the San Diego Padres in October 1990, before the plan could be implemented.
If Wilpon and Doubleday believed in two-headed leadership, they should not have abandoned their view just because the heir apparent flew west. A diligent search in 1991, before Harazin replaced Cashen in September of that year, could have uncovered a capable successor to McIlvaine.
General managers, after all, move more often these days than they ever have. (The title itself is used less often; clubs have created a variety of titles to describe what a general manager traditionally has done.) Three have left their jobs in the past two weeks: McIlvaine resigned in San Diego June 9, Ted Simmons walked away from the Pittsburgh Pirates' position last Saturday and now Harazin is gone.
Harazin and Simmons were part of the large class of 1991-92. Ten clubs named general managers between the last month of the 1991 season and the start of spring training in 1992 -- seven in September '91 alone. McIlvaine was one of five general managers named a year earlier.
When McIlvaine says yes to the Mets' offer to return -- he gave strong indication yesterday that he will -- 17 of the 28 clubs will have named general managers within the last three years.
Money is at the root of the general managers' plight. With player payrolls and other expenses so huge today, they face as much pressure as their managers to win, or at least to contend, so fans will flock to the ball park and television ratings will rise. Owners are impatient when their money is at stake and they are unforgiving when they feel it is being squandered.
Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati Reds' rookie general manager, was criticized last month for firing Tony Perez after only 44 games as manager, but he knows that he himself will be subject to dismissal once the club owner, Marge Schott, returns from suspension if the players earning a total of $43 million don't make a serious run at the division championship. Like George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, Schott has left a trail of general managers with heads lopped off.
 
'Had to Be Done Now'
 If the Mets had contended last season and this, Wilpon and Doubleday most likely would not have decided now to take away Harazin's player personnel hat and ask him to focus on the business side alone. "Things were at a point where we felt it had to be done now," Wilpon said at the Mets' news conference yesterday.
McIlvaine could have remained as the Padres' general manager, but he felt he couldn't continue under the Padre owners' decision to decimate their club so they can severely reduce their player payroll.
The owners might not have liked McIlvaine's outspoken reaction to their plan while he was still their general manager, but he felt betrayed by their changed fiscal approach from when they hired him.
 
The Ultimate Imperative
 Discussing the influence of money on both player decisions and the fate of general managers, McIlvaine said yesterday by telephone from San Diego: "That's where your owners come into it, what they're willing to do, how long they're willing to take. In my mind, Doubleday and Wilpon are as good as any owners, if not the best owners, in baseball today from that standpoint. Their primary interest is winning. That's music to my ears. In a g.m.'s position, that's what your interest is."
Simmons gave up the Pirates' job because he had suffered a heart attack. His heavy smoking obviously could have contributed to his heart problems. But working under the pressure of letting Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and Doug Drabek, among others, leave and still being expected to compete also could have been a contributing factor.
Yes, like smoking, being a general manager can be dangerous to your health.

Men and Women and Sex and Power

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Fans of talk shows and news programs will have noticed that sexual harassment has replaced date rape as television's offense of the season. Both subjects enjoy that good old man-woman appeal, but, as tonight's edition of CBS's "48 Hours" demonstrates, charges of harassment have more reach and variety.
"When does a word, a look or a touch become a slur, a leer or a grope?" asks Dan Rather at the start of the program, titled "Indecent Proposals." On the show is a Hollywood talent agent who was charged by 11 women (10 aspiring actresses and one undercover police officer) with giving talent tryouts a special meaning; female police officers in Newport Beach, Calif., who sued after what they asserted were years of being manhandled by superiors, and Minnesota women who say they were emotionally scarred by having to endure dirty cracks from boys in their school hallways. 
 The emphasis here is on men using their power to obtain sexual favors. The talent agent, whose fate at the hands of a jury you can learn tonight, says self-flatteringly, "I thought all these women were coming on to me." He and his wife blame his troubles on the actresses' quest for publicity. But the descriptions of his encounters with the pretty plaintiffs suggest strongly that this fellow was asking for it. The Screen Actors Guild evidently ignored its members' complaints, perhaps in deference to the grand old tradition of the casting couch.
In the Newport Beach case, the police chief -- who was only accused of looking the other way -- denies the charge. After the National Organization for Women took over the campaign, the chief and a captain were dismissed by the city. But when they fought back, with some community support, they were reinstated. The impression left is that despite an investigation of sorts, city officials were unable to figure out whether anyone had done much of anything to anyone else, and were simply hoping to quiet matters by bowing to the heaviest pressure of the moment.
In the Minnesota school these days, some girls seem to feel put upon while some boys seem to feel beleaguered. Perplexed administrators have naturally called in a consultant. One woman, seen lecturing, travels the nation talking to fourth, fifth and sixth graders about sexual harassment and exhorting everybody to step in if they see something disrespectful or hurtful. With unemployment still high, the issue of sexual harassment, however defined, at least deserves credit for creating a new, undemanding career opportunity.

HEADLINE: A Budget Too Much Like Perot's

 BODY:
Ross Perot told voters he would reduce the deficit. So did Bill Clinton. But Mr. Clinton added a more profound promise: to tilt Federal spending toward investments in education, training, technology and research. In his February budget message President Clinton lived up to his promises, proposing to cut the deficit by $500 billion over five years, yet add $200 billion in programs to raise public and private investment.
Now Congress is about to dispose of Mr. Clinton's investment plans. Unless the Administration lobbies effectively, Congress will pass a budget that focuses on deficit reduction and virtually ignores economic growth. 
 The President's five-year budget plan included several tax subsidies for corporate investment and about $150 billion in public investment in, for example, technological research and training for displaced workers. But soon after the President presented his plan in February, the political mood turned nasty toward anything that sounded like Government spending. Congress rejected the President's stimulus package, which included some investment initiatives, and his proposed $30 billion tax credit for corporations, which increased their investment spending above past levels.
But these blows were light compared with Congress's decision to knock more than $50 billion over five years out of the President's proposed non-defense discretionary spending. And Congress refused to consider raising caps set for discretionary spending in 1994 and 1995. Those caps are tight -- requiring non-defense spending to fall, after accounting for inflation, by a few billion.
So unless Congress cuts defense spending more than Mr. Clinton proposes, which isn't likely, it will have to cut non-defense spending by a whopping 10 percent for 1995. Say goodbye to most of Mr. Clinton's initiatives. And hello to Ross Perot's crimped vision, which puts deficit reduction above all else.
Appropriations committees are already busy with their budget shears; tentative agreements would cut Mr. Clinton's request for Head Start, the program of early education for children, and the Job Corps, which trains disadvantaged workers, by about one-third. Expect the fraction one-third to keep popping up; that might be what Mr. Clinton is able to preserve of his $150 billion, five-year investment program.
The Administration didn't help its cause by including in its investment plan programs of suspicious worth. The Senate rightly excised a set of corporate tax breaks that would have done little to increase productive investment. The Administration's plan to subsidize investors in small companies and real estate would be wasteful giveaways.
What's needed is for the Administration to set priorities and fight hard for what's most dear. That probably means training programs for displaced workers, the national service initiative, early childhood education and preventive health care, scientific research, technological development and, later, welfare and health-care reform. These are programs that can throw off huge social benefits and are, therefore, a proper function of the Federal Government.
Congress seems intent on giving Mr. Clinton a third of his loaf. That's too close to Mr. Perot's myopia, and two-thirds away from what Mr. Clinton wisely promised.

HEADLINE: Where Is The Old Bob Dole?

BYLINE: By Alice M. Rivlin; Alice M. Rivlin is deputy budget director.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I have such a longstanding respect for Senator Bob Dole that I fantasize that the old Bob Dole -- the responsible statesman -- will weigh back into the budget debate.
He was one of the first Republicans to recognize that the towering Reagan deficits endangered the health of the economy. Ignoring the political risk, he stood up to his own President, who offered supply-side nostrums, blithely talking about "growing out of the deficits" and minimizing their size by basing projections on rosy scenarios. 
 The old Bob Dole cut through the malarkey. He knew the Government was living beyond its means, borrowing the nation's savings, punishing farmers, home buyers and investors with high real interest rates. He knew there were no easy answers, that deficit reduction required tough political compromises involving spending cuts and tax increases.
The old Bob Dole, as Finance Committee chairman, then majority leader and finally minority leader, took on two Presidents of his own party, in 1982, 1985 and 1990, to try to tame the deficit. He got precious little White House support but kept fighting for saner fiscal policy.
Now, finally, we have a President who is leading the fight for fiscal responsibility. Bill Clinton did not have to be urged or cajoled. His first priority was an economic plan to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over five years. His plan included unpopular tough spending cuts: Well over 100 domestic programs would be cut by $100 million, including reductions in Medicare and agricultural subsidies and deep cuts in Government administrative costs and personnel. It called for tax increases on those most able to pay and a broad tax on energy. It showed the reductions in Federal interest costs that would result from the lower deficits.
The plan was balanced and fair: roughly half the deficit reduction would result from spending cuts, half from tax increases that would fall overwhelmingly on the most well-off Americans. And the numbers were real: The estimates rest not on a rosy scenario but on the Congressional Budget Office's conservative assumptions, also used by the Congress.
Congress passed a resolution reflecting the main features of the plan. In working with it, we agreed to cut the deficit even more than our original proposal would have by putting a "hard freeze" -- no adjustment even for inflation -- on discretionary spending programs. A reconciliation bill passed the House with only slight modifications in the Administration's basic design. The Senate Finance Committee reached the same deficit reduction target, with differences in some tax and spending cut components; passage of its bill this week would move action to a conference. Next, appropriation action consistent with the budget resolution would lock in spending cuts, so that half of all deficit reduction would come from those cuts. Indeed, under the Clinton plan, all discretionary spending would be frozen for five years. No other President has been so courageous. The old Bob Dole would have lead the cheering.
Instead of pitching in to help solve the deficit problem, Mr. Dole is sabotaging the effort with misleading rhetoric. He says the Democrats' plans are mostly tax increases because some of their spending cuts do not count. He claims the appropriation cuts should not count because the budget resolution caps might not hold. (Why not? Those in the 1990 agreement held, and Congress is more serious about deficit reduction now than it was then. So is the electorate.) He says cuts in interest costs should not count. (Why not? It's real money and he was happy to count it in the 1990 agreement.) He says cutting Federal subsidies by charging higher user fees is really raising taxes, although longstanding budgetary practice and common sense say otherwise. He talks vaguely about controlling entitlement spending, but offers no specific proposals.
The old Bob Dole would have had little patience with such nitpicking. He knew deficit reduction is tough, requiring not only tax increases and spending cuts but user fees and interest cost cuts. He would have recognized the Administration's plan, in the House or Senate versions, as a balanced package of politically difficult changes, pleasing no one but designed to get the job done. I still respect him, but I sure miss the old Bob Dole.

What Will Mets Rebuild With?

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
AT last, the Mets' co-owners have used the dreaded word that is baseball's synonym for surrender. The word is rebuild.
"We're here," Fred Wilpon was saying yesterday as Nelson Doubleday stood next to him, "to rebuild a championship team." 
 It's a start. In their best sincere suits, the co-owners were behind a microphone in the Diamond Club at Shea Stadium, announcing Al Harazin's resignation as chief operating officer, executive vice president and general manager, while acknowledging that Joe McIlvaine is their choice to take over the reconstruction of this fallen franchise.
"If Joe came back to us and wanted to run the team," Wilpon said, "we would be very pleased."
McIlvaine helped assemble the Mets who won the 1986 World Series; he also helped to disassemble the Mets in the seasons that followed. Even so, he's the best general manager available to assemble a new Mets team with Dallas Green, thankfully, preferring to remain as manager. Green's commanding personality is more important in the dugout than behind a desk.
McIlvaine recently resigned as the San Diego Padres' general manager after orders to slice his player payroll. If he returns to the Mets, his problem would not be salaries.
"No one has accused us of cheaping out," Wilpon said, alluding to the club's $39 million player payroll. "We haven't cheaped out in any area. Nor will we in the future."
Doubleday talked of how quickly the Phillies suddenly emerged as a runaway first-place team this season, as if the Mets might do the same. But what will the Mets rebuild with? They need virtually an entirely new roster, position by position.
Of all the Mets players, only Bobby Bonilla is good enough, healthy enough and young enough to be considered a cornerstone for a National League East contender. Dwight Gooden, Bret Saberhagen and John Franco have pitched well when healthy, but their arms keep creating unanswered questions. Sid Fernandez will be a free agent.
Looking to next season, the Mets might need an entirely new infield. Eddie Murray won't be back at first base. Jeff Kent has not been convincing at second base. Tim Bogar is merely holding the fort at shortstop following Tony Fernandez's departure. Howard Johnson, unable to play third base now because of a mysterious virus, will be a free agent.
In center field, Darrin Jackson has yet to justify the Tony Fernandez trade. If left fielder Vince Coleman doesn't pull a hamstring muscle, maybe the Mets will be able to deal him.
More than any other position, the Mets need an all-star catcher who can hit home runs and get the most out of the pitchers. When the Mets were either winning or challenging for the National League East title, Gary Carter was as important as Gooden, Keith Hernandez or Darryl Strawberry. Without him, the Mets' batting order and pitching staff haven't been the same.
But the essence of the Mets' problem is the absence of immediate blue-chip help from their farm system. There's no Gooden there, no Strawberry there. If anything, the Mets' best prospects are still several years away. McIlvaine would need to use free agency and trades to retool the Mets for next season. And there's no guarantee that the Mets' best prospects will ever develop into impact players. Most of their recent prospects have been overrated.
McIlvaine has been fingered as one reason for the Mets' liberation or disposal of Strawberry, Lenny Dykstra, Kevin Mitchell and Wally Backman.
"You want to tell me how many games Mr. Dykstra has played since he left; you want to tell me how many games Mr. Strawberry has played since he left," Doubleday asked, his voice rising in defense of those moves. "We go after talent. We don't go after citizens."
As much as anything else, the Mets will be going after a team good enough to attract the political and financial support for a domed stadium to be built around the turn of the century as part of an entertainment center not far from Shea Stadium. "Constructive entertainment," Wilpon said. "No thrill rides."
The only thrill ride would be a rebuilt Mets team good enough to win a World Series and good enough, eventually, to attract a buyer. Asked if the co-owners were considering selling the franchise now, Wilpon replied, "Absolutely not."
That's understandable. The Mets aren't worth much now. But in the nation's inflated economy, if the Mets were rebuilt into a World Series winner, the franchise will be worth $200 million. Ask the co-owners then if they might sell.

Design vs. the Environment: A Debate Among Architects

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 21

 BODY:
You can walk to McCormick Place, but not without dodging cars. Though it is just minutes away by foot from the Loop, the cavernous convention center is so isolated from the rest of Chicago by the traffic streaming past that most visitors arrive and depart by taxi or bus. Intentionally or not, the building is a perfect example of the problem addressed over the weekend by the more than 6,000 architects who gathered at McCormick Place: the extent to which architecture has contributed to the global environmental crisis.
Automobile traffic is only part of the problem. Roughly half the world's energy consumption goes into the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. Architects don't initiate this gross consumption, but some of them have begun to recognize that design can help curtail it. The choice of building materials, use of renewable resources like natural light and ventilation, and controlled patterns of suburban growth are some of the strategies architects can adopt toward what is called sustainable development: design that provides shelter without environmental or human exploitation. 
 Last weekend's World Congress of Architects, which brought together members of the American Institute of Architects and the International Union of Architects, was organized with the goal of enlarging the number of converts to "green design." "Architecture at the Crossroads: Designing for a Sustainable Future," as the conference was called, also served to commemorate the World's Columbian Exposition, the fabled Chicago world's fair of 1893, an event that gave birth to the City Beautiful Movement and symbolized the emergence of American architecture as an organized profession.
Several exhibitions throughout the city are also celebrating the tradition of design excellence that came out of the fair. The most notable is "Chicago Architecture and Design 1923-1993: Reconfiguration of an American Metropolis," on view at the Art Institute of Chicago through Aug. 29.
Organized by John Zukowsky and brilliantly installed by eight young Chicago architects under the supervision of Stanley Tigerman, the show traces the legacy of the Chicago School up through the bumper crop of post-modern skyscrapers that transformed the skyline in the 1980's. Concurrently, Culture in Action, a program of conceptually oriented public artworks sponsored by Sculpture Chicago, updates the City Beautiful tradition of integrating fine art into the urban fabric.
There was some historical irony in observing the fair's centennial with a conference on ecologically correct design, for the fair helped pave the way for many of the environmental problems addressed by this year's conference. Though the fair gave rise to a great tradition of civic building, it also helped to forge an unholy alliance between the architectural profession and America's emerging industrial civilization.
As Lewis Mumford observed, the classical style of the fair symbolized all too aptly the imperial style of modern industry, which exploited the "life and resources of separate regions" for the benefit of a privileged few. While some of the benefits -- like the magnificent city that Chicago remains today -- were indeed spectacular, architecture's pact with industry has had devastating consequences for the global environment. A local catastrophe, the Chicago Fire, provided impetus for Chicago's emergence as the great city of American architecture. Now, a century later, a global crisis is prodding architects toward a reappraisal of their values.
Leadership has its perils, and the World Congress faced a major obstacle in devoting a four-day conference to the theme of sustainable growth. It became painfully clear that there weren't many architects around who could speak with any authority about this subject. Most of those who spoke at the conference, including such celebrated designers as Helmut Jahn, Michael Graves, Peter Eisenman, Denise Scott Brown and Jean Nouvel, seemed more disposed to talk around or even discount environmental issues than to explore them. As a result, the conference threatened to become an exercise in deceptive green packaging rather than an occasion for fundamental change.
At times, the discussion seemed to revolve in aimless circles around a dubious polarity between esthetics and social responsibility. There was a heated exchange on Sunday morning between Mr. Jahn, the designer of some of the snazzier skyscrapers of the 1980's, and William McDonough, one of the best-known advocates of sustainable design. Mr. Jahn said he was disturbed by the applause that greeted Mr. McDonough's remarks because it suggested that "architects are trying once again to play the saint." Mr. McDonough got another round of applause when he accused Mr. Jahn of designing obsolete "steamships."
Still, on the second morning, when Jaime Lerner began to speak, all the noise suddenly seemed worth it. Mr. Lerner, an architect who until recently was Mayor of Curitiba, a medium-size city in Brazil, held the audience spellbound, partly because he has realized a fantasy architects often harbor: acquiring enough political muscle to carry out their ideals.
"It's important to have success scenarios," Mr. Lerner told the audience, and then proceeded to present one, describing innovations in mass transit, waste management, city planning and urban design that have helped to narrow the gap in quality of life between Curitiba's rich and poor. A man who radiates the dignity of common sense, Mr. Lerner brought the theme of sustainability down to earth.
Mr. Lerner's message was at least as urbanistic as it was environmental. With devastating confidence, he predicted that the 21st century would be a century of cities, because governments have a more direct connection with the environment at the local level. But what about those who lack even local political power? That was the question addressed by Culture in Action, a citywide program of public artworks organized by Mary Jane Jacob of Sculpture Chicago. One of the projects, a "street level" video installation on a street in West Chicago, promises to be one of the most memorable events of this centennial year.
Television is a medium that has helped to corrode communities by displacing the need for public space. "Tele-Vecindario," a project conceived by the video artist Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, is using television to strengthen a sense of community on Chicago's West Side.
Come August, Mr. Manglano-Ovalle and his 15-member collective, the Westtown Vecinos Video Channel, will be holding a video block party. Sixty monitors will be set up along a one-block stretch of Erie Street, in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in west Chicago. Placed in apartment windows, front yards and parked cars, the monitors will be displaying a video portrait of the community, based largely on taped interviews with local residents.
Mr. Manglano-Ovalle calls the project a "video mapping." It explores the overlapping territories of individual memories, the political structure of urban development, and turf struggles between street gangs, some of whose members have assisted Mr. Manglano-Ovalle in the project.
Like Mr. Lerner, Mr. Manglano-Ovalle has embraced a philosophy of "Think globally, act locally." His videos will depict a community that has been hurt by the shipment of jobs abroad, but that is home to people who have moved here in search of a better life. And it employs the electronic technology that links today's global economy. Though Erie Street is visually and geographically far from the City Beautiful monuments of downtown Chicago, Mr. Manglano-Ovalle's project recalls the City Beautiful ideal in using art and urbanism to reinforce each other. It is not a work of architecture, yet it is a project from which architects could learn about the spatial dynamics of the contemporary urban street.
And while street-level video may not qualify as sustainable design, it takes things down to the scale where individual actions are linked to global effects. In his closing remarks, Jaime Lerner told the audience that people often ask him what they can do to protect the planet. "Just do two simple things," he tells them. "Drive less the car. Separate the garbage."

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns Russia on Missile-Fuel Sales

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
The United States is trying to block the shipment of rocket-fuel ingredients from Russia to Libya, officials said today. The shipment is the latest in a string of exports that have caused major worry in the Clinton Administration.
With a deteriorating economy, Russia has been increasingly dependent on military sales to earn hard currency. 
 The Administration says stopping the spread of weapons is a high priority, but Washington also wants to prop up Boris N. Yeltsin and is trying to win Congressional support for $2.5 billion in aid to Russia.
 
A Political Balancing Act
 Thus President Clinton has sent a letter to President Yeltsin, warning that Russian companies face economic sanctions unless they halt such exports, United States officials said.
As an inducement, Mr. Clinton indicated, Russian companies could share the work on the multibillion-dollar space station and launch United States satellites for profit.
Administration officials met today at the State Department with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin of Russia to discuss curbs on missile-technology exports. The State Department did not publicize the meeting, and officials declined to say whether they had made any progress.
Moscow's arms sales have been an increasing worry for Washington. Russia has sold Flanker MIG-27 planes and SA-10 surface-to-air missiles to China and three diesel submarines to Iran.
"Russia and Ukraine increasingly are authorizing export of sensitive, dual-use space-launch, chemical and biological technologies as they attempt to save their weapons facilities and prevent unemployment," William Grundmann, a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Joint Economic Committee last week.
Russia has not joined the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that restricts the technology sales. But Moscow insists it is observing the controls.
Despite these assurances, the Bush Administration imposed santions in 1992 on Glavkosmos, the Russian space organization, after it determined that Moscow's sale of rocket technology to India violated the controls.
Under United States law, trade sanctions must be applied against companies that violate the missile accord. In addition, an amendment to the Freedom Support Act providing aid to Russia calls for development assistance to be cut off if Moscow ignores the controls. Under the law, President Clinton can issue a waiver, but such a move would indicate that helping Russia is a higher priority than controlling arms.
 
The Serbian Connection
 United States officials familiar with the shipment to Libya say the episode began when Pavoks, a Moscow company, exported 80 tons of ammonium perchlorate, which can be used to make solid rocket fuel.
According to United States intelligence, the deal was brokered by Serbian middlemen, who are playing a greater role in military sales to earn hard currency and circumvent the United Nations embargo on Serbia.
"Middlemen like political turmoil and loose controls," an Administration official said. "For them, Serbia is a nice place to try to operate out of."
Administration officials said customs documents were prepared to disguise the destination of the shipment, but Washington learned that the chemical was destined for Libya by way of Ukraine. After a tip from Washington, Ukraine seized the shipment.
According to American and Russian officials, Russia missile technology exports have been discussed in several high-level forums in recent months.
Mr. Shokhin, the Deputy Prime Minister, told a recent news conference in Moscow that President Yeltsin had sought compensation during the Vancover summit for canceling the sale of missile technology to India, a deal that he said was worth $400 million to Glavkosmos. Washington said participation in the construction of the Freedom space station and in launching American commercial satellites could be worth more.
 
Trying for a Compromise
 Earlier this month Robert Einhorn, a Deputy Assistant Secrtary of State, went to Moscow to try to resolve the differences. He reportedly offered a compromise under which at least part of the sale of missile technology to India would be tolerated. But the Russians would have to assure Washington that they would strictly observe the Missile Technology Control Regime.
That effort at a compromise failed, and Mr. Clinton sent his warning letter to Mr. Yeltsin.
Even if Moscow agrees to more strictly observe the controls on arms sales, United States intelligence experts say there will be problems in guaranteeing adherence.
"The concern is that organizations and individuals facing enormous pressure to survive financially will try to evade government controls," said Mr. Grundmann of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

HEADLINE: SENATORS TAKE UP CLINTON'S BUDGET WITH ACID DEBATE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The grand debate over President Clinton's package of tax increases and spending cuts opened at last in the Senate today, and Democrats and Republicans, well aware that the outcome is predetermined, seized the occasion to paint the economic differences between them in the starkest political terms.
The two sides suspended the invective long enough for the Republicans' alternative to the Democratic plan to be rejected. The Republican proposal would have capped spending on Federal benefit programs, frozen most other Federal spending and kept taxes at current levels. Republicans cast it as a tax-free way to reduce the Federal deficit; Democrats called it a sham because it simply decreed a halt to the explosive growth in benefits spending, without specifying how to halt it.
 
A Turncoat in Each Camp
 The vote against the Republican plan was 55 to 43. One Democrat, Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted for it, and one Republican, James Jeffords of Vermont, joined the Democrats to vote against it. 
 Earlier, a handful of Democrats joined the Republicans to reject an attempt by the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, to add to the bill $3.6 billion in tax breaks for small businesses.
No one appeared to question that the Democratic version of the Clinton budget -- a version with $50 billion less in taxes and $50 billion more in cuts than its House companion -- would pass the Senate, probably Thursday night. In large part, today's debate was moot court, played out in a mostly empty chamber for the primary benefit of cable-television cameras.
 
In High Dudgeon Indeed
 Democrats took to the floor to assail Republicans as gutless protectors of the fat-cat rich, hypocrites who preach the gospel of small Government but shrink from any politically risky effort to actually attain it.
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat, on the Republicans' opposition: "What's it all about? It's about protecting the tax breaks -- of those who got those lucrative tax breaks in the 1980's, during the Reagan-Bush years."
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, mocking the Republican argument in a bottomless Southern drawl: " 'There's a difference in philosophy, I've heard. We Republicans don't believe in raising taxes; we believe in cutting spending and paying the bill.' " Then, abandoning his mocking tone and comfortably back in his Democratic skin, Mr. Hollings declared that the Republican approach would "wreck the Government economy."
Republicans lashed back by accusing Mr. Clinton in the most sarcastic terms of selling the voters a bill of goods. They repeatedly turned the President's own words against him, wielding excerpts from his campaign speeches and his political manifesto, "Putting People First," to contrast his early pledges of tax cuts and small government with what they said was the reality of his duplicitous budget.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, mocking Mr. Clinton's words in "Putting People First": " 'A Clinton-Gore Administration will encourage small businesses and enterprises to take risks,' " he read. " 'My plan will not add new taxes on small business.' "
Instead, Mr. Dole argued, "they now face a tax increase not from 31 to 35 percent, but from 31 percent to 45 percent, or maybe even more."
 
D'Amato Is Indignant
 Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York: "Almost one half -- 49.8 percent -- of the tax increases come on small business. Promises made, promises broken."
Senator Phil Gramm, the deeply conservative Texan: "I oppose this bill because you cannot create more investment by taxing investors. You cannot create more savings by taxing savers. You cannot create more jobs by taxing the job creators.
"Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose their jobs because of this bill; Bill Clinton will be one of those Americans," he said, adding slyly, "but he will deserve to lose his job."
The genuinely tough fight will come next week, behind closed doors, when House and Senate lawmakers try to meld the two packages into a bill that can pass both chambers of Congress.
Still, today there was an oratorical food fight in which multibillion-dollar figures were tossed about like tomatoes, and pie charts and bar graphs, purporting to prove both sides' arguments, abounded. But to non-economists, there often was not much clarity. So far apart were the two sides that they could not even agree on how much Mr. Clinton proposes to raise taxes or cut spending.
The Democrats say the measure will slow the growth of the Federal debt by more than $500 billion through 1998 by raising taxes a total of $250 billion and reducing spending another $250 billion. More than three-quarters of the tax increases will fall on people with incomes exceeding $200,000, but all Americans making more than about $20,000 would owe some extra money to the Government because of a new tax on gasoline and some other fuels. (For those making less than about $20,000, the gasoline tax would be offset by a tax credit and increased Federal benefits.)
 
Where Cuts Will Come
 Only about $100 billion of the proposed spending cuts are in this bill, and most of those cuts will come from limiting the explosive rise in Medicare spending. The remaining cuts will largely be made in military spending and in other bills for individual Federal programs to be passed this fall and in the next four years.
The Republicans took issue with all those numbers, saying the bill had more taxes and fewer spending cuts than the Democrats maintained. But mostly they hammered away at the tax increases.
Their alternative, which Mr. Dole labeled "Tax-Free for '93 -- and '94, '95, '96 and '97," was secretly prepared and sprung on the Senate hours after the debate began. It claimed to reduce the Federal deficit to $197 billion in 1998, $5 billion lower than the Senate Democrats' proposal, but without any of the tax increases or increases in Federal fees that Mr. Clinton and the Senate Democrats contemplate.
In place of tax increases, the Republicans proposed to adopt all the spending cuts in Mr. Clinton's budget and to extend existing caps on total spending for discretionary programs for five years, saving $164 billion. Those caps, part of the 1990 budget agreement between Democrats and President George Bush, are to expire in 1995.
Starting in 1996, the plan would further limit spending on Federal benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid to an amount that includes inflation, the growth in program rolls and 1 percent extra for growth.
Republicans said the two-year delay in lifting the caps on benefit programs would allow Congress time to enact a bill to cut health-care spending, but their proposal gave no indication of how that might be done. Their plan also exempted Social Security.
The Senate would have been allowed to override the caps, and further increase spending, whenever it could muster 60 votes.
Mr. Dole wielded a huge "big spending cuts" pencil as a television prop as he pointed to charts showing the Federal deficit plummeting under his plan and rising drastically in 1998 under the Democratic proposal. In truth, the chart would have been accurate only if Congress enacted health-care legislation under the Republican plan and did not do so under Mr. Clinton's.
"There is a Republican alternative," he boasted. "We don't have any taxes. We don't tax small business. We don't tax small-business men, we don't tax small-business women in Idaho or California or Illinois or New York or anywhere else in America."
 
Packwood Weighs In
 Senator Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican who ran the Senate Finance Committee during the last major tax debate in 1986, said that long-term caps on Federal spending were the only way to keep Democratic hands out of the Treasury's till. Otherwise, he said, America would end up like Sweden, taxing not 30 percent but 60 percent of all income to pay for expensive social programs.
"The pressure to take the money we're raising in this bill in taxes, which the President says is to reduce the deficit -- the pressure to take that money, and spend it on education, environment, highways, defense -- will be inexorable," he said. "Maybe Republicans are on the wrong side of this issue. Maybe the public wants this money spent and is willing to pay taxes for it. But we're willing to take that gamble."
Democrats were simply and openly contemptuous. "Over the course of their program, in three years, you've got $108 billion in reductions in Medicare and Medicaid," Mr. Sasser said. "Now, if that's not going to adversely and dramatically affect millions of senior citizens and sick senior citizens of this country, I don't know what will."
The Republican plan, Mr. Mitchell said, was just a plot to preserve the tax breaks of the 1980's for the Republican political constituency.
"Who bears the burden?" he asked. "When my Republican colleagues come here and say there should be no taxes, their intent -- their clear purpose -- is to protect those who earn more than $200,000 a year."
 
Simpson Smells 'Rubbish'
 But Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican -- said the contention that cutting spending and opposing taxes is protecting the rich was "the truest form of posturing."
"What rubbish," he spat. "What absolute rubbish."
Earlier in the afternoon, four Democrats joined the Republicans to defeat an attempt by Mr. Mitchell and another Democrat, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, to add to the Senate package an array of small-business tax breaks that are already in the House bill, and which Mr. Clinton favors.
The clauses would raise from the current $10,000 to $18,000 the amount of equipment that small businesses could write off immediately as business expenses rather than having to depreciate over a number of years. It also would have reduced the capital-gain tax from the current 28 percent to 14 percent for a select number of investments in small businesses, mainly high-technology firms worth less than $50 million.
Mr. Bumpers argued that the breaks were an effort to help the sector of the economy that is responsible for most innovation and most new jobs. But the capital-gains proposal was savaged by another Democrat, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who argued that it was just another special-interest tax break.
Mr. Bradley predicted that it would lead big businesses to spin off profitable units into new firms, partly owned by corporate executives, who would would then sell their interests. In effect, he said, the reduced capital-gains tax would become a benefit for rich officials of big, established companies.
And he railed at the idea of inserting a new tax break in the Senate bill merely because, at the end of its deliberations last week, the Finance Committee discovered that it had some money left over.
Mr. Bradley and three other Democrats -- Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Russell Feingold of Wisconson and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota -- voted with Republicans and against a Democratic effort to rule that the amendment was germane to the budget bill. The amendment needed 60 votes under Senate rules to pass; it received only 54.

HEADLINE: Budget Debate: A Primer;
Cutting Through Claims and Counterclaims As Senate Ponders Ways to Curb the Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Those watching the budget debate in the Senate on television today must have been numbed by the claims and counterclaims.
There were the Democrats, with their four-color charts, arguing that their budget would turn around the nation's economy by slashing Government spending, taxing the rich and lowering the deficit by more than $500 billion over the next five years. 
 There were the Republicans, with their own charts and graphs, calling the Democrats' plan little but a huge tax increase, especially on small businesses, and saying they could reduce the deficit as much just by lowering spending.
In name of cutting through the fog, here are the facts about some of the main matters in dispute.
 
Amount of Deficit Reduction
 The Democrats contend that the legislation before the Senate would lower the deficit by $516 billion over five years. The Republicans say the correct figure is $347 billion.
The legislation, officially called a reconciliation bill, deals only with taxes and spending for benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security that are not subject to annual appropriations. It is projected to raise taxes by $249 billion and cut spending by $98 billion. That is where the $347 billion comes from.
But the Democrats plan to offer an amendment, backed by the White House, that would freeze total spending for all other Government programs -- the military, education, the salaries of Government workers and everything else in the Federal budget. In the language of the budget, this is called discretionary spending, for which money is appropriated each year.
The freeze would save more than $100 billion, and the lower interest payments that would result from smaller deficits would amount to nearly $60 billion. Adding those figures to the $347 billion gives the Democrats their total deficit reduction of $516 billion.
Regardless of how precise the figures offered by the politicians seem, budget specialists say no one can predict accurately what the deficit will be five years from now.
Tax increases often raise less revenue than anticipated. For example, the large increase in revenue predicted from the higher taxes on business in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 never materialized. That was in part because businesses found ways around the new law. But the most important reason was that the economy since 1986 has been worse than expected, and business profits have been much lower.
Spending reductions also depend heavily on the turn of events. Who knows whether the state of the world in a few years will require greater military spending, or whether a slow economy will require more to be spent on social programs like unemployment compensation? This legislation has no contingency fund for emergencies or for unforeseen circumstances.
Still, no one argues that politicians should give up the cause of deficit reduction because the precise amount achieved from various steps cannot be accurately predicted.
 
Taxes vs. Spending Cuts
 The Democrats say their package is evenly divided between the two. Republicans say the Democrats are most interested in raising taxes, and contend that the spending reductions may never come to pass.
In fact, the higher income taxes would go into effect this year, and most of the other taxes would become effective in January. But most of the spending cuts would come much later.
No spending would be lowered in this fiscal year, and only 7 percent of the total spending reductions proposed by the Democrats would take place in the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1. More than three-fifths of the spending cuts, $165 billion out of $267 billion, would be made in the fiscal years 1997 and 1998, after the end of this Presidential term.
Each year, the President and Congress could reverse these cuts, and the temptation would become greater as their effective dates draw nearer. Recent history has shown that when deficit reduction legislation begins to bite, the politicians change the rules rather than bear the pain.
 
Entitlement Caps
 The basis of the Republican plan to lower the deficit without increasing taxes would be to cap spending for entitlement programs beginning in the fiscal year 1996 so they could not rise faster than the growth in the eligible population, inflation and, in 1996 and 1997 only, an additional 1 percent. These are programs like Medicare, Medicaid, pensions, unemployment compensation, farm price supports, food stamps and welfare under which benefits are paid automatically to everyone who is eligible.
The Republicans would exempt Social Security from the caps. But that is a meaningless exception because Social Security is not rising faster than inflation and the growth in the eligible population. The only programs expected to rise faster are Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, and Medicaid, the health program for the poor. The Republicans offered no clue how they hope to limit costs for those programs.
Would they pay doctors and hospitals less? Would they charge retired people higher premiums? Would they stop making medical insurance payments in midyear if the spending ceiling was reached?
And what if the economy turned sour, putting more people out of work? Would the Government break its promise to pay unemployment benefits?
The Republicans never say. And without such specifics, the promise is an empty one. It is like saying that the best way to avert a flood is to hold back the tide. Everyone agrees that if the tide could be stopped, the flood could be avoided. But no one knows how to keep a high tide from occurring.
 
Taxing Small Business
 The Republicans maintain that a large portion of the higher tax rates the Democratic plan would impose on taxpayers with taxable income above $140,000 would fall on small businesses and would inhibit the owners from pouring money back into the business so they could expand and hire new workers.
This proposition is grounded on the fact that many businesses are not themselves taxed. Rather, the proprietors, partners or shareholders pay taxes on the profits at their tax rate, which is lower than the corporate rate.
One problem with the argument is that many of these businesses are actually doctors, lawyers and other professionals -- not the sort of entrepreneurs normally associated with job creation.
Another problem is that these businesses pay taxes only on their profits, after deductions are taken for expenses like paying wages to employees or making new investments to expand.
The Republicans never quite explained why surgeons, or even the owners of hardware stores or canneries, should be taxed less on their income than someone who draws a salary from, say, the United States Treasury.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Adirondacks?

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes is former editor of the Editorial Page of The New York Times.

 BODY:
This is the moment of truth for the Adirondacks. The future of New York's greatest public natural resource is at stake.
In the next few days, the Republican majority of the State Senate will decide whether one man's zealotry to kill the Adirondack Park will prevail. 
For the first time in at least 30 years, the state has no funds to purchase privately owned, environmentally endangered land that is urgently needed for park purposes. To meet this emergency, Gov. Mario Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Sol Weprin, a Democrat, have each proposed setting up an environmental trust fund to enable the state to buy some of the most immediately threatened areas.
Here is where the man who would like to kill the park -- and may yet succeed -- comes in. Senator Ronald B. Stafford of Plattsburgh, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is an implacable enemy of the park, which lies partly in his district. A foe of zoning controls above the local level, he panders to the illusory short-term interests of his constituents. Last year, he tried and failed to kill the park altogether. Now he has hit upon a clever, divisive scheme to strangle it. Under the names of Owen Johnson and other Republican colleagues, he proposes his own version of an environmental trust fund to buy high-priority natural areas throughout the state. What makes the scheme unacceptable is its frankly discriminatory twist.
With only two specifically named exceptions in the park, he would exclude the entire Adirondack area from all future state purchase of privately owned land -- no matter how willing the seller, how low the price and how vitally necessary to protect the park from further degradation.
The park's nearly six million acres cover one-fifth of the total area of the state. Within its boundaries (it is about 60 percent privately owned) lie some of the state's most environmentally sensitive properties. If they are lost in the next few months or years -- as they surely will be under the Stafford proposal -- the unique qualities of the park's great open spaces are certain to be rapidly nibbled away. The park's pathetically weak zoning rules are already unable to curtail accelerating development pressures.
How is it conceivable that a lone legislator could succeed in a scheme that would offer public protection to the rest of the state at the expense only of the Adirondacks?
The answer lies with one Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, the Senate Republican majority leader. Mr. Marino is politically in debt to Mr. Stafford, largely owing his position to him. Mr. Stafford, in turn, sits on a favor-dispensing throne among his fellow Republicans as Senate Finance Committee chairman.
Mr. Marino long ago gave Mr. Stafford the Adirondacks as his political fiefdom. He has rationalized the gift on the transparently false theory that whatever concerns the Adirondacks, the largest park in the U.S. outside Alaska -- it attracts 10 million visitors a year -- is only a local matter. Of course, the park is not merely of statewide interest: It is of national concern.
In addition, the permanent economic health of the park and its 130,000 residents depends not on lawyers' fees, temporary construction jobs along the lakefronts and speculative real estate values but on a thriving tourist, woodworking and timber industry. If the best of the private land holdings are thrown open to speculative development, the jobs that matter will disappear along with the park's still matchless beauty.
Senator Stafford's proposal is no compromise, as it is purported to be; it is a shrewd scheme to entice legislators with the prospect of more funds for the rest of the state by taking the Adirondacks virtually out of the competition.
It deserves to be flatly rejected in favor of a genuine and statewide environmental trust fund in which the needs of each area, including the Adirondacks, would be fairly weighed. The Stafford plan will fail if the Republicans of the Senate face up to their responsibilities -- and not to their political debts to Mr. Stafford.

HEADLINE: House Retains Space Station In a Close Vote

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Putting space research and jobs ahead of cutting the budget deficit, the House today endorsed the troubled space station by a hairline margin, probably insuring at least one more year of construction.
The station is several years behind its original construction schedule and has run several billion dollars over its original budget, set by the Reagan Administration a decade ago. And with the cold war over and the deficit growing as an economic and political issue, the construction of a permanently staffed orbital laboratory has steadily lost Congressional support in the last three years. 
 But a last-minute Administration lobbying blitz, including letters to lawmakers from President Clinton and a visit to the House floor today by Vice President Al Gore, saved the program from probable defeat.
 
Move to Kill Project
 An amendment to the space-agency authorization bill that was intended to kill the program was defeated 216 to 215, with 104 Democrats joining 112 Republicans in support of the project. Voting against the project were 153 Democrats, 61 Republicans and one independent.
The space station, which would have the capacity to hold five astronauts for up to 30 days in space, would help scientists determine the long-term effects of space travel on human beings. It would also provide opportunities for advanced research in biotechnology and metallurgy in the lack of gravity.
Concerned about cost overruns, President Clinton last week endorsed a slightly smaller, less expensive version of the station, which would cost $2.1 billion annually for the next five years.
Although the redesign and orbit plans have not yet been fully developed, the station is to include solar power units and pressurized laboratory modules stretching from a girderlike truss.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has already spent $9 billion on the station, $1 billion more than it originally said a more advanced space station would cost. Opponents predict that the final cost could eventually reach $40 billion or more, with billions more needed for maintenance and operation.
The margin of victory in today's vote was a bit larger than it appeared, since four of the votes opposed to the space station were cast by delegates from the Virgin Islands, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The House cancels votes and votes again when delegates provide the margin of victory.
 
Second Chance for Opponents
 House opponents will have another opportunity to kill the project next week by denying financing for the space station, but very few lawmakers are likely to change their votes.
Last year, an identical amendment also failed, but by a vote of 237 to 181, demonstrating that Congress has become more skeptical about big science and other expensive projects. Much of this year's opposition came from the 114 House freshmen who had never voted on the issue.
The vote also appeared to insure that the superconducting supercollider, another big science project whose political support has been shakier than the station's, will go down to a decisive defeat in an appropriations vote by the full House on Thursday.
After today's vote, Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat who is the leading proponent of the space station in Congress, conceded, "I was surprised it wasn't a little wider margin." But he noted that supporters of the space station would dominate the House-Senate conference committee that will probably make the ultimate decision on financing for the space station this summer.
The Senate, which has historically been more supportive of the project, is expected to provide the space station with stronger backing.
Support and opposition in the House today cut across party and ideological lines. Lawmakers from California, Florida and Texas, representing states that depend on the space and aerospace industries for hundreds of thousands of jobs, provided the core of support. Supporters promised that experiments aboard the space station would lead to far-reaching scientific spinoffs, from cures to cancer to creation of new industrial alloys.
"History has shown that the great nations have been those that had a spark of risk-taking, of adventure, of being willing to operate at the frontiers of knowledge and exploration," said Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas,
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, predicted that 50 years from now people would see the vote today as the most important one cast in the House this year. "Imagine," he added, "if Isabel had said to Columbus, 'We just can't afford it this year.' "
Those opposing the space station were a coalition of big city liberals and rural conservatives who characterized the project as high-flying pork. Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, likened the space station to "pork in a can." Representative Dick Zimmer, Republican of New Jersey, called it a "fiscal black hole."
The bill that passed today authorizes the building of a space station by the year 2000. But the authorization is meaningless if the funds are not appropriated.

HEADLINE: FUND FOR BUSINESS IN RUSSIA TO BE CUT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that a $4 billion international fund it proposed to help Russian state enterprises convert to private businesses would have to be shrunk because Japan and the Western European allies are too squeezed for cash to join.
"We are doing some serious arm-twisting on the Japanese and Europeans to try to salvage as much as possible," a senior Administration official said. "People understand that the idea is not a bad idea, but they keep saying to us: Where are we going to come up with this dough?" 
The $4 billion fund, which was supposed to help Moscow sell unprofitable state industries to the private sector and to fund new entrepreneurs, was proposed by Washington during an April meeting of foreign and finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Tokyo.
The fund was separate from the pledge by the ministers and international lending institutions in April to provide $28 billion in loans and grants to Russia for currency stabilization, economic restructuring and imports. The first $2.5 billion of this pledge is about to be distributed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 
Group to Meet in Two Weeks
 The $4 billion fund for conversion to private enterprise was pushed by the Clinton Administration as something that could be formally established at the Tokyo conference of the Group of Seven set to take place in two weeks. The group includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. But the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said today that "there are some problems" with the fund proposal.
A State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said: "Many Governments are under serious financial constraints. It's going to be difficult to achieve a $4 billion figure."
One reason the $4 billion package is facing problems is that it would require a more immediate infusion of grants, whereas the $28 billion package agreed to in Tokyo consists mostly of loans and credits that the donor countries and agencies would supply by borrowing money.
Administration officials said that while the $4 billion target cannot be met now, they still believe the project is viable. They hope that a version of the plan, calling for roughly half or a quarter of the $4 billion target, can be agreed to at the Tokyo meeting, and that the fund could then grow.
 
Effect of Economic Slowdown
 The fact that the the Group of Seven has not been willing to contribute as much as it originally indicated appears to reflect the general economic slowdown in Europe and Japan. President Boris N. Yeltsin's consolidation of his political position has also removed some of the sense of urgency on the part of Western officials to provide aid to Moscow. Another factor is Japan's conviction that the Russian economy is not ready to spend the aid efficiently.
"We came up with an ambitious proposal, the allies couldn't swallow it and now we are trying a phased approach," a senior Administration official said.
The Administration, however, still intends to proceed with its own plan to provide $1.8 billion in bilateral assistance to Russia. This consists of grain aid, housing projects, and various technical advisory programs. The aid was promised to Mr. Yeltsin at his meeting with President Clinton in Vancouver in April.
As originally outlined, the $4 billion privatization fund was supposed to be made up of $2 billion in contributions from the Group of Seven countries and $2 billion from international lending institutions, with Washington kicking in $500 million of the $2 billion as a "challenge grant" to the other allies. Germany and Japan were supposed to have been major contributors, but on Tuesday the Japanese Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto, scornfully dismissed the fund proposal as "preposterous."
 
Confused by Japan's Stance
 Mr. McCurry said the Administration was "somewhat mystified" by Mr. Muto's statement and was seeking clarification from Tokyo.
"That characterization certainly doesn't square with the conversations we've had with the Japanese Government," Mr. McCurry said, adding that in previous talks with American officials, Japan had supported the concept of the fund.
A senior Administration official said the American goal now is to establish a smaller privatization fund of $500 million from the United States, Japan and the European Community. He said the United States would contribute $125 million, and the allies are being pressed to come up with the rest. In addition, they would try to get the World Bank and other international lending institutions to contribute another $1 billion, but that remained "iffy," the official said.
Nevertheless, the reduction of the proposed fund was something of an embarrassment for the Clinton Administration, which has stressed that its efforts to aid Russia will be distinguished from those of the Bush Administration because all the money it promises will be delivered.
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have sought considerably higher levels of aid to support Russian democracy, and appear to be winning Congressional backing for it, despite a political climate that is anti-foreign aid. But it is unclear whether this Administration will be any more successful than its predecessors in getting Japan and the other allies to deliver on their commitments.

HEADLINE: Pratt & Whitney Unions Approve Concessions Pact

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Putting the final piece of a major economic puzzle for the Northeast in place, union workers at Pratt & Whitney agreed last night to a package of concessions that are aimed at keeping the company from moving a large portion of its operations out of Connecticut. The vote is expected to save more than 2,000 jobs in the state.
The agreement gives Pratt & Whitney what it demanded -- tying wages to productivity and freezing raises until late 1995 -- in exchange for a promise not to use sub-contractors and to keep open its five plants in Connecticut open. After the state Government offered a package of tax cuts and grants worth $32 million, Pratt, a jet-engine manufacturer that is Connecticut's largest private employer, agreed not to move on the condition that the union accept the concessions package.
 
Sacrifice for Security
 Economists and politicians warned before the vote that a departure by Pratt would have been disastrous for Connecticut's fragile economy, endangering Pratt subcontrators and costing millions of dollars in lost taxes. The company's employment in the state has already fallen to 17,200 from 28,800 in 1986. 
 The vote, 4,210 to 3,496, was neither close nor overwhelming. The final count was tallied at 10:30 P.M. With about 82 percent an estimated 9,200 rank and file workers appearing to vote at one of four sites in the state, the decision appeared to reflect a clear desire to make sacrifices in exchange for job security.
Andrew Romegialli, directing labor representative for District 91 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said he thought the agreement represented the only viable alternative. But he added that the vote also reflected dissatisfaction among Pratt workers with their employer.
"It means that the workers have little faith in the company, and that Pratt & Whitney has a long way to go to earn their trust," said Mr. Romegialli.
Mr. Romegialli declined to provide a breakdown of the vote at the separate sites in East Hartford, Middletown, Southington and North Haven, but said it was relatively close at each. The votes were tallied in East Hartford.
Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corporation, offered no response to the vote last night. Al Pollard, a human resources representative at the company's headquarters in Harford, said it would respond later today.
 
Wages Tied to Goals
 Under the agreement, wages could drop by up to $2 an hour if productivity goals are not met. The agreement also calls for a freeze on raises and cost-of-living increases until December 1995, as part of a one-year extension of the current contract.
Mr. Romegialli said that the package meant that there would be no room for subcontractors in the next union contract, which is due to start in 1995.
"We now have a fighting chance to build our productivity over the next two years," he said.
In January, Pratt & Whitney said it would eliminate 6,700 jobs from its Connecticut plants within two years. It also said it would cut 1,500 jobs in Florida.
"Last year, Pratt & Whitney lost approximately $500 million," wrote Karl J. Krapek, the company's president, in a letter to employees. "These losses cannot continue. Our goal is to make ourselves recession proof."
The layoffs and job eliminations -- with similar ones at Boeing and McDonnell Douglass -- are part of an industry-wide shrinking in aircraft manufacturing.
In April, Pratt threatened to close two plants and to eliminate 2,300 more jobs unless it received tax breaks from Connecticut and concessions from its unions.
 
Comparisons to Other States
 In seeking the concessions, company officials argued that building jet engines in Connecticut costs 30 percent more than in states like Georgia and Maine, where Pratt maintains other plants. The plants in Georgia and Maine are non-union shops, which rely on robotics for much of their labor.
Operating in Connecticut cost $6 to $8 an hour more than in other states, the company said, including fringe benefits, taxes and energy costs. The figure was based on how much more the company said it cost to pay a hypothetical middle-level manufacturing worker.
The announcement shocked employees and legislators. It quickly opened a debate on Connecticut's fiscal condition, and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and the state's lawmakers vowed to try to meet the requests.
Pratt has been particularly hurt by the loss of Pentagon contracts, because under military procurement rules called cost-plus, local expenses became essentially irrelevant as the price of a product, whether a jet engine or a transistor, was determined by taking local production costs and adding the profit margin.
 
Huge Outlays
 Property taxes also cost the company $22 million in five communities, while it spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year on research and development, a powerful incentive for legislators in a state hit hard by the recession.
In early June, Pratt & Whitney company announced that it had tentatively agreed not to move 2,300 jobs to plants out of state in return for a package of tax cuts and other incentives. It said its decision would become final when the state legislature approved the tax plan, worth $32 million a year, and when unions agreed to concessions equally that amount.
The legislature approved the tax plan shortly after the announcement. The plan consists mainly of a system of tax credits to to encourage research and development by Pratt & Whitney, as well as other Connecticut companies, in return for their continued presence in the state. Last night's vote appeared to satisfy the company's other condition.
Pratt & Whitney has made aircraft engines since 1925.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Does the American trade deficit reflect U.S. success or failure?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE American trade deficit in April, the largest in four years, is:
(a) Evidence of Japanese perfidy.
(b) Proof the American economy is in decline.
(c) A $10.5 billion misunderstanding. 
 O.K., O.K. The multiple-choice teaser may be a little hoary as a column opener. But don't turn to the crossword puzzle just yet.
The message -- that the trade deficit is as much a reflection of the strengths of the American economy as it is of its weaknesses -- seems to have eluded President Clinton. And what Bill Clinton does not know could prove costly to the nation.
First things first: Merchandise trade is hardly an adequate benchmark for American competitiveness in world markets since it does not include such big-ticket items as trade in services and earnings from foreign investments. But even the broader gauge commonly used by economists, the balance on the "current account," offers small comfort to doom-and-gloomers. In 12 months ended in March, Americans spent $81 billion more abroad than they earned -- and that figure is apparently on the rise.
What is going on? Van Doorn Ooms, the research director of the Committee for Economic Development, points out that the American economy has managed to pull out of recession while Japan and Europe have not. Hence foreign demand for American goods and services is stagnant, even as American demand for imports has picked up.
Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard University, notes, moreover, that America's trade balance is particularly sensitive to ups and downs in foreign economies because a disproportionate share of American exports consists of capital goods -- aircraft, computers, earth-moving equipment and the like. And cycles in investment are generally far more pronounced than cycles in the demand for consumer goods.
This is no small matter: If the other industrial economies were growing at a reasonable pace, Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics estimates that the kick would add some $30 billion to Americans' incomes.
But with Germany determined to fend off inflation and the Japanese Government paralyzed by political crisis, exhortations to stimulate by the Clinton Administration are not likely to make much difference. More to the point, the ballooning trade deficit is a consequence of America's success, not its failure.
That is not the end of the story, however. Experts agree a return to healthy growth rates around the globe would still leave the American economy with a substantial foreign deficit. What they do not agree about is whether this remaining "structural" deficit is worth fussing over.
By Mr. Bergsten's reckoning, $9 billion to $18 billion of the American trade deficit with Japan is the result of Japanese trade barriers -- barriers that reduce American business profits. And even if these lost profits amount to petty cash in a $6 trillion economy, they are no joke to the companies that lose them. The resulting tensions, Mr. Ooms argues, "are putting great stress on the industrial world's open trade regime."
It is not clear, though, whether a more open Japanese market would take the heat off. One rough-and-ready predictor of protectionist sentiment in Congress seems to be the overall size of the trade deficit. And Robert Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, points out that a reduction in the deficit with Japan would not necessarily reduce that overall figure. Indeed, John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, thinks the burden of the argument is on those who think it would.
Mr. Makin notes that the current-account balance is the consequence of thousands of private market transactions between consenting adults: every dollar of deficit created by an American purchase abroad is mirrored by an extra dollar's worth of assets bought voluntarily by a foreigner.
It thus makes just as much sense to argue that the rest of the world has a problem finding places to invest at home, Mr. Makin reasons, as it does to argue that America has a problem living within its means. He concludes that foreign investors -- everyone from insurance companies that pay too much for real estate to conglomerates that hold the working capital in Treasury bills at interest lower than the rate of inflation -- are "making us an offer we can't refuse."
Confused? Mr. Cooper, who was a senior economist in the Carter Administration, adds a clarifying middle ground. The core concern, he believes, ought to be the long-term growth of American living standards, and current account deficits are thus no cause for alarm. Indeed, they are cause for satisfaction as long as they are financing productive investment rather than current consumption.
The real worry, then, is that Federal budget deficits are sucking savings from private investment, forcing America to rely on foreign savings to finance growth. By this reckoning President Clinton, who worries about both budget deficits and trade deficits, has got it half right.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The United States has rejected a request by the United Nations to send military engineers to help dig up evidence of possible war crimes in Croatia because Washington does not want to put American soldiers at risk, State and Defense Department officials said today.
Instead, the Administration will donate $180,000 in medical supplies and equipment, including body bags, surgical instruments, hand tools and cleaning solvents, to Physicians for Human Rights. The group, based in Boston, is aiding an investigation into what is believed to be one of the worst massacres in the Balkan war. 
 Administration officials have not yet informed the United Nations that it will not join in the exhumation of bodies from a mass grave on a farm near Vukovar.
The farm, in a Serbian-held area on the Danube River in eastern Croatia, is suspected of having been an execution site for as many as 200 people.
 
175 Croats Are Missing
 The United Nations is trying to determine whether the grave holds the remains of about 175 Croat men who vanished from a hospital after Serbian forces captured Vukovar in 1991.
State and Defense Department officials said the decision to support Physicians for Human Rights was an attempt to fulfill the Administration's pledge to bring suspected war criminals to justice.
"We were happy to respond to the request for military equipment," said Vernon A. Guidry Jr., the chief Pentagon spokesman. "But it was determined that civilians could do the job as well or better than we could. Also, if we sent troops, it would have raised questions about sending additional troops for security, which would have involved a significant commitment of equipment."
President Clinton has refused to deploy American soldiers as part of United Nations peacekeeping teams in Bosnia because their lives might be put at risk.
Diplomats said the United Nations was likely to ask Norway for the engineering help that the United States has declined to supply.
 
Fear of Serbian Attacks
 Some Pentagon officials said their main concern was that even in a humanitarian role, American troops would be a target for Serbian attacks. The Pentagon estimated that the operation would require 150 to 200 engineers, plus logistical support troops to construct shelters and secure the area.
"It wasn't as simple as putting in engineers," one Pentagon official said. "You would be digging in Serbian-held territory to investigate Serbian war crimes. We would have had to provide an extensive security force in case trouble erupted and our troops were attacked or taken hostage."
Informed of the decision, Eric Stover, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, said, "We're disappointed that there is not a combat engineering unit and we hope that another country will step forward. But the assistance given for the equipment costs is very much appreciated."
Mr. Stover added that his organization had requested combat engineers because the peacekeeping mission in Croatia had said it was unable to secure the area and take the bodies out through checkpoints for laboratory tests elsewhere.
 
A Court Awaits
 Last month, at the request of the United States, the Security Council set up a court to sit in The Hague and try people accused of murder, rape, torture and other atrocities in the former Yugoslavia.
The United States has taken the lead in gathering evidence for the court, and last week submitted its eighth report to the United Nations with details of suspected war crimes.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali made the request for the American combat engineers in March, after Physicians for Human Rights, which conducted the initial inspection of the Vukovar site, informed United Nations investigators that it needed significant help in exhuming the bodies.
The request remained stuck in the Pentagon's bureaucracy, largely because of resistance to committing troops, Administration officials said.
 
Pleas to Aspin
 Last month, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, pressed Defense Secretary Les Aspin in a letter for a quick response. Although she asked for substantial cooperation, she did not specifically ask him to send a military team.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher also pushed the idea -- without specifically asking for troops -- in a recent lunch with Mr. Aspin, telling him, "We should do something to help this project," a senior State Department official said.
But the Pentagon strongly objected to the involvement of any American soldiers. In a letter to Ms. Albright on June 11, Walter B. Slocombe, the principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, stated three objections: the engineers would require a substantial number of additional troops to protect them; the operation could be carried out by civilians; deployment of military personnel would be expensive.
 
Balkan Update
 In GENEVA, the two international mediators for the Balkans expressed concern yesterday over initial Serbian and Croatian plans for dividing BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA into three loosely federated ethnic states.
After talks with leaders of the warring factions, Lord Owen, representing the European Community, said that he and the United Nations representative, Thorvald Stoltenberg, had been "rather disappointed" by plans' vagueness.
The United States has rejected a request by the United Nations to send military engineers to investigate war crimes in CROATIA because Washington does not want to put American soldiers at risk. Instead, the Administration will donate $180,000 in medical supplies.
Washington's first Ambassador to Bosnia, Victor Jackovich, presented his credentials and tried to lift the morale of the country's beleaguered President, Alija Izetbegovic.
FRANCE announced that it would send 800 more soldiers to Bosnia to help defend declared safe zones, including the capital, SARAJEVO.
In BELGRADE, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic warned that the trade embargo could cause economic collapse and social unpheaval.

HEADLINE: How House Panel Is Persuaded to Retreat

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The House subcommittee that helps to support the District of Columbia's government thought it had found a painless way to funnel money to the District: it would force a giant federally sponsored mortgage corporation to pay local income taxes.
Not surprisingly, the corporation, known as Fannie Mae, fought back. The federally chartered concern, which is the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, lobbied vigorously to defeat the proposal, which was withdrawn today. 
 The defeat was a good illustration of the lobbying influence of an organization that sometimes behaves like a branch of the Government and sometimes like a private company.
Fannie Mae, which maintains a team of prominent lobbyists for such occasions, mobilized the real estate industry and the chairman of a friendly House committee in its successful defense against the tax increase.
Among the Fannie Mae executives who worked against the proposal, said Mimi Mager, the District of Columbia's deputy director of Congressional affairs, was Franklin B. Raines, its vice chairman, who was formerly a top economic adviser to Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly. For its part, the financially strapped city government itself never warmed to the idea of taxing Fannie Mae, which is considered a very good corporate citizen with 2,000 jobs.
To Congress, Fannie Mae argued that the tax exemption lowered the cost of mortgages for low- and middle-income home buyers. "This proposal would be nothing less than a housing tax," said James A. Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman.
The fight erupted after the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the District of Columbia had approved the measure unanimously in its draft of the bill providing next year's Federal aid to the city. Today, a chastened subcommittee chairman, Representative Julian C. Dixon, Democrat of California, withdrew the offending provision.
Fannie Mae, formally the Federal National Mortgage Association, is a profit-making, Government-sponsored enterprise whose stock is publicly traded. By law the hybrid concern cannot move its headquarters from Washington.
The company raises money from investors, uses the cash to buy mortgages from banks and savings and loans, and then either holds the mortgages or sells them in packages to investors.
It earned $2.2 billion last year, on which it paid $773 million in Federal tax, but no local tax. The subcommittee estimated that Fannie Mae would owe the District as much as $260 million if it did not have a local tax exemption. The measure would also have removed the local tax exemption of Sallie Mae, the Student Loan Marketing Association.
To persuade Republicans that the amendment was a mistake, Fannie Mae used one of its frequent lobbyists, Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.
The company also enlisted the help of Democrats on the House Banking Committee, whose chairman, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, wrote the Appropriations Committee to say that his panel had jurisdiction over Fannie Mae's charter.
And Mr. Dixon himself was lobbied by a powerful home-state organization, the California Association of Realtors.

HEADLINE: Panel Takes First Steps, Modestly, in Closing Bases

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
In the first of a set of decisions that will cause economic disruption in scores of communities nationwide, a Presidential commission voted today to close one small Army installation and shrink another Army base but spared two big bases in New Jersey and Alabama.
Beginning today through Sunday, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission is deciding to close, shrink or spare 88 major military bases and 150 smaller installations that in most cases are the economic engines in their regions. 
 Today's actions were relatively modest, as the seven-member panel voted to close Vint Hill Farms, a small intelligence post in Virginia, and to shrink Fort Belvoir, Va. It rejected the Pentagon's recommendation to close most of Fort McClellan, Ala., and to reduce Fort Monmouth, N.J.
New Jersey's Senators, Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg, both Democrats, said Fort Monmouth would actually gain about 500 civilian jobs from the closing of Vint Hill Farms.
As expected, the commission decided to keep open Fort Lee and Fort Monroe, both in Virginia; Fort McPherson and Fort Gillem, both in Georgia, and the Marcus Hook Army Reserve Center in Pennsylvania. It had added those installations to the list of Pentagon recommendations mainly for comparison.
The panel also voted to save Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois.
 
A Lengthy Process
 The commission's final recommendations will go to President Clinton, who has until July 15 to approve or reject the package. If he approves, he then forwards the package to Congress for approval or rejection. Given the pressure to cut military spending, approval appears almost certain.
Congress established the commission in 1990 to insulate lawmakers from having to vote individually on the politically sensitive issue of closing bases.
Commissioners face the delicate task of balancing the economic necessity of closing costly bases in light of shrinking military budgets and troop levels and maintaining the proper number and types of installations to insure combat readiness.
In rejecting the Pentagon's recommendation to close Fort McClellan, for example, commissioners criticized the Army's plan to move the fort's school that trains soldiers against chemical weapons but keep its live-agent chemical training center. The panel had rejected a similar Army proposal in the last round of base closings in 1991.
"I'm convinced that the school and the live-agent training center must be kept together," said Hansford T. Johnson, a commissioner who is a former four-star Air Force general.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin recommended in March the closing or shrinking of 43 major installations and 122 smaller ones. The commission later added 47 other major bases and 26 smaller ones for consideration. Commissioners have suggested in interviews that they might substitute some bases for Mr. Aspin's choices, but they are unlikely to close many more than the Pentagon has proposed.
Mr. Aspin and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the commission last week that closing more bases than the Pentagon advised could hurt military readiness and overload fledgling efforts to help communities find new uses for the closed sites.
The Pentagon is eager to reduce its costs, which have remained high as the military makes cuts in other areas. From 1985 to 1997, the Defense Department budget is expected to shrink by 42 percent and the number of troops by 30 percent. If Mr. Aspin's recommendations are accepted, the number of bases will decline only 15 percent.
 
Lobbying for Livelihoods
 Today's deliberations marked the beginning of the end of a process that started three months ago and has required commissioners to crisscross the country to visit bases on the hit list and listen to a parade of angry and sometimes desperate local politicians, civic leaders and ordinary citizens fearful of losing jobs in their communities.
Many of those lawmakers and community leaders packed a Senate hearing room today, consoling each other when their base lost or celebrating when their installation was spared.
Gerald Powell, chairman of a community task force in Anniston, Ala., that had argued to keep Fort McClellan open, could barely contain his glee after the vote. "The Army didn't do its homework," he said.
California, which has several bases under consideration for closing, got a bit of good news today. Commissioners postponed until Thursday a final vote on the Defense Language Institute in Monterey. They generally agreed, however, that it was a bad idea to move the center, which trains military linguists, to Fort Huachuca, Ariz., where university language instructors would be hired to teach military students.
 
Good News for New Jersey
 In addition, the commissioners voted unanimously to keep the Army's last remnant at the Presidio in San Francisco. The base itself has been turned over to the National Park Service, but the Sixth Army will now retain its headquarters buildings there.
The commission rejected a Pentagon plan to move the Army's Communications Electronic Command from Fort Monmouth, near Red Bank, N.J., to Illinois. Instead, it decided to move the unit from leased property off the base to buildings on post that are being vacated by a military intelligence command and the Army Chaplain School, which is moving to Fort Jackson, S.C.
The panel will consider Air Force bases on Thursday and Navy installations on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The strongest opposition to closing bases has come from Charleston, S.C., and the San Francisco Bay area, both of which stand to lose tens of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenues if the Pentagon's proposals win approval.
If Mr. Aspin's recommendations are accepted, the Defense Department will spend $1.7 billion to clean up and close those installations, and then anticipates saving $3.1 billion annually beginning in the year 2000.
In its last round of base closings, in 1991, the commission closed 34 bases and reduced or consolidated 48 other sites, decisions that were expected to save $1.5 billion a year after 1997. In the 1988 round, 16 major bases and 70 smaller ones were closed to save $693 million a year. But only 5 of the 50 large bases on those lists have actually closed: Pease Air Force Base, N.H.; George Air Force Base, Calif.; Eaker Air Force Base, Ark.; England Air Force Base, La., and Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C.
The Pentagon operates 470 installations around the country. It has closed scores of bases overseas in the last five years; closings overseas do not need commission approval.
Mr. Clinton plans to offer $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years to help communities hurt by base closings.

Map/Diagram: "What the Base Commission Decided"
 
Thye base closing commission decided the fate of a number of Army Installations yesterday. Some bases has been recommended for closure or shrinking bythe Pentagon; the commission had added others. Later this week, the commission will be voting on Air Force, Navy and Marine installations.

HEADLINE: Fed Finds Slow Pace For Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The prospect of higher taxes and costly health-care changes is helping to limit economic growth to a "slow to moderate pace" in most sections of the country, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of business conditions said today.
The Fed's anecdotal assessment of business conditions through mid-June came as the Commerce Department published statistics showing that new orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell for the third straight month in May and that the economy grew at an even slower pace in the first three months of the year than had previously been thought. 
 "They're ugly, there's no two ways about it," Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist for the Society National Bank in Cleveland, said of today's results. "The goods side of the economy is doing nothing."
 
Auto Sales Mixed
 Sales reports today from the auto makers provided mixed news. Car sales for mid-June showed no improvement over last year, but sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles were up 13.4 percent, giving overall vehicle sales a 5.5 percent increase. Among the major auto makers, only the General Motors Corporation reported a dip. [Page D4.]
Although business activity as a whole continues to forge ahead, today's characterization as "slow to moderate" was disappointingly similar to the "generally modest improvement" the central bank found in its preceding survey in early May.
President Clinton's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, viewed the latest soundings with equanimity. "The bottom line to all of this is slow growth -- but continued growth," she declared, predicting that the economy would pick up in the second half once the President's package was approved and uncertainties removed.
It is widely expected that the Administration's budget package purporting to cut the deficit by $500 billion over five years will be enacted in midsummer. Congressional leaders expect to begin consideration of a health plan in the fall.
The glum report today by the Fed also portrayed an economic climate in which the central bank would be less likely to raise interest rates any time soon, various analysts said. In recent days, some officials of the Federal Reserve had said that it might be wise to raise rates to reassure the world of its commitment to keep inflation at relatively low levels.
 
Summarizing Is Blunt
 The central bank's survey, compiled this time by its regional unit in Philadelphia, bluntly summarized private-sector reservations about Clinton Administration policy proposals.
"Businesses commented that investment and hiring were being delayed because of uncertainties about Federal tax increases and national health-care reform," the Fed said in its summary. "Retailers also said that such concerns might be preventing a more vigorous increase in consumer spending."
A Fed spokesman, Joseph R. Coyne, said it was not unusual for policy matters to be discussed in the survey and there was no attempt by the Fed to influence the debate on taxes or health care. "This is just what the reserve banks pick up in their discussions with people," Mr. Coyne said.
For several months Federal Reserve officials have said in private that the tax increases in the President's plan and the uncertainties it creates will hurt economic growth. Indeed, Administration officials concede that the uncertainty will hamper growth.
But some Administration officials say in private that some of business'sgrumbling that all the uncertainty is discouraging them from hiring and investing is a not-so-subtle form of politicking against any tax increases.
The report on orders for durable goods -- items from clothes dryers to jet planes designed to last at least three years -- showed a May decline of 1.6 percent. While this slump was not particularly large for a series subject to big swings, most analysts had expected an advance of this magnitude.
They were also discouraged by a second straight, although modest, four-tenths of 1 percent decline in shipments of durable goods and by a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in unfilled orders. Backlog is one of the Commerce Department's official predictive indicators of the economy and this was the 12th decline in 13 months.
 
Orders 'Pretty Slow'
 "Our order books are pretty slow these days," said William Curtis, manufacturing manager for Hill-Loma Inc., a Gorham, Me., custom producer of machine tools for the metals processing industry.
He attributed much of the order decline, which he estimated at 50 percent from levels a year ago, to recession in Europe, where most of the company's output has gone in recent years.
When asked whether domestic customers, who he said were currently active quote-seekers but wary order-placers, were holding back because of policy uncertainties in Washington, Mr. Curtis said, "That could be part of it."
The 1.6 percent orders decline, to $128.3 billion in May, followed a two-tenths of 1 percent April decline that had originally been reported as a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department data showed. The drop in March was 3.4 percent.
The decline, moreover, was widespread. Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.4 percent while electronic machinery was down 2.2 percent and primary metals down 1.9 percent. Industrial machinery posted a 1.7 percent advance, regaining most of April's decline.
Nonmilitary capital goods, a widely watched but volatile category, eased eight-tenths of 1 percent, the report also showed.
 
Revised Growth Rate
 The report on gross domestic product put the growth rate for the January-March period at a scant seven-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a nine-tenths of 1 percent rate a month ago and a 1.8 percent pace when initially estimated in late April.
The biggest downward revisions were for personal consumption spending and for business inventories, $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The main upward revision was $2.1 billion for business investment.
The Fed's survey, which is known as its beige book, showed the Minneapolis district among the strongest areas of the country and San Francisco, where business sentiment has "deteriorated" since the first quarter, probably the weakest.

Treasury Security Prices End Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday as the market reacted to negative economic reports and renewed concern that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates as a pre-emptive measure against inflation.
Increases in Treasury prices were confined to long-term bonds, which benefited from a double dose of bad economic news: the nation's first-quarter growth was more sluggish than originally reported, and orders for "big ticket" factory goods plunged again in May. 
 The slow pace of economic growth, considered a damper on inflation, spurred buying of long-term bonds, which are most vulnerable to erosion in value when inflation heats up.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.76 percent from late Tuesday's 6.77 percent.
Short-term Treasuries, meanwhile, were unchanged to 3/32 point lower. Intermediate maturities were 3/32point lower to 1/16 point higher, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
 
Short-Term Notes Sold
 Traders sold short-term securities yesterday morning after an article in The New York Times said the Federal Reserve was considering nudging up interest rates before the end of the summer to shield the economy from rising inflation.
The Times quoted the Federal Reserve vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., as saying that a failure by the central bank to respond to inflationary pressures "could be damaging to the economy."
Higher interest rates would hurt the value of all existing fixed-income securities. But the report depressed short-term securities the most because the Fed aims at short-term maturities to carry out its monetary policy. The report also dampened demand for new five-year notes sold by the Treasury at its monthly auction.
The Treasury sold $11 billion in notes at a high yield of 5.23 percent. The notes carried a coupon interest rate of 5 1/8 percent, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,954.30.
The bid-to-over ratio, a measure of Treasury auction demand that compares the number of bids offered to those accepted, was 2.70 to 1, up from an average of 2.56 to 1 in the last six five-year auctions. However, the ratio trailed last month's ratio of more than 3.1 to 1.
"The auction dynamics were so muddled by these other events, it left marginal players uninterested," said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.18 percent as the discount advanced 0.03 percentage point, to 3.12 percent. Six-month yields rose to 3.31 percent as the discount advanced 0.04 point, to 3.22 percent. One-year yields rose to 3.51 percent as the discount gained 0.04 point, to 3.39 percent.
Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.14, to 1,299.16.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 3 percent, up from 215/16 percent late Tuesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1025/32 , up 1/8 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity fell to 5.78 percent from 5.79 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Cutback in U.S. Funds to Reduce Summer Jobs for New York Youths

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
With a belated package of Federal financing about to be approved by Congress, government agencies and community groups in New York City are gearing up for a summer jobs program for teen-agers that promises fewer jobs and shorter periods of employment than in recent years.
The Federal program, a cornerstone of the nation's efforts to give poor young people their first exposure to the workaday world, is more critical than usual this year in New York, where unemployment among young people has recently soared. 
 Those responsible for matching teen-agers with jobs say that even when they do get the new Federal funds, their troubles will not be over -- they will have less money for salaries, far fewer jobs than teen-age applicants and fewer hours of work in the jobs that do exist.
 
Contrast to Last Summer
 Across the state, the State Labor Department said there would be at least 30 percent fewer federally financed jobs than there were last summer, when most big cities received an unexpected, last-minute injection of Federal money for jobs. Federal funds enabled New York City to create 52,400 summer jobs last year.
In New Jersey and Connecticut, state officials said yesterday that they should be able to provide as many or more jobs this summer than last.
"The kids are waiting, and a lot of them are going to be dissappointed," said Josephine Nieves, the New York City Commissioner of Employment. She said that more than 100,000 young people had applied for summer jobs in the government-sponsored program and that fewer than half that number of jobs would be created.
One applicant still hopeful of finding work is Sarah Mercado, 15, of Manhattan, who applied for the jobs program a month ago. In her only job interview so far, "they told me there were so many other kids, they had run out of numbers," she said yesterday.
The jobs aid that Congress is working on now is in addition to a larger package of Federal summer-jobs money that has been directed to cities and states for years. New York City has already received money to create 27,000 jobs this summer.
In Washington, the House and the Senate have approved different jobs bills; now members of Congress must work out a compromise that will have to go back to both houses for a final vote over the next week.
On Tuesday, the Senate appropriated $200 million to pay for 160,000 summer jobs. Of that number, it said about 12,500 jobs would be in New York State, with half of those in New York City. New Jersey would be allotted 6,500 summer jobs, and Connecticut would get 1,600. The House has passed a bill appropriating $340 million for summer jobs.
At City Hall, Ms. Nieves said she expected that summer jobs that lasted 8 or 10 weeks last summer might be shortened to 6 weeks this year. Young workers might also have their workweek shortened to 20 hours from the 28-hour week that has been common in recent years.
 
Minimum Wage
 Under the city's program, all participants are employed at the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and assigned to jobs at government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Many jobs involve clerical work at hospitals and government offices, child care, maintenance of streets and parks, and work in summer recreation programs.
The federally financed program is separate from another large summer-jobs program sponsored by the New York City Partnership, a business group, in which young people are offered summer work at private companies, often at pay higher than the minimum wage.
The program created 42,000 jobs last summer. Although a final count is not yet available, officials of the business group said there would be fewer jobs in the program this year because New York City companies have been hurt by the recession and are trying to protect their existing employees.
The cutbacks come at a time when unemployment among New York City teen-agers, always worse than in most of the nation, has soared. The city said this month that the unemployment rate among young people 16 to 19 years old was 40 percent in the first three months of the year, compared with 20 percent two years ago.
 
A Need for Hope
 "We have to give our kids hope, and nothing is more hopeful for them than having a job," said Richard E. Green, executive director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective in central Brooklyn, a neighborhood group that works with the city to match young people with federally financed summer jobs.
Like other experts, he said he feared that the cuts in the jobs program might aggravate social problems in some of the city's poor neighborhoods. Among those who had applied for summer jobs this year through his group, and were still waiting, were two of the four young Brooklyn men who were arrested last week in the killing of a man in Prospect Heights in an attempt to steal his bicycle.
"What that incident should tell us is that there a lot of kids out there with noble intentions who can easilly get into serious trouble if they don't see a light at the end of the tunnel," Mr. Green said.

HEADLINE: Blazing a Power Trail in the Adirondacks;
When Senator Ronald Stafford Says Not in My District, a Whole State Goes Without

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 23

 BODY:
Now and then, an issue arises that spotlights the way things really work in the New York State Legislature. There is, for instance, the current tale of how the fate of arguably the most important environmental legislation of the year has come to rest largely with one man: Senator Ronald B. Stafford, Republican from Plattsburgh.
At stake is the creation of an environmental trust fund, legislation that would set aside at least $100 million for the state to purchase and preserve undeveloped land, including in Adirondack Park and in Long Island's Pine Barrens and along barrier beaches. 
 But most of Adirondack Park is in Mr. Stafford's district. A critic of big government and environmentalists alike, the Senator has opposed the fund, saying state land purchases will hurt the economy of his rural, largely poor region by stifling development.
In other places, Mr. Stafford's concerns might be viewed as one opinion among many in a Legislature with 211 members. But in the Republican-controlled Senate, he is the deputy majority leader, chairman of the Finance Committee and widely considered the second most powerful man after the majority leader Ralph J. Marino, of Oyster Bay.
 
Control at Home and Far Afield
 Furthermore, Mr. Marino is the type of leader who cedes considerable influence to those he is ostensibly leading. Among the Republicans, senior senators have great control over issues dear to them.
At times, Mr. Marino's leadership style gives his inner circle vast power over issues outside their districts. For example, Senator Norman J. Levy, Republican from Suffern, maintains a virtual stranglehold over legislation relating to the New York City subway system because he is chairman of the Transportation Committee and a trusted associate of Mr. Marino.
The power Mr. Stafford wields is over the Adirondacks, with virtual veto power over anything the Senate, and thus the entire Legislature, does in the six million acres of craggy mountains, frigid lakes and dense forests that sweep across the state's northern reaches.
If the trust fund did not include the Pine Barrens and the barrier beaches, and Mr. Stafford's opposition therefore only affected the Adirondacks, the issue might not have gained much attention in Albany. But by blocking the trust fund, Mr. Stafford has also prevented money from flowing to other parts of the state.
This year, that has caused grumbling not only among Democrats, but also among downstate Republicans who want the state to purchase land in their districts. Mr. Marino himself has made promises to pass a bill this year.
 
'One Man, and One Man Only'
 For those reasons, Mr. Stafford's power over the park is being severely tested. Thus far, he has held his own. The Senate trust fund bill, drafted with Mr. Stafford's help, bars the use of a trust fund for purchasing any land in Adirondack Park.
But under pressure from environmental groups, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have said they will oppose any legislation that does not include the Adirondacks.
"It's a very bad public policy precedent to give one man, and one man only, veto power over a sixth of the state, the sixth with a majority of the state's natural resources," said Neil F. Woodworth, conservation director of the Adirondack Mountain Club. "It's a policy without precedent in the nation."
Mr. Stafford is not the only official raising concerns about a trust fund. Mr. Cuomo has said he will support a fund only if money is raised primarily through new taxes or fees, a position opposed by Republicans and some Democrats who say the fund can mostly come from the state's operating budget.
But Mr. Stafford's longstanding opposition to the land purchases has been so effective that it has become the stuff of lore upstate, where he has been called, sometimes derisively, sometimes reverently, King Ronald.
It is a role Mr. Stafford, 57, seems to enjoy. In his office in the Capitol are framed cartoons of him from local papers. One shows him dressed in royal robes and wearing a crown; another has him lighting fireworks from a box labeled "abolish the A.P.A. bill," environmental legislation Mr. Stafford helped kill last year.
A broad-shouldered man with flowing white hair, Mr. Stafford conveys anything but the image of a power broker. Avuncular and soft-spoken, his sentences tend to ramble and he often gropes for words, sometimes looking to aides for help.
"I don't think I'm close to the developers, I don't think I help any one group," he said in a recent interview. "All I'm trying to do is keep our way of life. To give our people the opportunity to make a living."
 
Longtime Ties
 To a large extent, his singular power over his region exemplifies the highly decentralized way Mr. Marino runs the Senate. But it also reflects the closeness of the two men: Mr. Stafford was an early supporter of Mr. Marino when he first ran for majority leader in 1988, and his support was considered instrumental to Mr. Marino's victory.
But Mr. Stafford, who has been in the Senate for 27 years, has also built a reputation for near invincibility in his district, where he has been unopposed 8 times in 15 races. Underlying his success, friends and foes say, is a back-country populism that mixes attacks on big government with an uncanny knack for obtaining big government money.
In this year's budget, for instance, Mr. Stafford is responsible for about $10 million in appropriations for public works projects in his district, ranging from a $350,000 sewer project in Warrensburg to a $6 million low-interest loan to a paper company in financial straits. Mr. Stafford is widely thought to have obtained more members items, as they are called, than any senator other than Mr. Marino.
Mr. Stafford says his members items have provided an important economic boost to a poor area. But his critics say he has used them to buy political support from local officials and business interests, particularly the logging industry.
"This is a poor area and there are things we cannot do without money from the state," said Dick Purdue, town supervisor of Indian Lake and a frequent critic of Mr. Stafford. "It is a not so subtle form of corruption in the Adirondacks."
His critics also say that Mr. Stafford has exploited local anxiety with the weak economy, portraying environmentalists as wealthy downstaters and blaming the Adirondack Park Agency, which has far-reaching authority to restrict development in the park, for stifling local enterprise.
"He runs year in and year out as the defender of the little guy, yet he's done nothing for them," said Melody Mackenzie, a Democrat who ran against Mr. Stafford last year. She was outspent by a 10-to-1 margin but won 38 percent of the vote.
During her campaign, Ms. MacKenzie repeatedly accused Mr. Stafford of using his political clout to direct state jobs to his associates. A similar charge has been made in a Federal lawsuit brought by a Saranac Lake developer who claims he was pressured by a bank to use Mr. Stafford as his bond counsel. Mr. Stafford, who is a director of the bank, denies the charges.
Friends say Mr. Stafford's conservatism is grounded in his humble roots. "He's a populist," said Harold A. Jerry Jr., a member of the state Public Service Commission who advocates trust-fund purchases in the Adirondacks. "He's not adopting false positions to please constituents."
 
Humility and Hard Work
 Orphaned as an infant, Mr. Stafford was adopted by a Plattsburgh couple when he was 3. His father, a guard at Dannemora State Prison, liked taking him ice fishing; his mother, a school teacher, cajoled him to study. She usually prevailed, imparting lessons in humility, personal responsibility and hard work, he said.
"She always reminded you you're not as good as you thought," he said.
After graduating from Columbia Law School, he worked on the 1964 campaign of United States Senator Kenneth Keating, who lost to Robert Kennedy. The following year, he returned to Plattsburgh, challenged the local Democratic Senator and won. The margin, 8,600 votes, stands as his narrowest victory yet.
As an example of Mr. Stafford's independence, his defenders point to his early support for legislation allowing people sickened by toxic chemicals to sue companies long after being exposed. Republican leaders adamantly opposed the toxic torts bill, as it was known. But Mr. Stafford shepherded the bill to passage in 1986, winning respect from some of the same liberal lobbyists who now battle him on environmental issues.
"When they write the New York version of 'Profiles in Courage,' Ron Stafford will get an entire chapter for the toxic-tort fight," said Arthur N. Malkin, a lobbyist who worked with Mr. Stafford on the legislation.
During that fight, Mr. Stafford was stricken with lung cancer and received chemotherapy that left him bald, weak and almost unrecognizable. "We were once at a breakfast," said H. Douglas Barclay, a former state Senator, "and a Legislator came in and said, 'Too bad Senator Stafford couldn't make it.' And he was right next to me. It took a lot of guts to get through that."
Mr. Stafford says he has completely recovered from the cancer.
Now, amid a daily barrage of criticism from environmental groups, he faces his biggest political battle in years.
"The environmentalists are paid to do their job," he said. "But if people really knew how these laws affect people, they'd have a different attitude."

HEADLINE: Hartford Predicts 2d Consecutive Budget Surplus

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 23

 BODY:
A jump in corporation tax receipts will help Connecticut finish the 1992-93 budget year with a small surplus for the second consecutive year after four years of deficits, the latest forecast shows.
By law, the expected $10 million surplus must be applied toward the $966 million deficit from the 1990-91 fiscal year. The state still owes $706 million to investors who bought five-year notes. 
 William J. Cibes Jr., the state budg et director, said that the state appears to have achieved stability in its revenue system despite the problems afflicting the Connecticut economy.
"The main sources are very strong," he said, pointing to the corporation, sales and personal income taxes.
A $45 million rise in receipts from corporation taxes, which are assessed on profits, suggests that many companies are turning the corner, Mr. Cibes said. "That ultimately means, I believe, that there will be job creation," he said.
The jump in corporation-tax receipts will offset a $32 million Medicaid penalty that was assessed in February, but was not recognized as a revenue loss in the state's official budget forecasts until this week.
State Comptroller William E. Curry Jr. has been warning since March that the state would fail to get the $32 million by June 30.
Mr. Cibes said today that the previous decision to overlook the penalty had been justified because the state had earlier been optimistic about winning its appeal.
Mr. Cibes's new forecast differed in several ways from the one he issued last month.
The differences include a $14 million reduction in spending and a $5 million increase in tax refunds. The $10 million surplus represents the net result of all changes, as last month's report projected a zero balance on June 30.
All changes are comparatively small, given the size of the overall budget: $8.1 billion.
The sales tax, which usually falls off drastically in an economic downturn, has held steady for the last two years.
The income tax exceeded projections made last fall by more than $100 million when final returns, and first estimated payments for 1993, were opened in mid-April.
Mr. Cibes speculated that one factor may be the reduced rates on capital gains, dividends and interest that were introduced in 1991 when the income tax was extended to wages.

Stocks retreated broadly yesterday led by a sharp drop in blue-chip issues that pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down 30.72 points, to 3,466.81. Investor concern over corporate profits was again a factor, traders said.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 278.3 million shares changing hands, up from 260 million on Tuesday. Losing stocks were narrowly ahead of gainers, 1,073 to 845, as the Big Board composite slipped 1.17 points, to 244.92. 
 Heavy selling in oil stocks and losses in a number of bank issues supplied the downside impetus for blue chips in a session dominated by programmed trading. Oil stocks fell on concern over supply, compounded by rating downgrades and lower earnings estimates from several analysts on a number of oil companies.
 
Investors' Fears Heightened
 Declining oil prices amid bickering by OPEC members over production levels and an industry report late Tuesday showing a sharp rise in crude oil and gasoline inventories in the United States heightened investor fears over oil company profits. Texaco, fell 1 5/8, to 62 1/2; Mobil was down 1 3/4, to 73 1/8, and Atlantic Richfield dropped 4 3/4, to 114 5/8.
However, transportation issues, grounded for weeks, did well yesterday on propects of lower fuel prices. The Dow transport index rose 7.98 points, to 1,493.41 and was led by UAL, up 2 5/8, to 120 5/8.
Other negative news came from a Government report that May durable goods fell 1.6 percent and that first- quarter gross domestic product was revised downward to a gain of only seven-tenths of 1 pecent.
Among the issues leading the market lower were Caterpillar, down 1 3/8, to 72 7/8, after Tuesday's Commerce Department decision to impose punitive duties on imported steel. Traders said the move could lead to higher steel prices and hurt the construction industry, where Caterpillar has a major presence.
Frank Calta, managing director and head of institutional trading at Josepthal, Lyon & Ross, said the cancellation of the RJR Nabisco stock offering yesterday hurt the market.
 
Nabisco Offering Halted
 RJR Nabisco Holding's decision not to go ahead with a previously announced public offering of 93 million a special stock in its food business was based on the decline over the last four months of the market value of comparable food companies. The decline would have made it difficult for Nabisco to fetch the price for the food stock of $17 to $19 a share. One trader called the move a warning sign for the market, since it was the first of 290 initial public offerings this year that was not done.
The Costar Corporation, a manufacturer of disposable plastic lab ware, rose 5 7/8, to 23 5/8, after saying it had agreed to be acquired by Corning for $25 in Corning common stock for each Costar share. Corning fell 1/4, to 34 3/8.

HEADLINE: Small Business Wants More In Clinton Economic Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Convinced they have been outlobbied by big business, the nation's small businesses began pressing today for changes in President Clinton's economic plan, complaining that the Senate Finance Committee wiped out most provisions that would help them.
Representatives of the nation's 20 million small businesses, once optimistic about the President's original package, have soured on the plan because the Finance Committee dropped a capital-gains tax cut for small business and other investment incentives. 
 "We were done in on Capitol Hill," said Bennie Thayer, chairman of the 350,000-member National Association for the Self-Employed, "Big business once again got its way. Now we see small business being hurt more than we anticipated in the beginning."
Mr. Clinton's original plan included numerous goodies for small business that were eliminated in Congress -- like a permanent investment tax credit, the capital-gains tax cut for investments in small companies and tax breaks for hiring workers in poor urban areas.
In addition, the House of Representatives inserted a provision enabling small businesses to quickly write off the first $25,000 -- up from the first $10,000 -- of each year's investment in equipment, but the Senate Finance Committee scaled that back, too.
"We would like to go back closer to what the original package included," said John Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business United, a group with 60,000 business members. "At this point, we're incredibly upset with what the Senate did. It will show a real absence of leadership on President Clinton's part if he doesn't work to get some of these small-business incentives back in."
As the full Senate took up the deficit reduction package today, small-business lobbyists peppered the nation's capital with faxes and held numerous news conferences as they urged small-business owners to shower the White House and Congress with phone calls and letters.
Several lobbyists questioned why the Senate Finance Committee favored big business over small companies because, in their view, small business packs a far more powerful electoral punch.
The small businesses at first praised the President's plan, showing a willingness to put up with some higher taxes because the plan was serious about reducing the budget deficit. Many wealthy small-business owners complained about the increases in personal income taxes, but the general sense was the President's plan was positive because it contained special provisions for small business. President Clinton had also stressed that small businesses needed special incentives because they were the main engine of job creation.
But when the Senate Finance Committee replaced a broad-based energy tax approved by the House with a smaller tax on gasoline and other transportation fuels, it also dropped most of the tax breaks for small business as it struggled to offset the money lost from the energy tax.
 
Effort in Congress Pledged
 Hearing small business's pleas, Administration officials said they would seek to insure that some of the small-business incentives remain in the final package after negotiations between the House and Senate.
"The President's plan has always had a commitment to target incentives for small business because we believe they are a major engine of job creation," said Gene Sperling, an assistant to the President for economic policy. "I suspect in one form or another we will work to make sure the final bill has incentives that help small business."
Many lawmakers were heeding the wrath of small business. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, introduced an amendment to give back part of the small-business incentives that the Finance Committee removed, but it was defeated on the Senate floor.
His amendment would have increased the amount of an investment that small businesses could write off in the first year to $18,500 from the current level of $10,000. The House had approved a $25,000 ceiling in such deductions, but the Senate Finance Committee cut it back to $15,000. This provision aims to encourage small businesses to invest more by allowing them to deduct a sizable chunk of each year's investment that same year.
Mr. Mitchell's proposal also called for cutting a capital gains tax on investments in businesses with less than $50 million in capital. The Senate Finance Committee deleted this provision.
One Senate aide said the package was still favorable to small businesses, arguing that eliminating the broad-based energy tax was good for them. The aide asserted that the capital gains tax break would have helped only the rich, and added, "Expensing has been raised by 50 percent. How can anyone complain about having a deduction enlarged by 50 percent."
 
 
Income Tax Plan
 Much of small business's fury was aimed at the Administration's proposal to raise the personal income tax rate from 31 percent to 36 percent for households with taxable incomes of more than $140,000 and to 40 percent for households with taxable incomes of more than $250,000.
This provision would hit many wealthy small-business owners, whose corporate profits are taxed at the personal rate.
The National Federation of Independent Business, which has 600,000 members, called the personal income tax increase its No. 1 problem.
"Small businesses have accounted for 65 percent of the new jobs created in the past five years," said Ronald Bullock, president of the Bison Gear and Engineering Corporation in Downer's Grove, Ill. "Do we, as a country, really want to derail this job express by imposing an unfair tax on family-owned businesses?"

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Canada's Tobacco-Tube Test;
New Cigarettes Save Butts From Ashtrays

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 23

 BODY:
Smokers who cannot finish whole cigarettes will have a way to extinguish them neatly and smoke them again later with a new brand that is being introduced by Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., the Canadian tobacco company.
Packs of new Oxford Long-Lasting Cigarettes will come with special storage tubes to save partly smoked cigarettes. The packaging was a response to research that showed 50 percent of Canadian smokers put out unfinished cigarettes and later resmoked them. 
 The reason for Canada's smoke-and-snuff habit is attributed to high tobacco prices and tough smoking restrictions.
Oxford cigarette packs also contain "snippers" to cut off the ends of butts as well as a tube to extinguish and store a half-smoked cigarette.
"It responds to the changing trends of today's smokers," said a company spokesman, John McDonald, "mainly public and workplace smoking restrictions whereby people have to go down elevators, into stairwells and outside to enjoy a cigarette."
Canada's tobacco consumption has been declining by about 3 percent a year, Mr. McDonald noted.
"Quite often as well, people want to reduce their smoking and do not want to smoke a whole cigarette at once," he said.
Canada has some of the world's strictest anti-smoking laws. Smoking is prohibited in public places like shopping malls, railroad stations and office buildings. Tobacco is also heavily taxed, which has led to a thriving black market in cigarettes smuggled across the border from the United States.
Smokers will pay extra for the Oxford brand, which has a suggested retail price of 2.99 Canadian dollars, or about $2.35 (United States), for a pack of 10, compared with about $3.50 for a typical 20-pack.
The product is being sold initially in Quebec City and London, Ontario and is expected to be introduced throughout Canada.
Mr. McDonald said his company had the exclusive license in Canada for the special filter on the cigarettes and international patents on the product.
Sixty percent of Rothmans, Benson & Hedges is owned by a unit of Britain's Rothmans International P.L.C., and 40 percent is owned by the Philip Morris Companies.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
New York Gold Prices Jump As Inflation Concern Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices jumped to a two-week high on the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, as the rapidly rising soybean market fanned inflation fears and the dollar fell versus the yen.
In other commodities markets, silver futures rose sharply, grain advanced, orange juice cooled down, oil rose and livestock and meat were mostly higher. 
 Gold for August delivery climbed $5.80, to $375.50 an ounce, the contract's highest settlement since June 8. July silver surged 13.5 cents, to $4.395 an ounce, also a two-week high.
The metals market had been calm this month as inflation jitters that prompted a spring rally quieted. But the strength in commodity prices this week, especially in the weather-driven soybean market, revived investors' interest in gold, said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.
"You don't have to look too much farther than the soybean pit," Mr. O'Neill said. "When there is something that threatens to have some inflationary implications, gold is quick to respond to it." Many investors consider gold a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.
Soybeans reached a 12-month high this week as planting delays caused by excessive rain in the Midwest caused analysts to lower their acreage and production expectations.
The strength in soybeans contributed to a rise yesterday in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and industrial commodities. The index, which is considered a significant indicator of inflation, closed at 206.76, up 114 points.
Buying in precious metals was also prompted by gold's ability to hold above $367.50 an ounce and silver's ability to remain above $4.25, when sellers tested the markets, said Peter Cardillo, research director with Westfalia Investments in New York.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in August rose 4 cents, to $18.86 a barrel; July heating oil rose 0.19 cent, to 52.07 a gallon; July unleaded gasoline rose 0.19 cent, to 54.09 cents a gallon, and July natural gas skidded 22.1 cents, to $1.865 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Administration May Cut Growth Forecast to 2.5%

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is likely to cut its forecast for this year's economic growth to around 2.5 percent from the 3.1 percent prediction it made in January, the Administration's chief economist said today.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the Administration was contemplating a downward revision in the forecast because of the defeat of President Clinton's $16 billion jobs program and slower-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter. 
 "We're talking somewhere between 2.5 percent and 3 percent, and probably on the soft side of 3," she said at a lunch with reporters, suggesting that numerous factors were pushing the forecast toward 2.5 percent.
Many economists say that growth needs to be at least 2.5 percent to make an appreciable dent in the nation's unemployment rate, now running at 6.9 percent.
 
Smaller Debt Service
 Ms. Tyson predicted that notwithstanding the slower-than-anticipated growth, this year's budget deficit would not be larger than the $322 billion the Administration forecast in January. The reason: interest rates have fallen more than the Administration had forecast, causing large savings in servicing the Federal debt.
Ms. Tyson said that in light of the strong rise in business inventories in the first quarter, growth in the second quarter would probably remain moderate. She said she agreed with private forecasters who suggested growth of 2.3 to 2.4 percent.
But she predicted faster growth in the second half, saying that once the President's economic package was approved and many uncertainties removed, businesses would feel more willing to expand, invest and hire new workers.
She added that "the lagged effects" of low interest rates would also help speed growth later this year. For example, homeowners who paid $1,000 to refinance their mortages may take several extra months to feel the effects of their lower mortgage payments.
Other factors that suggested faster growth, she said, were interest-rate cuts in Germany and an expected economic rebound in slumping Japan. Stronger growth abroad would help increase American exports, which have been weak in recent months.
Ms. Tyson said the Senate's defeat of the President's stimulus program would subtract three-tenths of 1 percent from this year's growth rate.

HEADLINE: Why Not Take a Gander at This Piece?

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY

 BODY:
THE nicest people do it, the most intelligent people do it, the "letting it all hang out, telling it like it is" people do it. It's unconscious, subconscious, automatic. It's highly unlikely that there's anyone around who hasn't, at one time or another, used a euphemism.
"They're probably just as old as language," said Dr. Frederick C. Mish, editor in chief of Merriam-Webster Inc., dictionary publishers in Springfield, Mass. He noted that the actual word was Greek in origin, loosely meaning something that sounds better, and that it was generally related to "getting around the taboos and certain sacred words." 
 He said, for example, that "gosh" and "golly" were first used instead of "God," and that "jeepers" was used for "Jesus."
"Euphemisms also turn up anywhere they're needed to put a better face on things," Dr. Mish said. "The military may say 'incursion,' politicians use 'negative growth' and 'retrenchment.' What do they really mean? 'Invasion,' 'downturn' and 'cutting back on spending.' "
He also pointed out that there was a new tendency to use an initial in front of "word" as a euphemism -- "L-word" instead of liberal, for example, although this one was generally said tongue in cheek.
One of Dr. Mish's favorite euphemism-related phrases is "Pardon my French," which is generally said before profanity.
"It's amusing because there's an unspoken assumption that English wouldn't have any bad words," he said.
Back to politics. "Politically correct" is a euphemism, but for what?
Joseph J. Esposito, president of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Publishing Group, thinks the phrase is both curious and amusing because, he said, "It refers to the rigid ideologues of the left but is used exclusively by rigid ideologues of the right."
The British have some rather wonderful euphemisms. Try "one sandwich short of a picnic" for "crazy" or "NQOCD" instead of "not quite our class dear." And how about "sugar on your strawberries," meaning that senility may be just around the corner?
In various parts of the United States, to "send someone to the woodshed" is to give them a tongue-lashing or even a spanking. To "bless out" is to curse someone, and to use the phrase "horse hockey" is to get around saying "excrement."
Once in a while, the more thoughtful will catch themselves using a euphemism. They'll say "remains" and then ask themselves what makes that word any better, any more acceptable or pleasant than "corpse" or "body." They'll ask themselves why they say "odor" instead of "smell" and "perspiration" instead of "sweat" and, in short, why they are shilly-shallying around.
They may ask themselves but, for the most part, they'll still do it, a holdover perhaps from the past when it was considered impolite to be direct, or when certain words conjured images that were apparently too embarrassing to be spoken aloud, especially by ladies.
Most women of a certain age (another euphemism, usually used instead of "old" but in this case meaning anyone past the first blush of youth) can remember when "menstrual period" was a phrase used almost exclusively by doctors. Its most common euphemism, for some reason considered less distasteful, was and often still is "the curse."
A marginally more pleasant but infinitely less honest euphemism is remembered by Judy Licht, a television reporter. For years, she recalled, she referred to that time of month (another euphemism) as "having a friend." She and many in her age group also used a phrase -- "falling off the roof" -- that made even less sense but was an accepted part of their vocabulary.
Death has many euphemisms but one of the strangest -- "he bought the farm" -- may have an unusual provenance. According to Jerry Della Femina, who is married to Ms. Licht and is chairman of Jerry Inc., an advertising agency, it was first used in World War II by pilots and soldiers when a colleague was killed. "He bought the farm" meant that the insurance policy left behind would pay off any mortgage.
"Passed away" is probably the most ubiquitous euphemism for death, but more elaborate and genteel are "departed this life," "called home" and "gone to eternal sleep." And when it comes to the next step, burial, who hasn't heard the expression "laid to rest"?
All of these and more are a thorn in the side (is that a euphemism for irritation?) of Louis Ufland, a partner in Ufland-Jannes, a public relations and special-events firm in Manhattan. As for Mr. Ufland, he says he doesn't equivocate -- he comes right out with "died" and "buried."
It's true that "at liberty" and "resting" sound better than "unemployed," but the end result is the same. Everyone knows what is meant. And once in a while, "considering offers" actually means just that -- once in a while.
Once in a while, too, there is an euphemism that makes sense. "Eyewear" started as a fashionable and better-sounding word for "eyeglasses." Now that glasses are most often made of plastic, eyewear is more accurate.
There's nothing unpleasant about the word "wife" -- one hopes. So why "the little woman," a patronizing and infinitely less preferable euphemism? And why, too, "my better half," which is patronizing in another way? It's usually used by men who mean the exact opposite.
Let's not forget "sleeping with," "going to bed with," and "having an affair." All, in most cases, to avoid -- and what's wrong with it? -- the word sex.
Going to the "powder room," the "little boys room," or "little girls room"? Where's the "bathroom" or even, dare we say it, the "toilet," which is after all, just a small room fitted for a specific purpose?
For Dr. Maria New, chairman of the department of pediatrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, some euphemisms are essential -- but she deals with children. When she says "We're going to have 'a little stick' or 'a little pinch,' " it's accepted more quietly and readily than "Now we're going to stick a needle in you and draw some blood."
One of the more sublime euphemisms is attributed to Winston Churchill. It's "terminalogical inexactitude," and in less polite terms it means "a lie." Another owes its birth to royalty. It's called "a gracious message" and translated for mere mortals, it means a royal request to Parliament for money. Try that one on your boss.

Twelve days ago, Tony Fernandez escaped from baseball's version of hell, the place where a team cannot win two straight games, where a pitcher has lost 23 straight and where both the manager and general manager who started the season are now unemployed. No longer muddling along with the last-place Mets in Flushing, Fernandez returned to the defending World Series champion Blue Jays in Toronto in a trade for outfielder Darrin Jackson.
But the improvement in scenery has not improved his demeanor, at least not today. There was no smile emanating from Fernandez when he was asked about being back in the city where he began his major league career at shortstop 10 years ago. There were no wonderful stories from him about playing before a sellout crowd every night at the Skydome and no theories about why he is playing remarkably better for the Jays then he did for the Mets. There was mostly gruffness as a player reputed as aloof was exactly that. 
 "I'm happy to play wherever God sends me," said Fernandez, who spent two seasons in San Diego before playing two months with the Mets. "I'll be ready to play anywhere. It just didn't work out in New York."
 
Injuries Took Toll
 Why not? After claiming that everyone knew why he faltered in New York, and then being told that was untrue, Fernandez grudgingly mentioned how a bout with kidney stones and then fatigue from the ordeal had detracted from his game.
But he remained very guarded. Asked how much happier he was to be in Toronto, Fernandez snapped, "What makes you think I wasn't happy in New York?"
Well, if Fernandez is not happier in Toronto, his statistics surely have made the Blue Jays happier. After scraping bottom by hitting .225 with one homer, 14 runs batted in and making 6 errors in 48 games for the Mets, Fernandez has soared here.
While the Blue Jays were losing, 4-3, to the Yankees tonight, Fernandez was going 2 for 3 with a double, triple and a walk. He extended his hitting streak to seven games and raised his batting average to .356 for his 11 games with Toronto. He has 1 home run and 12 runs batted in. And he has not made an error.
"I'm just doing my job," Fernandez said before the game, never lifting his head to make eye contact.
 
A Savior For the Jays
 Although Fernandez has a bizarre sidearm throwing style that will not be taught at any baseball clinics, he is a savvy veteran who usually positions himself adequately and makes the plays his limited range allows. A four-time All-Star with a career .284 average who turns 31 next week, Fernandez has been a savior for the Jays because Dick Schofield, their regular shortstop, is on the disabled list with a broken arm and will be sidelined until at least August.
A deeply religious man who has sometimes been described as peculiar, Fernandez is the eighth player to serve two stints with the Blue Jays and is the club's career leader in games played at shortstop, 1,020. Although it seems as if it would be easy for him to speak about leaving the out-of-the-running Mets for a team that has a chance for its second straight World Series title, Fernandez is reluctant to elaborate on the blessing.
"I feel good," he said. "God works in mysterious ways."

HEADLINE: Cornwall Village Gets a Tate Gallery Branch

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. IVES, England, June 20

 BODY:
Nestled into the cliffs overlooking Porthmeor Beach in this tiny fishing village in the farthest corner of Cornwall is the brand new Tate St. Ives, a pristine white structure that politely defers to the sea. Within, there is a selection of art from the English artists who belong to the St. Ives School, selected from the holdings of the Tate Gallery in London.
The opening of the $4.95 million museum has not been without considerable fanfare, in the hope of improving the fortunes of St. Ives, an economically depressed area with an artistically rich history. 
 [Prince Charles arrived on Wednesday to add further luster to the inauguration ceremonies. About 2,500 members of the art world are expected in St. Ives before the week's festivities are over.]
For more than a century artists beginning with J. M. W. Turner and Whistler have come here to capture the views of the sea, the wild landscape and the soft, even light. So have scores of late-19th-century plein-air realist painters. The first of the so-called St. Ives School -- Ben Nicholson; his wife, Barbara Hepworth, and Naum Gabo -- moved here in 1939. Bernard Leach established his pottery here in the 1920's, and in the 1930's and 40's Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost and Roger Hilton joined the growing artists' colony.
"A number of these artists had international recognition in the 50's," said Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate. "The museum can't help but provoke a renewed interest and a reappraisal of their work."
 
Long Ruminations
 The idea for the museum has been brewing since the mid-1970's, but in 1985, when the Tate held a major exhibition of St. Ives artists, community officials got serious. "They asked us if we would be willing to run a museum if they could ever have the means to build it," Mr. Serota said.
The Tate's growing number of satellite operations is similar to that of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, an institution that operates several branches in the United States. Yet it is still less ambitious than the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which is running museums on both sides of the Atlantic. This is the Tate's second branch; the first, the Tate Liverpool, opened five years ago. While the Liverpool museum has had its share of economic difficulties, Mr. Serota said it was averaging about 600,000 visitors a year and that he hoped St. Ives would have the same appeal. Art for the Tate's latest venture has come from the museum's holdings of about 100 paintings and sculptures by artists of the St. Ives School. About 30 to 40 percent of the art in the new museum's galleries will change each year. "We'll also borrow works from time to time," Mr. Serota said.
Mike Tooby, the curator in charge of the Tate St. Ives, explained that he didn't want to "draw a line around a body of work and say it is strictly St. Ives." He added: "Mark Rothko came here on holiday in 1958. You wouldn't put him in the list of St. Ives artists; nevertheless there is a connection. We want to blur the edges."
Seventy-five artworks are currently on view. So are about 70 pieces of ceramics, many by Bernard Leach. There are also several new commissions. The entrance to the museum, for example, is dominated by a large colored-glass window -- part gift, part commission -- in rich hues of pinks and turquoise, created by Patrick Heron. Terry Frost, another contemporary St. Ives artist, created a long hanging especially for the main stairwell inside the museum.
 
Local Vernacular
 The main glazed rotunda echoes the shape of the gasworks that were built in 1835 where the museum now stands. The building's architects, Eldred Evans and David Shalev, were selected through a national competition. Their design reflects the vernacular architecture of St. Ives. The building's exterior, fashioned from a material known as marble dash (actually cement with pebbles mixed in) is common to the area. Natural light bathes the building, and the galleries are plain white modern spaces. Nautical references like portholes give the feeling of a ship; visitors are never supposed to lose sight of the water.
The core of the museum is centered around five small galleries. Two are devoted to a chronological overview of the St. Ives School from 1925 to 1975, two are for special exhibitions, and a fifth is for an in-depth show on a particular artist's work or period. The current installation includes a show of paintings and drawings by Barbara Hepworth from 1948 to '49 when she worked in a local hospital. In another gallery, there are two paintings by Brian Winter, one done in St. Ives, the other in London. "No doubt Winter is a St. Ives painter," said Mr. Tooby. "But I wouldn't want to take only the St. Ives pictures."
Mr. Tooby said there were about 200 professional artists living and working in St. Ives and three serious art galleries there; a lot, given that the total population is 11,000. In the last few years the village has had its share of economic troubles, and the new museum is seen as a way of creating more local jobs as well as increasing tourism. According to a market research survey conducted by the Tate, some 75,000 people will visit the museum each year, many of whom would not make the five-hour train ride from London just for a visit to the sea. And unlike the stately homes in the area that are open only from Easter through October, the Tate St. Ives is planning to stay open all year.
 
Cooperative Effort
 The museum has been as much a community effort as a Tate production. The 16,000-square-foot building is owned by the County Council of St. Ives and leased to the Tate. Local authorities raised more than $1 million; $1.8 million in grants came from the Rural Development Commission and the European Community Regional Development Fund, and more than $1.5 million has been raised from private sources, including the Henry Moore Foundation, the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts and the John S. Cohen Foundation. The museum's annual operating costs will be covered by the $3.75 admissions charge and by private donations.
Mr. Serota said the time was right for such a small, specialized museum. While the institution is looking for a site in London where it will run a contemporary-art branch of the Tate, the director stressed the need for museums in more remote settings. "Culture in Britain has always been rather centralized," he said. "But patterns of communication are changing as people are beginning to travel to art centers like Liverpool and St. Ives."

HEADLINE: Green for a Greeting, Red for Rape

 BODY:
At first it seems almost funny, that the Navy has produced a one-page guide on sexual harassment that reads like a 6-year-old's reading primer. On second thought, it's no laughing matter. Maybe this equivalent of the 1992 Presidential campaign's "It's the economy, stupid" is precisely what a service so deeply steeped in sexism needs to reform its ways.
The guide, which has been sent to all commanding officers for posting on military bulletin boards, defines harassment in terms of traffic lights. "Sexual assault and rape" gets a red light. "Expressing concern or encouragement" gets a green. Behavior that falls somewhere between a casual hello and a determined grope gets a yellow. Many women would agree that "unwanted letters or poems" is properly yellow. But "sexually suggestive touching"? Surely that qualifies for red. 
 Still, the Navy deserves some credit for an earnest if awkward attempt to clarify the do's and don'ts of sexual behavior for people who seem never to have learned them -- people like some of the aviators who attended the debauch that was the Tailhook Association's 1991 convention. Such people are hardly exclusive to the Navy. They reflect the American culture out of which they come -- a culture in which sexual harassment is common and sexual braggarts like California's Spur Posse become the guests-most-wanted by the nation's talk shows.
It may be hard to believe that servicemen must be told that asking "Did you have a nice weekend?" is O.K., and "grabbing, forced kissing, fondling" is not. But experience suggests that a clear code of conduct is needed. The Navy's guide may be simplistic, but like a reading primer, it's a start.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton Beats the Haitians

 BODY:
The Supreme Court has upheld the Bush-Clinton policy of taking to the high seas to force fleeing Haitians to return home. In doing so, it has given the executive branch a legal victory and a moral black eye.
Revolted by episodes of forced repatriation of political refugees, the United Nations and Congress prohibited the practice -- but not, says the Court, on the high seas. Why didn't the law mention the high seas? Probably because the lawmakers "may not have contemplated that any nation would gather fleeing refugees and return them to the one country they had desperately sought to escape." 
 That reasoning is strikingly reminiscent of the Court's ruling a year ago that U.S. agents might kidnap a suspect in Mexico for trial north of the border because the extradition treaty didn't expressly forbid that evasive tactic.
These are costly victories, sustaining executive power only because the fine print hasn't covered every weaseling evasion. The moral: When dealing with the United States, don't shake hands; get it in writing. That's just what Mexico is doing now in negotiations for a respectable extradition treaty.
As a candidate, Bill Clinton denounced the Bush Administration's ocean blockade of Haitians as cruel, and agreed with lower court decisions that it was illegal as well. But as President he adopted Mr. Bush's policy, calling it a humane interim response to mass migration from Haiti's dictatorship. Then his lawyers echoed the Bush Administration's legal arguments, including the complaint that the lower courts were bothering the President in matters of foreign policy.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for an 8-to-1 majority, needed all the agility at his command to construe the law the President's way. The law provides plainly that aliens may not be returned to a country where the Attorney General has found a threat to their lives or freedom based on politics, as opposed to economic deprivation.
Before President Bush announced the interdiction policy, thousands of boat people had been found to be political refugees. By blocking all boat people without an asylum hearing, the Coast Guard returned them knowing that many deserved asylum.
Despite what Justice Stevens called "the moral weight" of the Haitians' argument, he found that Congress did not intend to apply the asylum law beyond the water's edge. Justice Harry Blackmun, in a lone but cogent dissent, called on the Court to apply the law's plain language to carry out its broad humanitarian purpose.
Often in history the high court has cut the President some extra slack when he must deal with an intractable international problem. The Court has done so again, but in a way that awards power without honor to the President.

HEADLINE: How Mexican Jobs Ease U.S. Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Reaganomics, With a Mexican Accent," (Op-Ed, June 11), Michael Lind accuses President Clinton of confusion because he supports revitalizing the economy and the North America Free Trade Agreement, but Mr. Lind's arguments are confused. 
 "For Mr. Clinton to try to raise middle-class incomes and taxes while Mexican and other third world immigrants are depressing wages and raising the costs of law enforcement, education and welfare would be like bailing water from a leaking canoe," he says correctly.
Yet we share a huge border with Mexico and have been unsuccessful in preventing illegal immigration for decades. Surely, the best way to cut Mexican immigration is to help Mexico provide jobs at home, and the trade agreement can only help.
It may be true that under the agreement we will lose jobs to Mexico, but we will lose those jobs anyway, to China, Malaysia and Thailand. The job loss will only accelerate, whether to Mexico or Asia, if we raise the minimum wage. We will almost certainly lose fewer jobs if the trade agreement passes. It will make much more sense for a Mexican factory to get bulky raw and intermediate materials from the United States than it would for a factory in distant Thailand. Also, new jobs will be created.
Remember, there was never anything to keep American companies from building factories in Mexico to export to the United States and elsewhere. The barriers were against American companies making goods for Mexicans on either side of the border. Since the Salinas Government changed policies, United States-Mexican trade has increased, and the United States has developed a significant and growing trade surplus with Mexico, preserving some United States jobs and creating new jobs on both sides of the border. The Mexican standard of living has increased in the process.
I share Mr. Lind's concern for American workers, but surely we must care for the conditions of Mexicans as well.

HEADLINE: House Passes a Bill to Encourage Strikes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"House Passes Bill to Ban Replacement of Strikers" (news article, June 16) incorrectly reports of H.R. 5: "The measure would apply only to companies where a labor group is recognized by the employer or the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive representative of the workers in negotiations." 
 The "strike bill" continues to apply to both union and nonunion companies. In the June 15 House vote, an amendment by Representative Chet Edwards of Texas would have clarified this issue by restricting application only to union members who are
part of a "recognized or certified" bargaining unit. The Edwards amendment would have addressed business concerns about increased "recognitional strikes" by nonunion workers. Mr. Edwards's amendment was defeated, led principally by the House Democratic leadership and organized labor.
Under the House-passed bill, union members striking to press economic demands, or nonunion employees striking to force union recognition, would be permitted to shut down their employers and be guaranteed automatic reinstatement whenever they decide to return to work. Employers would be prohibited from hiring permanent replacement workers to keep the company afloat during the strike.
The bill would have an adverse effect on nonunion employers in other ways. Union strikes are not isolated events affecting only striking workers and their company. Under H.R. 5, nonunion employers would be subject to devastating economic consequences and small-business failures from increased union strikes.
The bill also creates an ideal, though unfair, union organizing tool for use against nonunion companies by guaranteeing the jobs of union members following strikes for economic demands, no matter how unreasonable. The certain result will be increased strikes, inflationary wage settlements and a chill on economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Nurturing Technology in Ohio

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio

 BODY:
This city in the heart of the Mahoning Valley may be better known for defunct steel mills than high technology and international competitiveness. But Youngstown is home to a technology outreach office that may be the prototype for a nationwide system, if the Clinton Administration's technology policy proceeds as planned.
The Technology Development Corporation is a strange beast, organizationally. Legally, it is part of Youngstown State University and is in a Victorian-era house on its campus. But it is also one of five outreach offices across the state sponsored by the Great Lakes Manufacturing Technology Center in Cleveland. The other four are in Akron, Canton, Elyria and Toledo. 
 Officials in the outreach office, which receives funds from a variety of Federal, state and private sources, have been actively coaching a group of 10 small and midsize manufacturing companies on such matters as making sure their products will meet the European Community's stringent new quality standards.
 
Thinking Globally, Acting Locally
 And so it came to be that Henry E. Bertolini Jr. has been spending roughly equal amounts of time lately thinking about his Youngstown company's aluminum extrusion business and about the intricacies of an arcane-sounding set of international quality-control specifications known as ISO 9000. So far, only a few hundred American companies -- most of them corporate giants like Du Pont and Union Carbide -- have been certified as meeting the standards.
But working with the outreach office has persuaded Mr. Bertolini, his colleagues at General Extrusions and indeed much of the Youngstown manufacturing community that the future lies in being globally competitive.
"We did not have a quality system in place that would make us a preferred supplier in the year 2000," said Mr. Bertolini, who is engineering manager for General Extrusions, a company that uses computer-controlled heavy machinery to squeeze thick, heat-softened aluminum bars into shaped parts. "We are going to use the ISO 9000 standards as the vehicle to build that system."
The principal agent of change was Michael J. Coast, a technology transfer specialist with the four-person, nonprofit Technology Development Corporation. "We looked at plants around here and found that most of them had no quality operators and no written procedures," Mr. Coast said. "So we held meetings to explain what ISO is and why they need it."
The ISO standards, originally devised to promote trade within Europe, are a set of rules governing such things as quality standards and management procedures. ISO certification is a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for manufacturers. In Youngstown, representatives of the 10 companies meet twice a month for workshops on how to interpret the standards and write the manuals and procedures that will be audited by the outside examiners that can confer ISO certification.
"I can draw on the expertise of the other companies and T.D.C.," Mr. Bertolini said. "They help keep us on track, which is useful because it is easy to get sidetracked on this kind of thing."
 
Technical Assistance
 The Great Lakes Manufacturing Technology Center receives Federal support through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. The Cleveland center employs more than 60 people who operate a technology demonstration facility, where executives can test computers, software and advanced machinery before deciding what to buy.
The center also operates a teaching factory on the campus of Cleveland State University, where the next generation of manufacturing managers is being trained by making real products. And the center offers a variety of consulting services, like the outreach program in Youngstown.
Though Great Lakes is one of seven similar, federally financed regional centers around the nation, it is by most accounts the most fully developed. And NIST officials consider it a model of what the Clinton Administration's technology program should be doing throughout the country. The other regional centers are in Albany; Columbia, S.C.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Overland Park, Kan.; Torrance, Calif, and Minneapolis.
Institutionally, NIST has a lot riding on the program's success. Currently, the agency has a budget of just $18 million a year for its seven centers. But the Administration is backing legislation that would earmark $186 million in the next fiscal year for such manufacturing technological assistance. Beyond that money, NIST is also hoping to administer another $100 million or so in Defense Department funds intended to help military contractors convert their operations to civilian products.
The House of Representatives passed legislation on May 19 authorizing the NIST spending as part of a two-year, $1.5 billion effort to improve the competitivness of American companies. Action by the Senate is expected this summer.
If passed by Congress, the spending for technological assistance would begin to help American manufacturers match their competitors in Japan and Europe, where help from the Government is a way of life. According to Philip Shapira, an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has studied technology programs, the Japanese spend about $745 million annually supporting 170 public technology centers.
While the United States has excelled in developing new technology, he said, "U.S. companies have been rather less successful in applying and commercializing those technologies."
 
Plans for Nationwide System
 Philip Nanzetta, a mathematician who heads NIST's efforts to assist manufacturers, said a fully developed nationwide system would include about 30 large manufacturing technology centers, like the one in Cleveland, and about 100 outreach centers, like the one in Youngstown.
"I think it can be done over a four-year period," he said. "We can open four to six M.T.C.'s a year and 20 to 25 outreach centers."
This vision for a national network to systematically transfer such expertise as the ISO quality standards and other technology and management methods to small and medium-size manufacturers comes after a decade of study and experimentation, largely at the state level. In the early 1980's, as it became clear that American manufacturers were losing to overseas competitors because of higher costs and lower-quality products and services, states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan established assistance programs.
In general, the approach was to tap the technical expertise available at state universities and community colleges and find a way to apply it to smaller companies lacking the time or money to send people back to school or hire private consultants. Great Lakes was supported by Ohio's Thomas Edison technology-assistance program and private financing before adding NIST support in 1989.
Because of this local orientation, each center has adapted to the economy of its area, rather than impose a uniform model. Youngstown, for example, lays claim to being the aluminum extrusion capital of the country. Thus the outreach office here has formed an organization of extrusion companies and the tool and die makers that are their parts suppliers.
 
Simple Additions, Big Benefits
 The goal is to meet manufacturing challenges they face in common, such as predicting how dies will perform. The center also hired an engineer, Yean-Jenq Huang, to build a computer model of what actually happens in an extrusion press.
This simple addition proved beneficial.General Extrusions was making a part by ramming aluminum through a die at 24 inches a minute, which company executives believed was about the right speed. But after Dr. Huang ran some calculations through his computer model, officials realized they could increase the feed rate to 48 inches a minute, doubling the machine's capacity.
"That is what we are here to do -- take current technology and transfer it to the people who need it," Mr. Coast said. "It is no good sitting there. We have to get it out on the shop floor."
Mr. Nanzetta said the system in Ohio -- a manufacturing technology center in a major city, with satellite outreach offices in smaller cities and towns -- was the model NIST would develop throughout the nation. NIST hopes eventually to link all of the regional and satellite centers over the proposed national data highway of optical fibers that is also part of the Administration's technology vision.
Mr. Nanzetta also said that the Government's national laboratories, traditionally the province of the Defense and Energy Departments, would be pulled into the system, so equipment and technology developed for military purposes could be made available for the civilian economy.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Block Efforts To Alter Clinton's Budget Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, June 25

 BODY:
Democrats held ranks in the Senate Thursday and early today in the face of solid Republican opposition and defeated all Republican efforts to change a five-year budget package that follows President Clinton's approach in most important respects.
The measure, the subject of one of the most belligerently partisan debates of any major legislation in years, is the most crucial bill of the year to the President. 
 The next step after the Senate is a conference with the House, which passed its deficit-reduction bill last month. The final version is expected to be voted on late next month or in early August.
 
Tax on Affluent Retained
 Unlike the House, which diverged from the Clinton prescription only on the margins, the Senate version replaces the President's proposal for a broad tax on all forms of energy with a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. The Senate version also includes somewhat stricter limits on Medicare spending and does not have some tax breaks for small business that the President and the House favor.
But the central feature of the President's plan, a steep tax increase for the most affluent Americans, remains in the Senate proposal.
The White House strategy was to take a hands-off approach to the Senate bill, hoping to get it through the Senate bottleneck to the conference committee, where the Administration plans to participate actively in writing the final legislation.
 
Party-Line Votes
 All day Thursday and into the early morning hours today, Senators trooped into the Capitol to cast one party-line vote after another. Senators Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, are ill and did not participate. Of the 98 remaining Senators, Democrats hold a majority of 55 to 43. They were able to win the tough votes but not by much.
First thing Thursday morning, the Senate rejected, 50 to 48, a Republican effort to block the increased gasoline tax. Five Democrats defected. Vice President Al Gore came to preside lest his vote be needed to break a tie.
In another cliffhanger, the Senate voted, 51 to 46, to kill a Republican amendment to prevent an increase in taxes on the Social Security benefits of middle- and upper-income retirees.
During the debate, the Democrats accused the Republicans of partisan tunnel vision. "If President Clinton tomorrow sent a bill up here to praise apple pie and motherhood," declared George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, "I predict to you that the Republicans would offer an amendment that says apple pie is evil and motherhood is insidious."
But Republicans maintained that the Democrats had excluded them from drafting the bill and asserted that the Democrats should not be surprised if they voted against it.
"We were just plain left out," said John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee. Over the years, Senator Chafee has often found common ground with the Democrats, but not now.
At a photo session at the White House on Thursday afternoon, President Clinton said he hoped the go-it-alone partisanship would come to an end. "It's just rare in these first tough budget votes to get any votes from the other party," he said. "I hope this will never happen again."
Over all, the measure is expected to cut the deficit by nearly $350 billion over five years. An additional $100 billion is expected to be eliminated from the deficit by appropriations bills to be enacted later this year. Counting more than $50 billion in lower interest payments resulting from the smaller deficit, the total five-year deficit reduction should be slightly more than $500 billion.
This would be more or less evenly divided between tax increases and spending reductions. But most of the tax increases would be put into effect this year and next, while most of the spending cuts would not come until 1997 and 1998.
 
Tax on Wealth
 The Administration calculates that two-thirds of the tax increases in the legislation would be borne by taxpayers with annual incomes above $200,000 and that more than three-quarters would come from those with incomes above $100,000.
Families with incomes below $20,000 would end up with a tax cut. The tax increase to middle-class families would typically be no more than a few hundred dollars a year. But the additional tax to a family making $350,000 a year would average about $25,000.
As was the case in the House last month, every single Republican was against the legislation.
Most of the Democratic defectors are up for re-election next year. Among those who went with the Republicans on one vote or another, were Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Richard H. Bryan of Nevada.
"This bill is a bad deal for New Jersey," Senator Lautenberg said. "Every study I've seen indicates that New Jersey will get the short end of the stick, paying a relatively large share of the taxes collected and getting very little in return."
 
Vote at Last Moment

 The defectors tended to vary on different votes, leaving the impression that the Democratic leaders had arranged ahead of time to allow certain Senators to stray on certain votes, always retaining enough support for a majority.
Senator Lieberman, for example, joined the Republicans on the gasoline tax vote, but he did not cast his vote until the last moment when a Democratic victory was certain.
A Democratic majority for the legislation was clinched Thursday morning, when a group agreed to a compromise that would restrict the growth in Medicare spending by about $60 billion instead of the $69 billion the Finance Committee approved.
Although they lost on the crucial votes, the Republicans still had mischief up their sleeves. On the one hand, they attacked the Democrats as big spenders. On the other, the Republicans, taking advantage of arcane Senate budget rules requiring 60 votes to approve certain items, blocked Democratic measures that were intended to make it more difficult to increase spending in later years. The White House supports and the House approved the measures that were defeated.
Democrats maintained that the maneuver showed the Republicans were not genuinely concerned about lowering spending. But Senator Phil Gramm of Texas called these budget discipline measures "a teeny little fig leaf" aimed at "convincing the public that we're doing something we're just not doing."
 
Unidentified Targets
 On Wednesday night, the Senate rejected their proposal for deep but generally unspecified spending cuts without tax increases.
The opportunity to block the spending discipline measures will be available to Republicans again if the conference agreement with the House includes those provisions, and this could threaten the whole bill's prospects. Without the provision, the final bill could face trouble in the House, where the complete legislation passed by only a six-vote margin.
The debate reflected age-old differences in the philosophies of the two parties. Democrats generally favor the Government's active involvement in solving the nation's problems, a position that requires the Government to spend money raised by taxes.
Republicans would rely on the marketplace and believe higher taxes and more Government involvement merely worsens the problems.
 
Reflects 90's Politics
 But the debate also reflected the politics of the 1990's. Democrats feel they must stick together behind President Clinton to prove that when their party controls both the White House and Congress, they can get the economy and the country moving.
Republicans hope their low-taxes, small-Government approach is their passport back to the White House and to control of the Senate.
It was this partisan divide that led to the bitter debate this week.
Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, declared: "Republicans don't really oppose taxes. They just oppose rich people paying taxes."
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, said he was "deeply offended" by such assertions. The Democratic approach, he asserted, is "premised on the politics of envy."
"What is wrong with the people who create jobs in America?" he asked. "Why should they be singled out."

HEADLINE: SPECTER OF TERROR: The Links;
Suspect in Bomb Plot Linked To World Trade Center Blast

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, the 32-year-old Sudanese immigrant whom Federal authorities have placed at the center of a conspiracy to bomb the United Nations and other targets in New York City, confided to an F.B.I. informer that he had helped test the bomb for the World Trade Center blast in February, according to Federal officials.
That explosion, Mr. Siddig Ali was quoted in a Federal complaint as saying, was a message that "we can get you anytime." 
 Another suspect, Clement Rodney Hampton-El, described by the authorities as the leader of a violent faction of militant Muslims in Brooklyn, also told the informer that he too had participated in the preparations for the trade center explosion.
The statements were some of the many links that emerged yesterday between the latest eight suspects, the trade center defendants, the man charged with the 1990 killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Islamic fundamentalist cleric. Mr. Abdel Rahman, whose Jersey City apartment was searched for several hours yesterday, said last night that Mr. Siddig Ali had been his interpreter for the last six months.
 
'Beyond a Single Terror Cell'
 How close and substantive the links between the two bomb plots and the many Islamic figures would turn out to be remained unclear last night. But senior officials in the Clinton Administration said the latest arrests gave a new and broader dimension to what had until now been regarded as a narrow plot aimed at the World Trade Center.
"What this certainly shows is that the conspiracy in New York went beyond a single terror cell," said one Administration official.
Both the group of men arrested yesterday and the trade center suspects were assembling similar bombs, mainly composed of fertilizer, Federal officials said. The two groups also had a shared world of common associates, religious beliefs and causes.
A senior law-enforcement official said the conspirators were apparently planning to carry out the bombings on or near the Fourth of July as revenge for the upcoming trial of the trade center suspects.
Law-enforcement officials said several of the latest suspects were close to Mr. Abdel Rahman, a blind, self-exiled Egyptian who calls for the overthrow of that country's secular government.
Mr. Abdel Rahman had emerged before as a tantalizing figure to law-enforcement authorities. His militant preachings attracted some of the trade center defendants as well as El-Sayyid A. Nosair, an Egyptian who was convicted on lesser charges related to the Kahane killing. But the authorities had never called him a suspect or even questioned him.
 
Apartment Searched
 For the first time yesterday, however, Federal agents searched his spare Jersey City apartment on Fairview Avenue, using the sheik's connection to Mr. Siddig Ali and other reported conspirators to obtain a search warrant. "I know that some of these individuals know him and they've allegedly met in various functions in the past," said James Esposito, the head of the F.B.I. in Newark. "The depth of that relationship I wouldn't comment on any further."
At a news conference announcing the arrests of the eight men, James M. Fox, the head of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that "at this time, we have no plans to arrest the sheik." But hours later, after the search of the sheik's apartment, a senior law-enforcement official said that "significant documents" were found and that Attorney General Janet Reno would have to make the decision about how agents would proceed with the cleric. The official did not elaborate.
 
Forced Their Way In
 Mr. Abdel Rahman said at a news conference last night that the agents broke down his door, and later told him they had seized papers, books and tapes. "I did not do anything to break American law," the Egyptian insisted, speaking through a new interprter who kept a cloth over his head to hide his features. "I have absolutely nothing to do with what happened," Mr. Abdel Rahman said.
Of Mr. Siddig Ali, Mr. Abdel Rahman said, "I don't know anything about him, but he's a fine young man."
Religion appeared to be one of the closest ties between the eight men -- five of them from the Sudan -- who were arrested in the raids.
A senior law-enforcement official said the group was essentially made up of two factions: five of the men who were arrested in Queens, headed by Mr. Siddig Ali, and three others headed by Mr. Hampton-El. The official said that Mr. Hampton-El, who was said to have been planning assassination attempts, was believed to be the leader of a particularly violent Muslim faction in Brooklyn that is suspected of several killings over the last year.
Six of the men, including Mr. Siddig Ali, worshiped at the Al-Salam mosque in Jersey City, where Mr. Abdel Rahman preached his incendiary brand of Islamic fundamentalism. Several of the Middle Eastern immigrants charged in the trade center explosion had also worshiped there.
 
'Religious Activist'
 "Most of the time they come here," said a member of the walk-up mosque who refused to give his name. "They sit together once a week in one of the houses belonging to one of them and they recite the Koran. But there's never any political involvement."
But he singled out Mr. Siddig Ali, an unemployed immigrant, as a "religious acitivist who's outspoken." It was Mr. Siddig Ali, fluent in both English and Arabic, who had acted as a translator for Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer who had visited the Al-Salam mosque in April to lecture the Muslims on their rights and responsibilities when approached by the F.B.I. "He introduced himself and said he would be translating for me," said Mr. Kuby, a law partner of William M. Kunstler.
Mr. Kunstler, who represented Mr. Siddig Ali at a hearing yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the Sudanese immigrant had also been a constant presence at the trial of Mr. Nosair. And law-enforcement officials said that several of the men arrested had connections to Mr. Nosair.
Most recently, the six men who attended the al-Salam mosque had taken up the cause of the World Trade Center suspects, trying to collect money for them, according to the member of the mosque. And a senior law-enforcement official said the motive behind the other bombing scheme was revenge for the trial of the trade center suspects, now scheduled for September.

HEADLINE: Yale Professor Is Injured by Blast; Mail Bomb Tied to Terror in 70's

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
A prominent computer science professor at Yale University was critically injured yesterday by a mail bomb that Federal officials said marked the re-emergence of a mysterious bomber who terrorized campuses and high- technology companies around the country in the 1970's and 80's.
The package exploded shortly after 8 A.M. at the computer science center at Yale in New Haven. The authorities said they believed it had come from the same person who sent a bomb to a professor at the University of California at San Francisco on Tuesday and who has sent 12 other similar packages since 1978.
 
A Group Called 'FC'
 Scores of law-enforcement officials have tried for years to track down the bomber, whom they called Unibom, for University Bomber. The authorities have never been able to establish a motive or precise pattern to the bombings, but officials said yesterday that the bomber's distinct signature was clear from the material used to make the bombs. They also made the connection to the earlier incidents from a letter received yesterday by The New York Times. 
 The letter, which was postmarked June 21 from Sacramento, Calif., warns of "a newsworthy event" and identifies its author as "a group calling ourselves FC." It promises to "give information about our goal at some future time." The authorities said the bomber had previously identified himself as FC.
William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said this evening that the agency had sent a message by computer network to most universities to be on the alert for suspicious packages. At a news conference in San Francisco, Mr. Sessions said professors should be particularly cautious about any packages with excessive postage, incorrect titles, misspellings of common words or no return address.
The bomb yesterday went off in the hands of David Gelernter, the 38-year-old director of undergraduate studies in computer science at Yale. Moments after the bomb exploded, ripping off his shirt, he ran from his fifth-floor office at Yale's computer science center building to a health clinic a block away, leaving a trail of blood. Witnesses said they could hear the explosion throughout the building.
 
Professor Undergoes Surgery
 Professor Gelernter's condition was upgraded from critical to serious yesterday afternoon after surgery at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. He suffered severe wounds to his abdomen, chest, face and hands.
Mr. Gelernter, who had studied to become a rabbi, is best known for inventing an innovative computer programming language he named Linda, after the pornography star Linda Lovelace. It has attracted a wide following in both the scientific world and for its commercial applications in publishing and computer animation. He has also expressed a strong commitment to applying computer technology to a wide array of social and economic problems.
Officials said that after the bombing, the switchboard at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven received a call from someone who said, "You are next."
Professor Gelernter's brother, Joel, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Yale Medical School, works at the medical center, but Assistant Chief Dean Eserman of the New Haven police said the authorities did not know if the bombing and the phone threat were related.
Joel Gelernter is also a specialist in genetics, and last night the authorities said they did not know if threats to him were also connected to Tuesday's bombing in California, whose victim was a geneticist.
That victim was Charles Epstein, who lost several fingers and suffered a broken arm and severe abdominal injures when he opened a padded brown envelope at his home in Tiburon, near San Francisco. Dr. Epstein, 59, continued recuperating yesterday. He is widely known for his research into Down syndrome and other genetic conditions and heads the university' division of medical genetics.
 
String Dating to 1978
 Law-enforcement officials said yesterday that they believed the mail bombs were the latest in a series of deadly parcels that have been mailed or placed by the bomber since May 26, 1978. The bombs have injured 21 people and killed one, Campbell Scrutton, the owner of a Sacramento computer shop, on Dec. 11, 1985.
While the bombs apparently have been sent mostly to people who workedextensively with computers and in high-tech fields, investigators have been at a loss to establish a more concrete pattern and motive. Some of the packages were addressed to a particular person, but others were left in parking lots or on doorsteps. The bomber has occasionally sent letters advising intended victims that packages would soon be arriving.
Three Federal agencies and scores of local law-enforcement officials have spent years trying to track down the bomber, who is also believed to have been behind bombings at universities in California, Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee and Utah. In 1980, he sent a bomb to the Lake Forest, Ill., home of Percy A. Wood, president of United Airlines, cutting and burning his hands and face. The bomb was planted inside a novel, "Ice Breakers."
 
Wide-Ranging Inquiry
 The bomber also mailed an explosive device in 1985 to the Boeing Aircraft Company plant in Auburn, Wash. It did not injure anyone.
The authorities say the bombs have become progressively more complex over the years and they tend to be meticulously constructed of common materials like fishing line, string, nails and wrapping paper. The shards in each explosion have been similar enough to lead investigators to conclude that they came from the same person.
In an attempt to crack the case, the authorities have held conferences over the years about the bomber and have combed through thousands of names supplied by victims. The case has been jointly handled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Postal Service.
Officials say the biggest break in the long-running investigation came on Feb. 20, 1987, when the bomber placed his 12th bomb, the last once before this week. It was in a burlap bag in a parking lot of CAAMS Inc., a computer sales and service company in Salt Lake City. When Gary Wright, an employee of CAAMS, tried to move it, it exploded and he received fragmentation wounds to his leg, hand, arms, throat and face.
But before the bomb went off, the authorities say a witness observed a white man putting the device between two parked cars. He was described at the time as between 25 and 30 years old, around 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall, and weighing 165 pounds, with reddish-blond hair, a thin mustache and a ruddy complexion.
The authorities say the bomber's first attack, in 1978, was in a technology building at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. A security guard was injured in that incident. A year later, a graduate student at Northwestern's Chicago campus was burned when he opened a cigar box containing an explosive device.
On Nov. 15, 1985, a bomb exploded at the Ann Arbor home of James McConnell, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan. The blast injured a research assistant who opened the textbook-sized package. The parcel was addressed to Professor McConnell and was postmarked in Salt Lake City.
Altogether, 12 of 14 bombs that the authorities say were sent by the bomber have exploded and in all but one of those instances someone has been hurt. The most damaging explosion occurred on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Washington in November 1979, when a bomb exploded in the airplane's cargo section. The plane made an emergency landing and 12 passengers suffered smoke inhalation.
The letter sent to The Times, which investigators say came from the bomber, said:
"We are an anarchist group calling ourselves FC. Notice that the postmark on this envelope precedes a newsworthy event that will happen about the time you receive this letter, if nothing goes wrong. This will prove that we knew about the event in advance, so our claim of responsibility is truthful. Ask the FBI about FC. They have heard of us. We will give information about our goals at some future time. Right now we only want to establish our identity and provide an identifying number that will ensure the authenticity of any future communications from us. Keep this number secret so that no one else can pretend to speak in our name."
It then gives a nine-digit number.
There was a feeling of nervousness at Yale yesterday as postal workers on the campus and in New Haven checked for suspicious packages. The newly named president of the university, Richard C. Levin, met with faculty members to reassure them about security.
"There is concern on campus," said Sheila Wellington, secretary of Yale University. "But there does not appear to be fear. There is nothing approaching a crisis circumstance."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Jump by 8,000

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits jumped by 8,000 last week, to the highest level in nine weeks, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 353,000, up from a revised 345,000 for the week that ended on June 12. Claims for the previous week were originally estimated to be 344,000. 
 It was the largest increase since 9,000 new claims were filed for the week that ended on May 29. It raised the total to the highest level since 356,000 claims were filed in the week ended April 17.
Many economists had predicted before the report that claims would edge up by just 1,000.
The less-volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts prefer to track because it more accurately reflects the labor situation, rose 3,750, to the highest level in two months.

Yen Strategy: What the U.S. Is Expecting

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, June 24 -- When the Japanese yen soared against the dollar in the mid-1980's, it put only a minor dent in Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States.
But the Clinton Administration -- and many economists -- are confident that this time the yen's recent rise will prove far more successful in cutting Japan's bulging trade surplus. 
 To chop away at Japan's surplus, the Administration has embraced a three-part approach that includes not only a strong yen but also wiping away trade barriers and pushing Japan to stimulate its economy and consumption. Administration officials say it is important for all three parts to work together, although they acknowledge that Japan's political crisis could weaken the yen and might make it harder to persuade Tokyo to take further steps to reduce the surplus.
Although the Administration denies that it has deliberately sought to push up the Japanese currency, the yen, egged on by comments from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and others, has soared almost 14 percent against the dollar, from 126 yen to the dollar early this year to 108.70 yen in New York today. [Page D14.]
Administration officials and many economists point to several reasons why the strong yen should push the America's $50 billion trade deficit with Japan down more rapidly than in the past.
Japanese companies, plagued by recession at home, now often have razor-thin profit margins, so when the yen rises, they feel immense pressure to pass that on quickly by raising their prices. An example: Japanese car makers have raised the sticker price on their exports to America by about 10 percent in slightly more than a year.
By contrast, in 1985, Japanese companies, helped by thriving sales at home, swallowed -- and were able to swallow -- much of the currency swing in order to hold on to market share.
"The effects of the exchange-rate changes will be quicker than before because Japanese companies are not in a position to absorb the exchange-rate change," said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 
Other Reasons Cited
 Another reason why a faster reaction is expected this time is that American companies are more competitive now, giving American consumers less incentive to buy Japanese, no matter what the price. Probably the best evidence of this is the resurgence of American auto makers, chip manufacturers, and laptop computer makers -- all of whom have gobbled up some Japanese market share this year.
And Japan is in a slump, so when its economy snaps back, Japanese consumers and companies will have more money to spend, and as a result will buy more imported goods. Thus Japan's recovery should naturally make a dent in the trade surplus.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, argues that the stronger yen will cut Japan's surplus in another way: Since a mighty yen will slow Japan's economic growth by hurting its exports, "the stronger yen substantially increases pressure on the Japanese Government to do a large, new economic stimulus package."
Under intense pressure from Washington, Japan has announced a $116 billion stimulus package, its second since last summer, to help end its worst slump in two decades. But Mr. Bergsten says the stronger yen keeps the heat on Tokyo to offer yet another stimulus program. That would certainly further the Clinton Administration's goal of getting Japan's economy to grow through domestic consumption rather than exports.
 
Cutting Japan's Surplus
 William R. Cline, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, estimates that every 1 percentage point increase in the yen against all currencies will reduce Japan's surplus with the rest of the world -- expected to be $150 billion this year -- by $3 billion to $4 billion, but with a two-year lag.
Several economists estimate theat the yen's rise against most major currencies this year should ultimately cut Japan's worldwide trade surplus by at least $40 billion. Mr. Bergsten says the yen needs to rise to about 100 yen to the dollar to achieve the Clinton Administration's goal of cutting Japan's worldwide surplus in half as a percentage of gross domestic product.
After the yen soared against the dollar and many other currencies between 1985 and 1988, its global surplus dropped to 1.2 percent of its gross domestic product in 1990 from 4 percent in 1986. But Japan's surplus has soared back to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product because the yen weakened considerably against most major currencies from 1988 to 1991, helping make Japanese goods more attractive. Not surprisingly, Japanese exports rose so that by last month Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached its highest level in five-and-a-half years.
According to Mr. Cline's calculations, every 1 percent increase in the yen against the dollar should, within two years, cut Japan's trade surplus with the United States by about $1 billion from what it would otherwise be. Japan's stimulus program and President Clinton's campaign to topple Japanese trade barriers are expected to reduce it even more. In a new book, Mr. Bergsten and Marcus Noland, a Johns Hopkins economist, estimate that American companies would export $9 billion to $18 billion more a year to Japan if Tokyo removed all trade barriers.
Still, a minority of economists say all this talk about a sharp drop in America's trade deficit is wishful thinking. Some economists and Federal Reserve officials are dubious that the stronger yen will push down Japan's surplus, when the dollar's 50 percent plunge against the yen from 1985 to 1988 cut Japan's annual surplus with the United States by just $15 billion, leaving it well above $40 billion. And they worry that the stronger yen, by making Japanese goods more expensive for Americans, will push up inflation.
"If Detroit wasn't able to sell autos at 240 or 125 yen to the dollar, then 110 yen to the dollar isn't going to make a difference," said Scott Pardee, a former Federal Reserve official and chairman of Yamaichi International America, a Japanese brokerage house.
And David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York, said, "The rise of the yen will reduce Japan's surplus probably a lot less than many economic models would predict,"
One hurdle to a lower deficit, he said, is that the mix of products that American companies make is not so attractive to the Japanese, while the goods Japanese companies make are highly attractive to Americans.
Then, there is another problem. The yen's rise makes it cheaper for Japanese companies to move production to low-wage locales, like Taiwan or Thailand, whose currencies are closely tied to the dollar. Thus, while America's trade deficit with Japan may fall, its deficit with the smaller Asian tigers may soar, fueled by Japanese investment there. The upshot: the jobs the United States loses to Japan today may be lost to other Asian countries tomorrow.
If the Japanese are unhappy with the strong yen, then they have an easy way to push it back down, says Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All they have to do is reduce their trade barriers, making it easier for American companies to export. Then, Mr. Fischer said, financial markets would feel less need to push up the yen to chop away at Japan's trade surplus.
This gives the Japanese a choice that Clinton Administration officials love: accept a strong yen or sweep away some trade barriers.

HEADLINE: In Sarajevo, Silence Turns to Despair

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzego vina, June 24

 BODY:
While the Serbian guns that have blasted this city for more than a year have quieted, news reports about a peace plan that would partition Bosnia and Herzegovina have plunged many here into despair.
"Bosnia's partition is only a matter of days away," said Mustafa Spahic, a Muslim cleric, referring to the proposal by the Serbian and Croatian presidents, Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, to divide this country into Serbian, Croatian and Muslim territories. 
 Many of the Muslims in Sarajevo are convinced that the partition plan will lead to the annexation of the Serbian and Croatian states in Bosnia by Belgrade and Zagreb, leaving a landlocked Muslim state overflowing with refugees.
The plan, advanced last week at peace talks in Geneva, was received positively by Lord Owen, co-author of the international peace plan for Bosnia. He said that the Bosnian Muslims could expect no better deal, and President Clinton said he would welcome the plan if all sides agreed to it.
 
Consistently Opposed
 Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic, has consistently opposed partition, arguing that it rewards Serbian and Croatian aggression against an internationally recognized republic and the forcible uprooting of minority populations.
But Mr. Izetbegovic and Bosnia's Vice President, Ejup Ganic, the two most influential Muslims in the Government, were outvoted by the rest of Bosnia's ten-member collective leadership. As a result, a Serbian- and Croatian-dominated delegation is in Geneva, discussing the partition plan on behalf of a Government whose supporters are mostly Muslim.
After a year of hardship and military setbacks, the split in the collective leadership has further strained the Bosnian Government ideal of a multi-ethnic Bosnian state and has raised Muslim concerns that their interests may be trampled by their own representatives in Geneva.
"We are not deciding our own fate, and those who have taken it upon themselves to decide it are biased against us," said Sheik Mustafa Ceric, the top Islamic official in Sarajevo.
"If Christians were being massacred in any Islamic country like the Muslims are being killed here," Sheik Ceric said, "the world community would have quickly found the means to condemn the Muslims as fundamentalists, and fighters of a holy war, and things would be taken care of overnight. A Muslim's life is now worth the least on the world market."
"Bosnia's Muslims are the new Jews of Europe," said Mr. Spahic, the Muslim cleric. "But we have no America to lean on. We have no one to lean on."
Mr. Spahic said that the small Muslim country foreshadowed by the partition would lack any economic prospects. "Bosnia's Muslims will be scattered like fallen leaves in autumn," he said. "Everyone will eventually leave except the few who will survive in a kind of reservation, chopping wood and working in gardens.
"This is the first genocide to be committed under the protection of the United Nations," Mr. Spahic said. "This is the first world-class crime to be carried out like a football game before the eyes of the entire world on television. And it has not helped at all.
"The Serbs are doing the dirty work of dealing with Bosnia's Muslims for all of Europe," he said.
 
Editor Speaks Out
 Kemal Kurspahic, the editor of Oslobodjenje, Sarajevo's daily newspaper, said the West's failure to intervene had disappointed Muslims.
"Right when we thought the West was thinking seriously about taking decisive action, our hopes have been dashed," he said. "Nothing has taken its place except the concept of safe areas, which is not only recognition of Serbian conquest but also capitulation by the West.
"As a consequence," the editor said, "there will be a new cycle of violence and ethnic cleansing, because exclusively Croatian and Muslim states in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be created without ethnic cleansing like that which we have seen in Serb areas so far.
"The international community had three reasons to intervene in Bosnia," Mr. Kurspahic said. "First, there was a moral imperative raised by the genocide, the concentration camps, the rape, the mass murder. Second came the 'new world order.' If a new world order exists, then the West had to act. If not, then the West must stop claiming to act as a defender of human rights. Third, a failure to intervene has given a signal to other potential aggressors."
"By all measures of human suffering, there were more reasons to intervene in Bosnia in '92 than in Kuwait in '91," he said.
"We've never asked anyone to come here and fight for us," Sheik Ceric said. "We will fight to the last drop of our blood, but we do not want our hands to be tied."
 
Balkan Update
 In GENEVA, 7 members of the Bosnian Government's 10-member collective leadership declared yesterday that they constituted the country's legitimate Government.
In VIENNA, the human rights conference rejected a Serbian-Croatian peace plan that would partition Bosnia and called for the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslim forces. The UNITED STATES and most of the countries in EUROPE abstained in a vote of 88 in favor, with only RUSSIA voting against and 54 nations abstaining.
In SARAJEVO, Gen. Philippe Morillon of FRANCE, commander of the peacekeeping force in BOSNIA for more than 16 months, confirmed that he would soon end his assignment.

HEADLINE: Big Powers' Free-Trade Talks Stall

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 24

 BODY:
The leading industrial nations failed today to agree on how to liberalize trade, dealing a setback to hopes of successfully completing negotiations for a comprehensive global accord late in the year.
Trade ministers from the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Community had hoped to forge an ambitious agreement in a two-day session here that would reduce tariffs and other barriers on hundreds of products, with the intention of announcing the accord at the economic summit meeting here next month of the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
 That agreement would then have been presented to the rest of the world as a basis on which to revive the worldwide talks under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Plans Fall Apart
 But after what was described as an intense meeting marked by sharp disputes, the trade ministers remained far apart in several significant areas.
"There is a considerable amount of work still to be done between now and the G-7," Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's Commissioner for External Economic Relations, said at a news conference after the meeting.
The biggest disagreements seemed to have been between the United States and Europe over American barriers on textiles and shipping, and European restrictions on foreign television programming and electronics.
"An outside observer could have sat in that meeting for half an hour and come to the conclusion that this was a hopeless situation," said a senior American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But then, heated disputes were to be expected as the negotiations came down to the most contentious items, he remarked.
 
The Rhythm of Negotiations
 The trade ministers said they still thought an agreement could be reached by the summit meeting, which starts on July 7.
"I have never been in a negotiation that ended before it had to," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "I don't believe it's either surprising or disturbing that we did not reach a full agreement here."
But privately, some officials said it would be difficult to develop as far-reaching a package of market-access measures as they had anticipated. And without a broad package, it will be hard to coax the 100 or so other members of GATT to complete the seven-year-long "Uruguay round" talks by the end of the year.
The negotiations are going on at a time when much of the world remains mired in recession and pressure for protecting markets seems to be growing. Many economists believe that a successful conclusion to the talks is necessary to kindle economic growth.
The mood at the meetings on Wednesday and today was in contrast to optimism expressed after similar talks in Paris at the beginning of the month.
The ministers agreed not to talk publicly about the specifics of this week's negotiations. But some officials said the biggest flare-up came over textiles.
The European Community has been asking the United States to cut tariffs that in some cases exceed 30 percent on fabric and finished clothing. It argues that such duties deter European exports of wool suits and knitted goods and also hurt the economies of poorer countries, some of which depend on textile exports.
The United States maintains that it is already a big textile importer, and that other GATT proposals already contain sufficient liberalization of textile trade.
The Europeans then began to pull back on offers to reduce barriers in some other areas. "That led the meetings downward to a much lower level of ambition," a European official said. But then "we realized we were looking at a much smaller package than anyone wanted," he added, and "we had a radical rethinking overnight."
 
An Interim Recovery
 In the morning, the trade ministers ushered their aides out of the room and met themselves for two and a half hours. "We brought it back from the really low point," the official said.
Big disagreements remain on other fronts. The Europeans want the United States to loosen restrictions on foreign shipping lines. The United States and Japan want Europe to lower tariffs on computer semiconductors and consumer electronics. They are also asking the Europeans to lighten their limits on foreign television programs, something that France in particular says it needs to preserve its cultural identity.
Japan, which has the world's largest trade surplus, has not offered what others view as acceptable proposals for reducing its tariffs on wood and wood products, liquor, leather goods and processed food. The Japanese did win plaudits with some concessions on financial services, agreeing to make it easier for foreign investment advisers to manage Japanese pension funds.
In an effort to secure agreement, the trade ministers have decided to meet in Tokyo on July 6, the day before the summit meeting opens, to complete a report to be presented to the top leaders. Until then, lower-ranking officials will meet intensively in an effort to resolve differences.

HEADLINE: Virginia Voters to Referee Feud of Robb and Wilder

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Taking one of the nation's nastiest political feuds to the voters, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia announced today that he would oppose Senator Charles S. Robb for the Democratic Senate nomination next year.
Mr. Wilder's candidacy is certain to add fuel to a long-running, highly public battle between the state's two leading Democrats and draw further attention to a Senate race in which Oliver L. North, who became a national figure virtually overnight as a result of the Iran-contra affair, is expected to seek the Republican nomination. 
 Mr. Wilder, who announced his "clear and pretty unequivocal" intentions at the taping here today of "Lead Story," a program on the Black Entertainment Television cable network, wasted no time in assailing Mr. Robb.Although he never uttered the Senator's name, he was clearly referring to Mr. Robb when he said that "character has to be part of" the campaign.
 
Dispute Over Eavesdropping
 Both men have suffered politically for their roles in one of the most drawn- out brawls in American politics. In one of their most recent disputes, Mr. Robb was accused of being involved in an eavesdropping plot against Mr. Wilder. Although official investigations cleared the Senator himself, three of his aides were convicted of distributing an illegally recorded tape in which Mr. Wilder discussed the antagonism between himself and the Senator.
The Governor has also come under attack for his role in the feud and once was led to apologize for "misleading" the press and the public about whether he had ordered a police investigation into reports that Robb aides had threatened people who were telling reporters about rumors of drug use and womanizing by the Senator.
"There's no question but that Wilder's primary motivation is to insure that Chuck Robb should not be re-elected," Thomas R. Morris, the president of Emory & Henry College in southwestern Virginia, said of Mr. Wilder's announcement today. "It will be a difficult task for him to deny the nomination to the incumbent, even though Robb is politically damaged goods."
 
'Virginia Needs Better'
 Mr. Wilder said repeatedly today that he could not cite accomplishments by Mr. Robb after more than four years in the Senate. "Name three things he has done," the Governor said. "I don't know of any. Virginia needs better than that."
Declining to respond directly to the challenge, Mr. Robb issued a statement suggesting that discussion of next year's campaign was premature.
"The 1994 Senate race will be here soon enough," he said. "Until then, we owe it to our state and party to keep our focus on the upcoming race for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. In the interim, we need to concentrate on deficit reduction, health care reform, defense down-sizing and creating enough jobs to reinvigorate our economy."
Mr. Wilder, whose term as Governor ends in January and who by law cannot run for a second consecutive term, had hinted for months about seeking Mr. Robb's seat. But his announcement today left some Democrats fretting that he would divide the party and risk the loss of that seat to the Republicans.
Recent polls have given Mr. Robb an edge over Mr. Wilder in a one-on-one matchup. But the Governor, whose popularity in Virginia has not fully recovered from his short-lived bid for the 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination, said he was confident that he could overtake Mr. Robb once a campaign begins.
 
Share Many Views
 Since the Governor and the Senator are both fiscal conservatives and share views on many issues, a number of analysts suggested that Mr. Wilder was being driven largely by a desire to strike out at his archrival.
Virginia Republicans said Mr. Wilder's decision would only help their party's nominee -- in all likelihood Mr. North, who has not yet announced his candidacy but has been traversing the state as if his campaign were already in full gear.
"I take some delight in their party's anguish," said Patrick M. McSweeney, the Republican state chairman. "There's no question that Doug Wilder's got a cast-iron stomach. He's one of the toughest campaigners I've ever seen. But because they share the same base, I can't see how this is going to do anything but tear them apart."
Many leading Democrats had urged Mr. Wilder not to run. And because of his limited support from them, there had been speculation that he would run as an independent, siphoning votes from both Mr. Robb and Mr. North.
But Mr. Wilder said today that he intended to run as a Democrat, telling reporters that "I have always felt that the Democratic Party was big enough" for both him and Mr. Robb. He disputed that he would be handing the election to Mr. North by dividing the vote with Mr. Robb, saying, "There are any number of voters who might not be enamored of Mr. North or the Senator."
Perhaps the most important question in the political equation for Mr. Wilder is how much loyalty he will retain from his base of black voters. In making his announcement on a black cable network program, which will be televised Sunday, he seemed to be seeking to shore up that support.
The Governor said he had used the program as his forum for scheduling reasons, since he is leaving the country this weekend and had promised to make his plans known by the end of June. But his press secretary, Glenn Davidson, asked reporters at the taping today to be sure to mention that Mr. Wilder's comments were at a black station.
Mr. Wilder said he would campaign on his successes in Virginia, including his winning passage of a gun control law fought by the National Rifle Association and his veto of a smokers' rights bill that tobacco interests had pressed through the Legislature.
 
Another Possible Challenge
 The developments in Virginia came on the same day that The Boston Globe reported the possibility of another intriguing match-up for 1994: that Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, was toying with the notion of challenging the state's senior Senator, Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat.
But Mr. Kennedy's office had no comment on the possibility, and Mr. Weld, who has long denied interest in the seat, insisted today that he was running for re-election next year.
"Some people had approached the Governor over the past couple of weeks and urged him to take a look at a run against Kennedy," said Virginia Buckingham, a spokeswoman for Mr. Weld. "But that's something he has decided he didn't want to do, and he does intend to seek re-election."

HEADLINE: U.S. SETS PENALTY FOR RUSSIAN FIRMS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The United States has imposed sanctions on Russian companies for selling missile technology in violation of international export controls, Clinton Administration officials said today.
But the sanctions have been waived until mid-July while Washington and Moscow make a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences. 
 The decision to impose the sanctions, which would bar American companies from doing business with the Russian companies, marks a further escalation in the dispute between Washington and Moscow over Russia's export of missile technology.
 
Visit Postponed
 The rift between the two sides was underscored today when Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia postponed his scheduled visit to the United States.
Mr. Chernomyrdin had planned to meet with Vice President Al Gore to conclude an accord on space cooperation. But reflecting its effort to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the Clinton Administration has linked the issue of space cooperation with Moscow's adherence to missile export guidelines. Until the two sides resolve their differences, Washington does not want to offer a share of the lucrative business of launching American commercial satellites or to let Russians share the work on the multi-billion-dollar space station.
American and Russian officials said the issue will be taken up when President Clinton meets with President Boris N. Yeltsin at the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Tokyo July 7 to 9.
 
A Last Chance
 That would give the leaders a last opportunity to solve the dispute.
Russia has not joined the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that restricts the sale of missile technology. But Russia has asserted that it is adhering to terms of the accord.
Despite this, American officials say the Russians have violated its terms by agreeing to sell rocket engine and missile production technology to India.
Other Russian actions have raised concern about Moscow's compliance with the agreement, including a recent Russian shipment of Russian chemicals, which American officials say was intended for Libya.
The sanctions are required by law once it has been determined that a company has violated the guidelines.
 
Seeking a Balance
 Nonetheless, there has been considerable discussion about the issue as Washington has sought to balance its commitment to stem the spread of dangerous weapons with its effort to help prop up Mr. Yeltsin's Government.
Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, declined to comment, saying the issue of Russia's missile exports were under discussion between Washington and Moscow.
It is unclear what effect the sanctions will have. One Administration specialist said that Mr. Chernomyrdin was beholden to Russian industrialists and that many of the industrialists favor the sales to prop up their companies.
 
A Compromise Offer
 The Clinton Administration has offered to tolerate part of Russia's sale of missile technology to India. The Russians would have to assure Washington it is strictly observing the missile control regime.
But officials in Russia's Foreign Trade Ministry said that the two sides have been unable to find a compromise, according to the Interfax news service in Moscow.
"Canceling the part of the transaction to which the United States objects would mean Russian subordination to America on space cooperation with third countries," Interfax said.

HEADLINE: San Pedro de Tiquina Journal;
Landlocked Navy's Dream Is to Go Down to Sea

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO DE TIQUINA, Bo livia

 BODY:
Senior officers here at Bolivia's largest naval base, tucked along a peninsula that juts into Lake Titicaca, admit they would prefer life on the high seas.
The mission of their 250 cadets, many of whom do not know how to swim, is to police the 150-mile length of the lake with five tiny patrol boats, hoping to catch the occasional Shining Path guerrilla passing by boat from Peru to Bolivia. 
 But the importance of San Pedro de Tiquina lies more in its symbolism. Just as the Argentines yearn for the return of the Falkland Islands, or the Malvinas as they call them, from Britain, Bolivians teach their children with religious zeal that one day they will return to the sea.
"We cannot forget what has been done to us," said Capt. Luis Aranda Granados as he gave a tour of the base. "A great part of our underdevelopment is because we lost our access to the sea. We had no water trade routes. But we will get it back. So now is the time to train for when we return to the sea."
 
The Lost Coastline
 Though Bolivia has lost large stretches of territory to all of its neighbors in separate wars, its one continuing complaint is with Chile.
In 1879, 500 Chilean troops overpowered 130 Bolivian troops, while the country was celebrating carnival, and seized 160 miles of coastline as well as vast deposits of copper and saltpeter.
Today there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and Bolivia continues to petition international groups to take up its cause against the much more affluent and influential Chile. Early in June the Bolivian Foreign Minister asked the Organization of American States at its annual meeting in Managua, Nicaragua, to press Chile to give Bolivia an exit to the sea. But the Chilean delegate said the case was closed.
"Chile continues with the capricious policy of keeping us closed in," Vice Adm. Miguel Alvarez Delgado, the Bolivian Navy commander, said. "We offer no threat militarily, but the Chilean military still believes in the Germanic theory of conquering the vital territory, of pushing into the heartland of the continent."
Meanwhile, Bolivia has tried a different way to the sea, through its northern neighbor Peru. Peru also lost coastline and mineral wealth to Chile, and the two countries still mistrust each other.
In May, the Peruvian Congress agreed to give Bolivia a free-trade zone in its southern port of Ilo. Along a three-mile stretch of coast, the Bolivian Government will be able to build a port, bring in goods free of import duties and transport them over paved roads all the way to La Paz with no Peruvian interference.
"We have broken the deadlock with Chile," Gustavo Fernandez Saavedra, the Minister of Government, said. "We no longer depend on them to get our goods to the Pacific. This will mean a diminishing of economic activity in northern Chile and an increased importance in southern Peru. It could change the balance of things enough to bring Chile to an agreement."
To be sure, the Ilo access for Bolivia does not mean the landlocked country will abandon its hopes of pressing Chile to give it at least some coastline.
The most obvious would be the stretch of no more than two miles between the northern Chilean city of Arica and the Peruvian border. But that territory was actually land Chile took from Peru, and Peru would have to renounce any future claims to it.
Bolivian officials say that the biggest obstacle is the Chilean military, led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator, and that very little can be done until the general steps down, which he does not have to do until 1998.
If anything that only fans the flames of nationalism in this country.
Every March 23, the country celebrates the Day of the Sea. Ten beauty queens are selected, one from each of the nine Bolivian departments and one named Miss Coastline.
In 1978, Bolivia founded the Bolivian Coastal Museum, in the heart of La Paz, which has little more then old maps of how Bolivia's coastline use to look. "A Pinochet general once said publicly that Bolivia never had a coastline, and so we started this museum as proof that was false," said Jaime Quispe, the museum manager.
The Bolivian Navy was founded in 1963 mainly to symbolize the country's hopes of regaining access to international waters. In addition to the San Pedro base, the navy patrols the many Amazon rivers.
"We know we are tiny, but we use the meager resources we have," said Admiral Alvarez, conceding that it might be years before he saw Bolivian Navy ships bobbing in salt water.
For now, officers here train their cadets, mostly young Aymara Indian men from surrounding villages, to develop other skills. Perhaps the most useful are learned in 15 hothouses at the base, where they grow tomatoes, beans, squash, cabbage, Swiss chard and other vegetables that otherwise cannot grow in the cold of the high Bolivian Andes.
"They take this knowledge back with them to their villages and it adds important vitamins often lacking in the Aymaran diet," Captain Aranda said.
"There are other advantages of having been here," he said. "They're guaranteed three meals a day, clothes and shelter for a year. Also, they go back home with such prestige that they can marry almost any girl in their village they want."

HEADLINE: Jet-Engine Workers Accept Harsh Reality

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., June 24

 BODY:
Having reluctantly agreed to a package of work-rule changes and wage concessions, unionized workers at Pratt & Whitney reported to work here today amid a sober recognition that they had lost an unwinnable battle with a company, and an industry, mired in recession.
The workers, faced with a virtual certainty that the jet-engine maker would move at least 2,000 jobs to lower-cost plants in Maine and Georgia, voted by a ratio of 4 to 3 on Wednesday to accept concessions that once would have been considered unthinkable: no wage increases for two years and up to $2 in hourly wage cuts if productivity does not improve.
 
An Incentive Package
 By accepting the Pratt & Whitney proposal, the workers put the final pieces in place for an unusual incentive package in which Connecticut will provide the company with $32 million in grants and tax breaks. 
 "If this deal had gone the other way, we would have been moving people out of Connecticut next week," said Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, whose jet engine market has been ravaged by the falloff in military spending and a downturn in the commercial airline industry.
The agreement "was the least of all evils," Hank Bielonyza, a maintenance mechanic here, said in an interview today. The company headquarters are at the East Hartford plant, one of the five Pratt & Whitney plants in the state.
Although he voted to accept the concessions, he wondered, "How do we know that the company won't still pick up and leave sometime soon?"
Pratt & Whitney, which has 17,200 employees in Connecticut, said its manufacturing costs in Connecticut soared in the 1980's and told both the union and state officials that it could save as much as $6 an hour per employee by transferring operations to plants in other states. The average Pratt & Whitney plant worker in Connecticut makes $15 an hour in wages plus $7.50 in fringe benefits.
"We have been deadly serious all along," Mr. Sullivan said. "This company is going to lower its costs."
Still, while the agreement on Wednesday may have been inevitable, some people worried about a possible precedent for other financially troubled companies.
"I am outraged," said John Olsen, president of the Connecticut chapter of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He said the concessions to Pratt & Whitney by the state and the union, District 91 of the International Association of Aerospace Workers, were "a form of extortion" that may now be attempted by other companies in Connecticut.
In accepting the Pratt & Whitney proposal, union workers agreed to a new contract, extending until December 1995, with no raises or cost-of-living adjustments. The workers also agreed to wage cuts of up to $2 an hour if they do not meet productivity objectives to be established by a committee of union and management representatives.
 
Work-Rule Changes
 Even more important to the company, Mr. Sullivan said, was that the union had agreed to work-rule changes that give managers greater freedom to assign workers to different shifts, machines or jobs.
In its agreement with the state, the company is to receive job-training grants and reductions in property and business taxes that it expects will amount to $32 million in the first year.
An important component of the state package is that the company will be rewarded with tax credits for investments in research and development in Connecticut.
 
Talking About the Future
 "Although our discussions with Pratt & Whitney have been wrenching, they are really about something bigger: the future of the aerospace industry in Connecticut," said Avice Meehan, a spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
Today, in a letter distributed to all Pratt & Whitney union workers here, Karl J. Krapek, company president, said that by agreeing to the plan, the workers had expressed faith in the future of our company.
Now, he said, the company would undertake a "significant redesign of our manufacturing, engineering and administrative processes."
Some analysts said the agreement to keep Pratt & Whitney from relocating may be a big victory for Connecticut.
"It's certainly a psychological victory," said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for the Shawmut National Bank of Hartford. "This could have been a terrible loss for Connecticut. Now, it's a worst case that didn't materialize."
But not everyone is feeling uplifted.
"It is, I suppose, something of a relief to have this behind us," said Norman Swanson, a parts inspector for 28 years in the East Hartford plant. Like Mr. Bielonyza, he voted to accept the concessions.
"But I'm not happy," he said. "I think the company blackmailed everybody they could."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Base Is Backed at New York's Expense

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
In a decision that helps New Jersey at New York's expense, a Presidential commission today rejected a Pentagon recommendation and voted to create a large East Coast troop-staging base at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and to close Plattsburgh Air Force Base in upstate New York.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin had recommended shrinking McGuire and Griffiss Air Force in Rome, N.Y., and moving many of their missions to Plattsburgh, making it the Air Force's main transportation hub for cargo, soldiers and refueling planes on the East Coast. 
 The Pentagon plan set off a fierce interstate competition, pitting politicians and communities from New York and New Jersey against each other. The commission decided that McGuire's proximity to other bases on the East Coast increased both its training and wartime value. During the Persian Gulf war the Air Force flew 15,000 flights from the base in Wrightstown, N.J.
As a result, McGuire will gain about 2,500 civilian and military jobs at Plattsburgh's expense. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission approved the Pentagon's plan to reduce strength at Griffiss, which will lose 1,200 civilian jobs and about 3,700 military employees.
 
Panel Shows Independence
 In its first two days of deliberations, the commission has demonstrated an independent streak. The panel has rejected or significantly modified 9 of the 14 Defense Department recommendations considered so far. In the 1991 round of base closings, the commission changed only four bases.
The commissioners also voted to keep Homestead Air Force Base in Florida open as a reserve base until the site, devastated last August by Hurricane Andrew, is rebuilt as a civilian airport.
Congress last year approved $76 million to help rebuild the base and aid the community. Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said today that it would take an additional $25 million to $50 million to build hangars for reservists flying rescue missions and refueling planes.
The panel's generosity, however, extended only so far. Commissioners reluctantly voted to close K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base in the sparsely populated northern Michigan peninsula. Military and community officials estimate that Sawyer's closing will cause unemployment in the area to rise steeply to 24 percent.
 
Final Recommendations
 The commission's final recommendations will go to President Clinton, who has until July 15 to approve or reject the entire package. If he approves, Mr. Clinton then forwards the package to Congress for approval or rejection. Given the pressure to cut military spending, approval appears almost certain.
In March, Secretary Aspin recommended closing or shrinking 43 major installations and 122 smaller sites. The commission later added 47 other major bases and 26 smaller sites for consideration.
On Wednesday, the first day of votes that will run through Sunday, the seven-member commission agreed to spare eight bases, reduce one, increase one and close one.
Commissioners today continued to ignore the Pentagon's recommendations. Against Mr. Aspin's wishes, commissioners reduced the Tooele Army Depot in Utah and kept open the Letterkenny Army Depot in Chambersburg, Pa., expanding it to perform tactical missile maintenance for all the armed services. The Letterkenny decision reflects the commissioners' desire to consolidate repair and maintenance work instead of having each service do its own.
Indeed, the commissioners seem to be relishing their roles as autonomous arbiters. The Air Force, for example, had wanted to close Homestead. But Jim Courter, the commission's chairman and a former Republican representative from New Jersey, said the panel's decision was "reasonable, affordable and makes sense."
"It's not what the Air Force wanted, but that hasn't stopped us," he said.
Today's deliberations delved heavily into technical issues like fuel hydrants, airport ramp space, runway lengths and air traffic congestion. While the commissioners -- who include retired military officers, former politicians and business executives -- all appeared well briefed on the maze of data, the panelists seemed to follow the lead today of Hansford T. Johnson, a commissioner who is a retired four-star Air Force general who headed the United States Transportation Command during the Persian Gulf war.
It was General Johnson who made the successful motion to make McGuire the East Coast transportation hub, instead of Plattsburgh. "McGuire's location was the determining factor," the general said.
New Jersey officials were of course jubilant. "This shows that if you have the facts on your side, you can save bases," said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey.
New York politicians, however, criticized the panel's rejection of the Pentagon's recommendation. "It goes without saying that this is a devastating blow that was totally unexpected," said Representative John M. McHugh, the New York Republican whose district includes Plattsburgh.
Commissioners face some of their most difficult decisions on Friday, when they begin voting on Navy installations and naval shipyards. Some of the fiercest opposition to base closings has come from Charleston, S.C., and the San Francisco Bay area, which stand to lose thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenues if the Pentagon's plan to close major ports in those areas is approved.

Map/Diagram: "What the Base Commission Decided"
 
The base closing commission decided the fate of a number of Air Force and Army installations yesterdya. Some bases had been recommended for closing or shringking by the Pentagon; the commission had added others. Later this week, the commission will begin voting on Navy and Marine installations.

HEADLINE: Americans' Incomes Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Americans' personal incomes grew a healthy six-tenths of 1 percent in May and would have increased even more if not for a decline in subsidy payments to farmers, the Government said today.
The increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.3 trillion, followed a paltry gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. 
 Both the April and May advances were held back by a decrease in farm subsidies. April incomes were helped by a rebound from the winter storm that hit the East Coast in mid-March. Excluding the special factors, incomes would have been up an even stronger eight-tenths of 1 percent in May and four-tenths of 1 percent in April.
Personal consumption spending, meanwhile, rose a slight two-tenths of a percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.29 trillion. But that followed a 1.2 percent surge in April.
Today's report fits with analysts' belief that the economy is starting to bounce back after a pronounced slowdown early this year.
The most-watched component of income -- wages and salaries -- rose a strong 1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.04 trillion after a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent in April.
Farm incomes were down in May. Transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, increased. Most of the gain came in Social Security checks.
Real disposable income -- inflation-adjusted income after taxes -- rose four-tenths of 1 percent in May after a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Yields Continue to Decline

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bond yields declined yesterday for the seveth consecutive day, putting the 30-year Treasury issue, with a closing yield of 6.73 percent, within striking distance of its 20-year-low yield set in mid-April.
There was no particular catalyst for yesterday's drop in bond yields, just a general sense among traders and investors that lower inflation and a sluggish economy have combined to create an era of good feeling about fixed income securities. 
 Of course, eras can be short-lived in the bond market, as shown by the market's quick retreat the previous time yields were near the current level. After reaching a price peak on April 15 of 105 7/32, to yield 6.72 percent, the 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 101 2/32, to yield 7.03 on May 21 after a spate of higher than expected inflation reports. In yesterday's trading, the 7 1/8 percent issue due in 2023 was offered late in the day at 105 1/32, up 1 1/32, to yield 6.73 percent, down from 6.76 percent on Wednesday.
Marshall B. Front, president of Stein Roe & Farnham Investment Counsel, a Chicago firm, said the markets' mood was upbeat "because people are still reacting to the muted inflation figures."
Apart from the decline in consumer prices reported last week for May, he noted that anecdotal reports from the United States and Europe "are that savage competition is making it very difficult for businesses to raise prices."
As for short-term interest rates, Mr. Front said he expects them to rise eventually "but with the economy limping along for now, the coming tax increases are likely to put enough drag on the economy that the Fed will have to think twice or even three times bfore raising rates."
 
Softer Economic Data
 William Sullivan, executive vice-president at Dean Witter Reynolds, noted that announcements this week of a drop in durable goods orders, a rise in unemployment claims and weak department store sales "have amounted to a steady drumbeat of somewhat softer economic data."
He said some investors and traders appear to be concluding that the June employment data could be weaker than expected. The June employment data to be announced on July 2 is expected to show an increase in nonfarm payrolls of 155,000 according to a survey by MMS International, a reseach firm.
In the Treasury note market yesterday, the new 4 1/8 percent two-year note was offered at 993 1/32, up 3/32, to yeild 4.14 percent, while the 5 1/8 percent issue due in five years was up 5/32, to 992 8/32, to yield 5.15 percent. Both issues are above the prices set at auctions earlier this week.
In the bill sector, the Treausry's new one-year issue auctioned yesterday sold with an average rate of 3.40 percent, down from 3.93 percent at the previous auction four weeks earlier.
Traders said prices of Treasury notes and bonds were benefiting from strong demand from investors and speculators looking ahead to the light supply of new issues in coming weeks. The next Treasury note offering is the regular monthly sale of a two-year issue in late July.
The paucity of Treasury offerings has led many investors to the corporate market, where yields are higher and the supply of new issues can be rapidly increased to satisfy demand.
The Stone Container Corporation acted quickly yesterday to raise $400 million in two transactions handled through Salomon Brothers. A $150 million issue of 12 5/8 percent senior notes due in 1998 with a junk-bond rating of B-1 by Moody's Investors Service, was offered at par. A companion $250 million issue of seven-year senior notes yielding 9 percent and convertible to common stock at $11.55 was privately placed. Stone is issuing the convertible notes without seeking shareholder approval. Its stock closed yesterday at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
A Slight Rise in Gold Prices Defies Consensus on a Trend

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices edged higher yesterday, but analysts differed on whether the slight gain was proof of the market's strength or a disappointing coda to a burst of buying on Wednesday.
On other commodity markets, silver futures slipped; grains and soybeans were mixed; crude oil futures rose, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Gold for August delivery rose 60 cents on the New York Commodity Exchange, to $376.10 an ounce; July silver slipped 0.3 cent, to $4.392 an ounce.
The action followed a gain of $5.80 in gold and a jump of 13.5 cents in silver on Wednesday, which analysts attributed to investment fund buying and inflation jitters.
Martin Reichenberg, the manager of trading services for Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J., said yesterday's performance proved "gold is still strong."
He said the market had cause to go down in light of profit-taking, stronger German bond prices and the weakness in the grain markets. Instead, it ended higher after weathering an early round of profit-taking.
 
'Disappointing' Performance
 He predicted August gold soon would return to $380 an ounce, a level it has not held since late May.
But Bernard Savaiko, a senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, called the metals' performance "kind of disappointing," and said gold would encounter substantial resistance in reaching $380.
Savaiko said gold's future course would depend on whether the Federal Reserve Board perceived enough of a threat from inflation to raise interest rates.
Wheat futures weakened on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Government announced new export subsidy offers that were at the low end of the expectations of traders. Corn and oat futures edged higher; soybeans ended narrowly mixed.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for August delivery rose 3 cents to $18.89 a barrel; July heating oil fell 0.11 cent to 51.96 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 54.75 cents a gallon, and August natural gas rose 7 cents to $2.159 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Advance Vs. Mark; Yen Strengthens

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar resumed its rally against the German mark yesterday, soaring past the important 1.7000-mark level after news that French and German finance officials would meet to discuss monetary policy.
The Japanese yen strengthened, however, on comments by an influential United States-based economist that the dollar should trade below 110 yen as a way to help curb Japan's global trade surplus. 
 The dollar rose in Europe early yesterday after the French Economics Minister, Edmond Alphandery, said he had expected Germany's central bank chief and finance minister to attend a French-German economic council today. The meeting was to discuss central bank interest rate policy.
The German Finance Ministry later announced that the meeting had been postponed for scheduling reasons. A new date was not immediately set.
 
 
Signal From Bundesbank
 But currency market participants took Germany's action as an expression of independence by the Bundesbank, which has remained steadfast in its policy of slow interest rate reductions despite international pressure for faster cuts.
"That was a clear signal that they weren't going to be pressured into an interest rate cut by the French," said David Gilmore, currency analyst with MCM Inc.
The development helped stem further dollar purchases for the day, capping the currency's gains at below the 1.7100-mark level in New York trading, Mr. Gilmore said.
In European trading, the dollar closed at 1.7110 German marks, up from 1.6930 late Wednesday. But in New York trading, the dollar rose to only 1.7070 marks from late Wednesday's 1.6913 marks.
 
 
Impact on Trade Gap
 The yen, meanwhile, strengthened on suggestions from C. Fred Bergsten, a Washington-based economist and former adviser to President Clinton, that the trade deficit with Japan could be curbed if the dollar remained below 110 yen.
In theory, a stronger yen would cut Japan's surplus by making Japanese imports more expensive and American goods cheaper in Japan.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 108.60 yen, down 1.97 yen from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 109.55 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 108.70 yen, down from late Wednesday's 109.05 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4675, from $1.4725 late Wednesday. By 4 P.M. in New York, the pound fetched $1.4690, less than late Wednesday's $1.4720.

Musical Chairs and Table
Pino Luongo is busy reshuffling the deck in his restaurant empire. The tenure of Marta Pulini as chef has just ended at Le Madri, 168 West 18th Street, and Gianni Scappin, who comes from the Venice region with a long resume, has replaced her.
Ms. Pulini has been named executive chef of the new uptown Barneys at Madison Avenue and 61st Street by Mr. Luongo, who has the food-management contract for the store. When it opens in the fall, the store will have Mad 61, a food complex on the lower level with an espresso bar, a wine bar, a retail food shop, a catering service, a cafe and a 100-seat restaurant. Mr. Luongo said he would like the restaurant to offer "Manhattan cuisine," an American-French-Italian fusion. The second floor will have the Chelsea Cafe, emphasizing salads, and on the ninth floor there will be a 50-seat American restaurant with a buffet. 
 Mr. Luongo is also preparing to install a Manhattan edition of Sapore di Mare, his restaurant in Wainscott, L.I., at the edge of East Hampton, into the plush space once occupied by Mondrian, 7 East 59th Street. He just closed another Sapore di Mare on St.-Barthelemy in the Caribbean after two seasons, deciding for economic reasons not to exercise an option to buy the Castelets resort where the restaurant was. A chef for the Manhattan restaurant has yet to be designated.
And at Mr. Luongo's Coco Pazzo, 23 East 74th Street, Mark Strausman, the chef, has left, hoping to open his own restaurant. Mr. Luongo has little patience for chefs who show such signs of independence. Cesare Casella, the chef and owner of the highly regarded Il Vipore restaurant in the Tuscan town of Lucca, is gradually taking charge of Coco Pazzo; he is spending 10 days a month in New York until October, when the job becomes full time. His family will continue to run Il Vipore through the winter, the slow season. A schedule like that could well justify the name of the 74th Street restaurant, which means crazy chef in Italian.
Meanwhile, Mr. Strausman, whose only firm commitment at the moment is to run a food festival in Baltimore for the all-star baseball game next month, has been negotiating to become a consultant for Il Cantinori, 32 East 10th Street. Il Cantinori just happens to be the place where Mr. Luongo began his New York restaurant career before going on to establish his near-flung empire.
 
Around the Country
 In November, Larry Forgione, the owner of An American Place, 2 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, will unveil an outpost called An American Place Harborside on 111th Street in North Miami, in the former Jockey Club overlooking Biscayne Bay. Also before the end of the year, Gilbert and Maguy Le Coze, the owners of Le Bernardin, 155 West 51 Street, plan to open a second edition of Brasserie Le Coze, their restaurant in Coconut Grove, Fla., in the Lenox Center in the Buckhead district of Atlanta.

'Front Page': Light News for the Small Screen

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The spirit of MTV strikes again! The youngish hosts, the flashy graphics, the with-it sounds, the smart-alecky tone stamp "Front Page" as a news magazine for people who grew up on television. This offering from Fox Broadcasting, which is not in the habit of straining attention spans, bops along on the line between information and entertainment. To judge by tomorrow night's sprightly debut, the latest television news magazine will cause no loss of sleep over Bosnia or health coverage.
Ron Reagan possibly apart, the program's regular reporters -- Andria Hall, Tony Harris, Vicki Liviakis and Josh Mankiewicz -- are not household names. But all are personable, energetic and younger than Mike Wallace and Barbara Walters. 
 Ms. Liviakis leads off the first show with a Hollywood expose. It appears that the Paramount producer Robert Evans and his partner, William J. MacDonald (the fiance of Sharon Stone, star of "Sliver," which they produced), have been involved with two operators who have been accused of bilking elderly investors. Glimpses of Ms. Stone are provided.
Ms. Hall follows with a story about plastic surgery on adolescents, notably a girl who went for a nose job and liposuction on her thighs. Unfortunately, the liposuction also shrank her breasts, so she had to go back for breast implants. Glimpses are provided of this young woman and of another, who sought to have her size 38DD bosom reduced.
There follows a brief discussion by the "Front Page" reporters on the propriety of high-priced surgeons' working on adolescents. Their moralizing may remind you of those reformers who used to visit brothels for the ostensible purpose of rescuing their inhabitants.
And finally, Mr. Reagan delivers an amusing report on a Utah man who has been prevented from developing his land because it is home to a rare snail. Interviewing an official of the Sierra Club about the ever-growing lists of endangered species, Mr. Reagan asks, "How many pearly mussels do we need?" The Sierra Club man says we need them all. There are glimpses of the snails, which Mr. Reagan describes as "reclusive, vegetarian and bisexual."
Between the reports, the reporters and several other commentators -- Mike Lupica of The New York Daily News, Chris Matthews of The San Francisco Examiner, Joe Bob Briggs, a syndicated columnist, and Lisa Birnbach, an editor of Spy magazine -- offer snappy comments to snappier graphics on this and that, with glimpses of this, that and the other.

'L.A. Behind Bars'
A&E, Friday at 9 P.M
Tonight's offering on "Investigative Reports" is a vivid look inside the Los Angeles County Central Prison, the world's biggest jail. Its 6,000 inmates are awaiting disposition of their cases, the charges against them ranging from murder to drug trafficking to traffic violations. One of the 165 unarmed deputies who are entrusted with keeping this uncommunal community under control says, "It's a very entertaining job."
You can watch the processing of newcomers, in chains, and, later, hear them complain about their mass-produced meals. Periodic cell searches find jail-made weapons and drugs, which keep making their way into the jail despite all precautions. (One prisoner gives a demonstration of how to make a shank, or weapon, suitable for slicing up someone who has looked at you the wrong way.)
The prisoners, who are segregated by what a guard calls life style (which means gang members in one section, homosexuals in another, "head problems" in still another) tell of the constant pressure to prove themselves as tough as the next inmate. "Eventually," one muscular recidivist says, "you're going to get got." By the end of the hour, you may be marveling that there isn't more getting got among men for whom violence seems to be a way of life, whichever side of the bars they happen to be on.

'Swords to Plowshares'
'The Price of Peace'
CNN, Sunday at 9 P.M.
What does New London County in Connecticut have in common with Nizhni Novgorod in Russia? The answer, available on this hourlong report, is plenty of trouble, owing to the end of the cold war. "Swords to Plowshares," reported by Frank Cesno in the United States and Miles O'Brien in Russia, focuses on closed plants, lost jobs and deep economic disarray in areas that prospered during the arms buildup of the 1980's.
Unfortunately, the information is delivered in bits and pieces, with too many interruptions and repetitions and too little coherent continuity. Mr. Cesno and Mr. O'Brien deserve sharper producers. But the point is effectively made. Although no American region can match Russia's difficulties, the former enemies have had to turn their attentions from their ideological struggle to a certain amount of cooperation in the struggle to pay what Mr. Cesno calls "the price of peace."

The Self Stays Strong Amid Shades Of Prejudice

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Kathe Sandler's documentary film "A Question of Color" begins with a sequence in which a group of black men and women of varying complexions recite many of the terms, from "high yellow" to "chocolate" to "blue-black," that are used to describe differences in skin tone. From this formal opening, the film plunges bravely into the ticklish subject of color consciousness among blacks.
What it finds is the prevalence of a subtle caste system in which those whose looks come closest to approximating white European standards of attractiveness tend to fare better in American society than those who look more African. It also finds that the tensions generated by this system, which is really an internalized expression of white racism, leave almost everybody feeling insecure. While those who are darker skinned are made to feel less desirable as mates and tend not to do as well economically, light-skinned blacks can find themselves accused of being pretenders to their African heritage. 
 For a film dealing with such a loaded subject, "A Question of Color," which opened yesterday at Film Forum 1 on a double bill with Marlon Riggs's "No Regret," is remarkably evenhanded and free of rhetoric. The film, which includes interviews with everyone from urban teen-agers to a 96-year-old woman in rural Alabama, also puts the issue into historical perspective. Dr. Benjamin Payton, the president of Tuskegee Institute, talks about the days of slavery, when a slave owner could have any woman he wanted and how the interracial sex resulted in a rainbow of skin tones.
The only moment in American history when that white-oriented color consciousness among blacks seemed to be crumbling, the film says, was in the 1960's when the black-consciousness movement, with its slogan "black is beautiful," prompted millions to adopt the Afro hairstyle. For Ms. Sandler, the white reaction against that movement is symbolized by the pressure brought against a television anchor, Melba Tolliver, who risked losing her job for wearing an Afro.
The movement's sense of exhilaration was short-lived. As the political pendulum swung toward the right, the old values were re-entrenched.
The film has an intriguing personal footnote. In 1977, after Ms. Sandler, who is light-skinned, was photographed with her mother on the cover of a mother-daughter issue of Essence magazine, she says, the publication was deluged with letters complaining that it had put a white woman on the cover. She goes on to reflect sadly on why she, and not her darker-skinned sister, was chosen for the cover.
In "No Regret," whose subtitle, "Non, Je ne Regrette Rien," is the name of one of Edith Piaf's signature songs, Mr. Riggs interviews five black gay men who are H.I.V.-positive. His subjects -- Michael Lee, Joseph Long, Assoto Saint, Reggie Williams and Donald Woods -- are all courageous, articulate advocates for personal disclosure about both their homosexuality and their H.I.V. status.
Among the issues touched on are how to break the news to a parent, whether to continue to have sex and how to maintain morale in a society that attaches a moral stigma to AIDS.
Of the five, Mr. Long may have had the most difficult journey toward disclosure. A devout churchgoer and recovering alcoholic who led a sexually closeted existence for 40 years, he has become an AIDS educator in the church, an institution that he says is in deep denial about the extent of H.I.V. infection among its flock.
Like Riggs's 1989 video documentary "Tongues Untied," which was attacked by Senator Jesse Helms and excerpted by Pat Buchanan in an ad for his campaign for the Presidency, "No Regret" is part documentary, part cinematic collage. Interwoven with the personal testaments are fragments of a poem by Mr. Woods, "Prescription," and stirring a-cappella gospel singing by Linda Tillery.
Both "A Question of Color" and "No Regret" were clearly made on shoestring budgets. If their scratchy soundtracks, crude visuals and rather haphazard structures make them occasionally hard to follow, their sensible, positive messages about self-acceptance in the face of racism and homophobia resonate strongly.

HEADLINE: Demagoguery on Taxes

 BODY:
The muddle-headed spirit of Ronald Reagan stalks Washington this week. Mr. Reagan promised Americans they could maintain their society without taxing themselves to do it. The theory went like this: Limit revenues, and spending will come down.
But under Presidents Reagan and Bush, spending went up, especially for defense. The limits on revenue didn't stop that; the country just went into the red to pay for it. Meanwhile the underclass grew, social divisions sharpened and attitudes toward suffering took on a Dickensian hardness. 
 Reaganomics II, as now peddled by Bob Dole & Co., offers only a slightly different plan. SenatorDole doesn't promise, as President Reagan did, that spending will magically drop if revenues dry up. The Dole plan offers a mechanism. Cap benefits, the Republicans insist, and our problems are solved. Let the human wreckage pile up at the bottom of society; the wealthy can take care of themselves.
Bill Clinton offered a different vision, and Americans bought it. In partnership with the private sector, Mr. Clinton wanted to create opportunities while reducing the deficit. The idea was to shrink the underclass, increase the middle class, bring those who "played by the rules" out of poverty, and face up to the fact that the vision had a price tag. Americans agreed they were willing to pay that price -- as long as he delivered.
Congressional Republicans aren't buying it. With their pledge to oppose all taxes, they are busily transposing the Reagan siren song into the new fiscal demagoguery: You can have a safe, healthy and prosperous society without paying for it.
Americans are not taxed excessively in comparison with citizens of other developed countries. It's instructive to look at the formula being proposed by the new conservative Government in France, which also faces a large budget deficit and high unemployment: spending cuts -- including salary cuts for Government ministers -- coupled with tax increases.
It sounds exactly like the truthful prescription being promoted by the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell. Cravenly eyeing the 1994 elections, Mr. Dole and the Senate Republicans are peddling a tired and dangerous vision that can only add to the deficit that piled up while Ronald Reagan led the country into the land of dreamy dreams.

Fear of Compassion

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
At last, the Government of the United States is pulling itself together -- White House, Congress, Supreme Court -- to show how determined and target-minded it can be when it comes to handling a social crisis.
Well, not all social crises -- not things like controlling the gun epidemic that sickens American life, or helping the mentally ill to get the care to take them off the streets, or pushing the war against drugs to the victory in sight. 
 But when it came to some boatloads of people fleeing China and Haiti, the Government showed its stuff pretty quick.
First, the Chinese were hustled off to prisons distant from human rights lawyers. And now Haitians have been taught by the Administration and the Supreme Court that the Coast Guard can hijack them at sea and send them right back home; never mind what Mr. Clinton promised to the contrary when he was running toward the White House instead of living in it.
Some Americans are ashamed -- among them liberals, radicals and conservatives. They are connected by the belief that the open-held arms of American history is one of those things that makes the country more than a very large piece of real estate.
But many more Americans -- liberals, radicals, conservatives -- react as if refugees must be fought from ship to cell. They seem afraid of the American sense of compassion and welcome that makes people all over the world bless the name of the land.
Among these Americans are descendants of immigrants who simply have become bigots themselves, clones of those who warned that this country would be ruined by Jewish peddlers, Italian gangsters and Irish layabouts. America provides many things, but no vaccine against hate.
But mostly coldness to immigrants comes from economic fears and confusion about the complications of immigration and asylum.
About 800,000 legal immigrants enter America annually. Sometime, lying in a hospital emergency room, look up at a Philippine nurse bringing relief. Decide whether the U.S. needs fewer immigrants or more.
About three million foreigners live illegally in the U.S., many of them Mexicans who saw no moral reason why they should not go from their poor country to seek work in a rich country across a historically recent border. We can stop this by helping the neighbor become somewhat less poor, or saying our house is your house. Otherwise -- argue with America's lusty history, which made its borders too big to patrol.
In any case, immigration creates national wealth, not national burden. It does add government costs in some places -- which Washington wrongly shoves off on cities and states.
About 90,000 to 100,000 other foreigners arrive every year to ask for asylum as refugees -- people who fear death, imprisonment or torture if returned. Most prove their cases.
But suppose some do pretend to be "genuine" refugees, to find economic survival. Is that a reason for America to panic against the ideals of immigration and refuge, which helped create the country?
Groups like the New York Immigration Coalition and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights explain the much-publicized backlog problem of 250,000 pending asylum cases.
Sweden has 800 officers handling asylum cases. Germany has 3,000. America has 150. Who created the backlog -- desperate people seeking a safe life or the U.S. bureaucracy, the same bureaucracy that allowed Mideast terrorists to get through despite strong existing laws?
Haitians have no clout in the U.S. But the truth is they flee Haiti to escape "endemic widespread human rights abuses," dictatorship and "the worst poverty in the hemisphere." Doris Meissner, the immigration specialist, wrote that in December.
Candidate Clinton said the Bush policy of hijacking Haitians on the high seas to send them back was so cruel that he would reverse it. But then President Clinton fought successfully in the Supreme Court to uphold the Bush order.
Dr. Meissner is now Mr. Clinton's nominee to head the Immigration Service. Perhaps she can convince the President that although the Court gave him the right to go back on his word it is not forcing him to do so.
In the end, faithfulness to compassion as national interest remains a matter of choice, for Presidents as for all Americans.

HEADLINE: I'm the Same Old Bob Dole

BYLINE: By Bob Dole; Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, is Senate minority leader.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Don't worry, the "old Bob Dole" is still on the job. And I can still spot a phony deficit package a mile away.
I appreciate Alice M. Rivlin's nice comments on this page Wednesday about my record on staying tough on the Federal deficit, but I can also appreciate that as deputy budget director she is doing her best to put some happy hype on a terrible product: President Clinton's tax-infested $347 billion deficit-reduction package. 
 Now, I have tremendous respect for Alice Rivlin, a talented and dedicated public servant, but she should spend less time waxing nostalgic for the "old Bob Dole" and start wondering whatever happened to the "New Democrat" Bill Clinton.
Unfortunately, President Clinton has left Candidate Clinton in the dust, taking a hard left turn out of the mainstream and speeding onto the liberal autobahn, where there are no limits on taxing and spending.
Left in his exhaust are all those middle-class Americans still waiting for their promised tax cut, all those Americans who will have to pay for the President's new energy tax, all those employers who will now be penalized for making their small businesses successful and all those voters who thought they were voting for real change in November.
That's why Senate Republicans will continue to oppose the President's economic plan, because it is lopsided with $271 billion in gross tax increases, lets the deficit skyrocket again after 1998, cuts Federal spending only by $15 billion during the next three years and asks the American people to look the other way as the Clinton Administration takes credit for $44 billion in deficit reductions that the Bush Administration enacted into law three years ago.
How that kind of Washington magic will create jobs, inspire Wall Street and boost the recovery is beyond me.
Unfortunately, the President and his Senate allies are determined to win a political victory, a shortsighted mission that may earn a few headlines this weekend but will haunt them once the taxpayers find out they've been shortchanged again.
If Alice Rivlin is really longing for the old Bob Dole, she would have blown the whistle on the bogus plan, exposing the fact that it does not produce the President's ballyhooed $508 billion in deficit reduction.
The old Alice Rivlin would have endorsed our Republican alternative that gets the deficit under control by freezing spending and not raising taxes.
And the old Alice Rivlin would have cheered our plan as it dropped the deficit every year after 1998 while her boss's plan lets it shoot right up again after that date.
She is right: I have made some tough choices on the deficit front. In 1985, as Senate majority leader, my Republican colleagues and I put together the toughest deficit-reduction package in history, eliminating entire Federal programs and freezing spending across-the-board, including cost-of-living adjustments for entitlement programs.
Did Democrats applaud this bold move? Did they vote for our plan? Did they accept our offers to be players? No way. Only the late Edward Zorinsky, Democrat of Nebraska, had the courage to join us. So forgive us if we deficit veterans don't get too excited about President Clinton's big-tax, low-cut, one-party agenda.
Yes, Alice, there's still an old Bob Dole. He's still fighting the old tax- and-spend liberals, even if they now wishfully call themselves "New Democrats."

Test of Leadership

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The Soviet-American treaty banning all but underground nuclear tests is nearly 30 years old now, and we tend to take it for granted. We forget that it exists only because a President was courageous enough to lead.
June 1963 was a time of high tension in the cold war. Less than eight months before, we had come to the brink of nuclear war over Soviet deployment of missiles in Cuba. The American political mood was overwhelmingly hawkish. 
 In that climate President Kennedy moved to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union. In a speech at American University on June 10 he called for steps toward peace, if not to end differences with Moscow then at least to "make the world safe for diversity." Most concretely, he called for "a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests," which he said would "increase our security [and] decrease the prospects of war."
The test-ban proposal aroused powerful opposition in Congress and the military. Public opinion was skeptical. When negotiations produced only a limited test-ban treaty, allowing underground tests to continue, even that was fiercely resisted. Theodore C. Sorensen, who was Kennedy's special counsel, described the resistance when he spoke this June 10, also at American University.
"But the President carried the fight to the Senate," Mr. Sorensen said, "to the Joint Chiefs, to the public, with speeches and phone calls and meetings and arm-twisting. . . . And he prevailed. No other signing ceremony in the White House gave him greater satisfaction."
Thirty years on, that history is acutely relevant. President Clinton faces an important decision on nuclear testing, one with profound implications for the spread of nuclear weapons. And once again the outcome depends on Presidential courage and commitment.
Last year Congress imposed a moratorium on U.S. nuclear testing until this July 1. After that the legislation allows up to 12 tests for the "safety" of nuclear weapons and 3 for their "reliability."
The military services have told the President they favor further tests, but they are not pushing with great zeal. They are not eager to spend the vast sums needed to deploy new warheads or weapons, now that the cold war is over, and the law allows tests only if the services plan deployment.
The real push for tests comes from the nuclear weapons laboratories, which want to justify their continued existence. And they have friends in Congress.
The arguments for testing are essentially ones of domestic politics, not science. In terms of national security, the arguments are overwhelmingly against new tests.
The United States in fact faces one extremely serious nuclear threat, and resumption of testing would exacerbate it. That is the proliferation of weapons. Intelligence reports suggest that a substantial number of countries could acquire nuclear weapons if there is any weakening of the barriers to proliferation.
If the United States starts testing, France, Britain and Russia may well conduct tests. President Clinton would undoubtedly say that this will be a last test series, but it would be extremely difficult then to get the other nuclear powers to agree on a final stopping date.
All this would have dangerous consequences for nuclear proliferation. The countries without acknowledged nuclear weapons have always insisted that the principle of nonproliferation is acceptable only if those that have them stop testing. And the nonproliferation treaty is up for renewal in 1996.
In fact, the term "safety tests" is a misnomer. There is no danger in existing weapons of unintended nuclear explosions; the only safety to be checked is of collateral matters. And testing would involve real danger to the world: the opposite of "safety."
President Clinton, speaking at West Point last month, said the U.S. "will soon begin negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, which will increase our political leverage to combat proliferation." Ending the current moratorium on tests would sabotage that negotiation before it can begin.
The necessary test is the one already taking place: the test of Presidential leadership.

HEADLINE: Where Indian Tribes Get Gambling Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Issue of Indian Sovereignty Behind Gambling Case" (Law page, June 11) incorrectly states that the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act "grants tribes broad powers to issue and regulate gambling licenses." 
 The right of Indian tribal governments to regulate reservation gambling comes from our people. We did not give up that power when we signed peace treaties with the Federal Government in the 1800's. The Supreme Court recognized these powers in the 1987 Cabazon decision.
In 1988, at the bidding of the states, Congress restricted our rights by requiring Indian nations to enter agreements with the states before operating casino-type games. Many Indian nations have worked out agreements with states and have shown we can successfully operate casinos and provide for our people. Now, states that refused to recognize our rights are teaming up with the Las Vegas and Atlantic City interests, which want even more limits on our rights.
Indian tribal governments simply want to keep the right every state has, to determine if we are going to use gaming as a source of revenue. We use the revenue to provide basic governmental services to some of the most economically deprived communities in America.

HEADLINE: SPECTER OF TERROR: The Suspects;
Arrested in Yesterday's Raid

 BODY:

SIDDIG IBRAHIM SIDDIG ALI
Mr. Siddig Ali, 32, arrived from the Sudan about seven years ago. The authorities called him the leader of the plot. He lives at 112 Brunswick Avenue in Jersey City.
A member of the al-Salaam Mosque in Jersey City described Mr. Ali as a "religious activist who's outspoken" and who was a leader in helping raise money to pay for the legal fees of the six defendants charged in the World Trade Center bombing and for the defense of El Sayyid Nosair, who was convicted of a gun charge in the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane. 
 A Muslim associate said Mr. Siddig Ali trained with a group of Muslim militants who frequently practiced what they described as "self defense" techniques in the Harrisburg, Pa., area on weekends.
Mr. Siddig Ali, who was said to have a degree in economics in the Sudan, was described by his lawyer, William M. Kuntsler, as a former security guard and street peddler. He also has worked as a taxi driver in New York City, where he was cited for numerous traffic violations. Mr. Ali was said to have come to New York seven years ago.
 
CLEMENT RODNEY HAMPTON-EL
Mr. Hampton-El, 55 years old, was born in the United States and has lived for more than 25 years in a fifth floor Brooklyn apartment at 1351 New York Avenue, in the Midwood section, where he is more familiarly known as Rasheed Hampton, his Muslim name. On his apartment door were decals in Arabic and English calling on "Muslims to unite."
Neighbors said Mr. Hampton-El is a quiet, pleasant man who kept to himself but also was friendly with many of the children in the building, bringing them candy and fruit. They said he was employed as a laboratory technician in a downtown Brooklyn hospital.
 
MOHAMMAD SALEH
Mr. Saleh, who is 40 years old, is also known as Mohammad Ali. He lives on the first floor of a three family house at 39 Burtis Avenue in Yonkers, where he operates a gas station at the corner of Bronx River Road and Yonkers Avenue. Mr. Saleh is described as a Palestinian from Jordan and has a wife and three small children.
Friends of the couple said they are devoted to their three children and that both spent many hours in daily prayers.
 
TARIG ELHASSAN
Mr. Elhassan, 38, of 390 East 8th Street on the Lower East Side, is a Sudanese who was employed in this country as a cab driver. His friends said he became a devout Muslim in recent years.
Described by neighbors as a shy, quiet man, Mr. Elhassan lived in a sixth floor apartment in a building where a number of other Muslims were displacing many Hispanic and black families. They said he was separated from his American-born wife; they have three small children. One neighbor said one reason or the separation was her opposition to his insistence that she adhere to strict Muslim tradition for women.
One neighbor, Jennie Hernandez, said that Mr. Elhassan was not particularly religious when he moved in three years ago, but added that his Muslim conversion became more pronounced recently.
 
ABDELGHANI FADIL
Neighbors said Mr. Fadil, a 31-year-old Sudanese and former New York City taxi driver, moved from his tree shaded apartment at 120 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn in January after sharing his home with as many six or seven Sudanese who would make travel often to New Jersey. They described Mr. Fadil and his Sudanese friends as quiet and polite.
The city's Taxi and Limousine Commission said Mr. Fadil's taxi driver's license expired in April, 1992.
 
VICTOR ALVAREZ
Mr. Alvarez, who is 32 years old and a native of Puero Rico, lives in a fourth floor apartment at 42 Wright Avenue in Jersey City, a few blocks from the Journal Square mosque where he and five of the other defendants worshipped and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical Muslim cleric, preached. His companion said he had been a supermarket stock clerk and was unemployed. He is considered by friends to be a devout Muslim.
 
 FARES KHALLAFALLA
Mr. Khallafalla, 31, of 926 Westside Avenue in Jersey City, is a native of the Sudan who was employed by a company that delivered medical supplies. Neighbors described him as a "very nice man" and said they could "not believe" he could be involved in any bombing plot. To help pay his bills, Mr. Khallafalla also served as the building's superintendent.
Like the other defendants, he worshipped at the Journal Square mosque and was known to send money to his family in Sudan. On a table in his nearly empty two-bedroom apartment was a textbook entitled, "Electronic Devices and Circuit Theories."
 
AMIR ABDOU ZAID
Mr. Zaid lived at 311 Palisades Aevnue in Jersey City. His brother, Gamal, said they immigrated from Sudan 10 years ago and that his brother was a taxi driver in Jersey City.

Getting Stock Certificates
 
Q If I buy shares in a company and don't receive the stock certificate, what can I do?
 
 GLORIA G. OKUN, Brooklyn
A When you buy shares through a brokerage firm, you can leave them in the custody of the firm or ask for delivery of the stock certificates. Many firms are trying to discourage the use of these certificates by imposing charges for delivery. 
 If you do not receive requested stock certificates, contact your broker and, if necessary, talk to the office manager. "You may have to file a complaint with the National Association of Securities Dealers to get results," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. "But even so, it could take months to actually obtain the certificates."
 
Medigap Insurance
Q What is a Medigap insurance policy?
 
CATHERINE AMATO, Princeton, N.J.
A Medigap, or Medicare supplementary insurance, is private health insurance that fills some of the gaps in Medicare coverage. Since Medicare pays no more than 80 percent of most doctor bills and also has holes in its hospital coverage, many people over age 65 also buy Medigap insurance. Neither Medigap nor Medicare provides any significant coverage for long-term care.
"Consumers who shop around for Medigap coverage can probably save money," said James Firman, president of the United Seniors Health Cooperative. "Prices for identical coverage can vary greatly from company to company, sometimes by as much as 100 percent or more."
But all older people do not need Medigap policies, including retirees whose former employers provide supplemental coverage and elderly men and women who belong to a health maintenance organization. In addition, low-income seniors may be eligible for different types of supplemental coverage through the Medicaid program.
 
Called-In Bonds
Q Some of our corporate bonds are being paid off early. Why is this happening, and how can we avoid it?
 
 JEAN MANN, Manhattan
A You are discovering the concept of call risk -- the risk that a bond will be called, or bought back by the issuer before maturity. Most corporate bonds allow issuers to call these securities, and many have recently done so because interest rates have declined and the companies can issue new bonds at lower rates. Such moves are, of course, in the best interest of the issuers of the bonds, not of the investors in them.
To avoid call risk, you can buy noncallable bonds. "Most importantly, you should understand the call provisions of any bonds you want to purchase," said Jonathan D. Pond, author of "The New Century Family Money Book" (Dell, 1993).
"The best measure of the possible adverse effect of a bond call is the yield-to-call, a bond's yield if the bond is called by the issuer at the worst possible time from the standpoint of the issuer."
It usually pays to steer clear of any bond whose yield-to-call is substantially lower than its yield-to-maturity.

HEADLINE: BUDGET SURVIVES SENATE STRUGGLE; NEW FIGHT AHEAD

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Hours after his budget package took a predawn white-water trip through the Senate and survived, mostly intact, President Clinton said today that he saw "quite encouraging" prospects that the House and Senate would meld their versions into one mutually acceptable bill.
But outside the White House, the signs that Mr. Clinton's budget faces yet another perilous legislative struggle were already mounting. 
 In their vote early this morning, the Senate Democrats needed Vice President Al Gore to move the budget past a united front of Republican opponents by a vote of 50 to 49.
 
Indicator of Trouble
 The clearest indicator of future trouble came hours later from Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, a conservative Democrat whose attacks very nearly derailed the plan two weeks ago in the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Boren, who voted for the Senate package, warned today that he would vote against any budget compromise that does not have more spending cuts than tax increases and does not meaningfully restrain spending on Federal benefits programs.
In the House, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem warned that the House would not approve any compromise that did not raise spending for social programs well beyond the levels in the Senate bill. The President faces a formidable obstacle in Mr. Rangel, a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, which wrote the House version of the budget, as well as a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members will hold the balance of votes on a compromise.
The two lawmakers released the first of what will no doubt be a flotilla of trial balloons leading to the budget conference, each suggesting that Mr. Clinton's budget is doomed to defeat if certain concessions, liberal or conservative, are not granted.
None of that would matter if the first Democratic President in 12 years had a cushion of Democratic support for his budget, which aims to reduce the Federal deficit by $500 billion over five years. But he does not.
When the Senate finished voting shortly after 3 A.M., 6 of the 56 Democrats, most of them conservatives, voted against the package, and one supporter, Patty Murray of Washington, was absent, recovering from gynecological surgery.
The six were Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.
Late last month, the House passed a budget measure much more to Mr. Clinton's liking by a bare six-vote margin. There, too, all 176 Republicans voted against the proposal.
Lawmakers from both chambers will start meeting after the Fourth of July to seek a compromise that can pass muster in both the House and Senate. That will be especially difficult because the swing votes lie at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum: conservatives in the Senate; liberals in the House.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers insisted that bringing the opposite sides together would not nearly be as hard as it looked.
"They'll try to bridge those gaps -- I don't think they are particularly large," Mr. Clinton said of Congressional negotiators. He predicted that the talks would yield a budget superior to either version already passed.
 
'Premature to Fret'
 One Administration official who has been deeply involved in the budget fight said, "It seems way premature to fret about this outcome."
But in this case, it is still not clear what the Administration will do next. The official said the White House had no clear idea yet how to draft a workable compromise.
The Senate budget has a decidedly more conservative cast than the House version. It includes fewer taxes, fewer tax breaks for business and more spending cuts in social programs than the House package, which Mr. Clinton has endorsed.
The Administration said the House package would reduce the deficit by $503 billion over five years, with roughly 55 percent of that figure coming from higher taxes and 45 percent from spending cuts.
The Senate bill would cut spending by $256 billion through 1998 and raise taxes by $243 billion, for a total of $499 billion through 1998. That is 51 percent from spending cuts and 49 percent from new taxes.
 
Debt to Keep Rising
 Despite the taxes and spending cuts, the total Federal debt would keep rising under either budget -- by a total about $1 trillion -- over the five years. By the last year, the annual deficit would be reduced to about $200 billion.
The probable sticking points in House-Senate talks have been known for weeks, and the Senate did not much alter them in its final deliberations. Among them are these:
*The Senate version still would cut $10 billion more from the five-year Medicare budget than the House version, which reduces spending by $50 billion. The difference had been $19 billion but was narrowed to win the support of party liberals.
*The Senate version spends less on the earned-income tax credit for the working poor than the House version, although both provide for a substantial increase. The Senate also increases the food-stamp benefit program by less than the House.
*The Senate omits a program that Mr. Rangel and other House Democrats say is nonnegotiable: "empowerment zones" that would grant tax breaks to businesses that locate and employ persons in poor areas.
*The Senate rejected a broad House tax on most sources of energy, opting instead for a gasoline and diesel tax that would raise about a third as much. Late Thursday, the chamber voted to scale back even that tax, exempting aircraft fuel and reducing the total five-year take to about $22 billion.
*The Senate rejected a House-passed break in the capital-gains tax for investors who take long-term gains in certain small businesses.
Early today, the Senate also voted 98-0 to excise from the bill an Internal Revenue Service program, aimed at rooting out small-business tax cheats, that would have required corporations to report all transactions with service companies, like airlines and hotels, that exceed $600 in a year.
Mr. Clinton said he intended to fight in the conference to keep the House's tax breaks for small business and inner-city firms, and suggested that he would look favorably on smaller cuts in Federal benefits programs and other social spending.
An Administration official, who refused to be named, said Mr. Clinton's preferences could add up to more than $10 billion in spending or tax breaks. To afford that, the House-Senate conference would have to retreat on the deficit-cutting goal or raise taxes.
Mr. Boren made that clear today. "There were a good 6, 8, maybe 10 Democrats last night that were just barely there" in support of the budget package, he said in an interview. "If they go back to something that resembles more of the House bill, just barely more spending than taxes, I'm a goner. Absolutely."
The senior Administration official noted that Mr. Boren has rattled swords before to no effect, agreeing as recently as Thursday to accept smaller Medicare cuts than he had earlier negotiated.
 
Democrats Had Reserves
 And several Congressional and Administration officials said the White House had held a stronger hand in this morning's vote than the final tally showed. At least one Democrat who voted against the legislation, Senator Johnston, was ready to support Mr. Clinton if needed, and another of the six defecting Democrats also was ready to switch, they said.
The White House said today that Mr. Clinton followed the voting till the end on C-Span, though he took a break with a videotape of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" during a long series of forgone votes on amendments in the middle of the night.
The White House made an overture to the conservatives today, dispatching the budget director, Leon E. Panetta, to order all Government agencies to plan for an average 10 percent cut in "nonpriority discretionary spending programs" in their next budgets.
It nevertheless was clear that Mr. Clinton has almost no margin of error in either chamber in the complex bargaining process to come.
In this and past budget conferences, the chairman of dozens of Congressional panels with stakes in the legislation appoint committee members to negotiate their portions of the bill, usually in private. Formal votes are rare; rather, lawmakers sign tally sheets that register their support or disapproval.

HEADLINE: Panel Votes to Close Staten Island Base; Spares New London

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Virtually ending any significant Navy presence in New York City, a Presidential commission voted today to close the Staten Island Homeport and move its ships and sailors to Virginia and Florida.
The decision by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission appears to put an end to one of the Navy's most modern installations, which until 1991 had been the focus of a debate over allowing nuclear-armed ships to be based in New York Harbor. The panel rejected, however, a Pentagon recommendation to shrink the submarine base at New London, Conn.
 
Other Major Closings
 In a body blow to California and South Carolina, the seven-member commission also voted to close the Navy base and shipyard in Charleston, S.C., and a large shipyard and two Navy bases in the San Francisco Bay area. Combined, they employ more than 14,000 civilians, and community officials estimate the closings could indirectly cause the loss of two to three times that many jobs. 
 The panel left open the possibility that it may vote in its two remaining days of deliberations to move other small installations to Charleston to ease the economic damage.
While communities with base closings are predictably angry and filled with prophecies of doom, the reductions and closings will yield billions of dollars in savings as a dividend from the end of the cold war.
President Clinton and Congress must approve or reject the commission's recommendations as a package, and the pressure to reduce the military budget makes approval virtually certain.
In its third day of final deliberations on the fate of 238 installations nationwide, commissioners focused on shrinking the Navy's vast network of bases. Some, like Charleston's, date to the early 1900's. Others, like Staten Island's, were built in the 1980's for a 600-ship Navy meant to fight the Soviet Union all over the globe. With the cold war over and the Navy fleet heading toward 320 ships by the end of the decade, the Navy has more bases than it needs or can afford.
 
Vulnerable Area Base
 After essentially ignoring the need to recommend base closings during the previous rounds in 1988 and 1991, the Navy is having to play catch up this year. As a result, scores of naval bases, shipyards, technical centers and air stations are under consideration.
No base was more vulnerable than the one on Staten Island. Originally designed as a homeport for a Navy battleship and accompanying warships, the homeport is one of the newest bases in the Navy. It now has one Aegis cruiser and five reservist ships, and is also a training center for 10,000 Navy reservists. But, being built at the height of the expansion, its prospects quickly shrank along with the size of the fleet.
The commission made clear that the opposition to the homeport among New Yorkers did not play a role in the decision.
Representative Susan Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, said in an interview that legal action to block closing of the homeport, while possible, would probably only prolong the inevitable. "I'd prefer to move on a more positive course and consider as rapidly as possible alternatives," she said.
Ms. Molinari said she would announce a package of redevelopment options for the port next Tuesday. Under today's vote, the family housing built at the homeport would continue to be used by the military for workers at other nearby bases.
Other states also felt the pain. Scores of community leaders and politicians from California and South Carolina packed a House hearing room today, with dozens of people left outside. Emotions ran high inside and out. One commissioner, Peter B. Bowman, a retired Navy submarine captain, was near tears as he reminisced in a quaking voice about the Mare Island shipyard in the San Francisco Bay area, where he was married 29 years ago. Moments later, he reluctantly voted to close the site.
Officials from Charleston said 38,000 jobs would be lost directly and indirectly as a result of the shipyard and Navy base closing. Community leaders had impressed commissioners with a well-organized campaign to save the installations, including having audiences hold three rehearsals before the panel held a field visit there.
Commissioners considered sending Charleston the submarines now in New London or a mine warfare center in Ingleside, Tex., but in the end, the panelists said, they could not save the bases. "From a monetary sense and a mission sense, nothing seemed to work out," said Jim Courter, the commission's chairman, a former Republican Representative from New Jersey.
South Carolina politicians and officials, who wore yellow buttons emblazoned with "In Defense of Charleston," took little solace in the comforting words. "This is probably the worst disaster that's happened to Charleston in my lifetime," said Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a 90-year-old Republican.
The outlook was equally grim in California, where 17 installations employing 68,000 workers are already being closed, and the military industry is in deep recession. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the commission closed the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Alameda Naval Air Station and the Treasure Island Naval Base. Aircraft carriers now based in Alameda will be moved to the homeport in Everett, Wash., which the commission decided to keep open.
 
'An Unfair Hit'
 "California has taken an unfair hit," said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.
One glimmer of good news for California came when the commission, after a spirited debate, voted 4 to 3 to keep open the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which employs about 4,400 civilian workers. Commissioners unanimously agreed to keep open Naval installations in Pascagoula, Miss., and Ingleside, Tex., Meridian, Miss., and Corpus Christi, Tex., as well as shipyards in Norfolk, Va., and Portsmouth, N.H. But the panel voted to close the Navy homeport in Mobile, Ala.
Earlier in the day, the panel voted to keep open depots at McClellan Air Force Base in California, Kelly Air Force Base in Texas, Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, which commissioners had added to the Pentagon list for possible closings. But the panel approved a Pentagon recommendation to close a small depot at Newark Air Force Base in Ohio.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin recommended in March the closing or shrinking of 43 major installations and 122 smaller sites. The commission later added 47 other major bases and 26 smaller sites for consideration. Commissioners have suggested in interviews that they might substitute some bases for Mr. Aspin's choices, but are unlikely to close many more installations than the Pentagon wants.

HEADLINE: Rights Forum Ends in Call For a Greater Role by U.N.

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 25

 BODY:
After dire predictions that it could mark a serious setback for the human rights movement, a World Conference on Human Rights ended on a surprisingly optimistic note tonight as delegates called on the United Nations to play a larger role in denouncing abuses.
Western delegations were particularly pleased that, after lengthy bargaining, the conference endorsed an American proposal for the creation of a new post of High Commissioner on Human Rights. 
 More than anything, though, the United States and other Western nations were relieved that their worst fears were not realized -- a retreat from the basic tenets of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the result of a bitter North-South clash.
"We came to Vienna with less than high expectations," John Shattuck, the chief American delegate, said tonight of the two-week meeting. "But we worked with other delegations to stop any backsliding on human rights. And, on balance, it was a successful event. It has produced a strong, forward-looking document."
 
Challenge of Relativity
 The West's main concern was that a bloc of mainly Asian nations, led by China, Iran and Syria, might succeed in their attempt to challenge the universality of human rights by arguing that they existed as a function of a country's history, level of development, cultural tradition and religion.
While the conference's final declaration does take note of these variables, it commits states to promote and protect all human rights "regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems." And it adds, "The universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question."
Conversely, because the conference had agreed to work through consensus, only days ago it seemed unlikely that a High Commissioner on Human Rights would be approved. In the end, though, the conference recommended that the General Assembly consider the idea "as a matter of priority" at its annual session this fall.
The conference itself had no legislative authority, leaving crucial decisions to be made later by other United Nations groups. But it nonetheless broke new ground by extending the definition of human rights to embrace the special rights of children, minorities, indigenous people and, particularly, women.
 
Women Declare Victory
 "The key factor has been the unity of women at the conference," said Roxanne Carrillo, an official of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, referring to the strong presence of independent women's groups here. "We strongly believe this alliance is the key to what we are celebrating today."
"These recommendations are a major half-step forward for the women of the world," said Charlotte Bunch, a spokeswoman for the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights. "It will be a full step when the recommendations are carried out. So we're here to declare victory, go home and start preparing the next stage of the campaign."
Although the rules of the conference required that it not dwell on specific human rights crises, it adopted special resolutions dealing with atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Angola. In the main, though, it involved a battle of words, with different governments left to identify where their interests might be threatened.
Non-governmental organizations working on human rights were particularly angry to be excluded from the committee drafting the final declaration. In a joint statement today, they described the declaration as "a flawed document" that confirms many basic rights but also reflects "attempts by governments to shirk their human rights obligations."
 
'Missed Opportunities'
 Pierre Sane, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, was even more critical, describing the conference as "a summit of missed opportunities" because "it dealt with the past and not the future, reaffirming principles agreed to 45 years ago instead of addressing the challenges of the future."
He said recognition of women's human rights was very significant, but the declaration used "condescending" language in referring to non-governmental organizations and made "a dangerous reference" to the media. "These organizations and the media are the key to human rights protection," he added.
Mr. Shattuck, who serves as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, also expressed concern over a paragraph guaranteeing freedom and protection of the media "within the framework of national law" because many countries have legislation permitting censorship.
As the conference closed in a flurry of self-congratulatory speeches, however, experts said its success could only be measured by how many of its recommendations are eventually carried out. "We'll know how much we have achieved in the General Assembly this fall," said Reed Brody of the International Human Rights Law Group.

HEADLINE: Home-Resale Rise Posted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes shot up 4.6 percent in May, the second straight advance after a winter slump, a real estate trade group said today. Each of the nation's four regions reported gains.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes totaled 3.61 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 3.45 million in April. 
 It was the biggest increase since a similar gain last December before adverse weather sent sales sliding for three straight months. Sales rose a revised 2.4 percent in April, slightly less than the 2.7 percent initial estimate.
The median price of a previously owned home was $106,100 in May, up just three-tenths of 1 percent from April and 2.9 percent from a year ago. The median means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
At the same time, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.47 percent in May, down from 7.48 percent a month earlier and 8.67 percent in May 1992, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Regionally, sales jumped 7.9 percent in the South, to a 1.37 million annual rate. Sales advanced 4.2 percent, to a 500,000 rate, in the Northeast. In the West, sales increased 2.7 percent, to a 750,000 rate. Sales were up 2.1 percent, to 980,000, in the Midwest.
The realtors group said sales for the first five months totaled 1.38 million, up 1 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Opening a Wound on Staten Island

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN

 BODY:
Supporters of the Staten Island Homeport reacted with bitter resignation to yesterday's decision by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to close the base.
The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, a longtime advocate for the Navy base, called the closing a wound to the borough's pride. 
 "We finally had something other than the garbage dump, something to be proud of," he said. "I'm terribly, terribly disappointed. It's kind of a bitter pill to swallow."
Mr. Molinari said he had watched the commission's proceedings on television from his home, where he was recovering after being hospitalized for exhaustion. He blamed Mayor David N. Dinkins, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and other Democrats for their early opposition to the base and for not supporting the base strongly enough when they dropped their opposition.
 
'I Will Not Forgive'
 "It's true the Mayor flipped in the last month or two and said he was now supporting it, but it was too little, too late," Mr. Molinari said. "The Congressional delegation not only opposed Homeport, but signed letters asking for Homeport to be closed. I will not forgive them for it."
Mayor Dinkins, who originally opposed Homeport because of the possibility that ships containing nuclear weapons would be berthed there, dropped his opposition in 1991 when President George Bush ordered the Navy to remove all nuclear weapons from its surface ships.
In a statement yesterday, Mayor Dinkins called the base closing bad news for New York's economy as well as for national security, and he said he would ask President Clinton to reject the commission's recommendation.
Outside the base headquarters yesterday, a billboard alerted passers-by to the date and time of the commission's hearings. Inside, workers listened to the debate over an intercom.
The $300 million Homeport is home to 2,000 active-duty military personnel and employs 450 civilians, said Lieut. Roxie Thomsen, a base spokeswoman.
 
Worry About Jobs
 One of those workers, 33-year-old Gregory Nakshin, said he had moved to Staten Island from Brooklyn to be closer to the base.
"Everybody is tense," Mr. Nakshin said. "I wouldn't say depressed because we knew it was coming."
Mr. Nakshin said he had already starting searching for a new job.
"It's kind of scary," he said. "I'm probably going to be out of work for a couple of months, then, God knows."
A similar reaction came from Monica Hackett, 32, of Red Hook, Brooklyn, who works in the Navy exchange store. She said: "I hate to see it close. I've really enjoyed working here."
Carlo Vinaccia, 61, the manager of Plaza French Cleaners, adjacent to the base, said that he would probably lose several hundred dollars a week in business and that local restaurants in the area would be hit even harder.
"It's stupid to close the base after spending all that money on it," he said. "It just isn't right."
 
Sailors Resigned
 The closing is less difficult for the sailors stationed at the base, because they transfer every two or three years anyway, Lieut. Thomsen said.
"For us in the Navy, the uniformed guys, we see the big picture," she said. "Still, it makes a lot of the troops nervous. They see the budget cuts, the personnel cuts. It's the uncertainty of the big military 'downsizing.' "
Not everyone was upset about the vote. Members of a group called Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor held a press conference outside the base to applaud the decision.
"It never made sense to base a nuclear-armed World War II battleship in New York Harbor," said a coalition leader, Thomas De Luca.
Other New York politicians, already reeling from Thursday's decision by the commission to close Plattsburgh Air Force Base in upstate New York, condemned the Homeport vote.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said it made no sense for the Navy to close one of its newest and most efficient facilities.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said, "It's a sad day for our nation's defense, a major blow to New York's economy, and it shows a total lack of sensitivity to New York and its people."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Advance; Grains and Soybeans Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures prices forged higher yesterday as the dollar weakened against other major currencies and South African mine labor talks reached an impasse.
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures fell; cattle futures rose sharply, and crude oil futures fell. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery gained $2 an ounce, to $377.30, and July silver surged 9.8 cents, to $4.49 an ounce.
Platinum for July delivery rose $3.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $385.70 an ounce.
 
 
Technical Factors
 The advances extended a precious metals rally that began on Wednesday and had been attributed to currency fluctuations, inflation jitters and technical factors.
Technicals played a role again yesterday when silver broke through resistance at $4.44, touching off fresh buying.
Gold benefited from the dollar's fall against other major currencies after President Clinton was quoted as saying Senate approval of his budget cuts was a clear signal that interest rates should be kept down.
Lower interest rates make the dollar a less attractive investment, which raises demand for gold.
Support also stemmed from news that national mine workers contract talks in South Africa, a major gold and platinum producer, had reached a stalemate and were headed for arbitration.
Profit taking in the wheat and soybean pits pressed grain futures prices lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
In addition to cashing out with big gains from rain-related soybean planting and winter wheat harvesting delays, traders began to even up their positions ahead of a Government report on prospective plantings due out Wednesday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for August delivery slipped 5 cents, to $18.84 a barrel; August heating oil rose 0.32 cent, to 52.28 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline rose 0.26 cent, to 55.01 cents a gallon, and August natural gas fell 0.2 cent, to $2.157 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: European Bank Chief Quits Amid Criticism of Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 25

 BODY:
The chief executive of the bank set up just two years ago to help foster free market economies in Eastern Europe resigned today amid mounting questions about his spending of taxpayer money and his progress toward the bank's goal of promoting capitalism in the former Soviet bloc.
The resignation of Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development came after months of news reports about his use of expensive private jets and his spending on a lavish new headquarters building here, and just weeks before the release of an internal audit report that is expected to be highly critical of his management.
 The departure of Mr. Attali, a 49-year-old former aide to President Francois Mitterrand of France, should end a storm of bad publicity and internal bickering at the institution. But since the bank did not name a successor it raises a new question about a successor at a time when there are many concerns about the policies of the bank -- including such basic issues as whether it can effectively make loans on tough commercial terms to fledgling enterprises in formerly Communist countries, as its charter requires it to do. Some officials said Mr. Attali's departure would lead to a broad reappraisal of the operations of the bank in an effort to overcome its slow start. 
 The bank's board will hold a meeting, probably in the next several weeks, to begin the selection process, and the issue is likely to come up among representatives of the United States, the European Community and Japan at their summit meeting in Tokyo next month. Mr. Attali said he would stay on until his replacement was ready to take over.
The European Community, whose member nations own 51 percent of the bank, is likely to have the greatest say in choosing a new president. As a result, speculation centered on a European, and the names most prominently mentioned within the bank today were Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, and Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France.
Over the last several weeks, the bank's board has considered a plan to bring in Ernest Stern, currently the No. 2 official at the World Bank, as second in command to Mr. Attali and as day-to-day operating chief. But Mr. Stern, an American, is not seen by bank officials as a serious candidate for the top job.
 
 
A Grand Vision
 Mr. Attali, a writer and economist with no previous experience in international finance, has pursued a grand vision of using the bank to help build a politically stable and economically vibrant single market across the whole of Europe and the former Soviet Union.
His grand vision often seemed to extend to his own job, which he viewed as statesmanlike and often entailed him traveling from capital to capital by private jet, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
But in recent months Mr. Attali has faced fierce criticism, both from the news media and from the nations that fund the bank with taxpayer money, including the United States, its largest financial supporter. The criticism was prompted by the disclosure in April that building and equipping the bank's lavish new headquarters in London to Mr. Attali's exacting specifications, and paying for the bank's operations, had cost $300 million -- more than the bank had channeled in loans and other aid to the emerging free-market economies in Eastern Europe.
The Financial Times quickly dubbed Mr. Attali's institution "the bank that likes to say yes -- to itself." In the United States, the House declined to appropriate the $70 million in additional capital the nation is committed to providing the bank this year, and Senate leaders said they would take the same position until the management problems at the bank were cleared up.
Since then the efforts of Mr. Attali to defend his record have been undercut by a series of disclosures about his spending, including his travel expenses, and about his work outside the bank.
 
 
Book Controversy
 In May, Mr. Attali was caught up in charges that his latest book, "Verbatim," used without attribution passages from interviews between Mr. Mitterrand and the writer Elie Wiesel. Mr. Attali's book is an account of his years working alongside Mr. Mitterrand. Similar passages based on the interviews are included in a forthcoming book by Mr. Wiesel about Mr. Mitterrand.
Mr. Attali did not deny using the passages or transposing them from 1988, when the interviews took place, to portions of his book purporting to cover events between 1982 and 1986. But he denied any suggestion of plagiarism, saying that he had been present during most of the interviews and that he had told Mr. Wiesel of his intention to quote from them.
What may have been the last straw for Mr. Attali came today, when The Financial Times reported that he was reimbursed twice for a $10,500 first-class round-trip flight to Tokyo last year. Mr. Attali said the double reimbursement had been the result of a clerical error.
The reimbursement is among a host of issues being studied by the bank's audit committee, which is due to release a report next month on the spending policies of the institution and the apparent laxity of its financial controls. The report is widely expected to be critical of the administration of Mr. Attali and of his personal expenses at the bank.
In his resignation letter, Mr. Attali defended the bank's accomplishments and his own conduct.
"As you know, the bank has come under increasing negative press attention in recent months," Mr. Attali said in the letter to Anne Wibble, Sweden's Finance Minister and chairman of the bank's board. "I know of no action that I have taken that in any way could be worthy of reproach. Unfortunately, this attention has begun to have a detrimental effect on the bank's work, and on its staff, and it is with the interests of the bank in mind that I have taken this decision."
Scott Dykema, a spokesman for the United States Treasury, said the spending excesses at the bank under Mr. Attali had been regrettable.
"The bank must now focus on quickly fixing its management problems and then, of course, getting on with the business of supporting the economic reforms of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union," Mr. Dykema said.
Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, said the bank should move vigorously to "clean up its act" after Mr. Attali's resignation.
Asserting the resignation was overdue, Mr. Obey said he would continue to oppose any American funds for the bank until it carried out large-scale reforms in handling taxpayers' money.

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds 'Cheerleading' In Monitoring of Empire

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
A United States Senate subcommittee examining Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield criticizes state insurance regulators, who missed even the most obvious signs of trouble, and expensive auditors, who made only the most cursory examinations of the company. But it says that at the heart of Empire's deep financial crisis is the "gross mismanagement" of the company's own top executives.
The 200-page report offers a devastating portrait of the company that insures 8.2 million people, mostly in New York. It charges that Empire is losing money because of service so abysmal that some of the biggest institutions in America -- from Fortune 500 companies to universities and labor unions -- have dropped their insurance policies and turning elsewhere, even if they have to pay more. 
 And it portrays a company so badly run that it cannot perform even the most basic tasks of an insurance company -- setting prices, paying doctors and hospitals and reimbursing customers.
In a news conference, Harold E. Vogt, Empire's chairman, called the report "one-sided," denied that the company was mismanaged and offered statististics to buttress the company's claims of efficiency. He said the company would defend itself next week, when its representatives are scheduled to testify before the committee.
 
Collapse of Regulation
 The committee's report, the result of a six-month investigation, is based on interviews with dozens of present and former Empire executives and board members, and a review of internal company records.
The report describes a system of insurance regulation that in the case of Empire virtually collapsed.
The Insurance Department abdicated its responsibility to regulate Empire, the report said, and took the company at its word when it blamed all of its problems on unfair competition from for-profit insurance companies. The committee said the department and its Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, seemed almost paralyzed by the fear of doing anything to harm a company whose collapse might leave some of the poorest and sickest New Yorkers without health insurance.
Indeed, the report concluded that the department, one of the best-financed and largest in the nation, acted more like a "cheerleader for Empire's cause" than an "aggressive regulator." And it described a pattern of inaction that it said "bordered on favoritism."
 
An Advocate for Empire
 "This pattern," it said, "included a propensity by the department to reverse itself when such action would be to Empire's benefit, the failure by the department to enforce its authority over Empire in certain instances, a willingness on the department's part to allow Empire to ignore department recommendations and regulations with impunity, and the transformation of the department into an advocate on behalf of Empire."
Kevin Foley, the Insurance Department's deputy superintendent, said it had been aggressive in regulating Empire. He also said there was nothing wrong with being concerned about the company's customers.
The report also strongly criticized a state-sponsored study by Arthur Andersen & Company Associates, the accounting and consulting firm. Concerned about this year's 25 percent rate increase, the State Legislature paid Arthur Andersen about $2 million to do an exhaustive examination of Empire's management. After the examination, the accounting firm said that while Empire had some management problems, it was losing money because of "cherry-picking," the drawing away of its healthier customers by competing for-profit companies, who did not have to insure everyone.
 
Audit Called Unskeptical
 But in a section titled "Arthur Andersen: A Flawed Report," the Senate subcommittee attacked the audit as an unskeptical look at the insurance company's finances. It said Arthur Andersen failed to interview any Empire customers, or former executives who might shed light on Empire's management problems.
The subcommittee report said the accounting firm probably should not have been given the contract because it had a potential conflict of interest: its consulting arm had done work for Empire. And it quoted a partner in the firm, Eric P. Edelstein, acknowledging that one reason the firm had sought to win the contract was as a way to get business from other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
Mr. Edelstein said today that he would have no "specific comment" about the criticisms until he received a copy of the committee report. But in general, he said, "we fully stand by our work product in its entirety.
 
Entitled to Rent Limousine
 Although the report criticizes the system that regulated Empire and the accountants hired to audit the company, it saves its harshest words for the insurer itself. Empire's management is too arrogant to take blame for the problem, the report asserted, or to give up luxuries that rival those of executives at big for-profit corporations.
When his company limousine broke down, Empire's chairman, Albert A. Cardone, rented one for two months -- at a cost of $11,000, according to the report. When the subcommittee asked why he did not use one of the company's pool cars, the committee said that Mr. Cardone responded, "I was recruited by this company and I was promised a car."
Empire's board members were wined and dined at lavish retreats, where the annual themes ran from Broadway to Art Deco, the report said. At one retreat, board members received gift baskets, luggage, and Tiffany decanters. The subject of one session: "Cost Containment."
In 1990, according to the report, Empire spent $17,000 to on buy cashmere blankets for its board members. It paid $2,000 on Tiffany mugs for retired board members.
Mr. Vogt dismissed charges of excessive spending on perquisites, including the gifts to board members. "I don't believe it was extravagant," he said.
 
Unwillingness to Save
 The subcommittee has investigated other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, and the executive spending at Empire is similar to the others. Indeed, some operate even more lavishly than Empire. But the report said that the perquisites, although only a small part of the company's costs, reflected an unwillingness to contain costs.
And in the area of mismanagement and poor service, the report detailed a situation at Empire that appears far more serious than at other Blue Cross plans. The most damaging evidence came from Empire's customers, whose stories offer powerful evidence to contradict the company's assertions that it is losing money because of unfair competition from for-profit insurance companies.
Subcommittee investigators interviewed officials of 42 large companies that have left Empire for other insurers. Most left the company because of poor service or excessive prices, the report said.
 
'Dealing With a Black Hole'
 "Dealing with Empire was like dealing with a black hole," said one unnamed executive in the report. Another said: "Let me put it this way. I have a full crop of gray hair and every damned one of them came as a result of my dealings with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield."
In one case cited by the committee, an Empire customer submitted a claim for $2,600, and received four checks for $2,600 each. When she called Empire's service representatives about the mistake, she was told that this "was her lucky day" and that she should keep the checks.
Recounting how Empire came to lose $250 million in three years, the committee said, "Gross mismanagement, wasteful expenditures, fraud, and a history of inattentiveness and non-action by its board of directors and the State Insurance Department have made it critically ill."
The report also criticized Empire for awarding a highly technical, multi-million dollar computer contract to a new company set up by a board member -- a dentist with scant computer experience.
 
Odd Job for Dentist
 Empire selected Sigma Imaging Systems, headed by Dr. William N. Stratigos, after dismissing the more experienced company it had previously hired. Dr. Stratigos had also been the dentist for Edwin Werner, Empire's former chief executive, and other top company officials.
The subcommittee report said that Sigma's work, which began five years ago, was far behind schedule. In the meantime, the company that was dismissed has already completed a similar system for another company.
After reviewing the arrangement, the subcommittee concluded, "Dr. Stratigos and Sigma were awarded a very important and extremely lucrative contract without any competitive bidding and apparently only because of Dr. Stratigos' special relationship to Mr. Werner, the former C.E.O., as his personal dentist and being a voting member of the board."

HEADLINE: Annuities Help Feather Retirement Nests

BYLINE: JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Many people nearing retirement fear that if today's low interest rates continue, they will live more like paupers than princes. To be sure they will have the income they need, they are buying record amounts of variable-rate annuities, which mimic mutual funds but have the added appeal of tax deferral.
"With the expected increases in tax rates, tax deferral becomes even more significant, and people of all ages may want to consider annuities for their long-term investments," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, a Manhattan-based accounting firm. "I would first encourage clients to take full advantage of plans that use pretax dollars like a 401(k) plan," he said, "then use annuities for additional investments." 
 John Febles, president of Professional Clinical Labs, a Manhattan medical laboratory, fits the profile of the typical buyer. He is approaching 50 and looking for a comfortable retirement cushion. Having already invested his business's pension plan with Metropolitan Life, he is considering a $50,000 investment in a variable annuity from the insurer.
The annuity packs a punch from tax benefits. If it and a comparable mutual fund each grew 10 percent annually, the tax-deferred holding would be worth $208,863 when Mr. Febles is 65, but the mutual fund, assuming a 31 percent tax rate, would be worth only $136,031.
When payments were made from the annuity, he would have to pay taxes on the growth portion, but not on the part that is a return of capital.
"I'm a very conservative person," Mr. Febles said, "and I believe the Met Life annuity will provide a good retirement income with minimal risk." He said he also wanted professional financial management, so he could concentrate on his business.
Although variable annuities have an insurance "wrapper" guaranteeing their payouts, their returns come from an underlying portfolio that can include stocks, bonds and other investments managed by a brokerage house, mutual fund or professional money manager. The annuities, available from insurance companies, banks and brokers, offer holders flexibility in switching portfolios and eventually in structuring withdrawals. Furthermore, because after-tax money is used, there are no investment limits.
Sales of variable annuities rose 55 percent in the first four months of this year, to $9.525 billion from $6.150 billion a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute. They increased sixfold from $3.068 billion in 1988 to $19.469 billion last year.
Unlike fixed-rate annuities, which now yield only about 4.5 percent, variable-rate products are chalking up strong returns. Wood Logan Associates Inc. of Old Greenwich, Conn., an independent marketer of annuities and mutual funds, offers a stock portfolio managed by Goldman, Sachs that achieved a total return of 18.9 percent last year. Its global portfolio, managed by Oechsle International, grew 19.5 percent, and its moderate asset allocation fund with both stocks and bonds, managed by Fidelity Investments, grew 9.5 percent.
Despite the potential returns, variable annuities are not for everyone. One reason is that they are long-term investments that can entail expensive surrender charges if holdings are liquidated in less than seven or eight years. Also, if an investor begins withdrawals before age 59 1/2, there is a 10 percent tax penalty.
Variable annuities are particularly attractive to people who have "a very long-term investment horizon," especially those over age 50, said Tim Kochis, a partner in Kochis & Fitz, a San Francisco-based fee-only financial planning firm. "The tax-deferred compounding can continue almost indefinitely -- you don't have to start taking money out until you're 85." The I.R.S. requires that withdrawals from most retirement plans, including I.R.A.'s, begin after age 70 1/2.
If an annuity holder dies, the estate is guaranteed the original investment less any withdrawals, though some plans offer more generous terms.
Mr. Neumark, who as a benefits specialist at Weber, Lipshie, reviewed Mr. Febles's choice, said investors should take care in choosing an annuity, particularly checking out the insurer underwriting it.
"Buy only from an insurance carrier with the highest rating," from A. M. Best, Moody's or Standard & Poor's, he said.
And keep in mind that top ratings do not guarantee health. Executive Life and Mutual Benefit had high ratings before they collapsed, leaving annuity holders unsure of how much they would recover, and when.
"Then look for hidden charges for administration and surrender fees," disclosed in the prospectus, Mr. Neumark said, noting that fees can reduce an expected return by up to 2 percentage points. "And compare fund performances with the S.& P. 500" or a bond index, if appropriate. He also advised people putting in a large amount to get a disinterested expert evaluation.

HEADLINE: Dreamland, N.J.

 BODY:
It's every incumbent politician's dream -- an election-year tax cut. In New Jersey, Republicans in the State Assembly fancied that a cut in the personal income tax this year would put Gov. Jim Florio on the spot and, of course, enhance their own popularity. But the politically astute Governor has pulled a fast one and also lobbied for a tax cut -- not as big as the G.O.P.'s, but still a cut.
A scorecard may help here: Governor Florio, a Democrat, is seeking a second term. But the huge tax increase he pushed through the then-Democratic Legislature three years ago was so unpopular that a year later the Republicans won veto-proof majorities in both houses. Thus chastened, Mr. Florio is unlikely to force another showdown on taxes anytime soon. 
 The Legislature has just passed a $15.4 billion budget for the year that starts July 1. For the most part it follows Mr. Florio's January budget, except that it earmarks $150 million as a "taxpayer relief fund." The Governor calls it a "slush fund," and may yet seek to strike it out. In any event, the game is more political than fiscal.
Even the Republicans are split on this one. The leader of the Assembly wants to cut the personal income tax now. The Senate president and the Assembly Budget Committee chairman are against it. And their party's gubernatorial candidate, Christine Todd Whitman, seems to lean toward a cut, but hedges by saying she wants to see what spending would be cut or revenues raised to compensate.
It is too early to know if there is room for a tax cut in the 1994 budget, because the state's economic recovery is still hesitant. And unless the upturn gathers unexpected strength, a tax cut in 1994 would surely mean more trouble balancing the budget for 1995, when a new gap of at least $1 billion will have to be closed by one means or another.
New Jersey, like other states from coast to coast, has lately been hard pressed to balance each year's budget. In the process it has resorted to one-shot savings and gimmickry, like selling pieces of state highway to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. There will be time enough to cut taxes when budget conditions truly improve. For now, fiscal prudence says no to electioneering tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Equivalency Diploma Still Has Value

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 15 article questioning the value of the General Education Development diploma, especially relating to New York City, misses or misstates several salient points. 
 Nobody "encourages" students to drop out of school to prepare for the G.E.D. The G.E.D. becomes an option -- perhaps the only option -- for a student who has no chance of earning all the required credits for a standard diploma before reaching 21, the age at which New York State withdraws funds for school attendance.
In addition, the bulk of registrants in preparation programs for the General Education Development diploma have left school months or years before re-enrolling in a test-preparation program. Increasingly, immigrants, who enter the country far too late to complete a full high school diploma, are enrolling.
The G.E.D. is not intended as a substitute for standard high school course work. Each year, the test is "normed" by being administered to thousands of high school seniors across the United States. To receive a G.E.D. diploma, a candidate must outperform the average high school senior taking the examination.
In New York State, the required passing score is higher than in many other states, so that recipients of the diploma in New York score at approximately the 60th percentile, nationally. In short, a G.E.D. diploma means that the student has done better at reading, writing and computing than the average high school graduate across the country.
Finally, the number of students pursuing G.E.D.'s is directly related to the educational inflation that has taken place since the early 1970's. People who dropped out of high school in the 1960's could still get jobs, without high school diplomas. Today, a high school diploma -- of any kind -- is needed even for the lowest-paying job.
As Ray Domanico, director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Educational Innovation, whom you quote, pointed out, "Students leaving with a G.E.D. are better having one than not."

HEADLINE: 2 Tell Subcommittee Insurer Altered Data In Order to Mislead

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Two former employees of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield appeared before a United States Senate subcommittee today and gave the first public evidence that the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer intentionally misled the New York State Legislature and Insurance Department for years.
The witnesses said they were told by Empire's chief financial officer that loss figures sent to the state had been "manipulated" to make them "politically correct." They said they were transferred from the company's executive suite after discovering that Empire kept two sets of books. And one said that Empire officials joked about the two sets of numbers at a party. 
 The testimony of Joan Boyle, a former vice president of Empire, and William Fuessler, who worked for Ms. Boyle, came as the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a searing report that, among other things, criticized state insurance regulators who missed obvious signs of trouble at Empire. It also said that auditors hired by the state did only the most cursory of examinations.
But the report levied its harshest assessment against the insurer itself, blaming much of Empire's financial crisis on "gross mismanagement" and lavish spending. [Page 24.]
Ms. Boyle and Mr. Fuessler testified that a month before they were transferred, they had stumbled on a discrepancy between a secret set of financial documents and the reports the company had filed with the state.
Known as the "Black Book," the secret documents contained figures that showed that Empire had lost substantially less money on its high-risk accounts than the company had reported to regulators.
In documents released by the Senate today, Empire's chief financial officer, Jerry Weissman, is quoted as saying he changed numbers on financial reports at the behest of Empire's chief executive and chairman at the time, Albert A. Cardone.
Mr. Weissman could not be reached for comment today. Mr. Cardone's lawyer, Steven Thal, said that he had not had time to analyze the report and the testimony, but believed that there was an innocent explanation.
 
Losses Exaggerated
 Mr. Boyle and Mr. Fuessler made the discovery in February 1992, as Empire was in the final stages of a fierce lobbying campaign for a change in state law that would force its competitors to also accept high-risk customers.
Empire officials acknowledged last week that inaccurate numbers were sent to the state, but said they were unsure if that had been intentional.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is the chairman of the subcommittee, said that Ms. Boyle and Mr. Fuessler provided a "strong case that misleading information had been passed on to the state," and added that the panel would decide next week, after the hearings are completed, whether to refer the matter for criminal prosecution.
 
No Explanations
 The unexpected emergence of Ms. Boyle and Mr. Fuessler prompted Senate investigators to cancel the appearances today of a string of Empire officials, including Mr. Cardone. He is now to testify on Wednesday, when the hearings reconvene.
Instead, Ms. Boyle and Mr. Fuessler, whose story became known to the investigators only days ago, told a tale of intrigue in the executive offices that prompted them to leave the company within months. Neither came forward voluntarily, investigators said. Each was subpoenaed and testified with lawyers at their sides, sometimes whispering in their ears.
The first hint that something was amiss came in early 1992, when Mr. Fuessler, an accountant, was reviewing some financial documents for a presentation to company officials on executive bonuses. "I just happened to see a number that didn't look right," he recalled.
Mr. Fuessler, who had worked for Empire for about 18 months, compared the documents that had been filed with the state against a set of internal records called the Black Book, which circulated only among certain high-ranking executives.
Puzzled by discrepancies, he asked the actuarial department for an explanation, he said. But the actuaries told him they could not give an explanation and told him to consult Jerry Weissman, the chief financial officer.
Instead, he spoke to Ms. Boyle, his superior. At the time, Ms. Boyle, who had been the executive vice president and chief financial officer of the New Jersey Blue Cross plan, had worked at Empire for about three months.
Ms. Boyle said she had been familiar with the Black Book and believed that it held "the most-up-to-date figures on Empire's gains and losses," and that only Mr. Cardone and Mr. Weissman had copies.
She waited until most of the staff had gone home to confront Mr. Weissman, she recalled. "When I showed Jerry the numbers, he appeared nervous," she said. She quoted Mr. Weissman as saying, "The Black Book numbers were for internal purposes and the actuarial numbers were for external purposes."
When she asked Mr. Weissman which numbers were accurate, "He said that the Black Book figures were right and the others were more politically acceptable," she recalled.
"I was very disturbed by this and told Jerry that he had a professional obligation to consistently report accurate figures," she said, adding that Mr. Weissman then "folded his arms and told me that I should talk to Al."
The following day, she said, she confronted Mr. Cardone, who "told me he didn't know anything about it."
But Mr. Cardone added, she recalled, "Nobody knows what figures are right."
The incident was so disturbing, she said, that she went home and wrote a memo for her files about the events of the previous days. She produced the memo for the Senate investigators.
She said Mr. Cardone began treating her coolly and stopped inviting her to meetings. Within a month, she and Mr. Fuessler were moved to different jobs in another building.
Several months later, at a reception for the company's board of directors, Mr. Fuessler found himself among a group of managers who were laughing about the discrepancies. "It was taken on the light side, the fact that there were two sets of books," Mr. Fuessler recalled.
By the end of the year, both Mr. Fuessler and Ms. Boyle quit Empire.
They said they were not sure why the company kept two sets of books, but believed that the false numbers showing inflated losses on high-risk accounts were used by the company to seek rate increases from the state. The losses apparently were shifted from segments of Empire's business that are less closely regulated by the insurance department, they said.
Harold E. Vogt, Empire's chairman, said at a news conference this afternoon that the company was surprised by the testimony, and that neither he nor Donald L. Morchower, the company's acting chief executive, had ever met Ms. Boyle or Mr. Fuessler or been aware of their discovery.
Asked about the existence of two sets of books, Mr. Vogt responded: "We don't have an explanation. That's currently under investigation." And he added a little later, "If in fact we find this to be true, it doesn't paint a very good picture of how Empire handled things."
 
 
 
AT A GLANCE
GIFTS AND OTHER SPENDING AT EMPIRE
 A report released by a United States subcommitee report cited perquisites that it said reflected a "blue chip mentality of Empire executives." It said the company "operates as if it is a profitable Fortune 500 company, rather than a non-profit health insurer." Here are some of the items included in the report.
 
DIAMONDS, PEARLS AND OTHER GIFTS
About $255,000 in 1992 and more than $1.1 million over the last five years for gifts to employees from the specially designed Empire gift catalogue. They included diamond and sapphire jewelry, Waterford crystal, pearl necklaces, gold wristwatches engraved with the Empire logo, grandfather clocks, carriage clocks and wall clocks. There also were presents of up to $2,500 in cash.
 
CARTIER'S AND TIFFANY'S
About $58,000 in gifts from corporate accounts at Tiffany's and Cartier's over the last seven years to employees and others.
 
LIMOUSINES
More than $226,000 on limousines over the last six years, with $50,000 last year and $91,000 in 1991, the two years that Empire lost more than $250 million.
$11,000 was spent in two months by Albert Cardone, the former chairman and chief executive, an average of $300 a trip from his home in New Canaan, Conn., to his office in Manhattan.
 
EXECUTIVE TRAVEL
$30,000 for a Lincoln Town Car for Mr. Cardone. The company also paid for his chauffeur, who also served as an armed bodyguard.
 
PERSONAL SECURITY SYSTEM
$17,000 to install a security system at Mr Cardone's house, plus $2,000 a year in maintenance.
 
EXECUTIVE APARTMENT
$48,000 per year for a corporate apartment at the Dumont Plaza in Manhattan for the chairman's use. Empire ended the arrangement in 1989, because Mr Cardone wanted accomodations with 24-hour food service.
 
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
$3,700 for ginger jars for retired directors and $14,133 for silver punch bowls and ladles for the 19 active board members in 1991.
 
SEMINARS FOR THE BOARD
An average of about $142,000 for annual weekend seminars for board members, usually held at hotels outside of New York City. The events often had themes, like "Amadeus" in 1990. At that one, as part of its masquerade motif, almost $3,000 was spent for 147 masks and another $2,500 to decorate the room. At least $25,000 more was spent on Ghurka bags, golf umbrellas and gift baskets.
 
 
 
GLOSSARY
Insurance Terms
 High-Risk Pool: The group of 2 million New Yorkers, including the bulk of the state's oldest and sickest residents, who receive insurance from Empire, often because private companies reject them. The pool is comprised of individuals and those in groups of under 50.
 
Cherry-Picking: The practice of passing over insurance risks, like the elderly, and seeking only the healthiest customers.
 
Blue Cross Blue Shield: The trademark name for a network of 70 independent nonprofit insurers that account for 20 percent of the nation's private health insurance market. The companies are committed to insure the oldest and sickest customers, who cannot get insurance elsewhere. In return, they receive favored tax treatment and discounts.
 
For-Profit Insurers: Companies, like MetLife and Equitable, that try to generate profit for shareholders. They are often called "commercial" insurers.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 30, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about testimony given before a United States Senate subcommittee by two former employees of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield -- Joan Boyle and William Fuessler -- referred incorrectly to a statement about them from Empire's current chairman, Harold E. Vogt. He said he had never met the two, who gave the first public evidence that Empire had intentionally misled the New York State Legislature and Insurance Department. But Mr. Vogt did not say that Empire's acting chief executive, Donald L. Morchower, had never met them.

HEADLINE: Court Again Rejects a Limit on Punitive Damages

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today upheld a $10 million award of punitive damages for a $19,000 injury in a ruling that once again dashed the hopes of critics of the civil justice system who wanted the Court to place a meaningful constitutional limit on punitive damages.
The 6-to-3 ruling made little if any new law and was not supported by a single majority opinion. It was the fifth time in recent years that the Justices did not issue a definitive ruling on punitive damages after suggesting that they were troubled by the issue. 
 In a plurality opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court upheld a ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, which in turn had upheld a jury's verdict in a case involving disputed rights to an oil field in McDowell County, W. Va.
The jury found that the TXO Production Corporation, a subsidiary of the USX Corporation, acted in bad faith when it brought a frivolous lawsuit intended to deprive another company, Alliance Resources Inc., of oil and natural gas royalties that TXO had promised to pay Alliance in return for Alliance's rights to the property.
 
Legal Strategy Vindicated
 Justice Stevens said that while there was a dramatic and even "shocking disparity" between the $19,000 that Alliance spent fighting the frivolous lawsuit and the $10 million it won in punitive damages, "that shock dissipates" in light of the millions of dollars that Alliance stood to lose had it not managed to defend itself and preserve its right to the royalties.
The outcome vindicated the strategy of Alliance's lawyer, Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor whom the company hired to defend the award after the Supreme Court agreed to hear TXO's appeal.
Mr. Tribe came up with the idea of defending the award on the basis of the "expected gain" or potential harm from the thwarted fraud, a rationale that was not part of the original case and that the Court had not previously considered.
When the case was argued in March, Mr. Tribe asked the Court to disregard the fact that the punitive damage award was 526 times greater than the actual damages, and instead to consider that it was at most twice the size of the $5 million at stake in the dispute.
During the argument, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court's leading critic of punitive damages, accused Mr. Tribe of "trying to concoct something" by presenting a new theory with figures that had not been tested in the trial court. But Mr. Tribe's gambit worked, and Justice O'Connor expressed her frustration today in a dissenting opinion that described the expected gain theory as "having been produced exclusively for our consumption."
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined the plurality opinion of Justice Stevens. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy voted separately to uphold the punitive damage award, as did Justice Antonin Scalia in a separate opinion that Justice Clarence Thomas also signed. Justices Byron R. White and David H. Souter joined the dissent.
 
Insurance Fraud Case Cited
 The question in the case, TXO Production v. Alliance Resources, No. 92-479, was whether the damage award violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law either as a matter of substance or procedure.
The substantive question was whether the award was so "grossly excessive" and disproportionate to the harm as to be arbitrary and oppressive. Two years ago, in a case called Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip, the Court said the due process clause did place some outer limit on punitive damages.
In upholding an award of punitive damages in that insurance fraud case, in which the award was four times the size of the actual damages, the Court said the 4-to-1 ratio "may be close to the line." So when the Court last December agreed to hear TXO's appeal in a case with a 526-to-1 ratio, many people assumed that the Justices would find the line to have been crossed.
The award was "certainly large," Justice Stevens said. But he added that the award was justified by the amount of money at stake, the "bad faith" of TXO, that company's wealth and "the fact that the scheme employed in this case was part of a larger pattern of fraud, trickery and deceit."
The second, procedural question was whether the West Virginia Supreme Court had given meaningful appellate review to the award. Justice Stevens found that it had, despite an opinion by one of the West Virginia Justices, Richard Neely, who wrote that a "really mean" defendant like TXO deserved to be assessed punitive damages of more than 500 times the harm it caused. Justice Stevens said that Justice Neely's "colorful reference" did not determine the outcome of the case.
 
Justice O'Connor in Dissent
 In her dissenting opinion, Justice O'Connor said the Court's ruling two years ago in the Haslip case "held out the promise that punitive damages awards would receive sufficient constitutional scrutiny to restore fairness in what is rapidly becoming an arbitrary and oppressive system." But today's decision "renders Haslip's promise a false one," she said.
The search for limitations on punitive damages, both in court and through legislation, has long been on the agenda of critics of the civil litigation system. Business groups, municipalities and other defendants in punitive damages cases appeal many cases to the Supreme Court every year.
It is possible that the Justices will select one of them for another effort at addressing the issue. A case involving negligence rather than a commercial dispute would remove the factor of expected economic gain from consideration and perhaps put the defendant in a more favorable light.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
The Small-Yield and Sound-Sleep School of Investment

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:
Some investors could not care less about stocks, options or even mutual funds. They want complete safety -- a Federal Government guarantee -- and are willing to sacrifice some yield to get it.
Among these investments, the best bet is Treasury securities, with interest rates at 3.35 for one-year bills and yields at 5.10 for five-year notes. "I recommend this alternative for those seeking the highest quality, lowest-risk alternative," said Lewis J. Altfest, president of L. J. Altfest & Company, New York financial planners. 
 A big advantage of Treasury securities is that they offer interest income exempt from state and local taxes, meaning the tax-equivalent yield for people in high-tax locales like New York is even higher. They can be bought at no charge from any Federal Reserve bank or at a small fee from a brokerage firm or bank.
Another investment backed by the full faith and credit of the Government is a United States Savings Bond, available at many banks and through payroll deductions at some companies. The guaranteed interest rate on bonds held for six months or more was lowered to 4 percent from 6 percent on March 1. But investors who hold these securities for at least five years will receive a market-based rate, which is adjusted twice a year to 85 percent of the average return for five-year Treasury notes. That rate will be 4.78 percent for bonds purchased through Oct. 31.
Like Treasury securities, these bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. The Federal tax can be deferred until the bonds are redeemed. And if they are redeemed to pay for college tuition, a Federal tax break may be claimed, depending on adjusted gross income.
Bank certificates of deposit -- insured up to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- are the most convenient choice for many of the risk-averse. To get the most out of C.D.'s, whose one-year rates average 3.11 percent and five-year rates average 4.9 percent, split up the money, "laddering" the maturities.
"If you have $100,000 to invest, I would divide the assets into five parts of $20,000 each and buy five C.D.'s with maturities ranging from one year to five years," said Bill E. Carter, president of Carter Financial Management in Dallas. "If interest rates turn back up, you are not totally locked into low rates."
Janet Steig, president of the Crossroads Financial Group in Roseland, N.J., said, "You should never give up sleep at night to get return if you are not comfortable with the investment."

HEADLINE: Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, Shock Therapist

BYLINE: By Peter Passell; Peter Passell is an economics writer for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The lobby of the Metropole, Moscow's lovingly restored grand hotel a few blocks from Red Square, is almost deserted on this gray spring afternoon. That's just fine with Jeffrey D. Sachs, a boyish-looking 38-year-old Harvard professor who is now probably the most important economist in the world. He has appropriated a cluster of comfortable armchairs for a meeting with two members of his team, Americans who work full time in Russia.
The agenda is Russia's safety net or, more precisely, whether unemployed workers will be able to make ends meet. Russia is plunging out of Communism, if not directly into a capitalist free market. Whether this huge, humiliated nation will stoically bear the pain of the transition is far from clear, and the strength of the safety net could make the difference. 
 There are plenty of laws on the books, but do they count? "All Russian citizens are legally entitled to free health care," points out Judith Shapiro, a senior lecturer on policy economics who is on leave from Goldsmith College at the University of London. The catch: they often "only get what they pay for."
While employees of Government and big enterprises generally have access to adequate service at their own clinics, the less fortunate are denied modern surgery, drugs and even decent sanitation. The problem is apparently growing worse, she notes, because inflation has far outpaced physicians' salaries, which weren't high to begin with. Many are now emigrating, or deserting their posts for more lucrative jobs, like driving taxis.
Sachs's immediate concern is the implication for the Government's budget, which must be slashed in order to bring inflation under control. If much of the nation's health expenditures are now buried as fringe benefits on the books of enterprises that depend on Government subsidies, who will pick up the cost once the enterprises are forced to economize?
Getting a handle on the magnitude of the problem is obviously difficult in a country that cannot even explain why life expectancy has fallen sharply in the last two decades. But some number is better than none. And by pressing officials to address this and other pivotal issues, Sachs hopes to accelerate the pace of reform.
Sachs's message of urgency is not universally accepted. Plenty of Western as well as Russian economists contend that a more gradual approach is not only possible but necessary. "Economic reform is a political process," says Padma Desai at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. "First, you must build consensus."
And even his sympathizers acknowledge that Sachs's high profile and world-class impatience could generate a backlash in a nation still adjusting to the reality that it is no longer a superpower. "There's a real dilemma here," says Stanley Fischer, an international economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You have to make a lot of noise to get the attention of the West. But the more noise you make, the more you make it seem that the reform program is a Western program. And that could be the kiss of death."
Still, Sachs's brand of "shock therapy" has worked elsewhere. And there is good reason to believe that Russia's future will turn on how well its leaders learn the catechism of change that he has worked so hard to promulgate.
TO AN AMERICAN JADED BY THE CHOICE OF breakfast flakes with or without bran, dates, sugar-coated raisins and 12 essential vitamins, there's nothing much to tease the palate or the eye in the Gastronom Smolensk near the center of Moscow. Deli counters, dominated by slabs of butter and wheels of stuff that must be cheese, are still presided over by gorgons in white smocks. Cans of vegetables still bear labels that look like rejects from high-school print shop. Odors of sour milk, industrial cleaner and damp wool assault the senses.
But Sachs recognizes what skeptics often miss. "You should have seen these food stores before the price reforms," he exclaims. Those were the lean years of perestroika, when everything but the dregs ended up in the commissaries of the well connected or fell off the backs of trucks on the trip from the warehouse.
Yes, there still are queues. But the lines are a result of socialist retailing practices, not food shortages. Shoppers first wait to pick out items for weighing and pricing. Then it's on to the cashier's line, where, after interminable delay, they exchange their rubles for receipts. Then it's back to the food-counter line to collect their 200 grams of smoked fish or half-kilo of margarine.
But goods are largely being allocated by price, notes Sachs, "rather than by whom you know." And the daily frustrations of shopping will be eased when privatized stores discover that supermarket-style checkout saves scads of money.
It's easy to overlook the significance of these modest signs of progress, and many Russians and Western intellectuals do. In spite of the strong popular vote of confidence that Boris Yeltsin won in the April referendum, they view Sachs's relentless optimism about Russia's capacity for rapid change as a denial of the inertia of a thousand years of Slavic feudalism.
But it is precisely Sachs's impatience, bolstered by seemingly infinite energy and a sophisticated grasp of modern economics, that has made him a force to reckon with. As an adviser to reform-minded governments from Bolivia to Slovenia to Poland, Sachs led successful battles for fiscal and monetary discipline in economies written off by more cautious practitioners of the dismal science. And as a fierce advocate of international debt relief for essentially bankrupt countries, he helped break the financial gridlock that consigned Latin America to economic stagnation for much of the 1980's. Now he is prodding the radicals who sometimes have the ear of Boris Yeltsin to press their advantage while they can.
"Poland, with its reforms in place, is the fastest-growing economy in Eastern Europe," says Sachs. "If Poland can do it, so can Russia."
SACHS, A specialist in monetary theory and international finance, started down the road to fame and controversy by accident. True, he was a prodigy at Harvard, passing his general exams for a Ph.D. in economics while still in college. And he was invited to join the university's Society of Fellows, an honor that might not qualify the recipient as a Friend of Bill but confers more status in academia than a Rhodes scholarship. And he won tenure in one of the nation's best economics departments at the age of 29.
But what might have been merely a distinguished scholarly career took an abrupt turn toward the practical in 1985. Harvard was host to a group of Bolivians, Sachs recalls, including one of his former students -- "and I was the only economist on the faculty to show up."
At the time Bolivia, the poorest country in South America, was suffering what may have been the most virulent inflation any economy has ever suffered outside wartime -- an astounding 24,000 percent annual rate. When the discussion turned to the near impossibility of stabilizing prices without triggering a killer recession, Sachs demurred. The least painful way to beat inflation, he argued, was a clean break with the past, a regimen of fiscal and monetary discipline combined with an end to economic regulation that protected the elites and blocked the free market. "If you think you can do it," challenged one official, "come to Bolivia and prove it."
He did, and quickly persuaded the newly elected Government to go along. Within weeks, hyperinflation was only a bad memory. And after months of tense negotiation, the country settled its mountain of debt to international lenders for about 11 cents on the dollar. "What Bolivia showed," concludes Sachs, "is that stabilization is doable, possible, sustainable."
As Sachs is the first to admit, what later become known as shock therapy was not plucked whole from thin air -- similar approaches had more or less worked in Germany after both world wars. Sachs's special insight was that the logic could apply to economies with no collective memory of free markets or history of evenhanded rules of contract law and property rights. In fact, he is confident that revolution is the natural means of economic change. "If you look at how reform has occurred, it has been through the rapid adaptation of foreign models," he concludes, "not a slow evolution of modern institutions."
Poland's success in stabilizing its currency and jump-starting growth is potent evidence that Sachs is right. But no test could be tougher -- or more important -- than the effort to transform the Russia of Stalin, Brezhnev and Gorbachev into a prosperous, consumer-driven economy in a single generation.
THE PRESSURE IS ON this morning in Sachs's temporary Moscow headquarters, a tiny suite in the Ministry of Labor that he and his assistants share with a group from the London School of Economics, two quietly efficient translators, a welter of computer equipment and a few empty pizza boxes. (Yes, they deliver in Russia.) A more comfortable home in the Ministry of Finance is still weeks away.
Topic A is the new agreement between the Finance Ministry and the Russian Central Bank, intended to tame the inflation that is running at 20 to 30 percent a month. It is, in Sachs's view, a cancer on the economy that is close to metastasis. Sachs has been deeply frustrated by the fatalism and political drift over the past year that has brought the economy to the brink. "Nobody says that 26 percent a month inflation is deeply ingrained in the Russian soul," he scoffs.
In most successful economies the central bank acts as a bulwark against politicians who have trouble denying goodies to their constituents. But in today's Russia the roles are reversed. Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister whom Sachs admiringly characterizes as "utterly matter of fact, not prone to rhetorical flourishes," is resolved to curb the inflationary budget deficit. But Viktor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Central Bank, is an old-school bureaucrat who is publicly skeptical that capitalist monetary theory applies to the Motherland.
More to the point, Gerashchenko owes some allegiance to the Parliament, which is dominated by former Communists, pragmatic provincial pols and enterprise managers who share a common desire to keep the socialist patronage machine creaking along. And this means easy credit for giant state-owned enterprises that had always depended on a single customer -- a Moscow ministry -- to tell them what to make and where to get the materials.
Gerashchenko has also been playing Uncle Sugar to the former Soviet republics, handing out rubles to republic enterprises that are Russian industries' best -- sometimes only -- foreign customers. Sachs estimates that one-tenth of Russia's productive capacity last year was devoted to propping up the periphery of the old Soviet empire, with the ruble payments surging back to stoke the incipient hyperinflation.
Now -- thanks in no small part to Sachs's tireless lobbying -- America and the other rich countries have at long last assembled a hard-currency life raft to keep the reforms afloat. In return, the Finance Ministry has bludgeoned the Central Bank into an austerity pact designed to reduce inflation to a mere 5 percent to 10 percent a month by the end of 1993.
The bank has reluctantly promised to pare loans to the basket-case enterprises, to charge interest that approaches the rate of inflation and to leave decisions about credits for other republics to Russia's foreign-policy makers. But the Government budget must also be disciplined, and Sachs has taken on the job of outlining the cuts that Finance Minister Fyodorov could propose.
Sachs talks frequently with Fyodorov and the other dynamo of the economic reform drive, Anatoly Chubais, the chairman of the privatization agency. He has a good working relationship with other senior reformers, including Aleksandr Shokhin, a Deputy Prime Minister, and Sergei Glaziyev, the Minister for Foreign Economic Relations. But he is not an employee of the Russian Federation. "I make it a policy not to take money from the Governments that I advise," he says. "It's better for me and better for them."
Sachs does, however, need cash to cover his own travel expenses and to support a sizable staff. Over the last three years most of the money came from the United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research in Helsinki. Now a good chunk consists of grants from the Swedish Government, the United States Agency for International Development and the Ford Foundation.
The task before Sachs and his Western economists this day is to identify the most expendable items in the budget. A primary target is energy, which Russia still produces (and wastes) in abundance. How much money would a cut in consumer subsidies on natural gas save? How much would it reduce the consumption of gas -- and could the resulting surplus be sold to Europe for hard currency? Since nobody present is an energy specialist, one economist is dispatched to research the experience in the former Eastern European satellites, which were left on their own to buy oil and gas when Mikhail Gorbachev cut them free.
It will be a long day -- indeed, days -- for the group to come up with a series of suggested budget savings that might withstand scrutiny from a skeptical presidential cabinet and a hostile Parliament. But nobody is complaining: Sachs, in spite of chronic jet lag, works harder than anyone. In fact, during most semesters, he actually carries a full teaching load at Harvard, squeezing his trips abroad between classes and during breaks in the academic calendar.
Besides, Sachs is offering these mostly young economists a role in the redemption of Russia -- a heady experience for academics who might otherwise be holed up in some dusty office calculating how many parameters could dance on the head of a computable general equilibrium model.
THE SCENE IS A CLEAN, well-lighted place with comfortable blond furniture, a conference room that could be found in a dozen northern European countries. But this pleasant chamber, part of the offices of the Russian Federation's Center for Economic Reform, is within the walled compound that was one of Stalin's country homes, a 10-minute drive from the Kremlin. Across the road in a grove of white birch stands the dacha of the late, unlamented Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's ideologist in charge of purging socialist culture of bourgeois influences like Dmitri Shostakovich.
The center, which serves as a think tank for the Russian Government, holds regular seminars at the compound for the Moscow reformers, plus distinguished visitors. But the lecture that day is not inspired by pressing issues of Russia's transformation. An economist from the International Monetary Fund is amplifying his views on Spain's post-Franco conversion from stagnant, regulation-ridden state capitalism to member in good standing of the European Community.
What is Jeff Sachs doing here? Has he interrupted his Moscow workathon for a busman's holiday? Has he brought along a minivan load of his worker bees to enlighten them about Spanish steel making? "Listen to the subtext," he suggests.
It doesn't take much listening. The discussion quickly turns to the difficulties of pruning the privileges of special interests in a democracy -- and in particular, of letting big state-owned companies go bankrupt. Even when workers on unpaid furlough are counted, unemployment in Russia is now probably below 2 million out of a labor force of some 70 million. But an end to the bankrolling of dead-end enterprises this year could easily push this figure above five million, and everyone with an inkling of Russia's sad, violent history is apprehensive about the political consequences. That is why Sachs and his team are so passionate about the social safety net.
A senior Russian economist alludes to the success of Chile's reforms in the 1980's, implying that there are advantages to buttressing painful change with blood and iron. Others are impressed by China, whose octogenarian leaders have succeeded in following a capitalist line without abandoning the socialist legacy of state ownership. Sachs, who has been fiddling with his new Psion Series 3 palm-top computer, bursts into a well-practiced lecture intended to stiffen the spines of those committed to democratic capitalism.
General Pinochet was a tyrant, Sachs says, but he did represent the interests of the Chilean middle class and was thus a strong supporter of market reforms. In Russia, by contrast, an authoritarian government would undoubtedly serve as a front for the military-industrial complex, which Sachs believes is the primary obstacle to a capitalist rebirth.
China may be able to grow rapidly without shedding the burden of the industrial base that Mao built, Sachs goes on, but all the growth is taking place in the free market. China is no model for gradualism in Russia, he concludes, because the inefficient Russian state sector is so much bigger than China's and thus demands a level of care and feeding that would inevitably break the Government budget.
Now Sachs returns to the offense -- his preferred stance.
"Stabilization is good politics," he says flatly. Stable prices, preferably associated with easy convertibility of the ruble to Western currencies, he argues, would bring an enormous sense of relief. And while unemployment would exact pain, he concedes, "governments can survive high unemployment but not high inflation."
In any case, Poland's experience with shock therapy is upbeat evidence that the effect on living standards is likely to be more modest than popularly assumed. While the official Polish statistics showed output falling by a third after the shock, Sachs is certain that "the alleged drop was largely illusory." Some 700,000 small businesses sprang up in the first year of market liberalization, he estimates, employing 9 percent of the work force -- much of it off the books to avoid taxation.
Average consumption of meat and fruit, rough proxies for overall consumption, actually rose between 1989 and 1991. So, too, did the number of cars, washing machines, color TV's and VCR's owned by the typical household.
Plainly, there are losers -- mostly employees of the grotesquely inefficient heavy industries -- and they constitute a powerful constituency. Indeed, just last month Solidarity displayed its displeasure with reform by deserting the ruling coalition and bringing down the Government. But the numbers, Sachs argues, should be put in perspective. "Unemployment, while high," he concludes, "did not rise beyond levels familiar in Western Europe."
The first goal for reformers, says Sachs, is to get across the message that democracy and capitalism are inextricable. Sachs, as a matter of principle, refuses to advise unelected governments: When approached by Poland's Communist junta to help renegotiate the country's foreign debts, he turned them down flat. Sachs's unbending stand, one must assume, has more than a little to do with the experience of his wife, Sonia Ehrlich, a pediatrician in Cambridge, Mass., who fled Communist Czechoslovakia with her family at age 12.
The Russian researchers accept Sachs's interpretation of Chile and China without complaint, though it is difficult to know whether they are convinced or simply unaccustomed to challenging authority. At lunch over borscht, pork cutlets and cheese pastries, all the talk is about who is winning and who is losing at which ministries.
THE STATUE OF FELIKS Dzerzhinsky may be long gone from its pedestal in front of Lubyanka prison. Moscow's upwardly mobile may swarm McDonald's each day for a chance to savor two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun. But time stands still in the anteroom of the former Central Committee building. Stonefaced guards in starched uniforms stare sullenly at the Americans walking the richly paneled, red-carpeted halls.
They may be sullen, but they know an order when they hear one. Once the proper permissions have been logged, Sachs is free to lead his small contingent to the cluttered office of Maksim Boiko, adviser to the chairman of the Committee on State Property Management. Sachs is paying a quick call on the Russian privatization agency), both to keep Boiko abreast on the latest monetary machinations and to lend moral support to the embattled agency.
The agency and its hard-driving chairman, Anatoly Chubais, whom Sachs labels "a freedom fighter," have been under attack by Parliament. The old guard wants to slow the privatization, or at least funnel more of the gravy to friends.
While the mechanics at the local level have proved more laborious than expected, there is apparently little popular resistance to small-scale privatization outside agriculture. Some 60,000 little businesses have been sold, and the pace shows no sign of slowing. In fact, a series of cross-cultural surveys conducted by Boiko along with Robert Shiller of Yale and Vladimir Korobov of the Kherson Pedagogical Institute strongly suggest that Russians are as enterprising as Westerners, and even as accepting of the vicissitudes of free markets. Russians are merely more suspicious that the rules will be rigged against them.
The decisive political battle on privatization (and perhaps the entire economic reform effort) will not be over the fate of small businesses, however. It will turn on the privatization of the larger enterprises, particularly the ones that equipped the Red Army with the latest weaponry. Many have been formally converted to joint-stock companies, and Russians have all been given vouchers that they can use to bid for shares. A recent showcase sale of ZIL, the conglomerate that made the stretch limos used by Kremlin big shots, was widely acknowledged a big success.
But Chubais's enemies have, for the moment, managed to exempt a good chunk of transportation, energy and high-technology enterprises from the auction block. And hand-wringing over the fate of these ersatz jewels in socialism's crown strains Sachs's steady affability. Concern for these mega-enterprises is motivated by "a mix of self-serving politics and wishful thinking," he says with scorn.
The output of the giant factories that had been integrated into the planned economy of Russia fell sharply in the last year, as it did in most of the industrial establishments of post-Communist Eastern Europe. And critics, Western and otherwise, cite this as evidence that shock therapy is a failure. Indeed, the conventional wisdom after Poland's sweeping reforms in 1990 was that collapsing output proved shock therapy was . . . well, too shocking. By the same logic, many analysts have linked the survival of an orderly Russian transition to a deal with the "centrists" in Parliament who represent the mega-enterprises.
"You just can't leap from here to there," argues Stephen F. Cohen, the director of Russian Studies at Princeton University, "and Yeltsin knows it." While Cohen acknowledges that Russians now accept the idea that free markets are needed to bring the nation to Western living standards, he thinks there is little support for changes that would shut down giant industrial employers. "The state sector will remain large: it's a tradition," he says, one that will not be broken by democratic means.
But Sachs notes that falling production of unwanted goods -- steel plate for tanks no longer being built, chemicals made so inefficiently that the finished products are worth less on world markets than the raw inputs -- does not reduce human welfare. In fact, he thinks it is critical that the military-industrial complex be left to fend for itself in order to free capital and skilled labor for market-driven development.
Sachs is also more optimistic than his critics about the capacity of some Russian enterprises to swim with the foreign sharks. In fact, he sees an industrial comeback worthy of postwar Japan. Russian industrial exports now total about $5 billion. "I'll bet they reach $50 billion by the turn of the century."
IT IS ALMOST TIME for Sachs to board a Swissair jet for Zurich (business class). There he will connect for the 6,000-mile flight for Sao Paulo, where he has been invited to spend a few days proselytizing shock therapy. Then it's on to Tokyo. Sachs, who seems to spend a quarter of his life on airplanes, usually orders the vegetarian plate.
But before leaving, he squeezes in an hour for cruising the Arbat, a once-quaint shopping street that has become a flea market. Tourists can buy everything here, from trash art to Red Army colonels' caps to a pensioner's family jewels. And the raw bargaining brings a rare glimpse of the material side to Sachs. "My wife hates it when I shop for bargains," he confides -- his gain, she reasons, must come at the expense of sellers who live on far less.
Sachs does like collecting old currency, and he is besieged by dealers. Here, in clear plastic envelopes, are rubles issued by the czars -- orders to pay proclaimed by absolute rulers with an absolute faith in their own legitimacy and that of their bank notes. Here, too, is the new money of the 1917 revolution, whose denominations, Sachs points out, quickly grew to six figures during the years of the Bolsheviks' fight for control. It is a sobering deja vu: a ruble, which had roughly the purchasing power of a dollar at the beginning of the Gorbachev era, is now worth less than a penny. And 10,000-ruble notes are now circulating on the streets.
Will the hopes of Yeltsin's reformers be smashed (as were those of Gorbachev's) against a wall of mismanagement, avarice and cynicism? "Big economies are harder to change than little ones," Sachs readily concedes. This evangelist for democratic capitalism leaves no doubt where he wants the Russian people to go. The giant question is whether they are prepared to follow.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Bradlees at Atlantic Center;
Retailing Opens a New Front in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE unflattering term applied in development circles to the suburban discount merchandisers who are tirelessly on the lookout for sites in the metropolitan area is "big box users."
"They are always looking for big square footage on one floor, surrounded by five acres of parking," says Bruce Ratner, president of Forest City Ratner Company, the developer of Metrotech in downtown Brooklyn. And, in New York City, not finding it. 
 But Forest City has persuaded Bradlees, the soft-goods chain from Braintree, Mass., to accept a two-level store -- with underground parking but no on-site surface parking -- in the commercial portion of Atlantic Center, the 24-acre mixed-use development in the Atlantic Terminal urban renewal area in central Brooklyn.
Forest City will go into construction this fall on a store for Bradlees of 150,000 square feet on two levels (some may even go on a third level). The underground parking is for 366 cars. The store will open late next year or early in 1995.
As part of the same phase of construction, Forest City will also start another two-level retail facility, with 120,000 square feet and most likely a supermarket as the tenant on the first level. It will have underground parking for 120 cars.
The architects for these stores are Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut of Manhattan and Planned Expansion Group of White Plains. Stanton Eckstut, the design architect, promised a design that reflects the railroad history associated with the site, one that "urbanizes these suburban users."
For all the expansion of the large-scale discount retailers in New York City lately, perhaps none is so telling from a land-use standpoint as their arrival at Atlantic Center, which lies at the terminus of the Long Island Rail Road in Brooklyn, where major throughfares and subway lines converge. It signifies a sharp turn from the 80's to the 90's in how developers conceive a large-scale urban site can be utilized.
And it brings to an end almost 40 years of uncertainty on the use of land that Brooklyn's leaders in the 50's hoped would appeal to a Dodgers team restless with Ebbetts Field. The Dodgers left for Los Angeles, but the urban renewal work that started with a stadium in mind plodded onward.
Change is discernible in the planning for housing as well as commercial uses at Atlantic Center, both of which follow the arrival of Forest City as partner of Rose Associates as developer of the urban renewal land. The housing plan done for Rose in a different housing era by Skidmore Owings & Merrill called for duplex condominiums around an internal mews with grouped open parking. Instead, there are to be three-family town houses with parking at the rear on the owner's land.
Forest City plans to break ground in September or October on the first phase, comprising 42 three-family houses, each for a buyer and two renters. They have been designed by Carl Meinhardt of the firm of Swanke Hayden Connell Architects with distinctively brownstone elements that will make them seem at home in their Fort Greene neighborhood.
EVENTUALLY there will be 122 houses in three- or four-family buildings, with a total of 440 units. That compares with 640 units in the Skidmore plan, in which half the apartments were one-bedrooms or studios. Though the number of units is lower in the new plan, the apartments will be larger, reflecting the greater marketability of the three-family form to larger families. All the units will have two or three bedrooms.
But the commercial phase, which is off Flatbush Avenue between Atlantic Avenue and Hanson Place, is drastically diminished in scale from the 80's plan. Rose was hoping to produce 1.8 million square feet of office space, a 4,000-seat multiscreen theater, a 50,000-square-foot supermarket, a 53,500-square-foot health club and a 1,000-car parking garage. Allied with this would have been only 205,000 square feet of retail space. The plan was approved by city government after land-use review.
Forest City Ratner is the New York affiliate of Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, a national building company. In a second retail phase, it plans 190,000 square feet of stores between Flatbush Avenue and Fort Greene Place, with Atlantic Avenue on the south and Hanson Place on the north. The two phases together are likely to produce no more than 10 stores, and probably fewer, for a total of 410,000 square feet of retail use.
THERE is a Phase 3 lurking in the future, and that could be 1.2 million square feet of office space. But even if it is all built, the total development would be half a million square feet smaller than the original plan.
Bradlees is the company that bid unsuccessfully against the Caldor Corporation for six former Alexander's department stores in the metropolitan area. Caldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., has already started reconstructing the 200,000-square-foot store on Bruckner Boulevard off White Plains Road in the Soundview section of the Bronx (which was a Korvette's and TSS store in earlier incarnations), and the 183,000-square-foot Flushing store (once an S. Klein's and later a Korvette's), and the five-level 300,000-square-foot Alexander's store on Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.
In Yonkers, Caldor bought a multilevel Alexander's store and later leased it to Bradlees, which has opened its first multilevel store there. Future Caldor construction is planned at the former Alexander's store on Queens Boulevard in Rego Park, Queens, and in Valley Stream, L.I.
None of these projects involve the establishment of a new retail location, as at Atlantic Center. "Retailing is what it should have been," in Mr. Ratner's view. "This is a great retail hub."
From the tax standpoint, the new stores are likely to be most productive to New York City from sales tax revenue rather than property taxes. Because the location is a "special abatement area," property taxes on the building are abated for 23 years. But sales taxes at 8 1/4 percent on projected revenue of perhaps $30 million to $40 million a year would be substantial.
Mr. Eckstut, the architect, noted that all the stores would be entered from the street rather than from an interior mall and would use building materials compatible with their Brooklyn surroundings.
"We're determined to build a store that is sympathetic to its urban environment, not just a suburban store plopped down on a city street," said Paul A. Travis, executive vice president of Forest City Ratner.
As for the revised housing plan, it appears to reflect not so much a market change but rather the only recently acquired ability to provide buyers of city-assisted three-family houses with mortgages. Mortgages to home owners who have two renters in their houses have only recently been approved by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).
This breakthrough on the financing side makes it possible to produce fee-simple houses with parking on the owner's property at the rear of the house, said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York Housing Partnership, which acts as intermediary for private development of for-sale housing on city-owned land. The Atlantic Center housing has Federal, state and city assistance.
The three-family house tends to widen the market by bringing in intergenerational buyers -- relatives living in private units of the same house. Also, under the underwriting standards, full value is to be given to rental income in calculating the financing for which a buyer qualifies. Buyer income is likely to be limited to about $70,000 a year (165 percent of areawide median income) and Forest City said prices should be approximately $210,000 a house. But prices will not be definite until sales begin, probably in the fall.
Another way of looking at the housing redesign is that more money will go into the house itself -- in the form of larger living unit -- and less into site improvements. And the third rental unit makes for greater affordability for family buyers, widening the potential pool of buyers.

Security Refund
 
Question: I have rented an apartment in a rent-stabilized building for about 25 years. I initially paid two months' security and upon each two-year renewal of the lease I also paid an additional amount to bring the security in line with the increased rent.
About a year or so ago, though, I believe a law was enacted that stated that only one month's security was necessary. Since then I have tried to get one month's security returned to me, but the owner informed me that I'm not entitled to a refund since the law stated two months when I moved in. 
 This seems very unfair. Am I right? . . . Elizabeth Buckley, Brooklyn
 
Answer: According to Lou J. Ganim, a spokesman for the state's Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees rent regulation and stabilization, the law requiring only one month's security was changed in 1987. But a section of it states that if the initial lease required two months' security and the tenant has continually occupied the apartment, then the two months' security deposit requirement continues.
 
Working Fireplaces
 
Question: In August 1990, I bought a condominium in Hoboken, N.J., with two fireplaces. I was told before the purchase by the seller-developer and the agent that they could not be converted into working fireplaces. But after I bought the unit and met the upstairs owner-tenants I learned that their fireplaces had been converted and were working.
The upstairs neighbors, however, said that they would want a huge "inconvenience fee" if I desired to convert my fireplaces.
At the time of the purchase there was not a proper board or management in place, except the developer. It also appears that the developer worked on other fireplaces without local permits. I want fireplaces. Do I have any recourse? . . . Richard DeVita, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. According to Ronald A. Sher, a White Plains lawyer, a basic tenet of condominium law in both New York and New Jersey holds that the unit owner may possibly seek recourse against the developer based upon a material misrepresentation or the failure to disclose a prior purchase inducement or incentive.
"The imposition of an inconvenience fee is apparently improper, although the unit owner may be responsible for expenses regarding the fireplace conversion," he said.
Mr. Sher added that the condominium declaration and bylaws must be reviewed since chimneys are normally considered part of the common elements and unit owners are usually granted an easement in common with all other units regarding common elements.
Further, Mr. Sher said the unit owner should contact the local building department regarding code requirements, as well as arrange with the condominium board for an inspection of the chimney stack and fireplace to ascertain the feasibility and scope of the project.
 
Storage-Space Rights
 
Question: I have lived in a building for 21 years, first as a tenant and later as a co-op owner. All these years I stored my trunks in the storage room provided by the building, even though I know that trunks are forbidden by the fire law.
Now the co-op board has decided that no more storage space will be available except through the renting of lockers that it is going to install.
Can it just revoke my rights of 21 years? Is this legal? . . . Albertine van Thiel, Manhattan.
 
Answer: Yes. According to Stuart Saft, a Manhattan lawyer and chairman of the Council of New York Co-operatives, it is legal.
"The board has complete descretion over the operation and management of the building," he said.
Mr. Saft added that the situation might be different for renters, as it would entail a reduction of services, and thus possibly the need for some sort of reimbursement or replacement of services.
"But once you bought your unit," he said, "your rights as a renter ended."

HEADLINE: Interpreting: a Business Spurred by Diversity

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE increasing ethnic and racial diversity of New Jersey has produced a huge demand for interpreting and translating services in courts, state agencies and corporations, officials and business executives say.
With scores of multinational corporate headquarters now nestled in New Jersey's suburbs, and with large communities of non-English-speaking Hispanic, Asian and other immigrants settling in the state's urban centers, this demand has led to the creation of hundreds of agencies that use the services of thousands of independent interpreters and translators. 
 In fact, the interpreting industry has grown so large so fast that it may now be experiencing some growing pains.
In the past, people who claimed to be fluent enough in English and another language could simply place their names on a list to be called on by the court to interpret. Now, some of the state's counties are preparing lists of "approved" interpreters who have passed tests demonstrating their skills; only those on the lists will be allowed to work in the courts. And the Administrative Office of the Courts is planning to adopt the practice statewide.
 
Concerned Over Audits
 At the same time, representatives of interpreting agencies say they are concerned over a number of audits of agencies being conducted by the State Department of Labor. The representatives say they fear that the department will require that all agencies pay unemployment compensation and temporary disability taxes on the freelance interpreters and translators they use. Such a requirement, they say, could put many smaller agencies out of business.
 
Bill for Exemption on Tax
 Officials at the Department of Labor say no such requirement is being considered. But last week, at industry urging, a Bergen County state senator introduced legislation that would specifically exempt interpreting agencies from paying unemployment and disability taxes.
Alan Ashkinaze, an industry lobbyist, said the individual translators and interpreters are often listed with a number of different agencies, which refer them to companies or courts as the need arises. For many, such assignments are their primary source of income, while for others they represent a second income.
Over the last 10 years, state officials say, the number of people needing interpreters in the courts has nearly doubled.
"There's just a tremendous influx of folks from around the globe who don't speak English well enough to get by in court without an interpreter," said Robert Joe Lee, chief of the Court Interpreting, Legal Translating and Bilingual Services Section of the Administrative Office of the Courts.
In 1983, Mr. Lee said, the state's Superior Courts used court interpreters 27,888 times; by 1992, the number had reached 49,094.
In the state's municipal courts, he said, the increase has been even greater. "We don't have actual numbers, but our projection for 1992 was that the volume was about 126,188 events in municipal courts," he said. In 1983 there were 59,688 instances in which court interpreters were used.
 
Difficulty in Adapting
 James W. Hughes, an associate dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said he was not surprised.
"You have an immigrant base that now comes from poorer countries whose legal systems might be quite different from ours," Mr. Hughes said. "They have a little more difficulty adapting to our system." Between 1980 and 1990, he said, the Hispanic population in the state grew by 50 percent, while the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders rose by 162 percent.
Industry officials say they have no objection to the state testing programs for court interpreters and translators as long as the testing is fair and consistent.
"It's sorely needed," said Joseph A. Murphy, president of the Bergen Language Institute Inc., an interpreting and translating agency based in Teaneck. "It's a good goal to try to find some way to evaluate people as to their professional ability and their expertise."
What troubles the industry, however, is the possibility that the State Department of Labor might begin to classify freelance interpreters as employees for purposes of assessing unemployment compensation taxes.
Such a move, said Mr. Ashkinaze, the industry lobbyist, would "wipe out a cottage industry."
 
Paying Their Own Taxes
 As it now stands, he said, individual interpreters and translators are treated by both the Federal and state governments as independent contractors for tax purposes. As such, they are responsible for paying taxes on the money they receive.
Under New Jersey law, said Steven R. Weinstein, a Newark lawyer who specializes in labor and employment law, an independent contractor is an individual who is free from the supervision and control of the agency that hires him, who performs his work outside the business office of the referring agency and who is engaged in an independently recognized trade, craft, profession or business.
If translators or interpreters were to be treated as employees rather than independent contractors, Mr. Weinstein said, the agency that hires them would have to pay 3 percent of their gross wages to the state for unemployment compensation and temporary disability taxes.
"Three percent may not sound like a lot of money, but they can go back five years, and then it becomes very substantial," he said, referring to the time frame within which the Department of Labor may audit a company's books. In addition, he said, many agencies work on such small profit margins that even 3 percent could make them unable to compete with out-of-state agencies that do not have to pay the taxes.
"It could also have a ripple effect," Mr. Weinstein said. "If they're employees for these purposes, do we have to provide them with workers' compensation coverage? Do we have to make state and Federal withholdings? Do we have to make FICA contributions?"
 
'A Natural Reaction'
 Mr. Murphy of the Bergen Language Institute said a requirement to pay unemployment compensation for his freelancers would "significantly change" the way he does business.
"In my company we translate and interpret 58 languages," he said. "I only have a few people on staff, and the 58 languages are taken care of with a network of about 600 translators I have around the country." If unemployment compensation had to be paid, he said, "it would be a natural reaction for agencies like mine not to ask any New Jersey translators to work for them."
Carmen Barros, the owner of International Interpreters, a small interpreting company in Hackensack, said that she used 50 or 60 interpreters and that the unemployment compensation requirement would have a significant effect on her business. "Just the accounting you would have to do is incredible," she said. "And if you take into consideration the fact that most people who have small agencies do everything themselves, they wouldn't be able to operate."
Gene Herman, a spokesman for the State Department of Labor, said that the Division of Employment Security Revenue was now auditing only one interpreting agency. That agency, which he declined to name, is being audited because a claim for unemployment benefits was filed against the company.
In the course of that audit, Mr. Herman said, "the Division of Employment Security Revenue determined that there is a relationship that is an employer-employee relationship." The audit covered only this year and last year, he said, and "the division has no intention of expanding it beyond that."
The division, he added, "has no indication that other firms are not in compliance with the law."
Mr. Weinstein, however, said he has personal knowledge of four agencies that are now being audited by the division. "One is my client," he said, "and there are three others that I know of. And in my client's case, they've gone back five years." He refused to name the agencies.
Donna Siegel Moffa, a Haddonfield lawyer who also specializes in labor law, said she has a client who is being actively audited by the division. "It started out with one year, and now they're asking for five years back."
The legislation to exempt the interpreting industry was sponsored by State Senator Gerald Cardinale, Republican of Demarest.
Mr. Weinstein said: "Rather than fight this out through litigation, we think it's ripe for clarification by the Legislature. We're dealing with a number of small businesses here. These are mostly minority-owned or female-owned businesses, and they provide a lot of jobs in the New Jersey economy."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Familiar Score: Perception 1, Reality 0

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
SCRATCH any market participant, and you're sure to find something of a hysteric, braced to think the worst on the slightest bit of bad news.
That fact emerged resoundingly over the past two weeks, as currency traders holding yen made a dash for the exits after a Japanese political revolt doomed Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's Government, threatening decades of rule by his Liberal Democratic Party.
For five months, economic fundamentals -- from the Japanese trade surplus to signs of economic recovery -- had helped push the dollar down against the yen, to a record close of 105.08 yen. But on June 18, when Mr. Miyazawa lost a vote of confidence in the Japanese Diet, traders threw out fundamentals, pushing the dollar up more than three yen. 
 Oops. Last week, the traders reversed again. The yen rally revived, as traders sold dollars and bought Japanese currency. By Friday, the dollar was trading just above 106 yen, near its level when the crisis erupted.
The selloff was "largely a knee-jerk reaction," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. Indeed, none of the fundamentals -- from the trade surplus to the recovering economy -- changed in the Diet vote. And near-term fiscal policy in Japan was already set with passage of a budget and a supplement.
Many currency traders knew that. But they, like most everyone in the markets, are prisoners of perceptions that often outweigh reality.
Think of a trader who, convinced that the Diet vote should have little effect on the yen's value, did not change positions. By week's end, that fictitious (or now unemployed) trader had a loss. Meanwhile, many of those traders who rode the perception that political turmoil in Tokyo meant currency chaos won profits.
Perception could well prove its importance again this week, with Friday's release of American unemployment figures for June. Last year, when those were announced, a firestorm erupted. Unemployment grew to 7.8 percent in the month, from 7.5 percent in May 1992, the Government announced, with employment down 117,000 jobs. Minutes later, the Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate, and the markets moved accordingly.
White House advisers split about how positive then-President Bush should be, with some arguing the figures did not reflect reality. Later, they were proved right: Revisions showed employment down only 16,000 jobs that month.
But perception was what mattered, helping win bond traders millions of dollars, and Bill Clinton the White House.
This week, the new figures arrive as Mr. Clinton's budget rolls through Congress. If bad, they're sure to be used against the package's tax increases -- even if they are inaccurate.
Mr. Clinton could always argue about the numbers' reliability. But perhaps last year's experience has taught him the lesson every bond trader will apply: When you want to play to win, play to perceptions.

HEADLINE: Betting the Farm on Managed Care

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
FOR an idea of what's coming in health care, we leave Hillary Rodham Clinton's recently disbanded task force and join Lawrence P. English's Connecticut-based army as it advances on the New York metropolitan region. Mr. English, a division president at the Cigna Corporation who commands 25,000 employees, is leading a bet-the-company drive to become a dominant force in the new world of "managed care" health plans. New York is his next big battleground.
His troops, it seems, are everywhere: 
 * In the Bronx, one of his 38 New York salesmen, a dapper 28-year-old named Art Howard, is busy reassuring employees at a small business that they can expect top-flight care now that they are enrolled in Cigna's medical network. Mr. Howard is a veteran at calming employers with promises of lower medical premiums while soothing workers concerned that managed care means callous care.
* Across the metropolitan area, Cigna representatives led by Dr. Jonathan S. Kaplan have been calling on more than three dozen hospitals and hundreds of doctors, asking them to join the network as well.
* In Great Neck, L.I., Mildred Tanner, a stout, forceful nurse, is on the phone, trying to gather enough information for a ruling on whether to pay for rehabilitation of a stroke victim and a heart transplant for a priest. In the next cubicle, another nurse is authorizing brain surgery for a man with AIDS. Altogether, six nurses track treatments ordered by Cigna's growing web of physicians, now more than 3,000 in New York and its suburbs.
* At health-care headquarters just outside Hartford, more than 2,000 workers in vast rooms are processing medical information, many of them crunching numbers to estimate what Cigna is paying out in claims and what it will charge customers in the coming year.
Cigna's invasion of New York is a vivid example of a revolution taking place nationwide in the health-care industry regardless of whether proposals for reform go anywhere in Washington. Like electrical utilities at the turn of the century or cable-television operators today, Cigna and its competitors are rushing to organize networks that they hope will generate big money for decades to come.
 
Emerging Giants
 In just a few years, experts say, perhaps five to eight medical networks run by insurance giants or other health-care businesses will dominate the New York metropolitan region. They will have enormous power over who gets what kind of medical care, how much the providers of care are paid, and whether medical costs can be satisfactorily controlled.
But for the insurance companies, medical networks also represent a substantial gamble. They are extremely expensive to set up, the competition is fierce, and the industry is uneasy about the possibility of government price controls that could squeeze profits. "The $64,000 question is whether you can deliver better care at lower cost and make a profit," said Michael Frinquilli, an insurance analyst with Salomon Brothers. "Price controls or competition might make the margins on this business too thin."
Cigna hopes within five years to increase its share of managed-care customers in southern New York State to more than 1 million from the current 55,000, and produce annual revenues here of more than $1.5 billion in today's dollars. One person who has studied Cigna's plans for New York said the company hoped to pay no more than 84 percent of its premiums on medical claims, and maintain administrative costs at 10 percent. Cigna would pay about 3 percent in taxes, so the company would reap a profit of 3 percent, or more than $40 million a year in the New York market alone. (The current margin on Cigna's managed care is lower.)
The growth of medical networks like Cigna's has already had enormous repercussions in the New York area. Some employers, workers and physicians are quite satisfied. But Cigna must contend with patients who worry about being forced to find a new physician because their old one is not in the network; with doctors unhappy about Cigna's limits on their fees and proposed treatments, and with hospitals that fret that they will not be paid enough to continue training doctors and providing care for the poor.
There is also a widespread uneasiness about the way medical networks like Cigna's pay their participating physicians. Doctors have long been paid more for doing more; now, because of a flat fee per patient system, they can actually profit more when they do less.
Finally, critics of the way medical networks are evolving argue that any cost savings are illusory, that savings squeezed from doctors and hospitals are lost in, among other things, higher administrative costs.
Many of the medical networks across the country are expected to be operated by five insurance giants: Cigna, Prudential, Aetna, Travelers and Metropolitan Life. In the New York region, other major contenders include the networks operated by Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (H.I.P.), U.S. Healthcare, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Oxford Health Plans.
Under managed care, an employer pays a fee to a medical network, usually called a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization. Employees are given a list of doctors in the network, who in return for the referral of patients have agreed to limit their fees and to clear all major treatments with the network before performing them.
 
Cigna's Stake
 More than any other large insurance company, the Cigna Corporation, a $19 billion publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has staked its future on managed-care networks. "We are rapidly moving from the insurance business to becoming a health-care delivery system," said Mr. English, president of Cigna Employee Benefits Companies. "New York, because of its size, is critical to us," he added.
Since 1984, Cigna has organized about 150 networks that together serve more than 2.6 million people nationwide. The company will not say how much it has invested in managed care. But after years of losses, the managed-care operations are now profitable, and health plans are responsible for the lion's share of the company's earnings.
Indeed, Cigna, whose property-casualty business is doing poorly, lacks the profit centers that other insurance behemoths have. If it fails in managed care, analysts say, it has almost nothing to fall back on.
The New York market has long resisted managed care. Many doctors in the area are specialists associated with teaching hospitals who refuse to be organized by an outside institution. Many hospitals are less profitable than in other regions and resist giving discounts. Complex regulations have scared off some network operators. In addition, the initial investment in networks in such a populous region is huge.
But in the last 18 months, sharp rises in premiums for traditional health insurance plans have forced companies to start looking for cheaper alternatives. Then, on April 1, a change in New York State law required insurers to offer the same rates to all companies, no matter how sick or healthy their workers are. One result is that many employers' premiums have jumped, making them more eager to look for lower rates.
"Two years ago, the attitude was so negative we couldn't even get in the door," said Bill Corba, the sales manager for Cigna in New York, who has just trained 30 salespeople to begin work this week. Now, "our phones just keep on ringing."
 
The Wider Impact
 Cigna's managed-care network has already been felt in many ways in the New York region.
Some employers are converts. The Nobody Beats the Wiz chain of electronics stores moved to Cigna on March 1 with 2,100 employees, including 1,500 in New York. The company had found that most of its workers could no longer afford its traditional insurance plan, on which they were asked to pay half the premium. So the company offered them a choice of Cigna plans, including an H.M.O. with rates 30 percent lower. The number of workers who signed up for health insurance nearly doubled, to 60 percent of the Wiz work force.
"For many, it is their first experience with managed health care and the reaction is very favorable," said Ralph Bulle, vice president for human resources at Wiz Distributors.
In the South Bronx, the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a nonprofit housing-development company that can no longer afford traditional insurance, will switch to Cigna on Thursday.
But its president, Wendy Seligson, is wary. Cigna pays many of the doctors in its network in the following way: the doctors are paid on a fee-for-service basis for the first 50 patients they agree to care for. After that, they're paid between $9.50 and $58 per patient per month for additional patients -- no matter how sick the patient may be that month and no matter how much work the doctor does. In fact, the less work the doctor does, the lower his or her costs, and the more money the doctor pockets.
Banana Kelly recently abandoned another managed-care plan whose doctors, workers say, sometimes did not return calls. "My concern is that the doctors have the wrong incentives," Ms. Seligson said, "that they will take on too many patients and our workers will not be satisfied."
At a recent meeting, Mr. Howard, the Cigna salesman, told Banana Kelly employees that they would have to choose a primary-care physician from a Cigna-approved list. Regina Franklin's hand shot up. For years she had suffered from severe asthma, and visited doctor after doctor until she found one who listened and found a medication that helped. He was not on the Cigna list, so now she would have to start looking again.
"I have little trust in doctors," she said. "It's real important that I have a doctor I'm comfortable with."
Mr. Howard persuaded Ms. Franklin to urge her doctor to apply to join the Cigna network. As more doctors hear such pleas from patients, Mr. Howard said later, they will come to realize they must either participate in networks like Cigna's or see their income decline.
 
Pressure on Doctors
 Indeed, the pressures to join networks and accept lower fees are growing for primary-care physicians -- internists, pediatricians and family practitioners. But eventually economic forces may take their heaviest toll on highly trained specialists and subspecialists whose numbers, at least in Manhattan, are far greater than the needs of managed-care networks, said Michael A. Stocker, president of Cigna Healthplans. For example, he said, some hematologists and gastroenterologists here may have to retrain for other specialties.
On the other hand, some doctors, particularly young primary-care physicians seeking to expand their practices, speak highly of their business partnership with a company that sends patients their way.
"I am getting a younger, somewhat healthier group of patients," said Dr. Kenneth R. Ackerman, an internist in Great Neck who joined the Cigna network a year ago. "People from law firms, accounting firms. They are more interested in preventive care. For me, it's more fun."
But Dr. Sergio Piomelli, director of hematology and oncology at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan, said the doctors in his group practice are extremely nervous, not so much about a loss of income as about the prospect that patient care will suffer.
In several cases, he said, he has seen networks refer children with rare blood and bone diseases to less expensive local hospitals where the proper diagnosis was missed or where advanced treatments were not even available.
"I fear there is more rigidity in these plans than there should be," he said, while conceding that the physicians in his practice would have to sign up for networks to stay afloat.
Anxiety has spread to some hospital administrators as well. Cigna pays hospitals in the New York area as little as $600 a day for its patients. Some teaching hospitals say their costs per patient are more than twice that high. But as their physicians join networks like Cigna's, the hospitals feel compelled to join, or face the prospect of growing numbers of patients being referred elsewhere.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said hospitals in New York have far narrower profit margins than those in other states.
The leaders of several teaching hospitals that have signed agreements with Cigna -- Columbia Presbyterian, Mount Sinai and Long Island Jewish -- warned that as they are pressed to give discounts to network patients, they may have to cut programs for the training of interns and residents, as well as care for the poor. Or, the taxpayer might have to bear more of such costs.
"Academic health-care centers are a national resource and we just can't compete on cost with nonacademic hospitals," said Dr. William T. Speck, president of Columbia Presbyterian.
But a nearly religious calm prevails at the offices of Cigna's medical director for the New York area, Dr. Kaplan, whose team oversees medical decisions for New York patients. Workers at the office in Great Neck glow with faith that they are transforming medicine for the better.
Dr. Kaplan said there is protection for patients in a system in which doctors can profit by doing less. Cigna frequently surveys patients about the care they received, and checks doctors' records for signs of cutting corners or inappropriate treatment, he explained.
Teaching hospitals, Dr. Kaplan added, will have to learn to be more efficient. But Cigna, which needs to sign up such prestigious institutions in order to attract customers, is also paying them considerably more than $600 per day per patient.
Perhaps the most difficult task for Dr. Kaplan's team is deciding when to authorize extremely expensive or experimental therapies with only a small chance of doing any good.
One day recently, Ms. Tanner, a nurse who spent more than two decades working in long-term-care facilities, was asked to approve a long rehabilitation program in a hospital for a stroke victim. The family wanted to try everything. But Ms. Tanner wanted to know whether less expensive therapy at home would work.
"The doctor may be thinking that a hospital is better because he can control things there -- that is his milieu," Ms. Tanner said. "If I approve hospitalization for somebody with limited rehab potential, I am not really doing anything for anybody. There is only so much pie to cut up."
At the same time, Ms. Tanner was gathering information on a priest too sick to undergo a second heart bypass operation, but a candidate for a heart transplant. The cost of the transplant at Columbia Presbyterian would be $162,000. But if he could benefit, Ms. Tanner said, it seemed certain to be approved.
Cigna executives say that although they must hire people like Ms. Tanner to run a managed-care network, for every dollar the company spends on higher administrative costs, it saves $2 to $3 on medical bills.
In the end, however, "we are also competing on the basis of quality," Mr. English said. "If we do a bad job, people will complain and leave us. Our real incentives are to keep people from getting sick."

At Empire Blue Cross, Definitely a Week to Forget 

"Enormous uncertainty" -- that's what Otto G. Obermaier, a former United States Attorney hired as an investigator by Empire Blue Cross, saw last week. Translated, that means "a mess." Here's the latest: It seems that even in a world increasingly run by computers, Empire decided it was too much trouble to program its computers properly, so it just paid many claims -- about one in six -- without checking for fraud or duplication. Also, the Manhattan District Attorney has begun a criminal inquiry, and the Senate began its own hearings. Trying to put the past well behind it, Empire decided it didn't make sense to keep paying a $205,000 salary to its top financial officer after sending him packing, so it suspended him without pay. And what does Albert A. Cardone, recently ousted as chairman, say to accusations of mismanagement? They are "but another effort by special interests to discredit me and a fine institution."
 
G.M. Brings Some Jobs Home
 
Detroit is moving jobs across the border again, but the United Auto Workers thinks it's just fine. That's because this time the route is reversed, with General Motors shifting some Chevrolet Cavalier production from Mexico to Lansing, Mich. As many as 1,000 jobs will be created, with some to be filled by laid-off workers. It's not that G.M. has forgotten how low Mexican wages are -- just that it has felt a lot of union pressure on exporting jobs, and with the American auto market finally stirring to life, it doesn't want to risk any disruption. And last week G.M. and the U.A.W. began talks on a national contract.
 
T. Rex, 38; Arnold, 15
 
As the film tycoon Charles Dickens once said, "Expectation $19 million, gross $20 million: result, happiness; expectation $21 million, gross $20 million: result, misery." It was misery indeed at Columbia Pictures after "Last Action Hero" grossed "only" $15.3 million its first weekend. Now, for any mortal film, that's a lot of tickets, but the studio was counting on megahit numbers -- $20 million or so -- for this one. To make it worse, "Jurassic Park" made $38.5 million its second weekend. That settles it: with all his undulating muscles, Arnold Schwarzenegger (the star of "Hero") is no match for a dinosaur.
 
One Company, Indivisible
 
RJR Nabisco is still mainly a tobacco company, no matter how hard it tries to fine-tune that label. In March it made plans for a separate class of stock linked to its food business, hoping to raise $1.5 billion. But last week, citing poor market conditions, it dropped the plan. One problem is that food company shares are not doing well these days. And in any case, the food shares would still have represented ownership of the whole company, smoke and all. With anti-smoking fists raised nationwide, some may see that as a less-than-healthy investment.
 
Cheeriexes? No, Sounds Funny
 
General Mills, by daring to tamper with an icon of modern civilization, may just have hit on a way to sell more breakfast cereal. As parents well know, if there are children around, a lot of cereal already winds up scattered around the table, on the floor or in the couch's remotest corners. If a cereal maker can just increase the amount that never reaches the mouth, it will clearly sell more. So General Mills may have had a brainstorm last week when it added X's to its Cheerios, inviting tic-tac-toe games with a grid on the box. What's next? At parties that go flat, the hors d'oeuvres could be shaped like chess pieces, and the cheese board divided into 64 squares.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Closing the Door on Steel
 
It's the same old story. The world makes too much of something, and a lot of the excess winds up in the ultimate market, the United States. But the United States, trying desperately to hang onto far more than its fair share of the world's plenty, cries foul and slams the door. And then everyone yells at Washington. Last week it was steel, as the Administration announced steep tariffs on steel from 19 countries, saying they were selling it for less than they charge at home. American steelmakers applauded, speaking of the "egregious distortion" that foreign companies create. But the view abroad was harsh, as one official said steel imports were being treated as "a whipping boy" for America's problems.
 
Meanwhile, the recent optimism on a breakthrough in global trade talks seemed premature, as trade ministers meeting in Tokyo failed to achieve a hoped-for accord on reducing many tariffs and were back to square one.
 
'Low Point' at Lloyd's of London
 
Lloyd's of London. It sounds so British, so solid. Its dignified backers are not "investors" but "names." But those "names" came face to face with some awfully undignified numbers last week, when the insurer reported its annual loss (a loss, by the way, for 1990; Lloyd's always allows such a civilized interval). And the deficit was huge -- at $4.3 billion, even worse than expected. The loss is "in every way the low point of Lloyd's history in the last 305 years," said David Rowland, the chairman. And a low point for a lot of those "names," too, who are out of pocket, on average, more than $150,000. When added to previous losses, that's put a big dent in a lot of fortunes. New investors are lining up, though -- in part, perhaps, because in the future they will not face unlimited liability.
 
World Falters, Russia Pays
 
It looked good on paper -- a $4 billion global fund to help Russian enterprises go private. The Clinton Administration, committed to increase Russian aid, proposed the fund in April, and the President is determined to make good on his promises. Congress seemed willing, but this nation's allies may not be. Last week the Administration, facing the reality that Japan and Western Europe might have too many troubles of their own to chip in, said the fund would shrink. The hope now is that half the amount can be agreed to later.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Thank You for Smoking?
 
The logic is flawless. Since smoking doesn't cause cancer -- that's what the tobacco industry has maintained all along -- it naturally follows that secondhand smoke doesn't either. The Environmental Protection Agency, of course, says other people's smoke causes up to 3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year, and that declaration has led to a lot more smoke-free restaurants and offices -- most recently, a ban last week on smoking in all Los Angeles restaurants. But the tobacco industry hates to see office workers puffing madly while they huddle in rainy doorways -- some of them might actually quit. So last week an industry group -- one with no ties whatever to the Flat Earth Society -- sued, asking a court to rule that what the E.P.A. has demonstrated just isn't so.
 
A Worried Economy
 
This is a nation waiting for two axes to fall -- they're called taxes and health care reform. And while it waits, the economy is treading water -- or so says the Federal Reserve, which in its latest survey of business conditions, out last week, foresaw "slow to moderate" economic growth. Investment and hiring are being delayed, the central bank said, by those twin uncertainties. That certainly seems plausible. But some Administration officials spy another wrinkle, suspecting that when business people say the sky will fall if taxes rise, what they're really doing is a bit of grass-roots lobbying against tax increases. If you've ever seen a 6-year-old predicting the certain end of civilization if she doesn't get ice cream now, that seems equally plausible.
 
For its part, the White House, holding its finger to the economic winds, now says the year's growth will probably be more like 2.5 percent than the 3.1 percent it had projected.
 
Who's Minding the Air?
 
Some Federal agency is surely looking out for air quality in airplanes, right? Actually, no. The F.A.A., it seems, mainly covers flight safety. OSHA cares, as long as the problem is on the ground. The E.P.A.? Again, no. But as airlines circulate less fresh air through the cabins, raising levels of carbon dioxide and fumes from cleaners and pesticides, flight attendants and passengers have complained of headaches and other maladies. So last week the Transportation Department stepped into the vacuum, as Secretary Federico Pena ordered a preliminary inquiry into the air quality of plane cabins.
 
A Budget Bill, by a Whisker
 
For President Clinton, it's make-or-break time. The waffling and missteps and runway haircuts, he hopes, will turn to forgotten dust if he can just cajole and strong-arm his budget plan through Congress. So senators lined up in neat rows last week, each wildly cheering the home team -- the Democrats trying to make their party's day, the Republicans trying to break this enemy Presidency. In a typical Democratic swipe, George Mitchell of Maine said that if Mr. Clinton "sent a bill up here to praise apple pie and motherhood," the Republicans would try to amend it to say "apple pie is evil and motherhood is insidious." As for the Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island said, "We were just plain left out." The Democrats held ranks, though, fending off all efforts to peck at the bill. The overall bill, though, squeaked through only on a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore. Next stop, a House-Senate conference.

HEADLINE: Profile/Myron E. Ullman 3d;
Changing the Mood at Macy's

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO
It was the end of a long day of sobering business reviews this month in the West Coast division of R. H. Macy & Company. Inventories were way out of line, portending heavy markdowns and a hit to the bottom line.
First one, then another Macy executive took responsibility for the poor planning, though neither had been in charge when the plans were made. Then one of them, Thomas C. Shull, turned to look at Macy's chairman and chief executive, Myron E. Ullman 3d, and said with a smile: "But now that I think about it, the fish does stink from the head." 
 The other executives, who unlike Mr. Shull were all Macy's managers of long standing, waited nervously for Mr. Ullman's reaction.
Mr. Ullman chuckled. "It was one of the last and most visible vestiges I had seen of the end of an era in which teasing the boss was something like committing suicide," Mr. Shull recalled.
In this and many other ways, the 47-year-old Mr. Ullman is changing a company long known as a hierarchical, backbiting organization that was dominated until its bankruptcy filing last year by an imperious if talented executive, Edward S. Finkelstein.
Under Mr. Ullman, who became sole chief executive this month, the minnows are now allowed, in fact encouraged, to laugh with, challenge and even criticize the whale. Mr. Ullman is also eliminating the trappings of imperialism that had become Macy's hallmark. He sold the company airplane. He prefers to attend meetings with Macy merchants in their offices instead of summoning them to his office or the stern board room. The corporate dining rooms on the 13th floor of Macy's flagship store in New York's Herald Square, once the preserve of a handful of senior executives, are open to any manager for meetings.
More important, the change in Macy's culture is defined by better dissemination of information among the company's 60,000 employees. Mr. Ullman is overseeing the installation of the technological infrastructure of a modern department-store company -- computerized systems used to track customer preferences, buy merchandise and manage inventory and the deployment of store employees, all in the name of efficiency and responsiveness.
Merchandise managers can now peer into their computers to find where inventories are backing up and quickly take markdowns. And planners who allocate merchandise to stores can discover quickly that women shopping in the lingerie department of the store in Queens have fuller figures and make sure enough larger-sized bras are in stock there.
Later this summer, Macy will even have a satellite network to communicate with its employees across the country -- to show sales associates how to best display a collection of garments or to fill in employees on the company's performance.
In the past, Macy "was a hierarchical organization, and information resided at the top," said G. G. Michelson, a senior adviser to Macy and a board member. "Mike has made a conscientious effort to get everyone on the same wavelength, to have people buy in."
Finally, at a company that had a stable of talented merchants but few people skilled in operations, Mr. Ullman has peopled the Macy universe with managers good at the nuts and bolts of inventory management, computerized merchandise allocation and other tasks that have become increasingly important to a retailer seeking cost efficiency.
In short, Mr. Ullman has laid the groundwork for a comeback at the 137-year-old retailer, and all without internal panic.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Ullman has prescribed the proper antidotes. Macy has met its projections for sales increases and cash flow only for the last three months, but few people will call that a turnaround. "He seems like he's got the thing thought through, he seems like he has the right answers," said Robert M. Miller, the lawyer who represents Macy's bondholders. "But to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the jury is still out."
Mr. Miller does not question Mr. Ullman's qualifications. Rather he wonders whether any retail company in Macy's weak condition can fully recuperate without improvement in the economy. He also wonders whether Mr. Ullman's nuts-and-bolts approach is right for a retail company where glitz and glamour are necessary parts of the business.
Indeed, while Mr. Ullman has assembled a strong operations team for Macy, his biggest challenge is to find a chief merchant for the whole organization as well as one to lead the West Coast division. These executives are critical to enhancing Macy's image among shoppers and suppliers.
FORCING people to adapt to new ways of doing things is not easy, and Mr. Ullman has confronted resistance along the way, particularly in the West, where problems have been complicated by the weak economy in California.
What softens the impact of these decisions is Mr. Ullman's style of management, which gives employees the sense that he's there to help them rather than simply to order them around. "I think of myself as a servant-manager," he said. "My job is to help others in the organization get their job done by giving them whatever tools they require."
Mr. Ullman, an alumnus of the University of Cincinnati, started by selling computers for I.B.M. (and became comfortable with technology). Then he became an administrator at his alma mater (where he helped the university turn itself around financially). Next he served as a White House Fellow in the Office of the United States Trade Representative, then joined the Sanger Harris chain of Federated Department Stores (and helped create computer-assisted buying and planning programs). Finally, he gained management experience by running a Hong Kong conglomerate, Wharf Holdings.
For all the changes Mr. Ullman has forced since coming to Macy in 1988, most outsiders think of him as a bean-counter, a financial officer hired by Mr. Finkelstein to police a heavily indebted company. Mr. Finkelstein, a visionary merchant tired of being criticized for his lack of financial expertise, presented Mr. Ullman that way.
 ACTUALLY, Mr. Ullman, who had little hands-on experience in managing finances, brought in Diane Baker from Salomon Brothers to deal with that part of the job while he began re-engineering the company's operations. But the "numbers guy" description stuck and was reinforced by Macy's board, which appointed Mr. Ullman and Mark S. Handler, a popular merchant, to a joint office of the chairman and chief executive when Mr. Finkelstein retired in April 1992.
At the time, the biggest knock against Mr. Ullman was that he was no Allen Questrom, the merchant hired to lead Federated Department Stores out of bankruptcy. Mr. Questrom, with his knack for public relations and a glamorous social life, attracted journalists, retailing experts, the financial community and even his competitors. Mr. Ullman, whose suits looked as though they came from J. C. Penney, who has a standing date with his wife every Friday night and who devotes Sundays to his five children, seemed to lack a certain panache.
"Questrom was the chief executive selling a grand vision of the hereafter that I think inspired a lot of other merchants to stay with him or jump on board," said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, director of the Center for Leadership and Career Studies at Emory University. "Ullman still has the challenge of somehow getting the Questrom job done."
Mr. Sonnenfeld thinks the appointment of Don Hewitt, the executive producer of CBS's "60 Minutes," to head Macy's recently announced home-shopping-channel venture is Mr. Ullman's first step in that direction. Mr. Ullman has also changed his style somewhat, discarding rep ties for more stylish ones and adding elegant suits from I. Magnin, Macy's high-end specialty store. He has also begun revealing himself more to the press and public in ways like power-lunching with Michael F. Coady, president of Fairchild Publications, which publishes the gossipy trade paper Women's Wear Daily.
"There are different points in time where different kinds of leaders surface to lead," said Arie L. Kopelman, president of Chanel Inc., which sells cosmetics and other luxury goods to Macy. "Clearly at this point, it is Mike Ullman's time. It's far easier to find a great merchant to tend to the creativity needs of the business than to find a leader who can hold all the strings in his hands with confidence and know which to pull when."
Finding a chief merchant with stature and ingenuity to play second fiddle to the youthful Mr. Ullman may be difficult without assurances that Mr. Ullman intends to leave the chief executive's office within a year or two of when Macy emerges from bankruptcy protection in the next few years.
Macy's creditors are determined that whoever arrives to put the goods on the more efficient structure that Mr. Ullman and his operations team have erected must stay for the long run. Mr. Ullman has already broached to Macy's creditors the possibility of appointing Michael Steinberg, a former colleague who recently resigned as president and chief executive of Foley's, to the No. 2 spot. But creditors have rejected the notion, at least for the time being. Mr. Steinberg is in his sixties.
Mr. Ullman's goal is to have someone in place by August, and he says there is plenty of room at the top of Macy for both himself and another dynamic personality. "I'm trying to build bench strength here," he said.
Some Macy watchers worry that Mr. Ullman's ego will prevent him from appointing someone strong to the position. But others who know him well disagree. "I know Mike believes that he's not capable of doing it alone," said James M. Zimmerman, president and chief operating officer of Federated, who got to know Ullman when he worked for that company. "That's why I think he will be successful."
Mr. Ullman said his goal is to pull off what he calls "the turnaround of the decade." Asked whether he would succeed, Mr. Ullman recounted a story about his sister Christine Stubbins. Several years ago, she startled her husband by telling him she wanted to join the Junior League in Cincinnati. Her husband discouraged her, saying they weren't blueblooded enough to meet the league's standards.
But she persisted, not only winning acceptance as a member but also rising to the organization's international board. "I think," he said, "she's the person in my family who I'm most like."
 
 
MR. ULLMAN'S IMPORTS
 THE cast of characters at R. H. Macy & Company, once a club of lifetime employees who had risen through the merchandising ranks, has changed dramatically in the last year. Mr. Ullman has brought in a number of executives whose careers are decidedly unlike those of traditional Macy managers. Among them:
* Thomas C. Shull, group vice president for business development and personnel, who met Mr. Ullman when the two were White House Fellows. Mr. Shull, a West Point graduate and former faculty member there, later joined Mr. Ullman at Federated Department Stores, and has also worked at the management consulting firms McKinsey & Company and Meridian Strategies.
* Jane Sanford, senior vice president of buyer-planner-stores systems, who helped Mr. Ullman create the computer systems at Federated.
* Jim Kenney, group vice president for corporate planning in the West division. An expert on corporate turnarounds, he also worked at Meridian and McKinsey.
* Tim Lupfer, Mr. Kenney's East division counterpart and the newest addition to the senior ranks. He completed a 20-year military career as an Army lieutenant colonel, leading a charge on Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm without a single casualty among his troops. Mr. Ullman likes his organizational skills.

HEADLINE: Mirror, Mirror

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
OUT of all interior spaces, perhaps none are as fearsome as the fitting room. Laden with secret psychology, they are spaces in which life's truths are tripled in tripartite mirrors. Setha Low, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY graduate center, calls them "the ultimate confrontational space."
Anne Cole, the California-based swimsuit designer, admits that there are "worse things in life than fitting rooms -- I just can't think of what they are." 
 As swimsuit sales multiply and beach blankets beckon, it is the season to contemplate the fickle nature of fitting rooms. Why is it that one can make you look languorously zucchiniesque (falsely) while another makes you look like a tomatillo's soul sister?
I was determined to unravel the secrets of their design, which seem to have all the dignity of Port-o-Sans, so I set out to explore fitting rooms across Manhattan, hoping to buy a bathing suit in the process.
"Wear black tights," suggested Ellin Saltzman, the fashion director for Bergdorf Goodman. "Real life isn't as harsh as a fitting room with a three-way mirror."
I began at Macy's. I knew Macy's was in bankruptcy; I wanted to keep an open mind. But Macy's was a prime example of the Confessional School of fitting room design (a claustrophobic box that left no doubt that I had sinned). The space was tiny, about 3 feet by 4 feet. It made me feel empathy for gerbils. All that was missing were cedar chips and a water bottle.
In search of decent lighting, customers parade out the fitting room doors into the store, past a retinue of husbands and boyfriends.
"This isn't so bad, right?" one woman squished into a too-tight suit said to her companion.
He lied.
I was thinking about the advantages of TV Macy's, the home-shopping channel to come, as I headed downtown. Accompanied by Harvey Bernstein, a designer who is working with Speedo Authentic Fitness, makers of bathing suits and other fitness gear, I visited Daffy's, a discount clothing store, which has chaotic communal dressing rooms, like Loehmann's. Mr. Bernstein pointed out globs of exposed mirror adhesive, which can sometimes result in mirror distortion.
This brought up the question of whether mirrors are rigged. I have long wondered about a conspiracy on the part of the nation's mirror manufacturers. Stan Rosen, who supplies mirrors to many New York retailers, later squashed this theory. But he confirmed that since the recession, many stores have opted for thin, quarter-inch mirrors, which if applied to a wavy surface can distort more than half-inch mirrors.
At Herman's World of Sporting Goods at Union Square an uplifting sign said "Health Regulations Prohibit Undergarment/Athletic Support Returns."
Herman's dressing rooms were tiny closetlike chambers. If claustrophobics wrote mythology, this would be Hades. A helpful sales person suggested that I should ask for the downstairs dressing room next time, which has been enlarged to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
For comparison's sake, I decided to visit Emporio Armani on lower Fifth Avenue. There, the dressing room mirror was a freestanding piece of furniture, oak to be exact, rimmed with frosted lights that projected a flattering, luminous glow like a theatrical makeup mirror.
Mirror length is a telling thing. At the Gap, the mirrors do not quite extend to the floor, so you can't see your feet. This trick, while somewhat annoying, is "psychologically lengthening" Mr. Bernstein explained.
Lighting is the biggest secret in a dressing room's secret psychology. The most common placement is a spotlight, usually fluorescent, beaming down upon the shopper's head. But down-lighting tends to cast weird facial shadows, dappling the face and eliciting perspiration a la Richard Nixon in a Presidential debate. Dressing room designers could learn something from television talk shows, which always include a batallion of lights on the floor, tilted up slightly. "This wipes all the wrinkles away," Mr. Bernstein said. "It makes your complexion look fabulous."
One reason people get depressed while trying on bathing suits, said Diana Mesh, a lighting designer with the Walker Group/CNI, a retail design firm, is that severe shadowing in dressing rooms makes the skin look puckered. What a relief it is to know that shadows can give you cellulite.
PERHAPS the most bothersome fitting room feature, besides pins on the floor, is the half-door, beloved by discounters, in which you are crammed into a tiny cubicle with half a door. The door functions like a slip, disguising but also revealing. Your feet and calves are on view for all the world to see and your head looms above the door like a dazed giraffe.
"Most fitting rooms are designed by accident," said Paco Underhill, managing director of Envirosell Inc., which tests designs and studies how people shop. Still, slowly, the ethos is changing: while fitting rooms, like bus stations, still tend to be in menacing places -- like those forgotten corners beneath the air-conditioning ducts -- they seem to be growing a bit.
Kurt Barnard, publisher of a retail marketing report, said retailers were beginning to realize that design tactics that emulate police interrogation rooms don't work. Because of the competitive retail climate -- of catalogues, home-shopping networks, et al. -- stores are starting to enlarge their dressing rooms and pay more attention to shelves, furniture and other amenities, including lighting.
A little-known fact: Nationally, dressing room size is growing, said Janet Groeber, the editor of Visual Merchandising & Store Design magazine. Five years ago, the typical room was 3 feet by four 4 feet. Nowadays, it is 5 feet by 6 feet.
While dressing rooms are expanding, sales folk still seem to be disappearing. There is nothing worse than being stranded in the fitting room with a size 8 bathing suit only to discover you need a size 10. The sales person is nowhere to be found. Do you risk humiliation and go search for the correct size as is? Put all your clothes on? Leave in disgust? Where, you wonder, is the flight-attendant call button?
But such cosmic thoughts did not help my immediate plight. I stopped briefly into a Banana Republic downtown, in search of a decent dressing room. I found one. There were no hard shadows, there was room to turn around and there were industrial lights and wainscotting that brought the store's imagery into the dressing room.
Still suit-less, I finally worked up the courage to face Bloomingdale's. I quickly spied a nice bathing suit by Karla Coletto, with a net over it and a slit up the back, a Nicole Miller in a pastel plaid, and a skirted navy blue suit by Anne Cole that covered the thighs and looked depressingly promising. I perused the Calvin Kleins, mystified by tags that weren't color-coded by size, and wondered if it was Ralph Lauren's idea to call beach towels "body sheets."
The dressing rooms were a pleasant surprise -- quite roomy, with handsome bleached wood racks to hang clothes on, a shelf with room for a purse, several hooks placed strategically and a comfortable chair to sit on. The rooms were big enough for a stroller.
A sign told me that the inventory control clerk would be monitoring me and that I was limited to eight pieces, and thanked me for my cooperation.
Just outside the rooms was a three-way mirror that allowed a rational assessment without a public parade (I don't love a parade). Buoyed by this luxury, I said no to the Karla, the Nicole and the Anne, and yes to the Calvin ($127.74)
Was there a correlation between the gentility of the fitting room and my decision to buy a bathing suit? I suspect so. It's hard to tell.
In parting, I thought about what Anne Cole tells her customers before they go bathing suit shopping: "I suggest a dry martini."
Make mine a double.

HEADLINE: Don't Tax, Don't Cut, Don't Panic Over Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With virtually no votes to lose, the Administration must now reconcile a House version of its economic plan that counts on the ill-fated British thermal unit tax and a Senate version that substitutes other unpopular taxes and spending cuts. A better substitute for the energy tax: Nothing! 
 Republicans and some conservative Democrats would cut spending, particularly on Medicare and other entitlements. Liberal Democrats argue this would injure lower- and middle-income citizens. Some of these Democrats would raise business taxes. Either would hurt the economy.
The core of the problem is President Clinton's insistence, egged on by some in Congress and the insatiable Ross Perot, that the proposed deficit reductions are sacrosanct. The reductions in the proposed budget are much more than Mr. Clinton ever promised in his campaign. He justified these larger deficit reduction demands on questionable new forecasts that indicated deficits beginning in 1996 and 1997 would otherwise begin rising much faster than anticipated.
There is no need to impose taxes now, largely to take effect later, on the possibility that further deficit reduction would be in order. There is no reason to add taxes effective now or to cut spending now. Either would seriously injure our weak economy.
President Clinton has a large -- possibly too large -- deficit reduction package on the table. Losing $70 billion or $80 billion of some $500 billion of accumulated deficit reductions in the next five years would be a small price to pay for getting his economic package through.
And the paradox is that the lesser deficit reductions would bring a more prosperous economy, which would very possibly reduce those future deficits after all.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Next Week, the World Stage Clinton's Well-Timed 'Escape to Tokyo'

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton steps from Air Force One onto Japanese soil on the afternoon of July 6, he will be granted a sort of magic wish.
Overnight, he stands to be transformed from a President struggling up a steep learning curve into a world leader of stature and weight. Arriving for the economic summit meeting with a deficit-reduction measure in hand that embodies the United States' promises to set its fiscal house in order before demanding the same of others, he will have accomplished what the other weakened leaders could only fantasize about. 
 At least this is the scenario the White House is counting on. Mr. Clinton's advisers are convinced that politics on the world stage is just like politics at home. Everything is relative.
No one knows this better than Bill Clinton, who rushed before the microphones on Friday, hours after his budget bill survived the Senate by a 50-to-49 vote, to claim victory and put it in a global context. "If you look at the level of aggression this country has displayed in trying to do something about its economic circumstances, as compared to what is going on in these other nations, the political and the economic problems," he said, "I think the United States should be very proud."
In spite of -- and perhaps because of -- the troubles here, White House officials are looking to the summit meeting with an odd mix of low expectations and giddy confidence. One senior adviser described the escape to Tokyo as "an opportunity made in heaven."
Administration officials had said a Senate defeat for the President's economic plan would have been "catastrophic" for the Asia trip. Now, even if the bill's immediate prospects remain up in the air -- a House-Senate conference must resolve differences over taxes and Medicare cuts -- Mr. Clinton's foreign policy and economic advisers say the disputes will not significantly change perceptions abroad.
"It's only the really close observer who goes beyond the fact that it looks like the President proposed a deficit cut and that's what he got," the official said. "So he goes with a win. And, moreover, it's a win precisely in the area where we have been being badgered for years."
At past economic summits, the United States has resisted pressure, coming especially from Japan, to lower its deficit as a step toward stimulating global growth.
This year is different. Months ago, the United States began taking a lead role in the Group of Seven, or G-7. The April meeting of the group's finance ministers marked the third since Mr. Clinton took office, and the countries' senior officials have been in contact ever since. The United States has also expanded its role as Russia's champion at the G-7 table.
 
About American Leadership
 "What this summit is really all about is American leadership," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former Assistant Secretary of State for economic and business affairs. "There are questions abroad about America's will to lead in the post-cold war period, about America's military presence abroad and concerns about American trade policy.
"There's an opportunity for the President at this summit to dispel these concerns and to rally other countries, despite their weakened conditions, around American goals and priorities."
All of this would bode well for Mr. Clinton's political future here. He and his senior advisers subscribe to a tenet that has guided most Presidents: When in trouble at home, look abroad.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's pollster, said the President stands to gain from his Asia trip. "This is the first meeting of all the allies where the issues are almost wholly economic," he said.
The scales are weighted in Mr. Clinton's favor for several other reasons. Whatever setbacks he has suffered, when he meets with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan, he will be the only one who can be fairly certain that he will still be in charge of his country as few as three years hence.
As one American official put it: no other foreign leaders will be arriving at the summit with poll ratings higher than their shoe size or the prime rate.
Mr. Clinton also stands to regain substantial footing in the United States' relationship with Japan, which, having soured after a White House spat over trade issues, is now rebounding as the Japanese survey their collapsed political system.
"It is an enormous opportunity if we play it right," said Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
"If the President with his enhanced stature because of successes here and failures within Japan can play it skillfully and encourage political pluralism in Japan, it really could help us tremendously in the long run."
American negotiators who have been skittering across the Pacific for preparatory meetings have laid much of the groundwork for the substance of the meetings. Few expect that the communiques that are released in Tokyo will effect global economic change.
Mr. Clinton will arrive with three basic pitches: increased aid to Russia, combined efforts to boost the global economy and broader trade opportunities between the United States and its partners.
He can push only so far. The good news, of course, is that he can appear to be a worthy world leader when he stands for the ritual group photographs with other prime ministers and presidents. The drawback, his advisers warn, is that he cannot press too hard for concessions from leaders who have such severe popularity problems at home.
"What makes it tough is that all of those guys have to be extremely cautious," one State Department official said. "But it also makes it somewhat easier because all these folks are looking for achievements they can point to as well."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Iran's Zealots Get a Jolt Out of Failure

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: TEHERAN

 BODY:
FOURTEEN years after the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, the Iranian revolution has failed to achieve either prosperity or sustained hope. A costly eight-year war with Iraq, economic mismanagement and endemic corruption coupled with executions and arrests have left the clerics who rule Iran isolated and ever more dependent on the repressive organs of state security for control. Discontent is so widespread that even Government officials wonder aloud how they managed to lose so much support.
But amid these failures the Government has embarked on a new radicalism both within Iran and abroad and seems in many ways as potent as ever. 
Anti-vice squads and Islamic vigilante groups are back on the streets, harassing women for improper dress and searching cars for alcohol and Western videos. A five-day roundup ended last week in the arrest of 8,615 people described as drug addicts.
Abroad, Israel, Egypt and Algeria accuse Iran of supporting armed Islamic fundamentalist movements pitted against them. And Iranian dissidents have been gunned down in Rome and Berlin -- at the behest, it is widely believed, of mullahs here.
On the surface, the failures of the fundamentalist Government and its drive toward even greater extremism appear somewhat contradictory. But it is the very collapse of revolutionary ideology that is fueling Iran's new militancy.
Authoritarians who take charge in the name of the people but who fail to deliver on promises to uplift the downtrodden often fall back on the harsh tactics used in first securing power to keep hold of it. And, as in Iran, they frequently manipulate paranoia of the outside world to shore up their position.
Initially Iran was buoyed by the enthusiasm and sense of purpose that come with building a new society. Utopian Islamic ideology and the chimera of a new order brought masses to the streets to denounce the "Great Satan" during the United States Embassy hostage crisis. Later, after the 1980 invasion by Iraqi troops that triggered the Iran-Iraq war, young men zealously enlisted en masse and charged headlong into Iraqi machine guns. But with hundreds of thousands of Iranian war dead went the revolution's innocence and quixotic magic. Only the paranoia was left.
The end of the war in 1988 was supposed to bring with it not only peace but prosperity. But Iranians who sacrificed their youth and careers or lost friends or kinsmen have been rewarded with mounting unemployment, high inflation, housing shortages and a state-run economy that has driven industry into the ground.
The postwar malaise that has swept Iran has led many, especially the young, to idealize Western pop culture and turn away from religion.
"By creating this theocracy, by intertwining religious and political symbols, the clerics are building a nation of atheists," said a political scientist.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the so-called pragmatist who was re-elected by a less-than-resounding margin this month, has been unable to attract much foreign investment, lure back professionals in exile or wrench state industries from the hands of huge Islamic charity foundations, which control billions of dollars of assets and produce everything from cars to candy.
As discontent and unrest swells, the President has found that he must rely on hard-liners, many of whom head such foundations, to keep control. These are the very hard-liners who predicted his reforms would never work and made sure by sabotaging them.
Through clerics at local mosques, the Government is at least aware of its unpopularity. And while it does not shrink from brutality, it tolerates a level of dissent that would land an Iraqi in prison or in front of a firing squad.
Still, it has neutralized any organized opposition. Political parties and secular organizations are banned and every institution, from the universities to the army, has been purged of dissidents. The press is tightly controlled by clerics who, while permitting debate on economic or foreign policy, do not allow commentators or reporters to question the sanctity of the Islamic state. Neighborhood committees keep tabs on dissenters.
The mullahs have also had some success in blaming outside forces for their failures. America, still the "Great Satan," is portrayed as behind an array of problems, from drug addiction to ennui among the young.
Unless the clerics have a crisis of faith, at which point the fundamentalist state could collapse like a house of cards, their peculiar interpretation of Islam will remain sacred and unassailable.
And so economic decline and discontent have sparked in believers a new sense of urgency. While diplomats consider the Iraq-based opposition group, the People's Mujahedeen, a spent force, its perceived threat has taken on prominence in Government circles, which is why Iran, according to diplomats, braved international censure by gunning down an opposition leader, Mohammed Hussein Nagdi, in Rome in March.
In the old Intercontinental Hotel here, now a seedy stop for out-of-luck European executives and reporters, a Government theorist likened the new drive by the clerics to a passage in the Hadith, a collection of the prophet Mohammed's sayings.
In the passage, Mohammed and his followers are returning victorious from battle. The fighters look forward to an easy peace. But the prophet warns them that the battle they just finished will be nothing compared with the holy war, or jihad, they will soon have to engage in for people's hearts and minds.
"We return from the little jihad," the theorist said, quoting the prophet, "to the greater jihad."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Labor Has a Big Job for Its New Friend Clinton

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
ORGANIZED labor, or what is left of it, has high hopes for the Clinton Presidency. But so far the Administration has put on the back burner all the proposals that might give labor more power, except for one: a bill that would prohibit management from replacing strikers permanently with newly hired workers. And now that bill has become the defining labor issue of the young Clinton Presidency, as important today as the air traffic controllers strike was in the early Reagan years.
The heart of the matter is not in the bill's details, although they are important. The heart of the matter is that both unions and management have chosen the bill for one of their periodic battles over the balance of power between them. A union victory would probably be followed by other union gains. And if the managers win, then President Clinton, for all his sympathies toward workers, might not be much better for organized labor than Ronald Reagan or George Bush. 
 "This is make or break," said Jeffrey H. Joseph, the chief lobbyist for an alliance representing thousands of companies trying to defeat the Cesar Chavez Workplace Fairness Act, which is named for the late farm workers leader. The House approved the bill earlier this month, but three or four votes are still lacking in the Senate to prevent a Republican filibuster that would defeat the bill when it comes to the floor next month. Mr. Joseph is lobbying hard to make the filibuster work.
"Enacting this bill would upset the marketplace pricing of labor," he said. "It would price workers above their market value."
And that is the issue: Should union workers earn only the lower pay and benefits that outsiders would accept if they could get their hands on union jobs? Or should unions regain enough power in collective bargaining to insulate the wages and benefits they have won over the years?
The Clinton Administration has come down on the side of strengthening collective bargaining through the Chavez bill. The President promised such a remedy during the election campaign and John Zalusky, a senior economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the "union movement certainly expects the Administration to put its whole weight behind the bill."
Testifying before Congress, Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich has argued: "Without a viable right to strike, employers have less incentive to engage in serious bargaining with their unions, to hammer out mutually satisfactory solutions. And unions see no point in trying to work cooperatively with management" to increase their efficiency and output. To this, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, replied that without the threat of replacement, "there is little incentive for labor to make demands that are reasonable and reflect market realities."
The right to replace strikers has existed since 1938, when the Supreme Court legalized the practice. But until the 1980's it was hardly noticeable. Mostly, unions and managements signed ever richer labor contracts and the companies covered the higher labor costs by raising the prices of their products. Equally important, unions had other powers -- now outlawed -- that discouraged companies from hiring replacement workers.
People on strike, for example, could retaliate by picketing their company's suppliers and customers. Or union members at other companies could legally refuse to handle a struck company's products, or "hot cargo" -- a labor right outlawed in the largely pro-management Landrum-Griffin bill in 1959. That was the last major labor law passed by Congress, and now a changed world -- in which American companies are less dominant -- has brought on today's battle.
 
A Pool of People
 Rising competition from imports in the 1980's made it harder to raise prices to cover rising labor costs. It became easier for companies to move operations to lower-wage countries. And unemployment in a weak American economy made millions of people willing to grab at union jobs that paid higher wages than they could earn in nonunion work.
Drawing on this pool of people, President Reagan replaced the nation's air traffic controllers when they struck in 1981. Strikes by Federal Government employees are illegal, which justified the Reagan action. But corporate America found parallel justification in the Supreme Court's 1938 replacement worker ruling. Such prominent companies as International Paper, Greyhound, Eastern Airlines and Trans World Airlines hired thousands to replace strikers. And President Bush promised to veto a bill similar to the Chavez one, if Congress had passed it last year.
Not only replacement, but just the threat of it, made many union workers willing to accept concessions without striking -- or to end a strike abruptly, as 14,000 workers at Caterpillar Inc. did last year. The General Accounting Office, a research arm of Congress, found that more than 30 percent of all companies involved in strikes in the late 1980's announced they would hire permanent replacements. Not surprisingly, the number of major strikes has declined very sharply since the 1970's.
"The replacement worker bill, if it passes, would close an era that opened up with the air traffic controller crisis," said Charles A. Jeszeck, a G.A.O. labor economist. "And it might portend broader changes in the future."
The unions, for example, are pressuring the Clinton Administration for such things as a higher minimum wage and laws that would make organizing nonunion workers easier. But these requests have been referred to a blue ribbon commission that won't report until next May. Only striker replacement is on the table, and Harry Katz, a collective bargaining expert at Cornell University, says that unions might be wrong to attach so much importance to it.
"They are blaming too many of their troubles on management's right to replace strikers, and they are focusing too heavily on a legislative panacea to their declining power," Mr. Katz said. Temporary replacements, for example, would still be legal, which might keep a factory going for months.
Whatever the gamble, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. wants striker replacement gone. "If the bill is defeated, you will see alternatives to strikes developing," Mr. Zalusky said, "like working to rule or mandatory arbitration."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Its Competitors Distracted, France Gets to Be a Power

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
PERHAPS the only thing that France dislikes more than bowing to American leadership is having to recognize Germany as Europe's main power. The collapse of the Soviet bloc thus gave it good reason to worry: The United States was left as the sole superpower, while united Germany seemed destined to dominate the new Europe.
Yet France's fears of losing its clout appear premature. With the United States sending conflicting signals about its role in the world and Germany forced into introspection by economic and social problems, France has grabbed the chance to reassert itself as the only European power with global vision. 
 Even the ouster of a Socialist government by conservatives in elections in March seems to have worked to its advantage. The meeting of European Community leaders in Copenhagen last week could well have exposed rifts between the Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, and the conservative Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur. Instead, they spoke as one: France has a single foreign policy.
Indeed, this policy has had the same objective since General de Gaulle decided in the 1960's that France should have its own independent nuclear deterrent: to convince Washington, Moscow and its European partners that France is a great power -- "une grande puissance." When this status was threatened by the cold war's end, the French elite was thrown into a tizzy. Now its proud image of itself is on the mend.
Oddly, the crisis in the former Yugoslavia has helped France in this regard. By assigning 5,000 troops to United Nations peacekeeping forces there, it has done what neither the United States nor Germany has done, a point that it is not shy to recall publicly. This in turn has given France moral authority to define the international response to the conflict, working -- unusually -- in tandem with Britain, which has 2,500 of its own soldiers in the field, many of them also in Bosnia.
Thus, when Washington contemplated air strikes against Serb artillery or, last week, when the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, echoed President Clinton's call for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims, France and Britain swiftly objected: Escalation would turn their troops into easy Serb targets or, perhaps worse, force them to abandon their humanitarian mission by withdrawing entirely.
 
Projecting Influence
 Far more than Britain, though, France seems intent on projecting its influence. It is participating in United Nations peace-keeping forces as far away as Somalia and Cambodia, but it also sees opportunities for initiatives in Europe itself. Aware of the region's failure to anticipate and then to halt the wars in former Yugoslavia, for example, it is now promoting the idea of an international conference next year to settle frontier and minority problems elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Uncertainty in Europe has in turn prompted France to view the United States with new eyes. During the cold war, it never missed a chance to display its independence from Washington. After the Persian Gulf war, it feared that President Bush's oft-proclaimed "new world order" was a disguise for American domination, particularly of the Middle East, where France was once a major player. But now, with the Clinton Administration seemingly ambivalent about its global role, France is eager to maintain an American presence in Europe and is moving closer to NATO.
One reason is that the European Community has so far failed to live up to expectations as a new economic and political superpower. Barely 18 months ago, France hoped the Maastricht Treaty on European union would anchor Germany in a community committed to creating a single currency and common foreign and defense policies. But delays in ratification of the treaty combined with an economic recession have left the community drifting rudderless.
Relations between France and Germany, the traditional motors of European integration, have also been marked by new tensions. France blames high German interest rates for its economic slowdown, while Germany accuses France of blocking progress toward a new global trade liberalization accord in order to defend its farmers. A rare level of mutual irritation even forced cancellation of a ministerial meeting last week.
Certainly, with presidential elections to pick a successor to Mr. Mitterrand less than two years away, Mr. Balladur's conservative government is under strong pressure to show early results in the form of economic recovery. And this is feeding the temptation for still greater trade protectionism.
Yet while Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain as well as the United States and Japan all seem consumed by domestic problems, France has identified the absence of global leadership as an opportunity to make its voice heard. After community governments agreed last week to contribute more "men and money" to the United Nations effort in Bosnia, for example, France was the first to offer 800 extra troops.
Certainly, more than any of its allies, France has a clearly focused foreign policy today. And it knows that it has no time to waste. Already this month, the United States said it favored giving Germany and Japan permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. In the past, this idea has included the suggestion that France and Britain lose their permanent seats. More than to provide leadership, then, France is eager to show that it still deserves the grand title of "une grande puissance." And, on this, there is a domestic consensus. It is, quite simply, a matter of honor.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Focus on Reducing Pesticides in Food Production

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The Federal Government has decided to reduce the use of chemicals in the production of the nation's food, assigning a higher priority than in the past to protecting children's health and the environment.
If the change of policy is fully carried out, it could alter everything about the way food is grown and what Americans eat. It was announced Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture and will be reinforced in a scientific report to be issued Tuesday. 
 The announcement by the three agencies will "create incentives for the development of safe pesticides" and will "remove those pesticides that pose the greatest risk from the market," Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said in an interview.
 
'Landmark' in Food Safety
 "The Administration is committed to reducing pesticides," he said, and supports "integrated pest management," a farming method that uses pesticides sparingly, increasing the use of beneficial insects and crop rotation.
Dr. Kessler said the Administration strategy underlying the three agencies' announcement was "a major landmark in the history of food safety."
Until now, critics have charged, agencies have been at odds over agricultural chemicals, and in recent years, especially during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, there has been little effort to restrict their use.
There has been no coordinated effort among the agencies, except when concerns about individual pesticides have raised public alarm. Otherwise, the environmental agency has dealt with analyzing the safety of pesticides, the health agency has tested for pesticide residues in food and the agricultural agency has promoted pesticides to help farm production.
"The Agriculture Department, E.P.A. and the Food and Drug Administration are working together in a way they have never done before to benefit the American people," said Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the E.P.A.
Both the food industry and the environmental movement worry that the new message could discourage people from eating fruits and vegetables, just when the Government is also stepping up efforts to persuade Americans to eat more of them.
The long-delayed National Academy of Sciences report, which will be made public on Tuesday, hedges its findings, saying that infants and children may be uniquely sensitive to pesticides. The report says the changes are necessary in chemical regulations to protect infants and children because of this possible sensitivity, and because their diets differ from those of adults.
 
Putting Health First
 "Infants and children differ both quantitatively and qualitatively from adults in their exposure to pesticide residues in foods," the report says, because they consume more calories per unit of body weight and tend to eat fewer types of food than adults.
The academy found that the data on what children eat and on how to set tolerance levels for pesticide residues for children were inadequate to make certain that they are protected.
While acknowledging the need for pesticides to increase the amount of fruits and vegetables available, the academy recommends that the E.P.A. put health considerations, rather than agricultural production, foremost in making decisions.
This is a significant change from current policy. In determining tolerance levels for pesticide residues, the E.P.A. now factors in economic benefits along with risks to human health.
 
More Sampling Urged
 The report also recommends that testing for pesticides be done on young animals, whose systems are more nearly like children's, than on adult animals, on which most testing has been done. It also calls for the collection of additional food-consumption data and more frequent sampling of foods that children eat in large quantities. And it says all exposures to pesticides, not just those from food, should be considered when setting tolerance levels.
The report concludes that "children should be able to eat a healthful diet containing legal residues without encroaching on safety margins."
A second report, which is to be made public on Monday, was done by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. It says that much of an individual's exposure to pesticides in food occurs by age 5 because children eat far more fruits and vegetables in relation to their body weight than do adults.
"Millions of children in the United States receive up to 35 percent of their entire lifetime dose of some carcinogenic pesticides by age 5," according to the report. By the time the average child is a year old, the report said, he will have received the acceptable lifetime doses of eight pesticides from 20 commonly eaten foods.
The report emphasizes that the levels of exposure to pesticides that the E.P.A. considers either probable or possible human carcinogens are low, but that the health effects are not known and have not been investigated.
 
Food Producers Object
 Both reports are being criticized by the food industry. In addition, the F.D.A has criticized the Environmental Working Group's report for its methodology and its conclusions.
But Dr. Kessler said while scientists may disagree on much of what is in the report, "the questions raised in the report, in conjunction with the forthcoming academy report, point out an absolutely valid message: 'We've got a lot of pesticides out there, and we ought to be doing something to reduce them.' "
Trade associations for the food industry have spent the last several weeks preparing press releases and advisories to tell their side of the story. There is a lot at stake, since response to the cumulative effect of these reports and the Government's announcement could eventually mean not only tighter controls on the use of pesticides but, more immediately, a precipitous drop in sales of fruits and vegetables.
What has the industry working so hard to forestall a crisis are memories of the Alar scare with apples.
 
'Alarmist Language'?
 "We fully expect," the Center for Produce Quality said on June 16, "that activist groups may use the N.A.S. report as an opportunity to use high-visibility press events, celebrities and alarmist language to generate public concern." The center is the information arm of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association and the Produce Marketing Association.
The references to celebrities and the news media involve the actress Meryl Streep and the CBS television program "60 Minutes," which persuaded much of the public in 1989 to boycott apples because some of them were being sprayed with Alar, a growth regulator that has caused cancer in animals. That all apples were not sprayed with Alar was lost in the resulting uproar, and millions of pounds of apples were destroyed, ruining some farmers.
Ken Cook, executive director of the Environmental Working Group, said at a news conference on Friday, "Any publicized purge in the nation's kitchens, of the sort that the Alar controversy inadvertently generated in 1989, will almost certainly work against efforts to make the food supply safer from pesticides."
Efforts to place greater control on pesticides, to reduce their use through such agricultural methods as organic farming, began in the 1960's but did not find much broad public support until the 1980's. In 1985, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, introduced legislation to strengthen pesticide regulations.
In 1987, a National Academy report said that the nation's food supply was inadequately protected from cancer-causing pesticides. In 1989, the year of the Alar scare, the Natural Resources Defense Council released its report "Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in our Children's Food." But the Federal Government took did nothing significant to change the pesticide regulations.
The current pesticide legislation introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Waxman addresses some of the findings of the two new reports.
The food and chemical industries say that the food supply is safe but agree that changes in regulations are in order. "We need to be especially concerned about children," said Lester Crawford, executive vice president for scientific affairs of the National Food Processors Association, "because they will get 70 years of exposure. Changes ought to be made in E.P.A. regulations."
Despite the food industry's defensive posture, it has been working for a decade to reduce the amount of pesticides used in food. The National Food Processors, the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association have been recommending that their members use Integrated Pest Management. "We have 500 members," Mr. Crawford said, "and at least 25 percent of them have some commitment to integrated pest management."
Gerber Products Company, the baby-food manufacturer, requires its growers to use pest management techniques.
"We need to make a reduction in the use of pesticides," said Ms. Browner of E.P.A., "and we want to see children protected."
 
 
ADVICE ON PRODUCE: EAT IT ANYWAY
 Despite the cautions about pesticides in children's food, the executive directory of the Environmental Working Group, said, "Don't throw out those fresh strawberries, Mom."
Consumer and environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Consumers Union are telling parents to keep feeding their children fruits and vegetables whether they are organic or not.
"In fact," said Laurie Mott, a senior scientist with the defense council, "eat more fruits and vegetables because there are anti-carcinogens in fruits and vegetables." In addition, they are filled with vitamins, minerals and fiber and have virtually no fat.
Consumer and nutrition experts also recommend that shoppers urge grocers to stock organic foods or those certified as having no detected pesticide residues.
They also say produce from farmers' markets has less pesticide contamination because the crops do not have to travel far. And it is easier to find organically grown food at these markets than in most supermarkets.
Washing and peeling vegetables and fruits, the experts say, can eliminate some pesticide residues.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Tide of Immigration Brings Hostility

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 26

 BODY:
With both legal and illegal immigration into the United States approaching historic highs, a public reaction against immigration is also growing, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
After decades of heavy immigration that has included large numbers of Hispanic laborers and Southeast Asian refugees, and at a time when many Americans are out of work, a large majority of Americans surveyed said they favored a decrease in immigration. Many cited the economy as a factor in their opinion. 
 The poll shows that anti-immigrant feelings are also colored by a perception -- contrary to the facts -- that most immigrants are in the United States illegally. But the survey also shows that people are much more willing to welcome immigrants when the issue is couched in personal terms.
 
Anti-Immigrant Trend
 When asked whether immigration into the United States should be "kept at its present level, increased or decreased," 61 percent of those answering the national telephone survey last week preferred a decrease. That preference is up from a 1986 Times/CBS News poll, when 49 percent favored a decrease.
One of the poll respondents, Dorothy Lepping, a 33-year-old postal worker in East Stroudsburg, Pa., said her opinions had been shaped by the way she had seen immigrants treated in her hometown. "I saw the amount of aid that went out to them and the way that was abused," she said in a telephone interview after the poll. "I feel that our economy is in a bad state and we should take care of our own."
Such sentiments have grown over the decades. When the Gallup Poll posed the same question in 1977, just 42 percent favored a decrease in immigration; in 1965, when a new law ended four decades of low immigration, just 33 percent called for a decrease.
Shifts in public attitudes seem to parallel changes in economic conditions. In 1965, the nation's unemployment rate fell to just over 4 percent, as compared with the 6.9 percent reported for last May, and the economic growth rate then was 5.6 percent, as compared with this year's forecast of 3.1 percent, a prediction that may be scaled back.
According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 8.9 million people have immigrated legally into the United States over the past decade, and an estimated 3 million more have slipped into the country illegally. Immigration experts say the numbers approach those of the great wave of European immigration at the turn of the century and are the highest since comprehensive immigration laws were enacted in 1924.
"What people are reacting to now is the reality of the past 20 to 25 years," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a lobbying group that seeks to reduce immigration. "There are unprecedented levels of immigration and the numbers are growing, and the American people are saying, 'Enough is enough.' "
 
Economy Affects Opinions
 The tightening economy also seems to be a major reason for the increasing anti-immigration sentiment in the new poll, which was conducted Monday through Thursday and questioned 1,363 adults nationwide. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The participants in the 1986 poll and last week's poll were asked, "Do you think that, in general, the United States should welcome immigrants who come here with very little to try to make a success of their lives, or are conditions here today too hard for this to be practical?"
In the new poll, only 32 percent said the country should welcome immigrants, while 60 percent said this was not practical because of hard conditions.
In 1986, when the same question was asked at a time when economic conditions were better, 43 percent said the country should welcome immigrants, approximately equal to the 45 percent who said it was not practical because of hard conditions.
"If we had a robust economy, even a sustained high level of immigration would not create much controversy," said Arthur C. Helton, director of the Refugee Project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "I think if you look at the development of immigration policy, the impact on the work place would emerge as a decisive factor."
But only 36 percent of respondents last week and 34 percent in 1986 said they believed that most immigrants "take jobs away from American citizens." In contrast, 55 percent in the new poll and 52 percent in 1986 said immigrants "mostly take jobs Americans don't want."
 
Black Point of View
 Black Americans were nine percentage points more likely than whites to see immigrants taking jobs away, but blacks were nine points less likely to prefer a decrease in immigration than whites.
Another reason for the growing sentiment against immigration seems to be the perception that most recent immigrants are here illegally. In the new poll, 68 percent agreed that "most of the people who have moved to the United States in the last few years are here illegally." In 1986, that number was just 49 percent.
"If you can picture the image of the Statue of Liberty dissolving," Mr. Helton said, "and being replaced by the image of the World Trade Center after it was bombed, you have the sense of the negative trends in the current debate."
Other images of immigrants -- some unflattering and some more positive -- have remained relatively stable over time. While 44 percent of the people surveyed in 1986 and about half of those asked in the recent poll said that most new immigrants "cause problems," nearly half of the respondents in both polls said that "today's immigrants work harder than people born here."
Mr. Mehlman said he was concerned that a backlash against immigration could lead to increased acts of violence against immigrants, like those that have swept Germany. But the new poll shows that while many Americans may be ready to slam the country's door on immigrants, they remain unwilling to be personally rude to them.
Asked what would happen "if some of today's new immigrants moved into your neighborhood," 67 percent of respondents in the poll said the newcomers "would be welcomed." In 1968, 68 percent offered a similar welcome.
"You want to give them a fair shake," Mrs. Lepping said.

HEADLINE: Naval Depots in 3 States Face Closing

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Paring Navy installations that support the fleet, a Presidential commission voted today to close large naval maintenance depots in California, Florida and Virginia that employ nearly 12,000 civilian workers.
On the panel's fourth day of final deliberations on 238 installations, the commission voted to shut down 21 installations and keep open 32 others, while 9 were either pared back or expanded. 
 With the end of the cold war, declining military budgets have forced the closing of many well-known bases. But maintenance depots, which provide critical support to the bases, actually employ a much larger number of civilian workers than the military installations.
The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended closing naval aviation depots in Alameda, Calif., which employs 3,900 civilians, in Pensacola, Fla., with 3,800 civilians, and in Norfolk, Va., with 4,100 civilians. The Pentagon has said it has more than 50 percent more depot capacity than it needs among all the armed services.
 
Moving 'Top Gun' School
 The commissioners also approved a Navy plan to move its famed "Top Gun" fighter pilot school at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego to Nevada. In a complex realignment, the Pentagon will close two Marine Corps air bases in Southern California and transform Miramar from a Navy fighter base into a home for Marine Corps jets and helicopters, an unusual combination.
The panel also agreed to close Agana Naval Air Station in Guam, one of the few installations that the Pentagon wanted to keep and the local community wanted to close. Guam's elected officials have wanted to close the base for years and find other uses for its choice waterfront property.
Commissioners also recommended closing Cecil Field Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla., and moving its aircraft and forces to naval or Marine air bases at Cherry Point, N.C., Beaufort, S.C., and the Oceana base near Norfolk
The commission concludes its votes on Sunday and will send its final recommendations to President Clinton, who has until July 15 to approve or reject the entire package. If he approves, Mr. Clinton then forwards the package to Congress for approval or rejection. Given the pressures to cut military spending, approval appears almost certain.
 
Following Pentagon's Plans
 In March, Defense Secretary Les Aspin recommended closing or shrinking 43 major installations and 122 smaller sites. The commission later added 47 other major bases and 26 smaller sites for consideration. Commissioners had suggested in interviews that they might substitute some bases for Mr. Aspin's choices, but are unlikely to close many more installations than the Pentagon wants.
The panel, after tinkering with Mr. Aspin's recommendations in its first two days, have largely approved the Pentagon's proposals. If Mr. Aspin's recommendations were to be accepted, the Defense Department would spend $1.7 billion to clean up and close those installations, and then expect to save $3.1 billion a year beginning in the year 2000.
Closing maintenance depots yields large savings from the salaries of the civilian employees there. The Navy had said it needed to close three of its six depots, but maintain at least one of the two depots on the West Coast. The commission's decision on Friday to close the naval air base in Alameda, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay area, made inevitable the closing of the supporting depot there. The other West Coast depot, the North Island depot in San Diego, will be kept open.
That left the four depots on the East Coast. Commissioners decided to close the naval aviation depots at Norfolk and Pensacola, and keep the more efficient installations at Jacksonville, Fla., and Cherry Point, N.C.
The commission did not directly consider a broader and related issue to direct more maintenance work to commercial military contractors that have been hurt by shrinking Pentagon budgets. Mr. Aspin has said the Pentagon is reviewing the balance between military and commercial depot work.
 
Minimal Economic Pain
 The Pentagon's plan to move Navy and Marine Corps aircraft in Southern California causes minimal economic disruption, except in Orange County, where two Marine bases, El Toro and Tustin, will close. The panel voted in 1991 to close Tustin, but commissioners were reconsidering the decision.
Under the plan, 110 CH-46 and CH-53 transport helicopters at Tustin will move to Miramar or two other bases near San Diego, Camp Pendleton or North Island. The Marines will move 121 F-18 fighters at El Toro to Miramar. To make room at Miramar, the Navy will send 120 F-14's to the Lemoore base near Fresno, Calif., and the "Top Gun" school to Fallon, Nev.
It is unusual to base large numbers of slow-flying helicopters and supersonic jets at the same base for safety and training reasons. The wash from helicopter blades, for example, can propel pebbles and other debris into the sensitive intakes of jet engines if precautions are not taken. But commissioners decided they were in no position to second-guess the Navy on such military decisions, and approved the move.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
States' Top Democrats Get Appeal for Patience

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., June 26

 BODY:
For a party that assumed the White House only five months ago, the message at a convention of state Democratic leaders here was a candid admission that amounted to a political confessional: Lower your expectations and be patient with your President. He's learning from his mistakes.
In public and in private, David Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic Party, devoted hours this weekend trying to convince restive state leaders that President Clinton had a bright future, even while conceding the party's shortcomings. 
 "We all look at ourselves in the mirror and say, 'What have we not done as well?' We have not responded as aggressively or as effectively as we might have to attacks," Mr. Wilhelm said at the summer meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs. "And we need to do that." Repeatedly, he told his followers that "the thing we did not do well is communicate what we are doing."
Faced with what even Mr. Clinton's supporters concede has been the most traumatic debut for a President in modern times, the best the Democrats could do was blame themselves and Mr. Clinton for the blunders, always reminding themselves that there was still time, that a Presidency is not made in five months.
 
'I Thought He'd Take Off'
 "I didn't expect Clinton to come in and make the mistakes he made -- I thought he'd come in and take off," said Robert F. Thomas, chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party. "People in the grass roots are still very unhappy. I still see a lot of 'Impeach Clinton' stickers. But I'm confident we're on the upswing. I just think he's learning how to do things."
Stanley Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's pollster, sought to put the best face on the record low popularity ratings for a President at this early stage in office when he told the conference, "There are a lot of governors in this country who would take 40 percent job approval."
But he conceded that Mr. Clinton was hampered by an alienated electorate that is pessimistic that much can be done to improve the economy. After weeks of tumbling poll ratings that started when the President's package to stimulate the economy stumbled in Congress, Mr. Greenberg said, "We are at a point, I think, of stability."
 
Heady Days Long Past
 It was a long way from the heady days after the election, when Democrats gloated about mandates and trumpeted the era of the "New Democrats." In their yearning for the White House, many party leaders had not considered the down side of gaining power. As the adage goes: Be careful of the things you wish. Wishes come true.
Aiming to improve things, Mr. Wilhelm today unveiled a long-promised effort to expand the party at the local level -- and make inroads into Ross Perot's base -- with a Perot-style network built on using toll-free telephone numbers, national petition drives and newsletters to reach out to Democratic voters. Mr. Wilhelm also said the party was planning a national convocation of young voters for later this year.
"Now that we have a President in the White House," Mr. Wilhelm said, "our mission changes. That is why these initiatives are so crucial." For all the buildup, Mr. Wilhelm was short on specifics, unable to even offer a rough estimate of how much he will budget for the initiatives.
But his most important task was to reassure uneasy Democrats about his own leadership as well as the future of the party. Several said that for now, they were heeding Mr. Wilhelm's call to withhold judgment as the President tries to enact a new economic program, a new health-care system and a national service plan.
 
'A Learning Process'
 "Of course there's some concern," said Marlys Matuszak, the chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. "But when you take over anything, there's a learning process."
Rick Stafford, the party chairman in Minnesota, conceded that the Democrats' post-election swagger had given way to the rigors of governing. "We got complacent given the euphoria that came with the election," he said. "But I think we've been apologizing too much. We should not blame our President. He is a human being. He is not a God. He is not a monarch. I think we expect too much."
This guarded optimism was encouraged by good timing: Hours after the state leaders arrived here, the Senate approved Mr. Clinton's budget. It was by the closest of margins, and the measure faces an uncertain future in a House-Senate conference, but Democrats still touted the vote as a big victory.
James J. Brady, who is chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party and president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, said Mr. Clinton could not help but invite controversy by proposing a program that would raise taxes and cut spending. "I don't know anybody that runs up and says, 'Give me all the castor oil you can,' " he said. "But he's telling the American people truthfully how things have to be."
As much as he tried to put the best face on Mr. Clinton's first months in office, even Rahm Emanuel, the outgoing White House political director, warned Democrats not to read too much in the President's recent good fortune. "No one should take the last week to mean that we're out of the woods," he said. "We've got a lot of work to do."
Mr. Emanuel, who had been criticized as too prickly, is himself a casualty of the new Administration's growing pains. He will head the White House's campaign-style "rapid response" effort to react to attacks from Republicans. He will be replaced by his deputy, Joan Baggett, whom Mr. Emanuel described to the gathering as capable of running "a kinder, gentler political operation."
 
Rallying to the Chairman
 At least for now, Mr. Wilhelm, a longtime friend of Mr. Emanuel, has endured sniping from Capitol Hill and the White House over his own leadership. This weekend, many Democrats rallied to the side of the Chicago political strategist was Mr. Clinton's campaign manager.
Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group that Mr. Clinton turned to for ideas as he sought the Presidency, said the attacks on Mr. Wilhelm were unavoidable.
"David's in a very tough spot, and the reason is we are a party that hasn't had a strong President in a quarter century," said Mr. From, whose group has improved relations with the Democratic National Committee after years of tensions.
"We have to build a new party infrastructure, and it's very different from the old party infrastructure where you just go to a few leaders and organize your troops," he said. "David's looking at ways to really do some grass-roots organizing."
The plea from Mr. From and others this weekend, was simple: Give Mr. Clinton some time.
"A year from now," Mr. Brady predicted, "they'll be saying, 'The President's the greatest thing going since sliced bread.' "

HEADLINE: In Miami, Talk of Talking With Cuba

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 26

 BODY:
Emboldened by the change of administrations in Washington and deteriorating economic conditions in Cuba, new voices calling for a more flexible attitude toward Fidel Castro's Communist Government are emerging in the Cuban exile community here and challenging the hegemony of established groups.
The resulting political ferment most threatens the Cuban-American National Foundation, which for a dozen years has dominated, if not monopolized, exile politics. Having identified itself with the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the group has, in recent months, seen its influence diminish in Washington and had its political agenda increasingly questioned here. 
 One of the most visible signs of the new political atmosphere is the formation of an organization called Cambio Cubano, or Cuban Change. It is led by Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a former guerrilla commander and Cuban political prisoner, who says he is "prepared to dialogue with anybody" in Havana. The group favors more contacts between exiles and Cuba and opposes tightening the economic embargo against the Castro Government.
 
Orthodox Views Assailed
 The Cuban-American National Foundation, in contrast, was the architect of a law passed last year that prohibits foreign subsidiaries of American companies from doing business with Cuba. The foundation dismisses those calling for negotiations with Havana as hopelessly naive or tools of President Castro.
Domingo Moreira, a foundation director, said Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo's views "represent a minute fraction of the Cuban-American community." Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo is one of many people, Mr. Moreira said, "who want to stake out their political ground now that they have seen Castro's end is near."
But anti-Castro Cubans still living on the island and their allies in Miami have also intensified their involvement in the fray, issuing manifestos that criticize orthodox exile positions that would tighten the trade embargo and shun negotiations with Mr. Castro.
Orestes Lorenzo, the Cuban Air Force defector who became a hero among exiles when he flew back to Cuba in December 1992 to rescue his wife and sons, provoked a controversy earlier this year when he recommended that Cuban exiles load medicine, food and clothing onto boats and sail to Havana as part of a "Crusade of Love" to relieve suffering among Cubans.
Simon Ferro, a Cuban-American lawyer here who is a former chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, said: "Because we have a Democratic Administration that is more inclusive than past Republican administrations, maybe people are not as afraid to come out and talk publicly about the varying degrees of political opinion that exist within the community. Those voices were always there, but I think they weren't expressed because they didn't think they would get a fair shake in Washington."
The Cuban-American foundation, established in 1981, has become the most powerful Cuban exile organization in this country through adroit lobbying, financial muscle and, its critics assert, intimidation of potential rivals and manipulation of the Spanish-language news media. Last year, the human rights group Americas Watch issued a report criticizing foundation leaders for contributing to "a repressive climate for freedom of expression" here.
Mr. Lorenzo's aid proposal came amid reports of growing shortages of essentials in Cuba, including a scarcity of food that some doctors now believe may be responsible for a mysterious epidemic of blindness. "We need to take food, not bullets," Mr. Lorenzo said in a recent speech here. "We need to show them we care."
Exile groups that favor intensifying the embargo against Cuba have attacked Mr. Lorenzo's plan, saying it would only help prop up Mr. Castro. But many Cuban-Americans here, concerned about the health of their relatives in Cuba, grumble about that hard-line approach as they quietly flock to pharmacies to buy vitamins and medicine to ship to those relatives.
 
Unusual Credibility
 It is not clear how large a following Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo and the others of his view have, especially since their political agendas have been attacked by local Spanish-language radio stations that dutifully echo the foundation's more confrontational attitude. But his role as a founder of the paramilitary group Alpha 66 and the 22 years he spent in Cuban jails as a political prisoner give him unusual credibility. He was also an early supporter of Bill Clinton's campaign for President.
The foundation, in contrast, got off on the wrong foot with the Clinton Administration by helping sabotage the nomination of Mario Baeza, a Cuban-American lawyer from New Jersey, as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. The foundation considered Mr. Baeza too conciliatory toward Havana. The organization continues to wield considerable influence in Congress, where it makes generous donations to members from both parties, but, as a human-rights lobbyist in Washington put it, "it no longer has a pipeline to the Oval Office."
As a result, the future of TV Marti, long a pet project of the foundation, is in jeopardy. The House Appropriations Committee refused on Thursday to authorize any money for the station's broadcasts to Cuba, and the White House has made no effort to have the decision reversed.
Another sign of the Administration's disenchantment with the foundation came last month when about 100 prominent Cuban-Americans were invited to the White House ceremony observing Cuban Independence Day. The guests ranged from the pop star Gloria Estefan to Mr. Lorenzo and even Republican members of the Cuban-American delegation in Congress, but notably absent were foundation leaders who in the past routinely had access to the White House and the President.
Mr. Ferro, the former State Democratic official who helped organize the ceremony, cautioned that "just because more people are now advocating a softer, more conciliatory stance toward Cuba doesn't mean that is what Clinton is going to do."
But, he added: "The new atmosphere in which debate can develop lacks the kind of stress that existed before. People are jockeying for attention because they feel there is more room for voices now."
For its part, Washington has made it clear that it will not permit groups to the political right of the foundation to attack Mr. Castro. Last month, agents of the United States Customs Service arrested nine members of Alpha 66 after they were caught in the Florida Keys aboard a boat loaded with semiautomatic rifles and explosives. An Alpha 66 leader admitted that the men were heading to Cuba with the intention of sparking a rebellion.
Last month, a State Department spokesman, Joseph Snyder, said, "The United States Government does not support, condone or encourage any such illegal activities." He said the Government would prosecute those caught organizing attacks against Havana in violation of neutrality laws.

HEADLINE: How Scandal Undercut Japan's Smug Leaders

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
For the aging postwar rulers of Japan, the end began with a shady real estate deal: nothing too big, just a sleek glass office building in front of Kawasaki Station.
To construct the building on such a choice location in the mid-1980's, the president of a high-flying company called Recruit passed enormous amounts of unlisted stock in his company to powerful members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party. 
 It turned out to be just a first, wayward drop from a river of corruption, one that in time led to ties between politicians and the underworld, multimillion-dollar deals for companies that urgently needed changes in Japanese regulations, and finally a safe full of gold in the offices of Shin Kanemaru, the party's sly, craggy-faced fixer.
Through it all, the party's conservative leadership never really worried about survival. After 38 years of unchallenged rule, they gained a sense of invulnerability, which was born of a confidence that while individual politicians might rise or fall, the party that presided over Japan's incredible postwar ascendancy faced no real challengers.
 
Destruction by Proteges
 But by last week, five years, four scandals and three prime ministers later, those same leaders watched their power and their party implode in just hours -- destroyed not by their rivals, but by their own proteges, who abandoned Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and voted for a motion of no confidence in their own Government.
It was as if the Liberal Democrats' infrastructure, seemingly massive and unshakable from the outside, had rotted so thoroughly from within that a small tap sent it to splinters.
The party's most wily and respected political strategist, Masaharu Gotoda, who at age 78 serves as Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister, volunteered this week that the party's leaders had it coming. Recalling the first disclosures of corruption in 1988, he said, "That is when we should have had sweeping political reform. If we had done it then, we would not be facing a situation like this today."
But more than reform was at stake. The end of the cold war meant that the old fear -- that the toppling of the Liberal Democratic Party would destroy the country's economic system and its alliance with the United States -- had slowly evaporated. A stubborn recession and new trade tensions made many realize that the party that built Japan by protecting its markets, its farmers and its manufacturers -- often at the expense of its consumers -- might be an impediment in the next stage: learning how not to be the object of the world's economic resentment.
 
Socialists May Also Split
 Now the tremor is spreading. Japan's Socialist Party, the nation's perpetual opposition, also appears on the verge of splitting, dividing the old left-wing ideologues off from a more pragmatic, far younger group of legislators. Together, the rebels on both sides seem likely to form a coalition government that, if it survives, will cut out many of the older leaders who have dominated the nation for four decades.
Many people believe that the change could lead to actual debate about the country's future and its isolationist tendencies, something rare in Japanese history. It is the greatest chance here since the end of World War II to create a political system in which parties may alternate in winning power.
What has happened is clearly not a people-power revolution: it came about with none of Italy's street demonstrations, none of South Korea's tear gas. But the popular disgust created an opportunity for ambitious younger politicians.
Still, when the dust settles, many Japanese are asking, will a new party structure solve anything? Will it end the abuses of power, or simply redirect the graft? In a few years, will the parties spinning off from the Liberal Democrats come together again, purged of conservative elders who did not retire or die fast enough? And for America, will this ultimately create a Japan more geared toward the lives of consumers -- and thus more interested in lower prices, freer markets and more imports?
 
Origins of Power: Anti-Communism Party Keystone
 From its birth in 1955, the Liberal Democratic Party had a single raison d'etre: anti-Communism. The sudden rise of the Communist and Socialist Parties in Japan sparked union movements and deep opposition to the mutual security pact with the United States and the building of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. The United States was so worried that the Central Intelligence Agency gave the party aid for years.
But by the late 1960's the opposition had been virtually neutralized and the party had become the umbrella group for virtually every Japanese special interest, from farmers to car makers. As its power grew, the Japanese business community, certain its survival depended on keeping the party in power, funneled vast sums of money into the system. In turn the Liberal Democrats made sure that the Socialist and Communists got just enough seats and money to form a credible, but non-threatening, opposition.
In the mid-1970's the culture of Japan's "money politics" was exposed when it became publicly known that the Lockheed Corporation had made millions of dollars in payoffs in connection with the sale of its planes in Japan, including $2.1 million to Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. But even after Mr. Tanaka resigned and was convicted of bribery charges, cash was still king and ideological ferment was banished. Self-perpetuation became the goal.
"There was no policy debate," said Chalmers Johnson, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, and long a student of the distribution of power in Japan. "So for 30 years these guys have done nothing but plot their own re-election, or the re-election of their sons."
 
Failure of Reformers
 Periodic promises of reform sometimes narrowed the pipelines of money, but never rebuilt the machines that sucked it in. And as the economy boomed in the 1980's, small and mid-sized companies like Recruit, looking for influence and a chance to break into the market, began flooding the governing party with money.
The Recruit scandal swept away Mr. Miyazawa, then serving as Finance Minister, and eventually Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who was forced to resign in 1989. His most loyal political fund-raiser, master of selling $14 million in "tickets" to parties for Mr. Takeshita, committed suicide, perpetuating the party's conspiracy of silence about where the money came from.
The first warning from the voters came that year, stripping the party of its majority in the less-powerful upper house of Parliament. Though still divided and weak, the opposition had a monkey-wrench to throw into the machine: the ability to block everything but budget resolutions in Parliament.
But after the ritual cleansing of an election loss, the party bowed, apologized and seemed to come back. After the brief, disastrous premiership of Sousuke Uno, who resigned amid a sex scandal, the party installed a reform-minded Prime Minister with little independent initiative, Toshiki Kaifu.
Popular and well-intentioned, he provided a clean facade for the party barons. But when Mr. Kaifu briefly stepped into his own, indirectly threatening to dissolve Parliament unless a political reform bill was pushed through, they pulled the rug from beneath him, forcing him out of office in hours.
He remains bitter, remembering that Mr. Miyazawa suggested to him that he might not be ready to play "professional league baseball."
"I wonder what he thinks of baseball now," Mr. Kaifu said, musing about Mr. Miyazawa, who is expected to be deposed once the election is over.
 
'The Don of Dons': Kanemaru's Greed Speeds the Fall
 If any single person is responsible for bringing the Liberal Democratic Party's era to an end, it may be Shin Kanemaru.
At 78, Mr. Kanemaru is a brooding presence, with heavy-lidded eyes that make him look like a movie-studio parody of an aging kingmaker. He never held the premiership, and never really seemed to covet it. But with a few choice words, he determined the routes of multibillion-dollar bullet train projects and placed his lieutenants in strategic posts around the country.
The source of his power was the Takeshita faction, the biggest and richest of the half-dozen or so party groupings. But over time Mr. Kanemaru got sloppy. Last summer he admitted that he had taken $4 million in illegal contributions and stepped down as the vice president of the party. But he refused to be questioned. Instead, he negotiated a token fine of $1,700 -- less than the top fine for overnight parking on Tokyo's streets. And after mailing it in he headed off to work the next morning as if nothing had happened.
Prime Minister Miyazawa, who had been installed by Mr. Kanemaru, refused even to acknowledge a problem, stalking away one day when Japanese reporters had the temerity to ask about it.
The extraordinarily light treatment accorded Mr. Kanemaru prompted a public outcry that emboldened the leadership's many enemies. The Mainichi Shimbun, a major daily, called Mr. Kanemaru "the don of all dons." Then new evidence emerged that he had sought the help of gangsters to silence critics of Mr. Takeshita when he ran for Prime Minister in 1987. Mr. Kanemaru finally gave up his seat in Parliament.
That did not end matters. One Saturday night in early March, the prosecutors, stung by charges that they had let him off too easily, suddenly arrested the fallen politician for tax evasion. As they emptied his safe, they found $50 million, including the gold bars that became a symbol of how the party enriched itself. Mr. Takeshita, called to testify in Parliament, denied knowledge of virtually everything. So did Ichiro Ozawa, Mr. Kanemaru's chief protege, who said he had only served drinks during the critical meetings.
Mr. Gotoda, who as Justice Minister is believed to have given the arrest order, told a visitor to his office this week: "Somebody like Kanemaru could not have lasted that long. Factional politics was pushed to the limit." The party's split, he said, "was inevitable."
 
The Collapse: Party Implodes In Power Vacuum
 Mr. Kanemaru's downfall led to the breakup of the Takeshita faction and accelerated a power free-for-all. Mr. Ozawa broke away to form a faction of his own with Tsutomu Hata, a former Finance Minister.
Their platform was political reform, something many Japanese have a hard time accepting from Mr. Kanemaru's chief lieutenant. His group soon was at war with Mr. Takeshita's remaining loyalists.
The other factions were also falling apart. After the death in 1991 of Shintaro Abe, his faction -- the party's second largest, now led by Hiroshi Mitsuzuka -- saw its influence decline. Another powerful faction leader, Michio Watanabe, fell ill with what is believed to be cancer and had to resign as Foreign Minister. Though faction leaders still issued pronouncements, few listened. Discipline broke down. Many party members described themselves as "ronin," the term for samurai wandering the countryside without loyalty to a feudal lord.
Mr. Miyazawa, never known for his skills at intraparty politics, observed the chaos and did nothing. Earlier this month, he was still promising to pass political reform legislation before Parliament recessed for the summer. But hard-liners in the leadership refused to compromise with the opposition, insisting on an electoral plan that would have given the Liberal Democrats an even bigger majority. The effect, they knew, would be to kill the reform effort altogether.
Their effort to sustain the status quo touched off a revolt that had been building for years. The opposition parties called Mr. Miyazawa a liar, and Mr. Ozawa saw his chance.
When a motion of no confidence arose, he gathered his troops to oust his old colleagues. Twenty percent of the party's legislators, most of them young, abandoned Mr. Miyazawa and voted for the motion. Another 10 legislators, headed by the disillusioned head of the Liberal Democrats' reform committee, joined the revolt. Seiroku Kajiyama, leading the conservative forces of the party, threatened to throw them all out of the party. He never had the chance. They voted to bring down the Government, then quit.
 
The Future: A Smashed Party, A New Order
 In the maze of scenarios and theories about the next few weeks and months, there is only one seeming certainty: the Liberal Democratic Party, as configured since 1955, will be smashed apart.
After the mass defections of the last eight days, the party holds about 228 seats in Parliament, or 28 less than it needs for the barest majority. In the election to be held on July 18, it seems likely to lose more.
If the party can keep its losses to a minimum, it may be able to take the lead in a coalition government, presumably with one or more of the "reformist" breakaway groups.
The second possibility is that the Liberal Democrats will do so badly that they will be frozen out of a coalition by some combination of new parties, which carry names like Renaissance and Harbinger. The coalition might include part of the Socialist camp.
Yet a third possibility, one that could take months or years to play out, is that the Liberal Democrats will spin apart even further -- many believe that about 100 pro-reform members led by Mr. Kaifu could still walk out -- and then reconstitute themselves after purging the older conservatives.
But that may leave Japan once again with what amounts to one-party rule. Many say that would be a disaster: the only way to assure that consumers and urban voters get a voice is to insure that interest groups are split across at least two conservative parties, so that one can play off against the other.
"The system that lasted since 1955 is over," said Shigezo Hayasaka, a political commentator who once served as a political secretary in the Tanaka era. "The old L.D.P. is gone."

HEADLINE: Two Communities Savor Victory Over Pentagon Plans for Cutbacks;
Lives Constructed Around Military Can Go Forward

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WRIGHTSTOWN, N.J., June 25

 BODY:
McGuire Air Force Base, the military enterprise that sustains this region, went from the brink of extinction this week to an expanded role that seems to assure a prosperous future for its neighboring communities into the next century.
Not only will McGuire be kept open as an active Air Force base, contrary to a Pentagon recommendation in March, but it will expand in size and stature as the chief air mobility wing for the eastern United States, the Base Closing and Realignment Commission decided on Thursday. 
 The reversal of fortune was stunning not only for the base's 4,500 airmen, their 6,000 dependents and 2,200 civilian employees, but for local business people and thousands of retired military families who settled in the piney woods of South Jersey to enjoy the benefits of the base hospital and commissary.
"These past few months have been scary time for everyone," said Marjorie Stine, widow of a retired Air Force sergeant. "Everyone's been on pins and needles waiting for the axe to fall."
Leroy Wilkins Sr., a retired Air Force captain who now sells real estate in the Wrightstown area, said, "People were thinking of selling and moving out for the past few months, but they couldn't find any buyers. Now I believe we are going to see a lot of buying, not selling."
The communities around McGuire -- Wrightstown, Browns Mills, New Egypt -- had braced for the base closing commission to ratify the Pentagon's plan to transfer most of McGuire's military supply function to Plattsburgh Air Force Base in upstate New York.
"If that happened, Wrightstown and everything else around here becomes a ghost town," said Ms. Stine, who moved here two years ago from Philadelphia when the navy yard there was shut, ending the availability of military medical care.
 
Other Good News
 Instead, the commission overruled the Pentagon and reversed the fates of the two bases. Plattsburgh is to be closed and its fleet of more than 20 KC135 refueling tankers permanently relocated at McGuire, designated as the staging area east of the Mississippi River for Air Force transport missions and rapid deployment of troops.
In addition, McGuire is to acquire 19 KC10 tankers -- larger jets that also provide midair refueling for Air Force and Navy planes -- now stationed at Barksdale Air Force base in Louisiana, the commission decreed.
The planes would join the 51 C141 Starlifter cargo and troop carriers in McGuire's 438th Airlift Wing and two squadrons of KC 135 tankers operated by the Air National Guard, adding an unspecified number of new jobs to the base payroll, eventually reaching perhaps as high as 2,000 to 3,000, sources said. Tens of millions of dollars to be spent on upgrading hangars and other base facilities.
It is expected that some civilians at Plattsburgh will be offered the opportunity to transfer to McGuire. The changes are expected to take a year or more to accomplish.
The reprieve for McGuire was not the only good news for New Jersey. The commission rejected a plan to move the Army's Communications Electronic Command from Fort Monmouth, near Red Bank, N.J., to Illinois. Instead, it decided to move the unit from leased property off the base to buildings on post being vacated by a military intelligence command and the Army Chaplain School.
The commission also voted Friday to reject the Pentagon's recommendation to shrink the submarine base at New London, Conn. But it voted to close the Staten Island Homeport, virtually ending any significant Navy presence in New York City.
 
'A Game of Table Stakes'
 The commission's recommendations on base closings and realignments now go to President Clinton and then to Congress.
"I can't imagine the President, with the sensitivity at the moment on budget cuts, rejecting the recommendations of an independent commission," said United States Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. He spoke at a news conference here today with Senator Bill Bradley, also a Democrat of New Jersey, and Representative H. James Saxton, a Republican whose Third District includes the air base.
Should the President ask for any revisions, Senator Lautenberg explained, the commission would have to reconsider the entire proposal. "It's a game of table stakes -- he either accepts it all or gets nothing," he said.
Representative Saxton, in an interview, said the suspense of waiting for the fate of McGuire to be decided was "very unsettling" to an area economically dependent on the base. Real estate prices, already depressed by the lackluster economy and cutbacks at nearby Fort Dix, dropped further, he said, and planning for schools and businesses was suspended.
 
Some Problems as Well
 A few local residents had a somewhat different reaction.
"I couldn't say everyone would be disappointed if all the bases closed," said Virginia Detrick, head of the library at Browns Mills, a crossroads town near the entrance to Fort Dix. For all the prosperity the military contributed, she said, it brought some problems as well, such as rowdiness and crime.
Before the buildup of military bases in the area a local economy based on sawmills and gristmills barely supported a sparse population of farmers, hunters, wheelwrights and blacksmiths living deep in the pine and cedar woods, 30 miles from Philadelphia and 60 miles from New York City. Some subsistence farming remains, but there is no other major industry except the military.
Fort Dix opened in 1917 to train doughboys. In 1949, the Army landing field at the fort became an Air Force base in 1949, named in honor of Major Thomas B. McGuire Jr., a flying ace and Congressional Medal of Honor winner from New Jersey who was killed in action in 1945.
gfcrosslineSympathy for Losers
Now that McGuire's place seems secured into the next century, Jozsef Farago, Mayor of Wrightstown, is upbeat about the future.
Mr. Farago escaped from his native Hungary during the 1956 revolution and was able to enter the United States by volunteering for Army service. He rose to be a drill sergeant at Fort Dix during the Vietnam War, married a local girl, and after leaving the service 16 years ago bought Kelly's Bar, a Wrightstown landmark that had been a U.S.O. club during World War II.
"We'll do okay here with the Air Force," he said. "But do you know what bothers me? What bothers me is what's going to happen to all those people in Plattsburgh? What are they going to do with no more air base? Where are they going to go?
"They, you know, are now going to live our nightmare."

Policy Sublime: A White House Tennis Handbook

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
President Clinton is a regular runner, a semiregular golfer and an avid basketball couch potato.
Tennis, he leaves to others. 
 To fill that void, the White House has come up with a detailed policy on the use of its tennis courts.
The rules of the courts, prepared by Patsy Thomasson, the special assistant for administration, run to five pages and include a map of the White House complex complete with instructions on the best way to get to the tennis courts, at the southwest corner of the grounds.
The courts, according to the memorandum, are open to all members of the Cabinet, members of Congress and senior White House staff members. It leaves unclear whether recalcitrant Republicans are as welcome as supportive Democrats, but most people in Washington know the lay of that land.
White House workers and people who work for the Vice President or the Office of Policy Development may gain access to the courts only through a Wednesday lottery and may play only between 10 A.M. and 1 P.M. on weekend days. And they must play doubles.
In boldface type two-thirds of the way down the first page are these cautionary words: "Guests of the First Family have priority use of the court."
The Clinton tennis era is much more casual than that of the last Democratic President, Jimmy Carter. Often chastised for his micromanagement, he was an avid player who was noted for the attention he paid to who got to use the White House courts and when.
A memorandum circulated around the White House in June 1977, Mr. Carter's first summer in residence, said tennis players needed personal permission from the President to use the courts. Mr. Carter's aides used to joke about how they could plot to delicately broach the subject of tennis time after a meeting on the Middle East peace talks.
There appears to be no such problem with the Clintons. Although Mr. Clinton, too, has been known to micromanage an issue or two, tennis is not his game.
 
Barber Chair for Rent
 More on the office-space front.
David R. Gergen, the high-profile, new counselor to the President who has been struggling mightily of late to keep his profile as close to the ground as he can, may have been handed the optimum solution.
There is basically no room for the new Presidential adviser on the West Wing's prime first floor near the Oval Office. So Mr. Gergen has wedged himself in underground.
The office he has taken over is down a flight of stairs, next to the men's room and a stone's throw from the mailroom in the basement of the West Wing, roughly under the visitors' lobby. It is windowless and of such modest size that his assistant, Diana Pierce, is camped across the hall next door to the White House photographer.
More important for symbolism's sake is the office's previous use. The room was once the shop used by the President's barber. As often noted, Mr. Clinton has been seeking outside tonsorial advice, and the space once occupied by the White House barber, Milton Pitts, is now valuable real estate.
 
And One More Thing
 Mr. Clinton's political advisers fumed when their boss got tagged with a label that he confirmed as true within weeks of the start of his new Administration. He had, he admitted, lost his focus.
Nobody could fault him for lack of focus last week. In a coordinated and disciplined effort that represented a tour de force in single-minded determination, Mr. Clinton spoke of virtually nothing but the economy. And he went to extraordinary lengths to do it.
He talked about it to schoolchildren and to members of Congress, to reporters and to business leaders. He talked a blue streak, and when he stopped, his advisers trotted out senior officials like Lloyd Bentsen, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to pick up where he left off.
And just to make sure no one would miss the point, two of the week's regular daily news briefings, which normally touch on a wide variety of issues, were canceled to make room for Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta. Then, in case that turned out to be underkill, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Panetta suddenly popped up before cameras on Wednesday, the day before the big Senate vote, to denounce a Republican alternative and praise their own initiative.
Mr. Clinton even extended his campaign into outer space, talking up his plan to continue support for the space shuttle during a conversation with the astronauts aboard the Endeavour.
"We've got some important votes coming up in the Congress in the next two days," Mr. Clinton said during the hookup. "While you're up there, we're going to be down here voting on this project. And I very much hope that we can prevail. And I think frankly your success and your work will help us to prevail. You're doing as much up there to help us win the votes down here as anyone, and I thank you for that."
It must have worked. He won. And then he talked about it some more.

HEADLINE: In Cleaner Harbor, Creatures Eat the Waterfront

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON

 BODY:
Mariners used to joke that New York City was a "clean harbor" -- a quick way of saying that the water pollution was so severe that it killed any organisms attached to the hulls of their ships. But now the tables have turned: the waters around New York are so much cleaner that voracious mollusks and crustaceans have returned and are devouring the waterfront.
After decades of effort to reduce the pollution from sewage and petrochemicals that fouled the harbor, officials from the city and from New York and New Jersey have had trouble accepting the idea that clean water somehow poses a problem. 
 But in a perverse measure of environmental progress, the officials are now realizing that they could lose many of the wooden bulkheads and piers that line the waterfront unless they spend hundreds of millions of dollars to protect the timbers from the insatiable creatures, collectively known as bore worms.
"It may not be the cockroach that ate Cincinnati, but the bore worm is quickly becoming the mollusk that swallowed New York," said Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a major owner of waterfront property.
By the end of next year, New York City will have spent about $100 million to brace and wrap plastic around thousands of pilings supporting 12 of the most vital piers, including the South Street Seaport in the East River and the three Hudson River piers of the Passenger Ship Terminal (No. 88, at 48th Street; No. 90, at 50th Street and No. 92, at 52d Street), including the berth for the Queen Elizabeth 2.
But officials say the cost of fending off the bore worms will certainly rise. The borers have infested submerged wooden structures from Kennedy International Airport to New Jersey, as well as footings for the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and local bridges. In addition, the wooden bulkheads that surround much of the city and northern New Jersey are presumed vulnerable.
"We're talking a lot of money," said Ann Buttenwieser, the vice president of waterfront planning and development of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, who was among the first to sound the alarm. "No one has calculated the total cost. But any agency and property owner with piers is suffering from exactly the same problem."
Unlike most other types of maintenance, the work cannot be deferred, even for a short period. Mrs. Buttenwieser notes the worms have "nothing to do but eat 24 hours a day" and can devour 12-inch-thick pilings in a couple of years. So the bore worms will soon reduce any unprotected wood structure along the water to a fading memory.
The attack of the marine borers is one of a number of unanticipated consequences of progress in the fight against water pollution. The problems, in some ways, are as profound and unwelcome as the degradation caused by pollution. In April, for instance, a steel pier collapsed in Hoboken in large part because clean water sped corrosion.
"The oil and grease used to coat the steel and protected the pier," said Edwin J. Chius, the city's business administrator. "The cleanliness of the water has had a bad effect."
Environmental progress is something of a double-edged sword, with costs as well as benefits, on land as well as in the water. The reforestation of large portions of the Northeast has allowed deer to multiply, scientists say, aiding the spread of ticks carrying Lyme disease across the region and causing a sharp jump in traffic fatalities from collisions with the animals.
"When Bambi carries a fatal disease, his return somehow doesn't seem quite as wonderful anymore," said David Burg, the president of the National Audubon Society's New York City chapter, the country's largest.
But environmentalists point to the slaughter of laughing gulls on Long Island as perhaps the clearest example of the perversity syndrome. The birds were almost hunted to extinction at the turn of the century, yet were lured back to the area by the creation of the Jamaica Wildlife Refuge. But after transportation officials said the thriving colony is a hazard to jets using Kennedy Airport, the Department of Agriculture two years ago began shooting thousands of the birds.
"It's kind of a hot potato," acknowledged Thomas Bancroft, a senior scientist for the National Audubon Society. "It's not something that's been addressed thoroughly."
Saving the region's waterfront from the bore worms is likely to prove more complicated than protecting planes at Kennedy. The borers have bedeviled seafarers and waterfront communities for centuries. They are blamed for the hole in the dike that the Little Dutch Boy plugged with his finger. (Apocryphal? "It may very well be that the little boy put in more than his thumb. He probably put his whole arm in there," says Ruth D. Turner, the curator of mollusks at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, who wrote her first paper on the worms almost 50 years ago.)
The creatures claimed two of Christopher Columbus' four wooden galleons in Panama during his last voyage to the New World. And in 1833, the New York City Board of Aldermen, frustrated by demands to protect waterfront structures, passed a resolution declaring that "piers and wharves, as now constructed of timber, are temporary, and generally endure only from 14 to 17 years before they are destroyed by worms."
The waterfront was saved by pollution. It killed most marine life in the inner harbor and seemed to relegate the borers to a footnote in New York City's history. Andrew Willner, the American Littoral Society's baykeeper for the New York and New Jersey Harbor Estuary, noted that some areas like Newtown Creek had so much tar and oil in the water that skippers used to sail into them as a cheap way of caulking their boats and plugging leaks.
But water quality has improved steadily since the 1972 passage of Federal Clean Water Act, allowing countless marine species to return to the area. While some sediments remain polluted with toxics and heavy metals, many fishermen now swear that the city has some of the best fishing in the world -- an argument that was bolstered last year when a new world record was set near the Battery for a striped bass landed with light tackle. "When I haul my boat in every Spring, I have barnacles on any metal surface that isn't covered with bottom paint," Mr. Willner said with delight.
In the early 1980's, marine biologists began noticing an increase in the numbers of one type of borer, a shrimp-like, quarter-inch-long creature, Limnoria lignorum, known as a gribble. It attacks the surface of the wood and gives pilings their characteristic hourglass shape. But that caused little alarm, since the damage they cause is superficial and readily apparent.
But in 1983, another type of borer -- called the shipworm, even though it is a mollusk of the Teredinidae family -- was again detected in the inner harbor. The worms drill into the wood and, in the South Pacific, grow to six feet.
The two types of borers, working in tandem, make a double-barreled attack. In tests around the harbor, researchers found that the voracious mollusks made soft pine panels as porous as sponge in a year. But city officials could not believe that they threatened the decades-old waterfront.
"When I started talking about this a couple years ago, people said she's crazy," Mrs. Buttenwieser recalled. "But now it's become something of an emergency."
A study of the four piers at the Brooklyn Army Terminal found that the borers turned the thickest pilings into relative matchsticks in about two years. When the study began in April 1991, the pilings were 8 to 12 inches thick; by the next September, they were only about 6 inches. Many have now been reduced to as little as 2 inches and can barely support their own weight. Mrs. Buttenwieser said that when city officials arrived two months ago to inspect Pier 4, they found that Pier 1 had collapsed during the night.
"The preservation of the facilities that are infested with marine borers will require significant protective and rehabilitative expenditures," concluded a 1991 Port Authority study conducted by Vernon C. Berndt, a materials engineer and Cas Bognacki, a supervising engineer. "Hopefully, effective materials will be developed that can encapsulate and preserve our structures."
Dr. Turner of Harvard said the way to control the borers is to limit their food supply and to impregnate waterfront structures with preservatives like creosote. "Don't let any trash wood lie around," she said. "Chop it up and get rid of it."
But those solutions cause almost as many problems. Researchers say evidence is mounting that the borers have become tolerant of creosote, a liquid made from coal tar. In any case, such preservatives tend to leach out of the wood, polluting the harbor. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has proposed pulling out collapsed piers. But many environmentalists note that the pilings have been there for years and form artificial reefs, the spawning grounds for countless species, and strongly oppose the idea.
"The original attitude was to take it all away, but now we want to preserve it as part of our heritage," Mrs. Buttenwieser said.
Some West Coast ports have been wrapping their piers since the 1960's, when Los Angeles was hit by a severe borer attack. Officials say the process is not particularly difficult, but it is time-consuming and expensive because the piers have thousands of pilings, each one of which must be individually wrapped by a diver.
That has led to another approach: the city is replacing the dilapidated Tiffany Street pier in the Bronx with a dock made entirely of recycled plastic.

HEADLINE: Report on Empire Assails Albany's Insurance Dept.

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
While Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield was being mismanaged, the New York State Insurance Department seemed helpless to address the company's financial crisis and overly concerned that it might generate bad publicity for Empire, a scathing report on the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer says.
The 200-page report released on Friday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations portrays a department that was fearful that the company would collapse, leaving some of the state's sickest people uninsured. And so, the report asserts, regulators often appeared to bend to Empire's wishes. 
 The department has said it has little power under state law to interfere with the way Empire runs its business. And the report considers that the task of regulating the company may simply be too vast.
But, the committee staff also said, the department can approve rates Empire charges many of its 8.2 million customers, and ultimately has the right to take the company over. And it questioned "whether what is missing is not the authority to regulate, but rather the will to regulate."
 
Concerned for Customers
 Kevin Foley, Deputy Superintendent of Insurance, said on Friday that the department has not had the chance to digest the report. But he rejected criticism that the department has been soft on Empire. And he said that there was nothing wrong with being concerned about Empire's customers.
An aide to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Arda Nazerian, said yesterday that the Governor had not yet read the report and would not comment until he has done so.
The report charges that Salvatore R. Curiale, the State Insurance Superintendent, unskeptically accepted Empire's argument that its losses -- $250 million over the last two years -- were the result of unfair competition from for-profit insurance companies. Empire has accused its for-profit, or commercial, competitors of "cherry-picking" the company's youngest and healthiest customers, while Empire was required to insure everyone.
The report did not discount that as a factor, but it laid blame for most of Empire's losses on "gross mismanagement," serious service problems and a pattern of high corporate living more appropriate for a profitable Fortune 500 company.
 
'Almost Indistinguishable'
 Yet, the report asserted, "At times, Mr. Curiale has seemed almost indistinguishable from Empire officials in the vigor with which he has propounded Empire's cherry-picking argument as an explanation for Empire's recent financial woes."
Although the report questioned whether Empire's problems were too large and complex for insurance regulators to handle, it concluded that "the staff believes that if the Insurance Department had acted aggressively in the past to specific, incremental problems and issues, the current situation may not have come about."
The report shows Mr. Curiale repeatedly "asking, rhetorically: 'What am I supposed to do? I don't have the manpower or expertise' to tell Empire how to make money.' " And it recounts several examples of the department's caving in to Empire on significant matters of regulation.
In 1986, the company persuaded the department to back away from its decision to require Healthnet, Empire's new health maintenance organization, to file its own financial accounting with regulators, separate from the company's overall balance sheets. According to the subcommittee, the department changed its mind after a heavy campaign by Empire's lobbyists, the Albany law firm of Hinman, Straub, Pigors & Manning.
 
Leniency Reduced Safeguards
 A result of this seemingly minor change was important, the committee said. Had Healthnet filed a separate balance sheet, it would have been required to maintain hefty reserves to protect its customers. Moreover, it would have been far easier to spot early problems in the health maintence organization, which eventually lost $100 million.
The committee also cited instances in which the department seemed to minimize criticism of Empire. In 1990, a department insurance examiner included a section in his annual analysis that criticized Empire for being uncooperative in supplying financial information. The report was placed in the public record.
Empire's chairman, Albert A. Cardone, became upset, subcommittee records show, and telephoned the department to complain. The department then took the highly unusual step of "unfiling" the report from the public record, the examiner, Michael Scharff, told the subcommittee staff.
Mr. Cardone lobbied to have the criticism about Empire's lack of cooperation stricken from the report, Mr. Scharff recounted in a deposition filed with the committee.
The report was not returned to the public record until six months later. The criticism remained. But a new paragraph was added, in which Empire executives said they were unaware of the lack of cooperation, presumably by lesser company officials.
In his deposition, Mr. Scharff said it was not inappropriate for Empire to have the opportunity to comment on an annual report. He said he had no problem with the change, but called the handling of the report unusual.

Steinbrenner Is Just One More Car Alarm

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
The time has come to call the Fat Man's bluff; Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins have to bite the baseball, swallow and say, "You know what you can do with your ball club, George."
And make no mistake. It is George Steinbrenner's ball club, not America's, not New York's, not yours or even mine, with all my prattle about having been born in the South Bronx and sitting with my dad as the Great DiMaggio "drifted" under fly balls. I have been a registered Yankee fan since birth, except for those times, while covering them, when I put my passion in a blind trust. 
 Never trust blindly, or some felonious loudmouth will come along and buy the team and blackmail the city. So go, already, George.
For politicians and tycoons, the purpose of local sports teams is to create a joyful noise that will drown out the screams in the night. A major league franchise plugs a city into the Happy News Network of sportschatter. Tourists and investors are lured by what the South Bronx once called "allrightnika," the illusion that all is well.
For example, years will go by in which the only positive news that comes out of, say, Detroit, are sports stories. Recently, however, Chicago and Montreal suffered the negative whiplash of such stories when championship celebrations were crashed by vandals and looters.
But this has never been the case in New York, not even the case in regions of New York, at least not since Brooklyn, the borough that should have been a city, allowed itself to be defined by a baseball team. New York has always been too large, too fragmented, too important as an imperial city to need sports. There are people in New York who cannot identify Anthony Young, John Starks or Adam Graves. These are people who have fax machines in their cars.
Now, if the Yankees officially changed their name to the Bronx Bombers and became a positive force in that borough, a working member of the community rather than a developer's "anchor," there would be reason to pay off George to stay. If the owner had made good on all his 20-year-old promises to turn the area around the Stadium into a safe, well-lighted neighborhood, perhaps attendance would not be down. And there would be more sympathy for the Governor and the Mayor, who do not want to be remembered, unfairly, as the politicians who lost the Yankees.
Better they should be remembered as the statesmen who wouldn't be bullied, by George.
New York does not need the Yankees. New York needs the Broadway theater and the television networks, and it needs the publishing, advertising, financial and clothing industries, and it needs its museums and concert halls and art galleries. But anyone who claims that the Yankees are critical to the economics or the soul or, their favorite word, "chemistry," of the city is probably making money from the Yankees or has been spooked by the fall of the Mets.
Some irony here. Thirty-one years ago, when the Mets were really in the toilet, sportswriters scared they would lose their livelihoods rallied New Yorkers by touting the Mets' incompetence as symbolic of underdog struggle. Come to the Polo Grounds and watch the pageant of your lives. The Yankees were so good then they were sneered at as the team for bankers and tourists.
Now the Mets are just losers, and the sportswriters get quivery describing how the new manager, Dallas Green, yelled at the players and ranked on them in public. They are making fun of Anthony Young when he should be awarded the role medal; he hangs tough and keeps coming back. Meanwhile, the Yankees are winning and the Fat Man is passing out ransom notes.
So what if the Yankees move to New Jersey, where so many New Yorkers now live? You don't think Steinbrenner, of the Cleveland Steinbrenners, came all this way to call his team the Garden State Yankees? And remember what happened the last time a New York team moved to New Jersey. When the Giants won the Super Bowl, did anyone call them the Secaucus Eleven? Or label L. T. the Hackensacker? They were still the New York Giants on the Happy News Network, and for many who lived in the city, it was easier to get to their games.
Such lessons seem to have been lost lately in this frantic New Jock City with its concurrent seasons and a fandom maddened by tabloid wars and radio daze. The Rangers slipped out of the playoffs and we are still looking for targets; who can be Harazined for losing the Beezer? The Knicks gave us a gallant year; it would be unfair to keep replaying someone's missed shots in the time of Michael Jordan. Besides, Pat Riley cashing in on "three-peat" T-shirts is such a New York thing to do, even if he got the idea in Los Angeles. The Devils and the Isles and the Nets gave promise of hot seasons to come. Don't forget the Giants and the Jets. And the Mets will come back.
Forget about the Yankees. New York doesn't need them, not in Yankee Stadium, probably not even downtown, as badly as New York needs responsible ownership that considers itself the steward of a public resource and stand-up politicians and citizens who will join me in putting their Yankee love on hold until Steinbrenner gets it or gets out.
As far as I'm concerned, it's over until the Fat Man leaves.

HEADLINE: JUNE 20-26: Young Steps Down;
Detroit Now May Face A Referendum on Revival

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
His voice laboring from the effects of emphysema, Coleman A. Young, who is 75, said last week that he did not have the energy to seek a sixth four-year term as Detroit's mayor. The city's mayoral race instantly became a wide open contest among more than a dozen candidates, and could well turn into a referendum on the economic future of what is arguably the country's most depressed big city.
Mr. Young, whose principal contribution was to bring political enfranchisement to blacks, failed to lure investment and business after a massive flight of whites during the 1960's and 1970's. 
 Mr. Young has brought about some large public and private development projects. And a recovering auto industry should increase employment somewhat. Still, economists say the next mayor must draw investors, businesses and residents on a much larger scale. One big advantage the next mayor will have is a huge amount of vacant property and low asking prices.

HEADLINE: Services Count Also

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trade Gap Widened in April" (Business Day, June 18) aptly summarizes the important changes in the United States merchandise trade deficit reported by the Commerce Department for April and the year to date. Yet in equating these merchandise figures with the United States net "trade deficit," you ignore the growing trade surplus in private services and consequently vastly overstate our trade woes. This is an example of a national misperception that only overseas sales of American merchandise count as exports. 
 One has only to examine the 1992 and 1993 first quarter trade statistics, released June 15 by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce Department, to understand the importance of the booming nature of United States private services trade.
The bureau, recognizing the need to link the merchandise and services trade statistics, introduced a new net trade figure. While the merchandise trade deficit for fiscal year 1992 totaled $96 billion, trade in private services resulted in a $61 billion surplus; the United States net trade deficit for 1992 thus came to $35 billion.
Taking only merchandise into account is understandable. The Commerce Department's April numbers include no mention of services. Indeed, there is no monthly compilation of United States service export statistics, only a quarterly figure. However, the Bureau of Economic Analysis plans to begin issuing monthly private services and net trade statistics next year.

HEADLINE: Saving and Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trade Sanity With Japan" (editorial, June 16) falls back on an old shibboleth of free traders: "Longstanding trade deficits reflect insufficient saving." There is a good argument for free trade, but that is not it. 
 The equation that links investment, saving and trade works in both directions, and it is just as rigorous to argue that a lower trade deficit will increase savings. Common sense should tell you that the situation you describe, in which Americans buy more goods than they produce and therefore must import the balance, is only true if the United States were operating at full capacity.
If it isn't -- and our relatively high unemployment should signal to you there is plenty of slack in the economy -- then your assertion is logically imprecise.
Free trade benefits all participants through comparative advantage, but participants can "cheat" and come out ahead of the game. If the trade partners of the United States are protecting domestic companies and industries with nontariff barriers (difficult to detect and surmount), subsidies or dumping, it behooves the United States to use its political and economic muscle to open these markets.
Economic theory misunderstood and sloppily applied leads to political tensions and beggar-thy-neighbor policies. Above all, it harms the cause of free trade.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Without a Commissioner, Padres Unload Their Stars

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Where is Bowie Kuhn when we need him?
During his 15 years as commissioner, Kuhn made integrity the byword of his office. He considered himself so much the commissioner of the game's integrity that he acted swiftly when he thought that integrity was being compromised. 
 Seventeen years ago this month, for example, Kuhn prohibited Charlie Finley from stripping his club, the Oakland Athletics, of its best players.
No one is around now, though, to prevent the owners of the San Diego Padres from decimating what less than a year ago was a division contender.
The Padres are acting under the guise of a so-called small-market club trying to lower its payroll and survive in these so-called troubling economic times, but they nevertheless have undermined their ability to give the paying public a competitive team. The Mets, at least, have done that on merit.
 
Sheffield Jettisoned
 Gary Sheffield, who only came close to winning the Triple Crown last season, was the latest star player the Padres jettisoned. Fred McGriff, one of the most consistent home run hitters in the major leagues, goes next. The Padres will probably ship him to the Atlanta Braves or the Yankees, or maybe somewhere else, by the All-Star Game break. Bruce Hurst already would have been traded if his shoulder had permitted him to pitch.
Preceding Sheffield out of town were Tony Fernandez, Benito Santiago, Darrin Jackson, Randy Myers, Craig Lefferts, Mike Maddux and Larry Andersen.
When Kuhn blocked Finley's efforts to divest the Athletics of Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers and Joe Rudi in 1976, he wrote that the sales would strip the team of "much of its finest talent" and leave it with "little chance to compete effectively in its division."
"Public confidence in the integrity of club operations and in baseball would be greatly undermined should such assignments not be restrained," Kuhn concluded.
Bud Selig, the owner responsible for the integrity of the game in the absence of a Bowie Kuhn, Peter Ueberroth or Fay Vincent, rejected the Finley precedent in discussing the Padres' plight.
Finley tried to sell his players for money, Selig noted; the Padres, except when players have left them as free agents, have received players in return, albeit often minor league players.
"I've thought a lot about it," Selig said. "I don't think that's a proper analogy. No. 1, the Padres are getting back young players. It's not dissimilar to what Houston has done, and they've become a good club. And obviously the environment has changed. It's tough to analogize between 1976 and now. Here you have a club that's trying to get its payroll back into an area where it can make money or at least break even. They're not liquidating. They're getting good young talent back. Who among us is smart enough to predict how they'll turn out?"
Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, sees it differently. "The approach in San Diego," he said, "is things aren't going well so the only thing we can do is dump salaries, and if that hurts the team, alienates fans and drives down TV ratings, there's nothing we can do about that."
In return for the salaries they have shed, the Padres received Erik Schullstrom, Ricky Gutierrez, D. J. Dozier, Wally Whitehurst, Raul Casanova, Roger Mason, Mike Freitas, Derek Bell, Trevor Hoffman, Jose Martinez and Andres Berumen.
Selig is right: No one can predict how they will turn out. But experience says most of the young players won't attain the ability level of the players they were traded for, and certainly not in time for the fans who bought tickets this year to get their money's worth.
That is why two Padres fans have sued the club, claiming that the Padres reneged on a written promise -- made in a letter to season-ticket holders -- to keep Sheffield and Jackson this season. Furthermore, the Padres' 15-man ownership group has violated the pledge it included in the team's media guide.
Ownership, the pledge says, "is committed to building a strong and cohesive team, a team consisting of strong management and talented players with the desire to win."
It was reported yesterday that in the aftermath of the Sheffield trade, the Padres will offer prorated refunds to those who bought season tickets after the written promise was issued. "Everything I said in that letter was true as the facts existed at that time," said the team's president, Dick Freeman. "Nevertheless, the goodwill of our fans is important."
Selig, who has his own small-market problems in Milwaukee, said he understands the fans' frustration. But speaking of the team's primary owner, he added: "I have great regard for Tom Werner. He's doing what he feels he has to do. Knowing the economics of his team as I do, it has nothing to do with the capital structure of that ownership. It has to do with the payroll getting up so high you can't make it work in the market."
The Padres began the season with a $24.5 million payroll. It is $21.2 million now, but the owners want to slash it to perhaps less than half that amount.
Recalling that the ownership group bought the Padres only three years ago, Fehr said: "Teams have behaved this way in the past. The big difference is ownership bought the team recently, thought it could operate the team in a certain manner but obviously has had capitalization problems.
"This is a group baseball said was O.K. and approved. You don't have a commissioner who can make inquiries into these things. I'm not saying there's anything wrong, but given the chaos baseball has, if there's reason for inquiry, there's no one to make that inquiry. So if they want to do it, they just do it."
Selig, who sees nothing to inquire about, said he didn't think the ownership group has a problem. "They were the strongest group," he said. "A lot of people were bidding for the club. A lot has to do with the payroll compared with anticipated gross revenues." Payrolls of $30 million or $35 million just don't go well in a small market, not unless you're willing to lose a lot of money."
 
Pitching Around
 Don Baylor, the beleaguered manager of the Colorado Rockies, became so desperate for an effective starting pitcher that he gave the ball last week to Jeff Parrett, a six-year veteran whose first 31 appearances this season had been in relief and whose career record consisted of 367 games in relief and 5 as a starter.
Parrett is one of 17 pitchers the Rockies have used, but they have nothing on the Cleveland Indians. Mike Hargrove has used 20 pitchers. Eleven have started games and 16, including 7 who have started, have relieved. Parrett was the Rockies' ninth starter. They have had 14 pitchers relieve, including 6 of the 9 who have started.
The Indians, however, have recently eased their earned run average under 5.00. The Rockies' staff e.r.a. is moving in the opposite direction, soaring beyond 6.00 in San Francisco's 17-run onslaught last Thursday. The Rockies have endured 17 games in which the opposing team has scored 10 runs or more. The other six teams in the National League West have experienced 17 such games.
 
Powerless Red Sox
 With only 36 home runs entering yesterday's game, the Boston Red Sox are certain to finish at the low end of the team home run totals again. Last season they hit 84, outslugging only Milwaukee (82) and Kansas City (75) in the American League. What has happened to the team that not long ago seemed to have a bunch of home run hitters?
"Jim Rice retired, Dwight Evans retired, Don Baylor and Tony Armas no longer are playing baseball," Mike Greenwell said.
Greenwell, whose five home runs place him second on the team, said the Red Sox would love to have home run hitters, but "having home run hitters didn't translate into championships, so they went into the pitching part of the game more."
"We have to find a balance of hitting and pitching. If we had the power we used to have with this pitching staff, we'd have an awfully good team." But given the type of team the Red Sox have, the left fielder added, "speed and a better defense would help."
"Our pitching is going to keep us in a lot of games," said Greenwell. "If we could get another run or two, we could win some of the games we're losing."

How to Go Safely From Here to Fall

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
HERE is an oddity. A paradox, actually. We have an organization that the insurance companies hate, but the organization is telling us how to get safely through the summer.
The entity is called Radar, which is an acronym for the Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights, a lame-name umbrella group for the makers of radar detectors, those little black boxes that beep when they spot a trooper speed-reading up ahead. 
 The reason the insurance companies dislike Radar, of course, is that the organization's avowed goal is to help us get to our destinations quickly and without contributing unduly to municipal coffers via speeding tickets.
But Radar has long been the motorist's friend in other ways, too, publishing a monthly newsletter on transportation issues and serving as a clearinghouse for information on drivers' rights, speed traps and radar abuses by the police. Which brings us to the point of all this.
The newsletter, called Radar Reporter and published at the group's headquarters in Tipp City, Ohio, notes that summer poses a particular dilemma for drivers, with extra traffic creating more safety hazards at the same time that motorists want swift travel.
Thus, it says, you should pay particular attention to other vehicles and know that five types of mishaps account for 75 percent of all accidents and 83 percent of road injuries. In descending order, they are: running a red light; a stopped vehicle hit from the rear; running off the road; improper lane changes, and left turns in front of oncoming traffic.
In addition, the newsletter says, the few seconds you might save by driving fast are overshadowed by summer's increased hazards. Instead, drive at the posted limit, stay out of the way of faster traffic and allow extra room ahead and behind. On busy roads, go with the flow of traffic and be careful when changing lanes.
When in doubt, the newsletter advises, remember that research shows that vehicles traveling a few miles per hour faster than the average speed of traffic have the lowest involvement in accidents, while vehicles going much faster or much slower have the highest accident rates.
It is important, too, to watch everything on the road. Scan ahead so you have time to react. As you watch the traffic, formulate evasive plans and be poised to act. "When driving at night," the newsletter says, "assume everyone else is drunk and might do something unpredictable."
Even when driving by day, the newsletter says, remember that running with headlights on can double the distance at which you are visible to oncoming traffic.
There is the usual advice about leaving three seconds' worth of space between your car and the one ahead. Conversely, if you are being tailgated, just let the offender go by.
"Be a signal skeptic," the newsletter says. "Just because somebody has his turn signal blinking doesn't mean he's going to turn. It may have been on since he pulled out of Bubba's Tavern five miles back." It is also true that many vehicles have inoperative taillights.
Rearview mirrors are equally untrustworthy. Every car has blind spots, so look over your shoulder before changing lanes.
You need to know your vehicle, too, although that can be a problem when driving a rental. Still, pay attention. Do the brakes grab when wet? Does your truck run out of oomph on uphills when towing the boat? Don't forget to compensate when following another vehicle or in passing.
Similarly, become familiar with the sounds and vibrations of your steed. If something changes, it could be a warning of mechanical woes.
Far too many accidents occur when drivers are fatigued and trying to stretch the driving day, and it is important to know when to stop.
"Recognize when you are tired or your concentration is waning and get out from behind the wheel," the newsletter says. "Try to stick with your normal meal and sleeping schedules, and don't prop yourself up with mass quantities of caffeine."
All that may seem obvious, but the basics are still the basics, and when it comes to stopping accidents, restating them can't hurt.
Besides, much of the information in the newsletter and otherwise available from the organization is more arcane. If you want more, the address is Radar, 4949 South 25-A, Tipp City, Ohio 45371.
 
 
 
SUMMER AND THE OVERLOAD FACTOR
 True, you have six kids, a dog, a sick hamster, and the in-laws want to come along. But holiday-bound motorists should be careful not to overload the family buggy, the Tire Industry Safety Council warns.
The council, which represents most of the world's tire makers, notes that excessive weight causes abnormal flexing in a tire's sidewall, which in turn generates excessive heat.
Thomas E. Cole, the council chairman, said the added weight can also cause springs and shock absorbers to fail.
"An overloaded vehicle is hard to drive and hard to stop," he said. "Couple the overloading problem with the all-too-common problem of underinflated tires, and you have real potential for trouble."
Heat is a tire's worst enemy, Cole said, adding that a buildup -- particularly at highway speeds -- can start a separation of the tread from the body of the tire, eventually leading to failure.
The load that a tire will carry safely is a function of its size, its load range and the corresponding inflation pressure.
"Proper inflation is critical," Cole said, adding that it should be measured when cold, which means that you should get out the gauge before you get behind the wheel. Officially, cold pressure is the pressure of a tire driven a mile or less.
A tire's load capacity at its maximum inflation is molded into the sidewall, but the council recommends checking for a vehicle's proper inflation in the owner's manual. Usually, a label is also inside the glovebox door or on the driver's doorpost.
"Add up the maximum load of all four tires," Cole said, "and you get the total gross weight, including vehicle weight, passengers and cargo, that the tires can support. But remember, it's the manufacturer that determines the load that your vehicle can safely accommodate."
Maybe you can get a housesitter for the hamster.

HEADLINE: Two Communities Savor Victory Over Pentagon Plans for Cutbacks;
Lots of Hard Work Yield Good Night Of Sleep in Groton

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., June 25

 BODY:
Frank O'Beirne Jr. said today that he was looking forward to his first good night's sleep in months after hearing that the Base Realignment and Closure Commission was unanimously recommending that the Navy maintain its submarine base here.
Mr. O'Beirne, a retired Navy captain and one of the leaders of a coalition formed to save the base, helped perform a computer analysis that showed that closing other facilities could save up to $1.6 billion in the next seven years. He made six trips to Washington to share those results with the commission staff, and one trip to Boston to testify at a regional hearing. 
 "After 30 years in the Navy, I really hate to say this, but the Navy didn't have its act together," Mr. O'Beirne said. "They never looked at options, and then when we did, even the base closure commission had to sit up when you're talking more than a billion dollars."
Norbert V. Fay, who organized demonstrations in support of the base whenever it was visited by members of the commission, said he watched the vote on television today and described it to a union official at the base.
 
'Blow by Blow' Account
 "It was almost like a prize fight, the way I was giving him a blow by blow," Mr. Fay said. "It wasn't until I hung up the phone that I realized we had won.
"I look upon this vote as way of holding the community together for my grandchildren, to make it a place for them to grown up and thrive. If it had gone the other way, I think they would have had to move away to find jobs."
State and local officials joined members of the Sub Base Realignment Coalition in rejoicing at the commission's recommendation that submarines continue to be berthed in Groton, where visitors are greeted by a large blue sign that proclaims the city the submarine capital of the world. Besides the submarine base, Groton is home to the Electric Boat shipyard, which builds nuclear submarines and has undergone repeated layoffs.
The Navy had proposed moving most of its submarines to King's Bay, Ga., at a cost of $300 million, eliminating 2,227 jobs in southeastern Connecticut. Supporters of the Groton base contended that it made no sense to move the submarines while maintaining a training center in Groton, which the Navy said would be too expensive to move.
 
Not Out of the Woods
 "I'm elated," said Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat whose district includes Groton. "This is one of the best days of my life."
Mr. Gejdenson said the region still has to worry about the next round of base closings, in 1995, but this decision sets an important precedent.
The Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative provided the computer experts to do the analysis of the base-closure plans, because the base accounts for 15 percent of its electricity sales.'
"Everybody here is celebrating," said Richard D. Currier, the director of finance and accounting at the cooperative. "We had provided an awful lot of ammunition and it was apparently very hard to refute. But we all had our fingers crossed."
"I'm not surprised, just relieved," said State Representative Lenny T. Winkler, a Groton Republican. "The coalition did a fantastic job, a lot of research, and the case they presented made it hard to vote in favor of moving the submarines."
 
Savings Were the Ticket
 Mrs. Winkler said she believed what swayed the panel was the savings the Navy could realize by keeping submarines in Groton, and not the potential economic impact on the region, which the Federal commission was also supposed to consider.
"Every community that had a base on their list could prove that the economic impact would be devastating," she said. "But the coalition presented them with facts to show how the Navy could save money by keeping Groton open."
Mr. O'Beirne agreed: "You never know what's going to happen in a politically inclined environment. The pressure that can be brought to bear from any number of quarters can be enormous, and probably was. This was never a sure thing. It was a tense situation, right down to the vote."

HEADLINE: After a Year, Neighbors In Yonkers Live Warily

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YONKERS, June 25

 BODY:
In the Crestwood section of this city with a racially troubled past, neighbors grumble to each other about the newcomers, about the graffiti on a suburban fence, the lawn that was brashly invaded by bicycle riders, the blaring music that jarred a languorous afternoon.
But such complaints also mask a collective sigh of relief. 
 For the homeowners of this leafy thicket of colonials and tudors acknowledge that things have not worked out as badly as they feared in the year since 48 low-income families moved into a cluster of functional brick town houses constructed under a Federal desegregation order. In the Crestwood complex and in four other court-ordered town house developments in the city, there have been no crime to speak of, no racial clashes and no significant white flight, city officials say. Home prices have dropped, but they have done so almost everywhere in Westchester County.
Still, residents say their fears have not been put to rest.
In a new stage in the 13-year-old Yonkers housing desegregation case, Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan is weighing plans to place subsidized tenants in private buildings, either new construction or existing housing, in largely middle-class areas of Yonkers. Longtime residents are worried that as many as four new developments could spring up within a mile of the 48-unit Dr. James F. X. O'Rourke Town Houses in Crestwood, "tipping" the neighborhood's racial balance and leading to a white exodus.
"We don't want to be saturated," says Eleanor Bourke, head of the Whitman Homeowners Association, whose 200 predominantly white-owned homes surround the public-housing site. "If more housing comes here we could have a problem."
The nub of the latest stage of litigation involves the creation of Federal and state subsidized apartments for families who earn $67,000 or less in privately run buildings. Mayor Terence M. Zaleski, proclaiming a change of heart from the city's rebellious history, said he wants to settle its integration obligations by finding 450 apartments in existing cooperatives, building 115 new ones and renovating 144 apartments in the largely black and Hispanic section of southwest Yonkers.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which helped bring a 1980 lawsuit charging intentional segregation in locating public housing in southwest Yonkers, contends that reliance on existing apartments is impractical because cooperative boards are reluctant to sell to subsidized tenants. It wants a far more new construction.
Judge Sand could also select from options put forward by the court-appointed Fair Housing Implementation Office that call for as many as 1,700 apartments and houses on 18 sites, including four near the O'Rourke town houses.
On June 17, Judge Sand indicated in an interim opinion that he thought Yonkers could find no more than 250 homes in existing cooperatives and would have to rely more heavily on building new apartments. On Monday, the judge is to hear arguments on how much and what kind of new construction should be undertaken.
 
Question of Class
 It is additional construction that worries Mrs. Bourke and her neighbors. A resolute woman in her 60's who has lived in Crestwood for eight years, Mrs. Bourke, who is white, denied that she was ever opposed to the presence of black families, pointing out that several already belong to her association. "The attitude was that if you could afford to buy a house, you were welcome," she said.
Rather, she and her neighbors suggested, there were questions on the mixing of people of disparate economic classes, of people who had bought homes with heavily subsidized renters, many of whom are on welfare. Helene Ellen, who recently sold a house near Mrs. Bourke, said she also resented that the town houses swallowed up a Little League field and a tennis court.
But much resentment seems to be based on misinformation. Homeowners have complained that the O'Rourke tenants were given lawn furniture, air-conditioners and lawn mowers, for example. But the washer-dryers belong to the Municipal Housing Authority, housing officials said. Whatever lawn furniture and lawn mowers the O'Rourke tenants have, they say they bought themselves. The apartments come with slots for air-conditioners, but not the appliances themselves.
Cheryl Jones, a 43-year-old neighbor of Mrs. Bourke who is black, said she had barely noticed the presence of the newcomers. But she did notice how many white neighbors stopped her to explain that their opposition to public housing was not based on race.
"It's like they owed me an explanation," said Ms. Jones, who recently retired as a New York City Transit Authority train operator.
Still, she wondered how much thought Judge Sand has given to the practicality of mixing different economic backgrounds. "Is he willing to have low-income people in his neighborhood?" she said. "He's making that decision for everyone else. But is he willing to do that?"
She said her prime concern was that additional housing would draw the traffic and hubbub that made her leave the Inwood section of Manhattan. "I don't want it crowded," she said. "I lived crowded before. I don't want it again."
 
A Welcome Change
 At the O'Rourke town houses, the tenants also have complaints, particularly about the small size of the rooms, but they say they appreciate the chance to be away from the incessant gunfire and tantalizing drugs of the projects.
Janice French, who moved last June from the William A. Schlobohm Houses, a cluster of eight public high-rises in southwest Yonkers, said much of the crime in the high-rises was caused by intruders or guests in buildings too teeming for control. "You can't stop people from having company," she said. "Here everybody knows everybody."
One thing both sides acknowledge is that there has been little true mingling among adults, the tacit goal of the integration lawsuit, although some town house children play with those living in a nearby development of 1,083 garden apartments called Crestwood Lake. Forty-three percent of that development's population was minority members, including many receiving Federal subsidies, even before the town houses were built.
"We try to get along," said Mrs. Bourke of her relations with the O'Rourke tenants. "We're not blood brothers. I don't invite them into my home and they don't invite me into theirs."
Some opponents of housing integration have drawn parallels with Judge Sand's allied efforts to integrate Yonkers 32 schools. Since 1986, voluntary busing has created far more racially mixed schools, but the citywide numbers of white students has declined to 7,080, from 9,989 in 1985-86. Since then, the number of black students has climbed to 5,750, from 4,557, and the number of Hispanic students to 7,416, from 4,289.
Jerilynn Fierstein, a spokesman for the Yonkers Board of Education, said studies have shown that white flight specifically attributable to desegregation "has not been significant." The racial changes, she said, are the result of broader demographic shifts that have seen a doubling of Hispanics in a decade and an aging of the white population.
Intriguingly, the arrival of the town houses has created a sturdy, if diplomatic, relationship between Mrs. Bourke and Valerie Carroll, the tenant supervisor for Yonkers Municipal Housing Authority, who is black. Whenever any homeowners have a complaint about the town houses, Mrs. Bourke will visit Mrs. Carroll and she said she had been pleased with the quick responses.
But Mrs. Carroll complained that many homeowners too readily assume that if there is a blight like graffiti, it must have been caused by the town house dwellers. "How would they know it was one of our people?" she said. "Our people don't walk around with T-shirts saying 'I live in Dr. James F. X. O'Rourke houses.' "
She added: "I heard a little girl here say: 'It's like the country. It's wide open spaces.' The children can ride their bikes. They can roller skate. This is something everyone has a right to as long as they can take care of it."
Mrs. Bourke said that she felt she had patched the neighborhood together and that she worried most about panics like those decades ago in the Bronx, the embarkation point for many Yonkers citizens. She said she was grateful that a weak economy is frustrating home sales and hoped that those considering selling their homes would hold on to see that the neighborhood has not been hurt by the town house tenants.
Mrs. Carroll understands that some people might resent that the government pays so much of her tenants' rents. But she asks: "Why should they begrudge a person for moving up a little. I can understand their aspirations and anxieties. They should be able to understand our aspirations and anxieties, too."

HEADLINE: Jamaica: Prosperous Isle in Queens

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
When Ken Bernard and his two partners decided recently to open an upscale bistro offering Caribbean and other dishes and sidewalk dining, they looked past obvious spots like TriBeCa, SoHo or the Upper West Side.
Instead, they invested about $270,000 in a vacant storefront in downtown Jamaica, a commercial hub in southeastern Queens that not long ago had deteriorated amid the urban decline that ravaged other commercial districts in New York City and across the nation. 
 "There's enormous untapped potential here," Mr. Bernard, 28, said one recent afternoon as a lunchtime crowd of office workers, college students and shoppers filtered through the new establishment, S.I.B., at 92-32 Union Hall Street.
For years the boosters of downtown Jamaica have maintained that the area has been revitalized, offering as proof ambitious private ventures and, to a far larger extent, a diversity of government-financed projects like a new Federal building, a network of new subway stations and even a farmers market.
To a large degree, city planners and others say, the recovery has been sustained by government spending that revived and expanded the neighborhood's institutions.
But this alone, they say, does not account for the area's ability to rebound and thrive with low retail vacancy rates while the city has struggled against a recession that stalled construction projects elsewhere and created a glut of empty stores and shops.
Essential to the revival has been the increasing economic strength of a black middle class that has emerged throughout southeastern Queens.
In surrounding neighborhoods like St. Albans, Hollis and Springfield Gardens, as in other parts of the borough, black households have reached an economic milestone: virtual income parity with white households in Queens, according to the 1990 census records. Situated at the crossroads of these neighborhoods, Jamaica has profited to a great extent from an influx of new merchants, many of them immigrants, who have brought shops and other businesses in the hopes of tapping into the wealth.
 
Prosperity Seems Within Reach
 Bob Richards, president of the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, said: "The black middle class of southeastern Queens has had a large role in Jamaica's revitalization. They are Jamaica's future."
Now prosperity seems within reach. Up and down the district's streets, the once-shuttered retail storefronts are virtually all occupied. People bustle along sidewalks, swarming a recently arrived department store called Wertheimers, scores of smaller merchants, Iranian jewelry vendors and food stands serving West Indian dishes. Thousands of civil servants stream in and out of the new Federal building, and students surge through the gates of the recently constructed campus of York College.
There are also a number of shops and street peddlers selling dashikis, African artworks, posters of Malcolm X, beads, headdresses and other goods that have made the district something of a center for black culture and commerce.
"It's like being black is in style again," marveled Saiyd Muallam, 35, as he hawked books by black nationalists and historians from a card table on Jamaica Avenue. "There's a real consciousness out here. It's like an awakening."
Jamaica has struggled with many of the same problems that other downtowns across the country have faced, as white households fled the inner city and new suburban malls lured customers away. Throughout the 1970's and early 80's, the district was also hobbled by the loss of its most venerable and stalwart institutions: the headquarters of Jamaica Savings Bank, The Long Island Press and department stores like Macy's and Gertz.
 
2-Decade Redevelopment
 As a result, the redevelopment efforts of business leaders took two decades, with visions of transforming the fading shopping district into an intricate center of government, education and commerce. It was intended to cater to the tastes and needs of the surrounding neighborhoods, where longtime white residents who moved elsewhere were gradually replaced with black middle-income families who have made economic strides in recent years.
Bounded roughly by Hillside Avenue and Liberty Avenue on the north and south, and 175th Street and Sutphin Boulevard on the east and west, downtown Jamaica has been a natural hub for such a development, experts say, because it ties together several subway lines, dozens of city and private bus routes and the Long Island Rail Road.
"The area shows the amazing ability the city has to reinvent itself," said Eric Kober, a director with the New York City Department of Planning. "It's the resilience of these areas that sets the city apart and makes it an amazing place."
There are still many reminders of how much work lies ahead, however.
Just a few blocks from a new $30 million mall and office complex, on a shadowy side street, security guards with dogs patrol the courtyard and hallways of an apartment building that neighbors say was plagued by drugs and dealers. Much of the district's office space remains vacant. And Jamaica has yet to attract large numbers of high-end shops, say merchants and others.
 
Sense of Optimism
 "The job is not done by far," said Carlisle Towery, the president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which has intensively lobbied four mayoral and gubernatorial administrations to support downtown Jamaica's economic interests.
Even so, there is a sense of optimism and security on the streets now that projects like a $110 million Social Security Administration building and the $550 million Archer Avenue subway line, have been in place for several years and helped draw more people through the area for daily affairs. "We've got the basic public investments in place now," Mr. Towery added.
Pakeeza Pleasant, a 38-year-old real-estate consultant who lives in nearby Laurelton, says she travels to Jamaica rather than to malls in the neighboring suburbs of Long Island because of its bazaar-like atmosphere and the ethnic and cultural flavor of its streets.
"It offers so much," Ms. Pleasant explained after an afternoon of shopping with her small son. "You can bargain on almost anything."
Such willingness to spend has enticed a number of ambitious new entrepreneurs to the district, which has more than $300 million in retail sales each year, according to the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce.
 
Curry Goat and Class
 Six months ago, after shutting down their restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, Marcia Henry and Pamela Quashie moved the business to Jamaica, using their homes as collateral to expand the venture into a trendy dining nook inside a sleek food court at the new farmers market. There they serve West Indian dishes of oat-bran porridge, curry goat and ackee and codfish.
In the months before the move, they said, the partners sized up several other sites for the business, called Paradise Splash, but were ultimately lured to Jamaica because they felt it had high commercial traffic and a large appetite for their home-style cuisine.
"We know there's money to be made here," said Mrs. Quashie, an immigrant from Tobago. "We didn't have a dime when we started, but we hope to franchise one day."
The operators of S.I.B., the club on Union Street, also had high ambitions when they opened two months ago, bent on providing something they feel the district lacks: sophisticated entertainment spots.
As longtime residents of nearby neighborhoods, Mr. Bernard and his business partners realized that many of their neighbors often traveled to night clubs and restaurants far outside the area. They decided that people would prefer to spend their money where they live.
In preparing for the restaurant's opening, Mr. Bernard and his partners decorated the space with the paintings and wood carvings of artists from Guyana, their homeland. They also placed a dance floor in the rear amid high ceilings and muted lighting.
"What we're trying to do here is create an environment people would normally go to Manhattan for," explained the club's manager, Derek Drakes. "We're hoping to set a standard in Jamaica."

HEADLINE: Conversations/William Kristol;
A Conservative Cheerfully Argues That 'Family Values' Has a Future

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So why should we care about values issues after the 1992 campaign, after the Murphy Brown imbroglio and the backlash to the Republican National Convention? Haven't the liberals basically won on issues like abortion? Shouldn't we all just settle down and talk about the economy?
"To the contrary," says William Kristol, former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, now a conservative strategist trying to chart the movement's future. "Despite the clumsiness with which those issues were raised in 1992, the fact is that values issues -- to use your phrase -- are back stronger than ever." 
 He is sitting in his modest Washington office preparing to head off to the National Right to Life Committee's convention in Milwaukee later in the week, and other stops on the conservative circuit. He sees numerous signs that the politics of values is alive and kicking.
He cites the recent cover story in The Atlantic Monthly, "Dan Quayle was Right," a grim appraisal of what divorce and single parenthood do to children. He talks of the parents' revolt in Queens over what values their children should be taught. And notes the uproar over lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military.
As for the triumph of the liberals? Liberalism may dominate the government, the media, higher education and most of the cultural institutions, he says. "But on the other hand, liberalism is in a way very weak, it's very hollow. It's lost its force, its real conviction, its real confidence in itself.
"The analogy I use sometimes," he adds, with a small, unapologetic smile, "don't get this wrong -- but it's a little bit like communism, Eastern Europe in the late 1970's, early 1980's. It dominates all these institutions of society, but even the believers have lost confidence in it. And the people have certainly lost confidence in it."
He remains adamant that the American people are "pretty conservative" on basic values.
But -- don't get this wrong -- they didn't exactly rally to the image of "family values" presented by the Republican Party last year, did they?
 
'Just Empty Feel-Good'
 Mistakes were made, he acknowledges. "I don't think it was Dan Quayle's mistake -- but the mistake that was made by some in the campaign was to talk about family values without linking the values issues to concrete outcomes, results, effects on people's lives," he says. "So that too often all the talk about values sounded either like harsh moralizing or just empty feel-good: it's family night at the Republican convention with all the grandchildren on stage.
"The issue of family breakup is not simply an abstract issue of moral preferences. It's an actual issue of the life chances of kids in our society."
Mr. Kristol, who is 40, is no stranger to the cultural elite he derides. The son of the neoconservative writer, Irving Kristol, he is a Harvard Ph.D. who taught political science and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before entering the fray himself. He was chief of staff to William Bennett when Mr. Bennett was Secretary of Education and joined Mr. Quayle's staff in 1989. He has a reputation for being very smart and very conservative.
He is presently the director of the Bradley Project on the 90's, a conservative think tank. He has a vision of conservatives as the counter-culture, the renegades, taking on the chillingly P.C., liberal-dominated bureaucracies and crashing through for the people.
But whose values are the true values of the people? The Republican Party's platform on abortion, which would effectively outlaw the practice, is very much a minority view, according to public opinion polls.
"Look, I was for changing the abortion plank," Mr. Kristol says. "It's just that Bush didn't have the credibility with the prolife forces to carry it off. Everyone knew that plank was anachronistic in 1992."
This, however, is not to say that the abortion struggle is over -- just different, he argues. "I think the great majority of abortions will be legal for the foreseeable future," he says. "I think that's unfortunate, but that's a fact." Still, he predicts that more and more people will reconsider abortion in the years to come, that the anti-abortion forces will have an ever more receptive audience.
"Insofar as the pro-abortion agenda is not just to make it legal, but to remove all stigma from it, to make it not just a right but right, I think that's not going to happen," he says. "And it shouldn't happen. The unfettered right to abortion -- if you think it through -- is based on the notion that the right to abortion is as great a dignity as the right to free speech. And therefore it's something that should not only be tolerated, but maximized -- by having the Federal Government pay for it, by prohibiting anyone from trying to discourage anyone from exercising it."
 
Limiting Gay Rights
 Similarly, he sees a clear line on just how far the gay rights movement should go. "At the end of the day, I do not think society can or should treat homsexuality the same as heterosexuality, or at least the same as the heterosexual family." What then, is the appropriate government stance? "Legal protection for marriage and lack of legal recognition, in a sense, of homosexual unions of whatever sort, but not persecution of homosexuals in their private lives."
In all of these areas, Mr. Kristol argues, President Clinton is far out of step with the country, and is very much of the cultural elite.
But, you might ask, didn't he spend 12 years as Governor of Arkansas, not exactly a training ground for the cultural elite?
"It's as if he went underground," Mr. Kristol muses. "It's the Manchurian President. He went underground for two decades, acclimated himself to local traditions." Once elected, Mr. Kristol asserts, "It's Hollywood, New Haven redux."
But isn't there something unseemly about using values as political tools, "wedge issues" to swell a vote count?
"Look, I agree that you should not use these issues cynically," he says. Mr. Quayle's famous Murphy Brown speech was never given "with the notion that this was going to save the Bush campaign," he says. There were others in the party, he argues, without giving names, who seized on these issues to try to save a hemorrhaging campaign, and used them badly.
But these days, he says, he looks beyond Washington and is heartened. He scoffs at the notion that issues like gay rights are a distraction from the real business of government.
"There's this notion here in Washington that everyone should spend all their time discussing individual lines of the budget, and whether the tax rate should be 34 or 35 percent for corporations. But you can make the case that, in fact, over the long term society is going to be much more shaped by the lessons we teach our kids and the public policies we pursue regarding homosexuality, the family, issues like that."

HEADLINE: Putting It in the Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trade Sanity With Japan" (editorial, June 16) states that the American economy suffers from a lack of savings, presumably as witnessed by the low percentage of money invested in banks, and that this low rate of bank savings has prevented American companies from raising capital for modernization. I disagree. 
 The primary source for capitalization in the United States is the stock market, and as your business pages state daily, individuals are pouring billions of dollars into the stock market each week. After the real estate scandals of the 1980's, pouring money into banks certainly wouldn't help improve our industrial base.
Moreover, recent articles report that mutual funds have more capital than banks and that banks no longer fulfill the mission of providing capital for business. Since small investors in Japan do not have access to mutual funds and have to rely on banks as middlemen, comparing our system with Japan's is pointless.
Our antitrust laws (designed to protect the little guy) would prevent the overt misallocation of capital that Japan's Finance Ministry engineers in favor of larger companies. Our reliance on a market mechanism prevents Japanese-style economic engineering and is quantitatively fairer to United States citizens.
As long as necessary steps are taken to insure that accurate corporate data are available and that the market remains liquid, the stock market should provide a superior mechanism for financing long-term growth. It is high time that economic prognosticators consider the impact of individual investments in the stock market and consider the money involved as savings and not the wages of a day at the races.

HEADLINE: Rethinking 42d St. For Next Decade

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
"IT'S going to be a more beautiful Times Square in a hurry," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said last August, as four giant office towers on 42d Street were postponed in favor of an interim rehabilitation of existing buildings.
But "hurry" means something different on 42d Street than almost anywhere else. After all, it has been 10 years since Mr. Cuomo said, "Today we have laid the final cornerstone to rebuild the most famous crossroads in the world." 
 So the 10 months to prepare a new plan seem like the blink of an eye -- at least to those involved in the project. "We had to totally rethink what 42d Street is going to look like in the next 10 to 15 years," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project Inc., a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. "We think rethinking a plan in 9 to 10 months is something of a miracle."
Guidelines for the interim project -- which would last at least a decade -- are now being discussed with the development team, a joint venture of the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, as are the terms of the interim lease for the state-owned property.
The chief executive of the Prudential Realty Group, Brian J. Strum, said Wednesday that "there are substantial revisions that have to be accomplished with those guidelines."
For now, the vision of a new 42d Street remains just that.
There are critics who hope the project stays on the drawing board. They say that the public subsidies -- easily more than $100 million for site acquisition alone -- are no longer warranted, if they ever were. Under the new deal, for instance, the developers are relieved of their obligation to contribute $91 million to rebuild the Times Square subway station. And much of the construction that the project was supposed to spark around Times Square has already occurred. Meanwhile, critics say, the very life has been drained from 42d Street itself while it awaits long-delayed resuscitation.
Having condemned and emptied most properties on the east end of the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the 42d Street Development Project hopes to "reanimate" the street with a large-scale art exhibition using storefronts, facades, vitrines, marquees, billboards and even roll-down grates. On display from July 8 through Oct. 31 will be the work of artists and designers like Jane Dickson, Jenny Holzer, Tibor Kalman, Todd Oldham and William Wegman.
Eventually, 42d Street is to be a commercial, as well as esthetic, grab-bag -- "a little something for everyone," in the words of a marketing plan prepared for the state by Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing and the Phillips/Norwalk Company.
About 153,000 square feet of commercial space would be created on four large parcels at the crossroads of Broadway and Seventh Avenue that the state assembled for the office towers. These were -- and eventually are -- to be developed by Prudential and Park Tower, headed by George Klein.
UNDER the interim plan, buildings that were to be razed to make way for the towers will be rehabilitated as restaurants, nightspots, stores and service offices.
Another 112,000 square feet of space would be created in nine historic theaters and adjoining buildings that the state owns between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Finally, the plan calls for 147,000 square feet of commercial space on the Eighth Avenue end of the blocks between 41st and 43d Streets, which are still privately owned.
"Commercial facilities selected for 42d Street will generally be popular-priced establishments which together will generate excitement, fun and round-the-clock entertainment," the retail consultants said. "Forty-second Street cannot be pigeonholed like a 'festival marketplace,' a shopping mall, or Main Street, U.S.A. The street will always mirror New York City with all of its vitality and turbulence."
As a design parallel, one of the architectural consultants, Robert A. M. Stern, said 42d Street "should look noisy, historically layered and unplanned," with a "jumble of different scales, sizes, styles and historical periods" and "bold, brash and varied signs."
Prudential and Park Tower would develop the interim project with $20 million of their own, for interior demolition and reconstruction, some tenant installations, storefronts, streetscape improvements, facade restorations, roof replacement and asbestos removal. Large commercial signs, like those on rooftops, will be paid for, built and leased by sign companies, Ms. Robertson said.
The developers would pay the state $3.3 million a year in rent, adjusted for inflation. In turn, they would collect rent from their commercial subtenants. The estimated gross income for all four sites has been projected by the retail consultants at $8.64 million a year for the first five years and $9.94 million a year for the second five years.
But Mr. Strum of Prudential said rents would cover the investment only if the developers signed 10-year leases with uniformly strong tenants. "We probably wouldn't make any profit, but we wouldn't lose any of the $20 million," he said. "On the other hand, that's the most optimistic view."
The Prudential-Park Tower team has paid site acquisition costs as they arise, a figure that now amounts to $186 million and could reach $241 million. But ultimately, the developers are responsible only for $88 million of that amount. The balance is to be refunded in the form of forgiven taxes.
That means the public will owe the developers at least $98 million for property and fixture settlements paid to owners along 42d Street. In addition, some interim rent paid by the developers would be refunded, as would their $18.2 million contribution to the theater renovations and their $2.6 million contribution to streetscape improvements.
Besides that, the money spent by the developers on environmental impact statements, appraisals, title reports, title insurance premiums, surveys, filing fees, transfer taxes and some legal fees would also be refunded.
And this is to be paid back with interest. Under the old deal, interest was calculated as the prime rate plus 1 percent. (Currently, that would mean 7 percent.) Under the new deal, interest is calculated as the yield on 10-year Treasury bills plus 1.1 percent. (Currently, that would mean 7.06 percent.)
Under the old deal, interest would have run for the whole period of development; under the new deal, interest is suspended until construction begins on the office towers.
State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, has long criticized the economics of the 42d Street project as a needless public subsidy. His chief of staff, Erwin Rose, said last week that under the new deal, "the size of the subsidy may turn out to be very different and potentially could be higher."
But Ms. Robertson said the "overall financial deal has improved tremendously" for the public, particularly with the suspension of the interest accrual and the renegotiation of the interim rent for the office tower sites to $3.3 million a year from $1 million.
Current negotiations involve the design, use and occupancy guidelines that are to shape the new project. Tension is already evident between officials and the developers over signage and lighting requirements, as well as the question of what kind of tenants will be permitted in which location. "The state isn't in that business," Mr. Strum said. "We are. And there are little things that, if you write them in cement, can cripple you."
"If you say, 'This piece of space can only be used for the sale of food,' " he said, "that means you can't put in a Hard Rock Cafe, because they sell a lot of T-shirts."
Ms. Robertson said, "Guidelines should not only be flexible enough to attract retail tenants but exciting enough to attract really good tenants and maintain the essential spirit of 42d Street and Times Square."
Elsewhere on the street, the historic mid-block theaters might be used by nonprofit theater groups, a tourist center, a jazz or blues club, a nightclub and a theme restaurant. One of them, the Apollo, is already a home for rock concerts. The most celebrated of the group, the New Amsterdam, has long been seen as the one most likely to return to use as a Broadway house.
Six of them -- the Apollo, Liberty, Lyric, Selwyn, Times Square, Victory -- are controlled by the nonprofit New 42d Street Inc., which is responsible for finding new uses. The president of New 42d Street is Cora Cahan, who had been executive director of the Feld Ballet and was instrumental in the development of the Joyce Theater, at Eighth Avenue and 19th Street, and the Lawrence A. Wien Center for Dance and Theater, 890 Broadway, at 19th Street.
"WE knew, when the towers were not going up, that we had to revise the notion of long-term uses for the theaters," Ms. Cahan said. By shortening the lease terms to 10 years for some of the theaters, she said, "livelier and feistier" interim tenants might be found, to complement nonprofits making longer commitments.
"Anything that can move quickly here is better than requiring that everything be long-term," Ms. Cahan said. "There has to be experimentation and revision. We want the ability to revise."
Ms. Cahan said a plan ought to be ready for four of the theaters by the end of July. "We postponed making an announcement about any of the theaters until a public announcement of the entire revised plan for 42d Street," she said, "so the public had a sense that it was not a series of isolated things happening, but a major push."
Last August, when the 42d Street office towers were indefinitely postponed, Ms. Robertson said a plan would be ready in six months. But it is only now nearing completion. The main reason it got off schedule, she said, was that it contemplated something no earlier plan had: rehabilitating dozens of structures along 42d Street.
No one had paid much attention to the condition of these buildings before, as they were simply going to be fodder for the wrecking crews. Then, in an abrupt reversal, they were to be brought back to functional life. From cellars to cornices, every square inch had to be scrutinized.
"Our objective was to make the plan real," Ms. Robertson said. "We don't want a restaurant in a space where the column spacing is too tight or signage on a roof where the structural members can't support it."
"We wanted to come up with an answer that worked," she said, "that could be built now, that was economically feasible and that suited the needs of Times Square."
But Leonard J. Weiss, who owns a parking lot at 250 West 41st Street that may be condemned as part of the project, takes a different view. "As should be obvious to any sane person," he said, "nothing is happening and nothing is going to happen."
Even those who believe something may happen are growing anxious.
"We have to see a plan," said Frederic S. Papert, president of the private 42d Street Development Corporation, which created Theater Row on the block between Ninth and 10th Avenues and is planning a 42d Street trolley. (Despite similar names, the organization headed by Mr. Papert bears no relation to that headed by Ms. Robertson.)
"It's an embarrassment to New Yorkers that 42d Street has fallen so far from grace," Mr. Papert said. "In my view, it's worse now than it was. At least, it was operating."
All but 21 of 269 tenants have been cleared from properties on the state-owned sites. Of the nine historic theaters, only two are now in use: the Harris (where first-run features are shown for a $6 admission) and the Apollo.
Howard Swernoff's family has owned the six-story office building at 233 West 42d Street since 1928. The cloud of condemnation has made it almost impossible to find tenants, he said, with the exception of pornography operators, who have offered to lease space at a "handsome increase" over existing rents. "We're the only building that hasn't had porn in it," he said. "But I'm between a rock and a hard place. We may have to rent it to them."
Douglas Durst, an owner who has long been among the most forceful opponents of the 42d Street project, said officials were "continuing to make a huge mistake in believing they can build office towers and trying to lease it up on an interim basis.
"It's very difficult to bring good tenants in for short-term leases," he said. "I think they're going to have problems with that."
John Goldman, a real-estate developer and Clinton resident, asked: "Why don't they open it up again, give the keys out -- maybe with some discretion -- to the closed-up businesses and bring the place back to life?"
But it is a condition of the deal that the state deliver the sites vacant to the developer, although nothing theoretically would bar the return of a papaya counter or gyro stand.
Both the financial deal and the land-use plan "should get a full public airing," said Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the land-use committee of Community Board 5. "The interim solution, whatever gets done, is likely to look a hell of a lot like the permanent solution. So it becomes crucially important what happens."
Senator Leichter's chief of staff, Erwin Rose, who is not related to Joseph B. Rose, said the renegotiated deal would yield a "completely different project than the one approved by the Board of Estimate in 1984 and should be subject to public review."
MS. ROBERTSON is a veteran of the public review process, having come to the 42d Street project in 1987 from the city's Planning Department, where she was deputy director of the Manhattan office and the senior planner involved in a 1984 rezoning of the Upper West Side.
She said the revised plans would be shown to interested parties, like the community boards, in advance of the public hearings by the Urban Development Corporation. "We intend to meet people and inform them," Ms. Robertson said. "We have a road show and we expect to go on the road."
Under one scenario, used by officials to gauge the cost and potential of the project, but not meant necessarily to limit the kinds of tenants on any specific site, the office tower parcels could accommodate 153,000 square feet of commercial space, 88,000 of that on the ground floor.
Garrick-Aug and Philips/Norwalk recommended that the stores be geared to visitors.
Some of the retail units would be as small as 800 square feet. The largest would be:
* The former Nathan's Famous Restaurant and Big Apple Theater, at Broadway and 43d Street, would house a two-level theme restaurant, a nightclub and a specialty store, with about 17,000 square feet. The building dates to 1940.
* The lower floors of the Long Acre Building, at Broadway and 42d Street, would be used for a bookstore and other specialty shops, about 11,000 square feet. This 12-story building was completed in 1912.
* The Rialto Theater, at Broadway and 42d Street, would become a music store with a video theater and second-floor restaurant, a total of some 11,000 square feet. Built in 1935, this is a minor gem of Art Deco design, but not one of the historic auditoriums.
* The base of the former Ninth Federal Building, on Broadway between 41st and 42d Streets, would become the 10,000-square-foot "Exchange," a service center with a bank, currency exchange and ticket desks for theaters, airlines, excursions and tours. The 11-story building was finished in 1915.
There is also to be one new building on the south side of 42d Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue: a two-story, 3,300-square-foot newsstand, cafe and coffee bar. This will replace the "temporary" police and visitor center, fashioned from trailers, that was built in 1986.
The Times Square Business Improvement District has already established a small beachhead of its own, having set up a tourist and travel information office in the corner of the Rialto Theater building.
Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Business Improvement District, said the new plan "maintains what I think of as Times Square vitality within limited resources, and it holds out hope of bringing life back to the street as quickly as possible."
"If they're talking about as little as $20 million, there's not a whole lot you can do, so it's best not to show the hubris of big plans but to do something modest and appropriate," Ms. Dykstra said. "There is value to creative modesty."

HEADLINE: The Most Entertaining Americans? Canadians

BYLINE: By RICK MARIN; Rick Marin, who was born in Toronto, writes about the arts for Vogue and TV Guide.

 BODY:
WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT Canada? It's a big country with a lot of snow, Mounties and politely boring people who say "eh." The British novelist Kingsley Amis put a fictitious tome titled "Canadian Wit and Humor" on his list of the World's Shortest Books. "Worthwhile Canadian Initiative" was the winner of The New Republic magazine's Most Boring Headline contest.
Joke-wise, Canada gets no respect. But it should, especially since Canada has produced some of America's funniest comedians, actors, writers, directors -- a veritable army of renegade humor professionals. Without them, there would have been no "Saturday Night Live," no "SCTV," no Spy magazine, no "Ghostbusters," no "Wayne's World," no sidekick for David Letterman to take with him to CBS. Expatriate Canucks like Dan Aykroyd, Michael J. Fox, Mike Myers, Phil Hartman, John Candy, Rick Moranis and Martin Short could gather on Thursday to celebrate Canada Day, a holiday most Americans would rank somewhere below National Pickle Week. 
 Thanks to their nearly undetectable accent and their proximity to the United States, Canadians have insinuated themselves into the pop culture of the United States, from Mary Pickford ("America's Sweetheart") to the Amazing Kreskin. "Field of Dreams," the mythic movie about the great American pastime, was based on the baseball novel "Shoeless Joe," by the Canadian W. P. Kinsella. Television is filled with Canadians, from Lorne Greene in reruns of "Bonanza" and the space cowboy William Shatner on "Star Trek" to Jason Priestley, the heartthrob on "Beverly Hills 90210." "Generation X," the bible of the 20-somethings, was written by a Canadian. Even Superman, defender of truth, justice and the American way, was the invention of Joe Shuster, from Toronto.
"I remember a time when America wasn't Canadian," somebody laments in an old "Saturday Night Live" sketch that posited an invasion of the United States by its deceptively innocuous neighbor from the North. Spy magazine (co-founded by the Ottowa-born E. Graydon Carter) once ran a mock-paranoid feature titled "The Canadians Among Us."
They are indeed among us, but it's in the realm of comedy -- on both sides of the camera -- that their presence seems so weirdly disproportionate. Scratch the surface of television comedy over the last three decades and you'll find Canadian writers and producers behind such shows as "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour," "Hee Haw," "Taxi," "Fernwood 2-Night," "SCTV," "Major Dad," "Home Improvement," "Seinfeld," "The Simpsons" and "The Ren and Stimpy Show."
Why is this? Interviews with dozens of Canadians and Canada-watchers reveal that boredom, cold and an obsession with American television have propelled Canadians -- with their irreverence and their sense of irony -- into the solar plexus of American pop culture.
"Toronto in the 1950's was a very safe and ordered place, so the chief thing to be overcome in my childhood was boredom," says Lorne Michaels, who came to the United States 25 years ago to write jokes for Woody Allen and "Laugh-In" before creating "Saturday Night Live." In Canada Mr. Michaels performed in a television show called "The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour," in which his partner, Hart Pomerantz, dressed up as a beaver (Canada's national animal) and Mr. Michaels interviewed him.
Assimilation was easy. Canada is, in many ways, a slice of the same white bread American heartland that produced Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Jay Leno. Citizens of the United States generally know nothing about Canada and care less. Canadians, on the other hand, are experts on the United States. "I know more about America than most Americans," boasts Peter Jennings, the ABC anchorman, saying "aboot" for "about" in the Canadian accent he denies having.
Once Mr. Michaels had skipped south of the border, he did what most immigrants do: imported more of his countrymen. He brought his partner's brother Earl Pomerantz, who went on to write for "Mary Tyler Moore" and "The Cosby Show" and was the creator of "Major Dad." ("We wanted to get to a warmer place," Mr. Pomerantz recalls.)
Mr. Michaels also asked Mr. Aykroyd to join the original cast of "Saturday Night Live." More recently, he brought "The Kids in the Hall" to HBO and then to CBS. And, securing his lock on late night, he will be the executive producer for NBC's new Conan O'Brien show, scheduled to replace "Late Night With David Letterman" in August.
 
Comedy
The Gross National Product
 Ask Canadians in the comedy business about influences and they invariably invoke two names: Wayne and Shuster. Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster (a relative of the Shuster who created Superman) were a comedy team whose literate buffoonery became a staple on "The Ed Sullivan Show." Their big routine was a parody of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" called "Who Killed Big Julie?" Sample shtick:
Wayne: "I'll have a martinus."
Shuster: "Don't you mean a martini?"
Wayne: "If I want two, I'll ask for them."
Before Wayne and Shuster, there was Stephen Leacock, sort of a Mark Twain-meets-James Thurber humorist whom every Canadian youth is compelled to read in high school. Another influence: the cross-dressing, pants-down humor of "Monty Python's Flying Circus," which was broadcast in Canada several years before it was in the United States. "Americans appreciate British humor like Monty Python, but they don't always get it," says Andrew Malcolm, a former correspondent for The New York Times and author of a narrative history titled "The Canadians." "Canadians get it."
They also get satire and political humor, despite being famously deferential in the face of authority. Canadians will say "Thank you" to a bank machine. Yet they rebel in their comedy, channeling repression into humor. The Winnipeg-born David Steinberg did political stand-up in his Vietnam-era "Tonight" show heyday. Mort Sahl, who left Montreal at an early age, virtually invented the form. Rich Little, who is from Ottawa, impersonated Richard Nixon to death, as did Dan Aykroyd on "Saturday Night Live," a tradition continued by another Canadian, Phil Hartman, who does Bill Clinton.
"When I came to NBC there was this curiosity as to why I would want to do political comedy, because it was a sure ratings killer," says Mr. Michaels. "America was founded on the distrust of authority. In Canada, you don't feel secure in that right, so you exercise it. Defying authority in a small way is a big Canadian thing."
Paul Shaffer, the David Letterman sidekick who migrated south in the wake of musicians like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, likens the Canadian comedy phenomenon to the British invasion of the American pop music scene during the same decade. Like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, he says, Canadians "had an even more intense reverence for America than the Americans themselves."
 
Tube Power
Either On It Or Watching It
 When the comedian Mike Myers was in the eighth grade, he did a project called "Canadians in Comedy." He also did one on Lorne Michaels, he says, "in the hope that he would someday give me a job." Which, of course, he did.
Mr. Myers, who drew much of the suburban heavy-metal mythology of "Wayne's World" from his Torontonian youth, says he remembers Martin Short telling him, "When Americans watch TV, they're watching TV, but when Canadians watch TV, they're watching American TV." That distinction, Mr. Myers says, "makes you notice things."
Even before cable, Canadians were saturated with television. "If you were living in Vancouver or Toronto in the 70's, you were living in the most TV-dense place on the planet," says Doug Coupland, whose book "Generation X" is laced with American pop references.
Most of the country's 26 million citizens are massed along its southern border; they survive the long winter nights with antennas that pick up the indigenous channels plus signals from across the 49th parallel.
" 'Looney Tunes' was our introduction to American culture," says Mr. Carter, who is now the editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair. "We felt slightly above the pop cultural circus of the United States but slightly envious at not being a part of it." Dave Foley, a cast member of "The Kids in the Hall," claims that he honed his "observational sensibility" by spending his formative years watching "Green Acres."
Many Canadians cut their teeth on local television as a result of a strict nationalist cultural policy, enforced by the Government-run Canadian Broadcasting Company, mandating that 40 percent of all television and radio programming contain "Canadian content." Almost anyone in Canada who wants to be on television can do so. Los Angeles became the terminus for an underground railroad of CBC-trained talent. "By end of the 1960's, American variety television was controlled by Canadians," says Norman Jewison, who left Toronto to be a television producer in Hollywood before he started directing films.
 
Outsiders
The Funhouse Mirror
 Although founded on anti-Americanism (many early Canadian settlers were British loyalists), Canada is perhaps the world's most pro-American country. Robert MacNeil, who is cohost of "The McNeil/Lehrer Newshour" on PBS and plans to write a book about being an expatriate Canadian, describes this love-hate relationship as "ironic distance." Sean Kelly, a founding editor of the National Lampoon who instituted the magazine's satiric "Canadian Corner" feature, draws an analogy to the "insider/outsider" culture of the Jews or the Irish: "You're part of the culture," he says, "but you're observing that culture."
Many Canadians agonize over questions of "national identity," wondering what it is and why they don't have one. There are hardly any Canadian heroes, except hockey players. Mr. Jewison says he gathers Hollywood's Canadian cabal at his Malibu beach house for Canada Day parties, but when they sing "O Canada," "nobody can remember the words."
Michael J. Fox, who became famous as the arch-conservative Republican teen-ager Alex P. Keaton on the long-running sitcom "Family Ties," says that "playing this Reaganite kid, I was free to parody and play with the idea because, being Canadian, I had nothing at stake." He also managed to make a potentially odious character nice, a distinctively Canadian trait. Jim Carrey, a cast member of "In Living Color," leavens his often deranged characters (like safety-crazed Fire Marshall Bill) with goofy Canadian charm.
Niceness is one reason Americans like -- and permit -- Canadians to make fun of them. It may also explain why these mocking foreigners have been so successful here. They are harmless, totally nonthreatening, profoundly silly. Could an American have made "Meatballs," "Ghost busters" or the gently cutting White House satire "Dave" -- all of which were directed by the prolific Canadian comic auteur Ivan Reitman.
"There's something slightly absurd about Canada," says Harold Ramis, the screenwriter and director who moved from Chicago to Toronto to work on "SCTV," the inspired television parody that launched the careers of John Candy, Rick Moranis, Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara. The very idea of Canada cracks up the writing staff of "The Simpsons," who hired a television writer from Calgary to supply them with jokes about the Canadian Football League and the location of the world's largest nickel (Sudbury, Ontario).
Mike Myers, who says "I bore people with my Canadianness," admits to weeping sometimes with homesickness. To cheer himself up, he subscribes to a publication called Hockey Night in Toronto.
Expert at mocking others, Canadians can be stuffily humorless about themselves. Perhaps the only thing that the comedian Howie Mandel and the economist John Kenneth Galbraith have in common is that they don't regard their compatriots as necessarily funnier than residents of the United States.
"One should not exaggerate the influence," counsels Mr. Galbraith. Mr. Mandel agrees: "I don't know if they're producing any more comedians than any other state."
 
<O CANADA: THE LIST
 Canadians are the pod people of American pop culture, as Spy magazine (co-founded by a canadian) once pointed out. They look like people who live in the United States; thay act like them, and they talk like them (sort of). Are they taking over? Casual perusal of any "Who's Who" reveals the large percentage of famous Americans who are, in fact, Canadian - or wer at least born there. Here is a selective list of famous Canadians, present and past, whom mant in the United States have assumed were home grown.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Primordial Ooze of a Budget Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN building a house, every time a brick is laid or a room completed, the house looks more like the final product. But a bill in Congress is not like that -- especially not such a monumental measure as the five-year deficit-reduction legislation that squeaked through the House of Representatives last month and the Senate last week.
This has gotten lost as the budget bill has moved through Congress. Because the latest development is what makes the news, when the House or Senate has modified the energy tax, dropped a tax break or a new spending program or made some other change in the legislation, it has often appeared that the bill was unraveling further. 
 In fact, the final legislation, after the two chambers' versions are reconciled in a conference committee next month, could look mostly like the House's or mostly like the Senate's. Or it could be an amalgam of the two with only passing resemblance to either, like the way orange paint is quite different from the red and yellow mixed to make it.
"There is not a human being alive who can tell you what the outcome of the conference will be," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader.
Often conference committees work magic. This year, it might take a King Solomon to forge a deficit-reduction bill that can be enacted. Dozens of lawmakers will be conferees, since so many panels have jurisdiction over parts of the budget. But the final package will doubtless be written late next month in a small room by a handful of Democrats.
Three Senators will be at the table: Mr. Mitchell; Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Four Representatives will certainly be there: Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House; Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader; Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Comddmittee, and Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, chairman of the House Budget Committee. And a few top Administration officials who are former lawmakers will certainly participate.
Their task is a daunting one -- to write a bill that can be passed in full by the House and then by the Senate with no amendments.
 
Slim Margins
 The Senate approved its bill shortly after 3 o'clock Friday morning by the narrowest of margins, 50 to 49, with Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote, the first such vote by a Vice President in six years. The House passed its version on May 27 by a six-vote margin. This means that if only one Senator or three Representatives switch because they do not like the compromise struck in the conference, the whole bill will fail.
Mr. Rostenkowski said he was treating this conference differently from any other he had ever been involved in. Normally at this stage, he said, he would be trying to figure out how he could squeeze every last drop of what he wanted out of the bargaining. This time, he said, he was calculating what concessions he and his colleagues needed to make so that something could become law and serious embarrassment to the President and Democrats in Congress could be averted.
The close votes arose for two reasons: Every Republican in both houses voted against the legislation, and President Clinton's popularity is not such that Democratic politicians fear standing up to him.
On the first point, the Republicans are betting that a rigid stand against higher taxes is their ticket back to the White House and possibly even to control of Congress.
In the Senate last week, the Republicans offered a substitute budget that purported to reduce the deficit as much the Clinton budget by relying just on spending reductions. It was bogus. It was assembled at the 11th hour, and it did not identify by name a single Government program to be cut. But it was a rallying point for Republicans worried that if they simply voted against everything, they could be charged with fomenting gridlock.
Richard A. Baker, who has worked as a historian in Congress for 25 years and been the Senate historian since 1975, said he could not remember a time when an important bill became law after every Representative and Senator from one of the parties voted against it, as is the case with this bill.
On the question of Mr. Clinton's political strength, most of the Democrats in Congress believe that for the sake of their own survival they need to show that their party can confront the country's problems when they control both the White House and Congress. But they have been independent contractors for 12 years and are not in the habit of following a White House blueprint. And most of them are more politically secure than Mr. Clinton.
 
What Will Survive
 The Clinton proposal most likely to be part of the final bill is a steep increase in the taxes on the wealthy. Beyond that, the conferees must walk a tightrope between liberal Democratic Representatives, who favor a broad energy tax and more spending for social programs, and more conservative Democratic Senators, who worry about higher taxes and favor cuts in benefit programs.
Three of the six Democratic Senators who voted against the bill Friday have tough re-election fights next year: Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. The other three are conservatives who simply do not like the Clinton program: J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.
Several others had their arms twisted almost out of their sockets before they voted yes. They include Herb Kohl and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Bob Graham of Florida and Howell Heflin of Alabama.
Senator Kerrey's position was especially dicey. He lost to Bill Clinton in the New Hampshire primary last year when Mr. Clinton made everything sound easy, including a middle-class tax cut. Now Mr. Kerrey was being asked to save Mr. Clinton's political life by voting for a gasoline tax, a tax on Social Security benefits and new Medicare limits.
He bit the bullet Friday morning. Next month, he will be asked to do it again. Depending on what comes out of conference, it may be asking too much.

HEADLINE: 'Power Lunches' in a Converted Barn

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK

 BODY:
NEAR the intersection of Route 24 and Columbia Turnpike, where cows once grazed on rolling farmland, gleaming office parks rise from landscaped lawns. Only a weathered brick barn appears untouched by the development.
But close inspection reveals that it, too, is part of the change. This "historic barn," as a bold-lettered sign explains, is the unlikely home of a new organization called the Park Avenue Foundation and Club. 
 By the end of this year, the club's sponsors plan to open a private dining club and an affiliated foundation that will use any profits from the club to benefit local charities and cultural institutions. Civic leaders have already united to raise several million dollars toward renovating the aging structure. They say they aim to preserve not just the building but the traditions of the private dining club, an institution that seemed headed for extinction in New Jersey's changing economy.
The club takes its name from its location on Park Avenue, a suburban corridor that is as different from Park Avenue in Manhattan as the new club will be from the men's clubs of yore, many of which have closed in recent years.
In Newark, the Essex Club shut down last year, following the demise of two other venerable institutions, the 744 Club and the Downtown Club. They were casualties of the sagging economy and the exodus of large corporations from Newark, Manhattan, Trenton and other cities for suburban office developments in places like Florham Park and surrounding Morris County.
 
Disrupting Old Habits
 The Morristown area was one of the fastest-growing regions of the state in the 1980's, gaining some 10,000 jobs from 1982 to 1990, according to the New Jersey Labor Department.
For uprooted executives, the transition from city to suburbia disrupted old habits. Those accustomed to strolling two blocks to meet a business associate for lunch or drinks now needed a car to get anywhere. Some corporations opened their own private dining rooms for executives, but this did not answer the needs of lawyers, stockbrokers, accountants and others who wanted a place to take clients.
To cater to such displaced diners, work is proceeding furiously on the hundred-year-old barn, once part of a dairy farm owned by the Sisters of Charity. Where cows once chewed their cud, executives will dine on meals prepared by "culinary experts," the club's brochure says. Where a silo once stood, corporate directors will hold forth in meeting rooms. A paneled library and grill room and bar will also be available to members.
Although the club bears little resemblance to a working barn, some local residents are pleased that the building has been saved. Betty Heinig, vice president of the Morris Museum Foundation, in Morristown, said that because of all of the new construction in the area, residents began to form a sentimental attachment to the hulking structure. "It is one of the few genuinely old buildings still left in that area," she said.
The Morris Museum is one of the seven nonprofit organizations participating in the foundation that will divide club revenue remaining after operating expenses. Others are the New Jersey Symphony, the Jersey Battered Women's Service, the Morris-Sussex Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Newark, the Morris Habitat for Humanity and the New Jersey Special Olympics. Each organization contributed toward the initial fund to start the enterprise.
 
A High-Profile Board
 "This is more a community project than a private club," said the club chairman, David Hedley, a managing director of the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and a Mendham resident.
The club already has close to 700 members, and it plans to establish a waiting list after membership reaches 1,100. On the advice of the Club Corporation of America, a Dallas-based business that will manage the Park Avenue Club, Mr. Hedley helped to assemble a board of governors composed of well-known civic leaders -- including former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, president of Drew University in Madison; Christopher Forbes, vice chairman of Forbes Magazine, and Peter Burgdorff, a real-estate broker.
Mr. Hedley said that a demographic survey showed that "the audience for this is there," noting the concentration of corporate headquarters in the area, including Exxon International, Allied-Signal and Schering Plough.
For those who want a private environment to combine business and socializing, there are few alternatives in the area, said Deborah Rooney, project associate at the club. "We are encouraging people to come and do business here," she said. "We expect there will be power breakfasts, power lunches."
A "young executive" membership category, which offers reduced fees for people 34 or younger, is already sold out, according to the club newsletter.
While country clubs nearby serve meals during business hours, Ms. Rooney said that most of them discouraged members from conducting business too openly and that some even have rules against the display of business papers in their dining rooms.
There is one establishment in Morristown that fits the stereotype of an exclusive private club, the century-old Morristown Club, founded in 1884. The club moved in 1929 into its present quarters, an old unmarked brick mansion at 27 Elm Street. It began as a men's luncheon club and still serves only lunch, except for one evening each month when it has a dinner and speaker.
The Morristown Club, which has 275 active members, has changed with the times. In the 1980's, it began admitting women as members. It also plans to accept up to 50 new members this year, said Irene Meehan, an investment adviser with the Tucker, Anthony brokerage firm in Morristown, who joined after the all-male restriction was struck down.
The club's board of governors is headed by Peter Perretti, a former State Attorney General who is a partner in the law firm of Riker, Danzig, which is one of the donors to the Park Avenue Club.
There is no reason why both clubs can't thrive. Ms. Meehan said, "It is right that there be a more broad-based club" that is open from morning into the evening hours.
The idea for the Park Avenue Club came at a party several years ago, when Mr. Hedley struck up a conversation with Stanley Gale, president of Gale & Wentworth, real-estate developers in Florham Park. The talk turned to saving the barn on a large tract that Mr. Gale was developing.
That led to interest from the Morris Museum and others arts organizations that were hoping to expand. But efforts to turn the barn into an arts center foundered because of inadequate funds.
Mr. Gale, whose company had already erected an office park on the property, decided to donate the barn and a plot of land, which it valued at $2 million, to the new foundation. Labor and construction materials for the renovation were donated by local businesses and unions.
The value of the entire project has been estimated at $4 million, although much of that has been made in in-kind donations. Fund-raising events have propelled the project along, including a cocktail party at the Morris Museum, with a talk by Mr. Kean, and a series of gatherings marking construction-related events, like a "topping off" ceremony.
 
'A New Angle on It'
 The club's leaders describe the combination of a foundation and social club as unique, and several academic experts on philanthropy did not challenge that claim.
"This seems to have a new angle on it," said Jon Van Til, professor of urban studies at Rutgers University. "It may well be that these seven organizations by coming together may have a more effective fund-raising organization."
But he warned that combining two disparate functions could raise problems. "There could be an unholy mixing of taxable and nontaxable activities there," Professor Van Til said. "But funding is tight, and the profession of fund-raising is growing."
In its brochure, the club explains that donations to the foundation are tax-deductible charitable contributions, while club dues and expenses can be deducted only as business expenses.
Mr. Hedley said that based on projected membership and fees, which are $1,500 for joining and $75 a month thereafter (young executives and nonresident members will pay $500 to join and $50 a month), he can predict that the participating nonprofit organizations will most likely receive a better rate of return on their investment than they might otherwise receive.

HEADLINE: Its Courtship Over, E.D.S. Seems Eager to Play the Field

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
WHEN Britain's largest telephone company backed away last month from a proposed alliance with the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the initial reaction from some investors and industry observers was one of pity.
But Lester M. Alberthal Jr., chairman, president and chief executive of the Dallas-based computer services company owned by the General Motors Corporation, says far from being the wallflower at the global dance, E.D.S. is doing just fine, thank you. 
 "We have no interest in trading one owner for another owner," Mr. Alberthal said in an interview last week about the collapse of the deal with British Telecommunications P.L.C., which would have involved the sale of 25 percent of E.D.S. stock. "We're not out there trying to find a partner. We're trying to have discussions and pursue all the major players to see if there are any business relationships that make sense."
If that sounds a lot like someone suddenly embracing the single life after being stood up at the altar, it may also not be such a bad thing for E.D.S. to do, analysts say.
"They don't really need to pick a specific partner," said Timothy R. McCollum, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst. "They just need to align themselves with as many companies as possible."
After all, E.D.S., which was founded by Ross Perot in 1962 and purchased by G.M. in 1984, remains strongly profitable and has made plenty of aggressive moves on its own in Europe, a hot market now because of economic unification and the opening of the east.
What's more, technology alliances have had a spotty record, particularly when corporate cultures don't mesh. In this case, the analysts say, British Telecom sought a degree of control over E.D.S. that promised clashes down the line. Though owned by G.M., E.D.S. remains strongly independent in the way it does business.
That business, which produced sales of $8.2 billion last year, is serving as a butler and nanny to companies' increasingly complicated computer systems. It ties together computer services, taking over billing and other functions and running data processing departments -- a practice known as "outsourcing." Incrementally, it has put together the world's largest private communications network to link customers' desktop computers and data terminals with massive information storage libraries and to transport data via telephone lines and microwave and satellite transmission.
Still, analysts say, E.D.S. does need to forge a strong relationship with one or more telephone companies if it is to continue to grow long-term.
The computer services market is an increasingly global one, they say, in which the lines between computers and telephones are blurring and the International Business Machines Corporation and others are becoming aggressive competitors. Although E.D.S. already leases telephone lines in bulk from providers like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the MCI Communications Corporation and Sprint, closer ties to one or more carriers could provide greater access to their worldwide networks, making it possible to reach more customers.
SETTLING down with British Telecom, however, instead of playing the field in Europe could have been costly to E.D.S., said Sean Phelan, principal analyst with the Yankee Group Europe, a consulting and research firm in London. "While I can see the advantage for European carriers in a tie-up with E.D.S., I don't see the advantage for E.D.S.," he said. "E.D.S. can manage and coordinate the services of multiple European carriers far better than they can coordinate among themselves. And while E.D.S. is independent of any carrier, they are all potential clients."
For his part, Mr. Alberthal, 49, said E.D.S. has been talking with every major telecommunications company -- among them A.T.& T., the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and European companies, including even British Telecom after the deal fell through -- looking for what he also calls stronger relationships.
But if any new relationship gets so strong that it involves the sale of E.D.S. shares, it will have to overcome the hurdles posed by the unusual nature of the G.M.-E.D.S. stock structure.
Shortly after acquiring E.D.S., G.M. created class E shares, which offer a stake in E.D.S.'s performance through dividend payouts but not in its ownership, since G.M. holds all of the company's capital stock.
While G.M. has been talking for some time about selling part of E.D.S., it is not clear just how a buyer would get a voice in running the company under the current structure.
In British Telecom's case, all that is known for sure is that it offered to buy 25 percent of class E shares. Analysts say G.M. sought as much as $5 billion for the shares and also wanted to structure the deal as a tax-free transaction. Otherwise, G.M.'s taxes could have been as much as $1 billion, analysts said, reflecting E.D.S.'s increased value since G.M. acquired it for $2.5 billion. British Telecom refused to pay more than $4 billion, and in early June bought a 20 percent stake in MCI instead for $4.3 billion.
"British Telecom wanted a steal," said Stephen T. McClellan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in San Francisco. "It turned out G.M. was a little less desperate for cash than they thought."
But apart from questions of price, G.M. would have to give up some equity in E.D.S. for any deal to work, analysts said. And they doubt the auto maker is willing to do that since E.D.S. is one of its few profit-making centers. "I don't think anything is imminent," Mr. McClellan said.
E.D.S. will do well even without a partner, analysts said. The company holds about a fifth of the $28 billion United States market for outsourcing and related computer business services and its finances are strong, with $543 million in cash and securities and cash flow that is double its earnings level. Indeed, E.D.S. has plenty of cash and lines of credit to make acquisitions, the analysts said, although not enough to lay its own fiber optic lines for expanding its communications network. Since G.M. acquired E.D.S., it has consistently racked up double-digit increases in net earnings. Last year, it earned $635.5 million; Mr. McClellan estimates it will earn $729.6 million this year.
YET E.D.S. is being challenged as never before. In only two years of existence, I.B.M.'s computer services subsidiary, the Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, has passed Andersen Consulting, the Digital Equipment Corporation and others for the No. 2 position. I.S.S.C. last year racked up $1.8 billion in revenues; like E.D.S., it is one of its parent's few bright spots.
"The issue for E.D.S. now is how aggressive I.B.M. will be," said Terence Quinn, an analyst with Furman Selz Inc. But I.S.S.C. also has some disadvantages. Not surprisingly, for example, it pushes I.B.M. hardware while E.D.S. can offer a wide range of hardware and software.
British Telecom and MCI also could become formidable competitors if they can acquire more information technology expertise and use their planned global telecommunications network to deliver services to corporations, Mr. Quinn said.
In contrast, the Perot Systems Corporation, the company started by Mr. Perot after he left E.D.S. following a high-profile squabble with G.M., has less than $450 million in annual sales, and has taken some, but not much, business away from E.D.S.
DURING the recession, E.D.S. capitalized on an outsourcing boom. More corporations turned over their data-processing operations to outside experts to save money and avoid technology obsolescence and incompatibility down the road. The American market for such services is expected to more than double to $61 billion by 1997, according to Dataquest Inc.
Corporate users last year awarded 18 big outsourcing contracts, half of them valued at more than $500 million. E.D.S. won five of the megacontracts and I.B.M. won three, including a $3 billion, 10-year deal with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
E.D.S.'s non-G.M. work has soared in the past four years, growing at a compound annual rate of 25 percent from 1988 to 1992, compared with 4 percent for its G.M. accounts.
In the first half of 1993, however, E.D.S.'s revenues from outside customers slowed to single-digit growth. That worried some investors and dampened the price of class E shares, which have lagged competitors for more than a year and closed Friday at $30.75. But Merrill Lynch's Mr. McClellan believes the blip is temporary and that non-G.M. business will return to double-digit growth in the second half after some new contracts begin to produce revenues.
Still, he forecasts that the non-G.M. business will grow only 12 percent this year, while G.M.-related revenues will be flat. Because of the slower growth, E.D.S. has been reducing employment in areas that don't directly relate to servicing customers -- as much as 5 percent in some of its 37 strategic business units, according to analysts. E.D.S. employs about 71,000 worldwide.
"They're going through a major retightening," Mr. McClellan said, adding that he's glad to see it.
As it increases its non-G.M. business, E.D.S. also continues to ease its dependence on G.M., which accounted for 75 percent of its revenues immediately after the auto maker acquired the company. The share was down to 41 percent last year and is expected to fall to 38 percent this year.
"We don't want to have our revenue stream impacted by one company," Mr. Alberthal said, sounding another note of independence. "We don't want to be tied to one company or one industry or one country."
 
 
 
TO EUROPE, OR ANYWHERE
 Even without a telecommunications partner, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation is on the way to its goal of delivering any kind of information -- voice, data or video -- to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
The computer services company has won or is a finalist for several large contracts this year that expand its presence in Europe and cultivate a new customer -- consumers. E.D.S. has pushed into Europe mainly by acquisitions, buying SD-Scicon P.L.C., a British-based computer services company, for more than $250 million in 1991, for example.
That acquisition is already paying off. E.D.S., along with the Computer Sciences Corporation, is a finalist for a $2 billion contract to take over data processing operations for Inland Revenue, Britain's tax collection agency. A winner should be announced in October. Its largest contract so far in Europe is a $1 billion deal signed in April to take over data processing for a Swedish union of business cooperatives, the Kooperative Forbundet.
International business last year accounted for about 23 percent of E.D.S.'s total revenues of $8.2 billion and the company eventually wants to boost overseas sales to half its revenues. Revenues from customers in Europe, apart from General Motors, more than tripled in the last three years, to $828.3 million last year from $226.7 million in 1990. Total European revenues came to about $1.37 billion last year.
Consumers are also key to E.D.S.'s long-term global strategy. Typically a behind-the-scenes player, E.D.S. hopes to win more name recognition through deals like one announced in May to operate as many as 4,000 automated teller machines in 7-Eleven convenience stores. The E.D.S. logo will be on the machines for the first time.
Meanwhile, E.D.S. hopes to capitalize on the convergence of cable TV and phone companies to deliver video, which E.D.S. can store in computerized form and transmit over phone lines. Last month it signed a 10-year, $300 million contract with Spectradyne Inc., a leading provider of pay TV programming to the hotel industry, to deliver movies and other programs when guests want them instead of at a pre-set time.
"We want to expand beyond the business customer," said John R. Harris, an E.D.S. vice president and head of the Communications Industry Group. "We want to serve the individual at home or work or anywhere in between."

HEADLINE: Graduates Bring Their Ideals to a Battered World

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AS Ricardo Horacio Roda prepared for graduation last week, he looked back on three years of struggling to learn a new language and make friends in a strange country. The 17-year-old from Argentina, the first Hispanic student in 60 years to become valedictorian of Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, said that for him graduation was "the American dream come true -- proof that in this country, if you want something and work hard for it, it can happen."
Throughout Westchester last week, high school students who were approaching graduation looked back at their struggles as teen-agers and ahead at the responsibilities they would shoulder as adults. Born in the 1970's, these graduates are statistically part of what some journalists are calling "Generation X" (from the 1991 book by Douglas Coupland, regarded by some as the manifesto of the under-30 set). This group has no formal name (titles like Boomlets and MTV Generation have at times been suggested by the media for the older, twentysomethings) and to date few distinguishing characteristics except that they follow a generation of baby boomers, school authorities say.
 
A Difficult Legacy
 It is what 17-year-old Jennifer Zobel, who graduated second in her class at Fox Lane High School in Bedford last week, described as "a generation of children of working parents, kids who had to learn early on to be independent." 
 But Jennifer, who plans to attend Columbia University, and other members of the class of 1993 rejected the notion that they were a nameless or faceless generation. They said that they had their work cut out for them in the world and vowed to distinguish themselves by addressing the issues of the day.
They chided the generation of their parents and teachers -- that of the 1960's and 70's -- for preaching love but bequeathing to succeeding generations a world where the legacy of racism and intolerance still prevails in many areas.
And they criticized the baby boomers, the high-earning and big-spending generation, for leaving behind a fragile economy and the worry that when the class of 1993 graduates from college in four years, there still may be too few jobs to go around.
Also, the students talked about AIDS, Bosnia, Somalia and domestic issues in the United States.
School principals, sending off the class of '93, characterized the graduating seniors as ethically and morally concerned about the world they were entering as adults, and more intent upon righting wrongs than making money.
"They're concerned about human issues," said Daniel A. Woodard, the principal of White Plains High School. "Our generation made a mess of things, and they want to turn that around."
At Mount Vernon High School, Vice Principal Brenda L. Smith said: "Many say they don't know what this generation is, but I cling to some hope that they will find themselves, given the problems that exist in society. I tell the students not to underestimate their ability to influence, for the better, the lives of others."
A 1992 national study of incoming freshmen, which was conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles, showed that the observations of school principals in Westchester and the graduating high school seniors in the county reflected concerns and attitudes of young adults throughout the country.
 
Social Values a Major Concern
 The university's 27th annual national survey of 213,630 incoming freshmen at 404 colleges and university showed that the percentage of students for whom "helping to promote racial understanding" was either an "essential" or "very important" goal rose to an all-time high of 42 percent in 1992, up from 33.7 percent the year before.
Also, 85.1 percent of the freshmen disagreed, compared with 79.7 percent the year before, with the statement that "racial discrimination was no longer a major problem in America."
The study also showed that influencing social values had become a major concern of students throughout the country, with two out of three saying they performed volunteer work -- similar to what school principals in Westchester reported. The study added that students today were less interested in majoring in business and more focused on the health professions and related fields like biology and medicine, which was borne out in interviews with graduating seniors in Westchester.
From black, white, Hispanic and Asian families -- and different religious backgrounds -- the graduating seniors agreed that the greatest challenge before them as a group was to create a world where more than lip service was paid to the Old Testament question, "Am I my brother's keeper?"
Solita Alexander, who graduated fifth in a class of 341 from White Plains High School and is to enter Harvard University as a pre-med student in the fall, said: "Our generation is very aware of the needs of people who have less than we do. We're not going on to college thinking that everything will be a big party."
 
Fulfillment Is Important
 Solita, who is black and the daughter of a single mother from Guyana, an executive secretary at International Business Machines in White Plains, said that she wants to work in a rural community, like Appalachia, where residents have limited access to medical care or other advantages.
In Mount Vernon last week, where Lindsey McCabe was preparing the speech she would deliver to 509 fellow graduates, the valedictorian said that she would preach tolerance for other races, for homosexuals and for those with AIDS and would tell the class of '93 that "success should not be measured in money or grades, but in the ability to lead a happy life and be fulfilled."
 
Appreciating Diversity
 The yearbook editor and staff member of her school's literary magazine, Lindsey is to enter the University of Virginia as an English major in the fall. She said that her experiences growing up as the daughter of an Irish Catholic father and a Jewish mother, and as a young white woman in a school district where 85 percent of the population is black and Hispanic, have taught her "the importance of learning to appreciate diversity."
In Tarrytown, at Sleepy Hollow High School, the valedictorian, Robert C. Hyman, 18, said he was worried about a world that "still has too much of a gap between the urban poor and the wealthy elite."
Robert, who plans to enter Harvard University in the fall and study either physics or history, criticized many universities, including Harvard, for "promoting diversity but still being too upper-crust," and took to task fellow classmates for "being concerned only with issues that affect them directly, like censorship, and not enough concerned with the big issues like the environment."
Robert's message to 99 fellow graduates last week was that no matter what a person's race, religion, line of work or income is, "each of us has to make a difference in the world, even in little ways, like how we raise our children or conduct our relationships."
 
Problem of Discrimination
 At Bronxville High School, Aileen Bramhall, 17, said that although she grew up in a small, affluent and predominantly white community, she is aware of "a lot of places in the world where there is despair."
She will enter the University of Rochester in the fall and hopes to become an opera singer. "Aileen in Gaelic means the bringer of light," she said. "That's what I want to do. It is very sad to think that there are other young people in places like Bosnia and Appalachia who have talents that we will never know about. For anything to be wasted is a great tragedy."
And at Briarcliff High School, one graduating senior, Nancy Lee, cited discrimination as a major problem facing high school graduates today. "People talk a good game about not discriminating, but they don't play it," she said.
 
'Hopeful for the Future
 The issue hits close to home for the first-generation daughter of Chinese immigrants, who said she rejected stereotyping of Asian students "by those who think of us only as smart and going into math or science."
Nancy, who graduated fifth in a class of 88 students and plans to study biology at Cornell University, also criticized fellow Asian students for "only staying with their own kind."
She added: "That's their part of discrimination. Both sides are at fault when they don't reach out."
In Yonkers, Ricardo observed that in many ways teen-agers have similar concerns wherever they live, whether it be in Argentina, in Westchester or in a third-world country. "The class of '93 throughout the world has to face a lot of problems," he said. "We worry about many serious issues, but we all still have to be hopeful about the future."

HEADLINE: A Therapeutic Program for Troubled Students

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
DURING the final weeks of the spring term, most high school teachers have to struggle to capture their students' interest. So it was to be expected that some of the teen-agers in Sam Hedrick's world-cultures history class were gazing into space recently instead of their textbooks. Still, Mr. Hedrick managed to steer a conversation about welfare abuse into a spirited discussion of World War II and the rise of Hitler.
Despite these trappings of a conventional high school classroom, which has such standard social studies features as world maps, globes and computers, this class actually took place inside the Psychiatric Institute of the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. And the students, who have had problems with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as psychiatric disorders that include anxiety, depression, suicide attempts and severe mood swings, are enrolled in West-Prep.
 
Checking to Avoid Relapses
 The program, a joint effort of the Westchester County Medical Center, New York Medical College and the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Southern Westchester, offers troubled adolescents a combination of school and therapeutic treatment on an outpatient basis. 
 "All the kids here have a psychiatric diagnosis and a substance abuse problem," said Meri Wieder-Sirkin, the health-services coordinator for West-Prep. Geared toward youngsters 14 through 18, this five-year-old program provides a full academic curriculum and a variety of therapy sessions during its 8:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. day.
Students have to be referred by other hospitals, private psychiatrists or therapists, home school districts or the court system. What distinguishes West-Prep from other programs designed to treat troubled adolescents is that the students live at home, yet have access to the medical services of the Psychiatric Institute.
"This is the only Boces program in this area that is focusing on this problem of substance abuse," said Neil Manis, supervisor of special education services for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. "If school districts send these kids here, the school districts have made earlier efforts to intervene. They're here because they have a disease that's interfering with academics. And it has made enough of an impact so that the school district doesn't want to handle it internally."
In many respects, a typical day isn't so different from that of most high schoolers. Students take classes in English, math, social studies and science and have the opportunity to relax with such activities as gym and occupational therapy.
What is not part of most high school students' experience is having to give daily or weekly urine samples to check for relapses into alcohol or drug abuse, a routine that West-Prep's students perform matter-of-factly.
Atypical of many high school programs is the strict enforcement of a behavior code, with increased freedom and responsibility (as well as prizes) available to those students who follow the rules and have good attendance.
For those who are violent or return to drugs, consequences are increased restrictions and loss of such privileges as going on a field trip or watching a movie. "Reinforcement is the key," said Mr. Hedrick, a special education teacher who teachers social studies and English in the program.
 
Building Up Self-Esteem
 As part of the treatment, students are expected to participate in alcohol- and-drug-abuse, self-help and group therapy sessions with other youngsters in West-Prep. The program also offers group sessions for their parents and siblings.
Amanada Bevacqua, a drugs and alcohol abuse counselor, said: "I want to get them to have insights into what got them into trouble. Some common issues are low self-esteem, family dysfunction and negative peer pressure. In many cases, these kids have to work through needing to be on a prescribed medication for their problem."
One parent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her family's privacy, said: "I know that these people have done tremendous things with my son. He was a wreck when he came out of Stony Lodge, and he would have relapsed if it hadn't been for the teachers and counselors. They focus on what the kids can do and build up their self-esteem. He'd still be very vulnerable without their support system." Stony Lodge is a private psychiatric hospital in Ossining.
The 24 students who are currently enrolled in West-Prep reflect a diversity of backgrounds and abilities, with the alcohol and drug abuse and emotional disorder often the only common link. There are teen-agers with learning disabilities whose academic program focuses on remedial efforts, and there are those who can easily pursue college preparatory courses.
Some students come from affluent homes in the county's wealthier communities while others live in group homes.
 
Rain Forest as a Project
 Susan Taylor, who teaches math and science at West-Prep, said: "It's hard to get them motivated or focused if they've had a bad time at home. A lot of these kids have not had much success in school. Our main job is motivating them so they can get out of high school, so they don't lose their education and so they can be successful. We work with the school district in planning an academic program."
One of this year's more successful projects was the creation of a living rain forest as part of the environmental science course and horticulture program. In a light-filled room cluttered with hanging plants, a replica of the rain forest -- complete with appropriate plants and insects -- stands as testament to the students' interest and dedication.
Maxine Kaplan, a member of the expressive therapy department of the Psychiatric Institute, said: "We had done small-scale terrariums before. The kids built the entire rain forest."
 
A Success Story
 Added Mrs. Taylor: "The important thing was that the kids got to do something that was successful."
The combination of relentless reinforcement from teachers and therapists, small classes and positive peer pressure has apparently succeeded in keeping many of the students on a straighter path. "Before, I was not into school," said a 17-year-old girl from Pleasantville, Marie M., who agreed to be interviewed only if her last name was not used. "I really got into social studies here, especially economics. I also like math and accounting. Ever since I've been sober, everything's different. I can't wait for college next year." Marie, who attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly, plans to enroll in Westchester Community College next fall.
Michael Feldman, 18, of Yorktown Heights is one of the program's more accomplished graduates. While he was at West-Prep, Mr. Feldman took college classes at Westchester Community College. Since his high school graduation in January, six months early, he has been enrolled at Iona College, working toward an accounting degree.
"When I first started at West-Prep, I didn't want to work with the program," Mr. Feldman said. "Then I realized that I was not going to get anywhere until I made friends with the staff and my peers. The best thing is that the staff works with you as a person, not as a patient or student. When I had first come out of the hospital, I was ready to use drugs again. But I didn't want to when I went to West-Prep. I've been off substances for two and a half years now."
Still, those who work with the students at West-Prep acknowledge that it is a continuing struggle to insure that these youngsters stay off drugs and alcohol after they leave the program. "If an adolescent and his family are both engaged in treatment, the rate for success is much higher," Ms. Wieder-Sirkin said. "And we work hard on the transition by continuing to do treatment."
Added Joseph Starvaggi, a clinical supervisor for West-Prep:
"I feel I'm successful when we have a kid who has acknowledged his problem with drugs and has been sober for a long time. I can only guide them and give them a direction and tools to use. I want to establish them so they can contribute and be comfortable with themselves and their families. I don't expect to cure them."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Discuss Trade Goals

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, June 28

 BODY:
As bilateral trade talks began here Sunday, Japan and the United States remained divided over the issue of numerical benchmarks for measuring progress in opening Japan's markets, officials said.
The discussion, which will continue through today, is intended to set up a framework for talks between the two nations on structural issues like Japan's distribution system, and on particular trade sectors like automobiles. The American side has said that being able to measure progress is a key requirement, a demand that Japan has rejected as "managed trade." 
 Japan on Sunday proposed to set up a high-level committee of American and Japanese officials to discuss trade matters during the next two years. The group would be called the Committee on Market-Oriented Economy and Trade, or Comet, according to American officials and Japanese press reports.
 
Elements of Open Trade

 
 Japan proposed that there be general areas of discussion, including loosening regulations, opening government procurement to foreign companies, strengthening each nation's competitiveness and harmonizing both countries' rules in areas like intellectual property.
The United States has also proposed that future discussions be grouped into "baskets" and there is some overlap between the two proposals. The Japanese proposal, however, does not have a basket for the specific issue of increasing Japan's purchases of American and other foreign autos and auto parts, which Japan argues is beyond the control of the Government.
Japan's proposal also emphasizes that American trade practices should be discussed as well as those of the Japanese. While Japan said the committee might discuss the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers and satellites, it said the "Buy American" programs by the United States should also be topics of discussion.
The United States and Japan have said they want to complete the framework in time for the visit here next month of President Clinton for the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations. But the framework, if it is established by then, is likely to be only a roadmap for future discussions rather than including specific new market-opening measures.
 
Numerical Goals at Issue
 In a separate meeting here Sunday of representatives from the seven nations in preparing for the summit meeting, the United States proposed including numerical goals in the economic declaration to be made at the meeting, Japanese officials and news reports said.
The United States wanted the Group of Seven to agree that each country would strive to cut its current account trade surplus to within 2 percent of its gross domestic product, a demand that American officials have made separately to Japan as part of the bilateral talks. In addition, the United States wanted the seven countries to agree collectively on a target of 3 percent economic growth.
Japan and some European nations opposed including these goals in the summit meeting's declaration, so they will probably not appear, one Japanese official said.

HEADLINE: Jumpstarting the Electric Car's Future

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Almost everybody likes the idea of clean, quiet electric cars, but at today's relatively high prices -- from the mid-$20,000's for a small car to $100,000 for a mini-van -- almost nobody buys them. So they remain impossible to mass-produce, which means that prices stay high.
Now, a new analysis has concluded that the impasse could be broken if Federal and state governments would commit themselves to large-scale purchases of the vehicles, an idea that some Federal officials cautiously agree has merit. 
 The study, scheduled for release today by the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College, calls on Federal, state and local governments to purchase 200,000 vehicles a year, or about 80 percent of the cars and light-duty trucks that they now order each year. An order of that size would lead to lower prices over all, according to the authors, who said that "this gridlock can be broken with no direct cost to taxpayers."
Dr. Barry Commoner, who directed the study, said that if the Government entered the vehicle market in a big way and caused the price to fall, "we're not talking about a subsidy, but simply an economic motivation."
While electric cars have far less range -- from 50 miles between charges to perhaps 800 -- than gasoline-powered vehicles, most cars in the Federal fleet do not travel more than 50 to 100 miles a day, Dr. Commoner said.
The main motivation for developing electric vehicles is air pollution control. Electric vehicles are pollution-free at the point of use. Electricity production creates some pollution, but power-plant smokestacks are more easily controlled than auto tailpipes, and can be located hundreds of miles from population centers.
President Clinton has been seeking to stimulate production of "alternative fuel vehicles," including those running on compressed natural gas, methanol and propane. In April, the President signed an executive order requiring the Federal Government to buy nearly 34,000 such vehicles during the next three years, or 11,000 more than the number specified in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
But officials of the General Services Administration, which actually buys the vehicles, and of the Energy Department, which provides the difference in cost between traditional and alternative-fuel vehicles, say they prefer buying natural gas- and methanol-powered cars because their price premium is far smaller than for electric cars.
William T. Rivers, an official at the G.S.A.'s fleet management division who is responsible for buying alternative-fueled vehicles, said Congress had appropriated $18 million for the extra costs of buying 11,250 alternative-fueled vehicles next year. That comes to $1,600 a vehicle. The added cost of some alternative cars falls well within that margin. A Dodge Spirit that can run on methanol or gasoline costs $721 more than a gasoline-only model, Mr. Rivers said, while a Chevrolet Lumina or Ford Taurus that can run on methanol or ethanol carries no price premium.
In contrast, he said, electric mini-vans sold by Ford and Chrysler cost more than $100,000 each. For example, Mr. Rivers said one mini-van that sells for $15,000 in the gasoline-powered version costs $115,000 for the electric model.
Buying electric vehicles would require a substantial subsidy, Mr. Rivers said, one that must be shared with methanol and natural gas vehicles. "Right now the only mechanism we have to get the vehicles is that the Department of Energy receives an appropriation from Congress under the Energy Policy Act," he said, referring to a provision of the 1992 law that is supposed to reduce dependence on oil.
 
A State Issue, as Well
 California, however, is counting on the emergence of an electric car industry by 1998, when its air quality regulations call for 2 percent of each auto manufacturer's California sales to be electrics, rising to 10 percent in the early years of the next century. Other states are seeking to adopt California's rules. And Washington often adopts national rules after they have been tested in California.
Gary Mauro, the Texas Land Commissioner who was named by President Clinton as chairman of the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force, said his group would try to work with state governments and private-sector fleet purchasers to stimulate demand for electric cars, with an eye to bringing down costs.
The problem, he said, was scale. For example, not counting postal vehicles, the Federal Government owns about 558,000 light-duty vehicles, too small a fleet to require 200,000 new vehicles a year.
In addition, Mr. Mauro said, it was wrong to think that electric vehicles would work in all situations; with the limited energy in their batteries, they could not perform adequately in areas where heat or air-conditioning requirements were high.
Other people are skeptical for different reasons. "The technology is not quite at the point where they're worth being mass-produced," said Kenneth F. Barber, director of the Electric and Hybrid Propulsion Division at the Energy Department.
The average passenger car in the G.S.A. fleet travels 13,000 miles a year, the agency said. That comes to 50 miles a weekday. Some, obviously, travel far more than 50 miles in a day, but proponents of electric cars say a motor pool could employ many vehicles with a 50-mile range.
Dr. Commoner and his co-author, Mark Cohen, a Queens College scientist, said they thought costs would drop sharply after the first few hundred thousand electric vehicles were ordered. They based their projections in part on studies of the gasoline auto industry's early years; the price of an average car fell by more than two-thirds between 1907 and 1915, the authors said, because of the "learning curve" inherent in mass production.
 
Demand's Effect on Supply
 Still, in the case of electric cars, mass production would not lower the price of batteries; it might even drive the price up, because demand could rise faster than production capacity, experts have said.
But mass production would lower the cost of assembling the components, Dr. Commoner argued. "Most of the value added that goes into the car is the assembly," he said.
At this point, the American auto industry has the ability to deliver electric vehicles only in limited numbers. But within three or four years, if demand mounted, auto makers could gear up to produce any number of electric vehicles. In the interim, electric vehicles are readily available from small assemblers, which buy cars from manufacturers, take out the engines and reconfigure them.
Electric car producers say that even modest increases in demand would lower the cost of some components. For example, the Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Mass., sells a converted Geo Metro with an electronic controller. This device converts alternating current from the recharging plug into direct current, the form in which it is stored in the battery. Then it changes the energy back into alternating current for use in the drive motor.
The controller, in a box the size of a videocassette recorder, costs about $5,000 because it must be hand built, Arvind Rajan, Solectria's vice president for marketing and planning, said. With automated production, he said, the price would drop rapidly.
Solectria's least expensive car model currently sells for $26,000; the company has sold 40 of them in the last two years. If it could sell 10,000 vehicles a year, Mr. Rajan said, the price would be about $10,000 each.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Oil Company Going Public

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 27

 BODY:
Argentina takes a step on Monday that no other Latin American country has done: It is selling control of its state oil company, YPF S.A., to local and international investors.
The planned sale of nearly $2.5 billion in YPF stock after the close of trading on Monday is perhaps the most graphic illustration of the change in political and economic orientation for Argentina under President Carlos Saul Menem and, by extension, for much of the continent as it emerges from almost two decades of high inflation, protected markets, weak growth and negative industrial investment. 
 Historically, state energy companies have been considered the crown jewel of any Latin American government -- the patrimony of its history and the ultimate financial refuge from the pressures of international bankers and other foreign interests that threaten national security.
 
A Sale is Cheered
 In the past, the hint of selling such energy companies would stir nationalistic outcry and predictions of economic ruin.
But Argentines have cheered the sale of YPF, formerly known as Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, flooding banks here with four times the number of buy orders for the stock than had been expected. And under a plan devised by Economy Minister Domingo F. Cavallo to exchange YPF stock for Argentine bonds, the Government will be able to retire almost $2 billion of debt.
"This has to be one of the most important financial transactions in Latin American history," said Jose E. Rohm, executive director of Banco General de Negocios, adviser to the Argentine Government and the underwriting syndicate on the transaction. "In one big stroke, Menem and Cavallo will consolidate an extraordinary economic transformation. Other countries in the region have hardly begun to consider this. Chile still holds onto its state copper company, Venezuela and Mexico have yet to address the state monopoly of their oil industries."
Christopher Ecclestone, a stock market analyst in Buenos Aires, said, "This could accelerate the eventual sale of state-owned natural resource companies around Latin America, not only oil but mineral companies as well that have traditionally been considered sacred cows."
On Monday afternoon, underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company will announce the final offering price for the YPF shares and the number of shares sold to public investors.
Officials expect the shares to be priced between $19 and $20 each -- in the upper range of the $17-to-$20 a share previously estimated by the Government. They say almost 130 million shares, 37 percent of the company, will be bought by investors who have sent in orders to underwriters during the last month. YPF shares, in the form of American depositary shares, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
 
Exceeded Expectations
 Though analysts have been skeptical of the transaction because of the speed at which the First Boston-Merrill Lynch syndicate has marketed the deal, they admit the offering has exceeded expectations. If, as investment bankers predict, almost $2.5 billion in YPF stock is sold, it will be one of the largest initial public offerings on record as well as one of the largest privatizations.
But the value for the Argentine Government is expected to top $4 billion. The Government is offering to exchange certain bond issues held by pensioners and other investors for YPF stock at a 15 percent discount. Officials estimate that up to $1.6 billion in bonds will be exchanged, bringing the total value to the Government to $4.1 billion when the stock sale and debt retirement are combined. And the Government plans to apply the proceeds from the sale to pay part of the billions of dollars in bonds held by retirees.
 
An Oil Giant
 With a total market value of about $7 billion, YPF would be one of the 20 largest oil concerns in the world. The company controls 54 percent of Argentina's oil and gas industry and has reserves of 2.8 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents.
Investment advisers note that at around $20 a share, the value of a barrel of YPF reserves would be about $2.50, much less than the current average among international oil companies of about $6 a barrel.
While the privatization of YPF represents Argentina's willingness to open its economy, the company's financial condition reflects a significant turnaround from three years ago, when it lost $576 million, and throughout the 1980's, when it lost more than $6 billion.
New management has cut employees from more than 50,000 in 1990 to fewer than 10,000 now. Though it earned just $259 million in 1992 on sales of $3.91 billion, earnings this year are expected to exceed $600 million and approach $1 billion in 1994.
One reason is that by next year a pipeline to Chile will be completed, opening a large new market for YPF and adding substantially to its projected earnings.
 
The Fears That Remain
 While some analysts see YPF as a pure play on oil and gas assets, there are those who see inherent risks in the country -- a possible disruption in its economic stability and the ever-present worry in Latin America that a future government might decide to renationalize the company.
Not only do most politicians feel that would be out of the question, but investment bankers say that the deal's structure would make nationalization nearly impossible.
"We estimate well over a million Argentines will own YPF stock," Mr. Rohm said. "Now you tell me which Argentine politician would come along and take those shares out of the hands of that many voters."
Officials project that the Argentine investing public will end up with 31 percent of the shares in the company. By law, the Government has to keep 20 percent. Ten percent of the shares go to YPF workers, and five Argentine provinces have decided to keep 11 percent of the company. Foreigners, therefore, would represent only about a 28 percent ownership.
Investors have also worried about the independence of the company's directors, because the Government and provinces will have 31 percent of the shares. Investment bankers structured the deal so that the Argentine Government and the provinces are entitled to elect a total of 3 of the company's 12 directors, far from management control.
But not everyone is convinced that the privatization will mean the release of control by the Argentine Government over YPF.
"No one really has the impression that the company is leaving the fold of the state, just by injecting outside shareholders," Mr. Ecclestone said. "The shareholders are going to be a very dispersed group and there will be no real dominant player among them to exert pressure on management."

Southwest Airlines Earns Praise for Its Profitable Ways.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, rare among the big carriers because it is the only one that has made money each of the last three years, has attracted a slew of imitators among start-up airlines intent on duplicating Southwest's emphasis on lean operations and a minimum of passenger amenities.
But analysts see little threat from the copycats.
"If the start-up airlines succeed in direct competition with Southwest, they would have some impact," said Paul P. Karos, the airline analyst for First Boston. "But that doesn't seem to be a likely possibility." First Boston recently raised its earnings estimate for Southwest's second quarter, which ends this week, as well as for the company's full-year 1993 and 1994 results. 
 Southwest, the only big carrier to turn a profit last year, is the only one of the big airlines that does not operate a hub-and-spoke system, will not transfer passengers' baggage to a connecting flight, does not serve meals, offers only economy class on all flights, and has only Boeing 737's in its fleet. Its policy of not reserving seats often sets off a mad scramble at boarding time.
While adopting some of these techniques, newcomers seem eager to avoid head-to-head combat with Southwest -- probably for the same reason its giant competitors are reluctant to take on the no-frills carrier. When Southwest recently started flying to San Jose, Calif., for example, American Airlines beat a hasty retreat from that market. According to a recent Transportation Department study, while Southwest is only fifth in total passengers and eighth in revenues -- $1.7 billion, compared with $14.4 billion for American, the industry leader -- it carries more traffic in the top 100 markets in the continental United States than any other United States airline.
"Five years ago people who flew Southwest loved it," Mr. Karos said. "But the general public had the perception it must have been a cattle-car operation. Not any more. Today there's a whole different attitude. It's considered the 'in' thing to fly Southwest."
It is also sometimes cited as a model for the Big Three carriers to emulate, although their unit operating costs average 50 to 70 percent more than Southwest's, according to the Transportation Department.
Southwest's growing popularity is largely the result of lower air fares. The average fares last year in markets served by Southwest were $56 for distances of less than 250 miles and $58 for routes of between 251 and 500 miles. Fares over those same distances, on routes not served by Southwest, averaged $110 and $130, respectively. Mr. Karos said the carrier would begin operating to "some new, lucky city" this summer, but the airline has not revealed which one.
First Boston raised its second-quarter estimate to 44 cents a share from a previous projection of 36 cents, either of which would be higher than the 25 cents a share that Southwest earned in the second quarter of 1992. For 1993, Mr. Karos raised his estimate to $1.65 a share, from $1.55, and raised his 1994 estimate to $2.30 a share, from $2.
"With earnings growth of 70 percent in 1993 and 40 percent in 1994, and with longer-term earnings growth potential in the 15-20 percent range," Mr. Karos wrote in a recent analysis, "we think this stock can trade at 20 to 25 times 1994 over the next 12 months.
"Valuing this company has proven very difficult the last several years since the growth keeps accelerating," he wrote. "We think the stock will continue to perform well as long as earnings expectations are met or exceeded. We think this will occur the next few quarters."
The big unknown, Mr. Karos said, is Southwest's load factors -- that is, the percentage of seats filled by passengers. While they may not equal the 68.6 percent load factor he expects for June, the highest for any quarter in Southwest's recent history, he said he thought they would continue at high levels.

HEADLINE: Voters Are Rejecting More School Budgets

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 27

 BODY:
Voters across New York State rejected school budgets this year at the second highest rate since 1980, baffling a monitoring group that said today that it did not expect so much discontent.
Frustration over expected increases in Federal taxes and New York's continued economic troubles may have contributed to the rejections, said the New York State School Boards Association. 
 Of the 637 votes this spring on individual school district budgets, there were 177 rejections, or just under 28 percent, the association said in its annual compilation of results. That is an increase from 1992, when about 20 percent, or one school budget in five, was defeated, and just under the level in 1991, when 181 budget plans were defeated.
"It's a big surprise to us," Louis Grumet, the association's executive director, said today. "Ordinarily, when state aid goes up beyond expectations, usually budget votes go very well. That's not the case this year."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Drop For First Time in 3 Months

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Posting their first decline in three months, orders for machine tools fell in May by nearly 9 percent. But industry experts attributed little significance to the decline as an indicator of trouble ahead.
In its monthly report, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade organization in McLean, Va., said yesterday that orders for May totaled $317.3 million, compared with $348.3 million for April, a decrease of 8.9 percent. 
 Since January, however, orders have increased 38 percent, to $1.6 billion, compared with the corresponding period last year, and orders last month almost doubled the orders of May 1992.
"I think it's just a blip on the screen," said Matthew B. Coffey, president of the National Tooling and Machining Association, a 3,200-member trade organization based in Fort Washington, Md. "I think everyone was a little uncertain at one point, with the chance of an investment tax credit. Everyone was waiting for that. But once that disappeared, everybody resumed their usual patterns. So maybe we're seeing the lag effect of that."
 
Orders by Auto Makers
 "I don't see anything like a trend," he added. "If this continues for a quarter, then I think we would be seeing a fundamental change."
Albert W. Moore, the president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, attributed the growth earlier in the year to orders by the Big Three auto makers. He said he expected fewer orders from the auto makers through the rest of the year, but he predicted that year-end figures for 1993 would still reflect at least 10 percent growth over 1992.
Machine tools cut and mold metal for capital equipment in a variety of industries, including those that make aircraft engines, refrigerators and cars. Tool orders, for both domestic use and export, are watched closely for trends in investment and imports.
This year, nearly 90 percent of the orders have been for domestic use, though the figure vacillates each month. In January, 19.7 percent of the orders were foreign; in May, just 5.1 percent.
That, too, was a signal to some that the decline might not necessarily stir concern that a fundamental shift in the economy is brewing. More critical to the level of future orders, Mr. Coffey and others said, might be the final shape of the Clinton tax plan, now being debated in Congress.
"If orders are starting to fall off, some major companies are holding back," said Charles D. Yuska, executive director of the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute in Washington, whose members buy capital equipment for packaging operations. "If they're a little more cautious, I think it's because of the uncertainty in Congress."
The monthly figures complied by the Association for Manufacturing Technology reflect shipments and backlogs, besides orders. Shipments have fluctuated this year, with the figure for May, $236.75 million, reflecting about a 5 percent drop since January. Backlogs increased for the third consecutive month, to nearly $1.5 billion in May, an increase of almost 6 percent for the month and 18.1 percent since January.

HEADLINE: Bankrupt Individuals Are Fewer

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
After rising inexorably for nearly a decade, the number of bankruptcies filed by individuals is suddenly declining.
In five of the last six months for which data are now available, filings were markedly lower than a year earlier. Bankruptcy experts say that the new data indicate that a significant shift has occurred. 
 Why this is happening and what it portends, nobody is quite sure. Although some skeptics see the data as a sign of greater caution by consumers who have been unwilling to overextend themselves, many experts believe the trend may presage an era of greater spending by consumers who feel less squeezed than in years past.
Lenders, accountants, economists and credit counselors who are still pondering the development might welcome it all the more -- if they could explain it. They offer many theories, however.
To the behaviorists, it suggests a new era of fiscal sobriety among consumers after a binge of borrowing. At the same time, they see more sophisticated management of credit risks by banks, which have become more careful about lending but also less aggressive about collecting debts from distressed customers.
 
A Recovery or Not?
 To some soothsayers, the reversal augurs a burgeoning recovery. Prosperity naturally fosters consumer confidence, they say, and a decline in bankruptcies goes hand in hand with a firmer job market and an increase in personal incomes. (Never mind that the upward march of bankruptcies coincided with the remarkable economic expansion of the 1980's.)
To number-crunchers, the reversal results inevitably from lower interest rates. These have allowed households to refinance debts on more favorable terms, improving cash flow and staving off financial collapse.
And maybe, like every statistical streak, the rise in bankruptcies contained the seeds of its own destruction: four million bankruptcies in the last six years just might mean that the nation's supply of deadbeats is starting to run low.
Whatever the reason, the change in the number of bankruptcy filings is distinct enough that Ed Flynn, the statistician of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, which released figures last week for the first three months of the year, called the latest data "a dramatic turnaround."
Bankruptcy filings by individuals took off in the early 1980's. The number of filings doubled during the Reagan years and by 1992 had reached 900,000 a year, triple the number in 1984. Beginning in 1985, a new record was set every year.
But now the monthly tallies are shrinking, and the trend persisted through the first quarter of this year, with bankruptcies down 20 percent in January, 11 percent in February and 7 percent in March, compared with a year earlier.
Robert W. Johnson, senior research associate at the Credit Research Center at Purdue University, said the new data "would indicate that we are looking at a major shift in the trend in bankruptcies."
"I think it may reflect that we are coming out of difficult times, a sign of economic recovery," he said. "I don't think it is a change in people's basic habits and willingness to declare bankruptcy, or a change in ethical standards. But it is a sign that people believe they can handle their debts."
 
Is a Spending Boom Coming?
 He is among those who think this means the consumer is gearing up for another round of spending that could buoy the economy, although others think just the opposite.
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, said the reversal resulted not from an economic revival, but from "a combination of lower interest rates and more prudent consumer expenditures."
"For tens of millions of American households the recession continues," he said. "Basically, it's the morning after the party. Most people have a slight headache. Some are even having difficulty getting out of bed."
Sam Gerdano of the American Bankruptcy Institute, which called a news conference to hail the statistical development, said that the shift in bankruptcy filings is probably largely a result of a marked decline in the percentage of earnings that the average consumer must spend on monthly debt payments, in light of lower interest rates. Encouraging the trend: Many homeowners in the last year have refinanced their mortgages and are using the monthly savings to reduce credit-card balances and other consumer debt.
The debt-service payment ratio, as this economic measure is called, is considered one of the best measures of financial stress on consumers. It started to rise just before bankruptcies began to climb, going from about 15 percent of income in 1983 to about 18 percent in 1990.
At such levels, Mr. Gerdano said, consumers "just cannot take on any more water." And finally, in 1991, the debt-service ratio turned the corner. It now stands at roughly 16 percent.
 
Change in Bankruptcy Laws
 It seems logical that fewer people would file for bankruptcy at a time when less of their income is consumed by paying monthly credit bills. But other analysts said this was probably not the only explanation for the new trend.
"I don't think the debt-service ratio explains it," said Philip S. Corwin, director of retail banking at the American Bankers Association. "It explains some increase, but it does not explain a tripling" in bankruptcies in the last decade.
The bankers say the long-running increase is mainly a result of passage of a new bankruptcy law that took effect in 1979, which made personal bankruptcy easier and more attractive economically, because it allowed the filers to retain more of their personal assets. And Mr. Corwin said that despite the latest numbers, the bankers fear that what is happening now is a leveling off at a lofty plateau, not a major decline.
Mr. Flynn, the statistician for the bankruptcy courts, said that in past cycles bankruptcy filings had fallen back just 10 percent or 20 percent from their cyclical peaks, which suggests that 700,000 or 800,000 new bankruptcies might occur each year.
But it is hard to say how many distressed debtors are still waiting in the wings.
"I think the overriding factor is that those people who have found it necessary to file, have already filed," said Jack Salomon, a partner at the accounting firm of Grant Thornton. "Now it is just the stragglers, the people who have tried to work it out and failed."
Both he and Mr. Corwin said that the banks might have become more flexible in helping people arrange to repay debts without going bankrupt.
"We are trying to put out the word that if you have a credit repayment problem, come talk to us; we will work with you," said Mr. Corwin of the bankers' group. "We can work things out outside the bankruptcy courts, which is better for everyone."
Not necessarily, said Mr. Johnson of Purdue's Credit Research Center. Consumers learned in the 1980's that declaring bankruptcy not only could make economic sense in the short term, but that it did not necessarily ruin one's credit.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
In a New Television Campaign, Perrier Tries to Ride a Wave of Tiny Bubbles to a Rebound in U.S. Sales.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE American marketer of Perrier hopes to put the fizz back into lagging sales with advertising that celebrates something much more basic than the brand's cachet: its bubbles.
A series of television commercials, which begin running this week, are silent but for the sounds of a bottle opening, the effervescence of the mineral water within and a glory-hallelujah wave of "Aaaahhhs" from an unseen choir. To give the carbonation added character, special effects make objects on screen -- city lights, golf balls, sunflowers -- rise to the sky, bubble-like, as each bottle is uncapped. 
 The commercials are the first for the Perrier Group of America since its French parent, Source Perrier S.A., was acquired last year by Nestle S.A., which subsequently consolidated the brand's worldwide advertising at Publicis-FCB Communications in Paris. The campaign, created by Publicis's New York office, replaces one by the Perrier Group's previous American agency, Waring & LaRosa, that portrayed the brand as omnipresent by deeming it "part of the local color" in bars and restaurants from the trendy Time Cafe in Manhattan to the prosaic Shake Shack in California.
"This campaign is a reaffirmation of Perrier, as opposed to the repositioning that some people might have expected," said Kim E. Jeffery, president and chief executive at the Perrier Group in Greenwich, Conn.
"Its tone is fun and light and somewhat magical," he added during an interview last week in which he provided a preview of the campaign. "It speaks to the exhilarating strengths of Perrier -- its bubbles, its simplicity, its naturalness."
Alan Platt, a vice president and group creative director at Publicis in New York, said that because the campaign was intended to "broaden what the perception of Perrier is, we're going back to what it is, a refreshing bottle of water that gives you a little lift."
"We want to get away from the 80's baggage," he added, referring to the sparkling water's lofty image during most of that decade, "and be more inclusive than exclusive." So the commercials feature people like a lithe young golfer in full grunge regalia (no shirt, baggy shorts, backwards cap and boots) and a trio of little girls.
Glen Jacobs, a vice president and group creative director who worked with Mr. Platt on the commercials, called them "our homage to the bubbles, which is where it all started; they're what set Perrier apart."
Mr. Jeffery is the first to admit that the Perrier Group is still struggling to regain the brand's momentum that was stopped dead by a recall in 1990 concerning benzene contamination. Sales in America, which reached $102 million in 1989, briefly fell to zero as 72 million bottles of Perrier were pulled off shelves.
Despite ambitious predictions that sales would rebound to pre-recall levels, they have yet to do so; while Perrier remains the nation's best-selling imported sparkling water, it lost its ranking as the No. 1 imported water of any type to Evian, the French nonsparkling brand. Perrier sales last year totaled just $60 milllion, though Mr. Jeffery said they were up about 10 percent so far this year.
"Very honestly, we thought it would take us less time" to recover from the "self-inflicted wound," he said, "but we had a recession intervene."
Jesse Meyers, publisher and editor of Beverage Digest, a newsletter in Old Greenwich, Conn., agreed that "Perrier has gone through some difficult times," adding, "It still has a way to go, and a way to grow, to make up for the recall."
Yet the Perrier Group "seems to be headed in the right direction," he continued, primarily because of "its new alliance with Nestle, which is worth a gazillion dollars," and the powerful bottlers who make up its distribution system.
The campaign is also the first to be completed by Publicis for any of the more than 100 countries where Perrier is sold. As a result, Mr. Jeffery said, "there's interest around the world to see what happens with this."
"The advertising may differ from country to country," he added, "but the core values will be similar."
The Perrier Group plans to spend $7 million on the campaign between now and the end of the year. By comparison, the company spent $6.1 million to advertise Perrier during all of 1992 and $4.9 million in 1991, according to Leading National Advertisers in New York, which tracks ad spending.
The commercials will run in 10 local markets that Mr. Jeffery estimated account for 50 percent to 60 percent of Perrier's sales volume: Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, Washington and West Palm Beach, Fla.

HEADLINE: U.N. Talks Bring Haiti Leaders and Aristide Together in New York

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 27

 BODY:
United Nations diplomats began talks today in New York with senior Haitian political and military leaders and with Haiti's first elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in an effort to restore him to power after 21 months of exile.
The negotiations, which came after continuing international pressure that brought tough new economic sanctions against Haiti's military leadership and its civilian allies last week, are being held on Governors Island, a tightly controlled military reservation in New York harbor. 
 Diplomats said the first stage of the talks did not involve any face-to-face meetings between Father Aristide and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian Army commander who led the coup in September 1991 in which the President was deposed and hundreds of his followers are believed to have been killed.
The conversations between the United Nations special envoy for Haiti, Dante Caputo, and the two adversaries were private, with few details passed on even to many of the diplomats gathered for the talks, which continued into the night.
 
Agenda Is Aim
 Instead, diplomats shuttled between the separate headquarters of Father Aristide and General Cedras and their large delegations on the island, seeking to establish an agenda centering on the basic goal of quickly restoring Father Aristide to office.
Mr. Caputo emerged from a three-hour meeting with General Cedras this afternoon to tell reporters, "If I may say so, I found on both sides a common ground, and this is not only to find a solution to the political crisis in Haiti, but to see that that solution will create a stable and durable democracy in that country."
Asked for an appraisal of the first day of talks, a member of Father's Aristide's delegation said: "Two inches forward, and then a freeze. I wouldn't even say three inches. We were hoping to see at least a foot of progress."
Diplomats said Father Aristide and General Cedras, enemies whose political stalemate has long had a bitter personal edge to it, would engage in direct talks only after significant progress had been made on terms for the passage of power.
Diplomats involved in the talks said they were cautiously optimistic about a breakthrough in the wake of the new United Nations sanctions, which are intended to block oil and arms supplies to the country and freeze the assets of supporters of the coup against Father Aristide.
A former Haitian official with close ties to the military said today that the armed forces had grown "extremely worried" about their ability to hold on to power in the face of the sanctions and had come to New York to "save their own skins."
The former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that word had been spread among army officers in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, that if General Cedras were arrested or not allowed to return to Haiti, as has been rumored, "everyone in the Lavalas movement should be rounded up" in retaliation. Lavalas, whose name comes from the Creole word for flood, is Father Aristide's political movement.
According to Haitian business executives with close ties to the Army, General Cedras, who has been offered an amnesty by Father Aristide, came to New York still hoping that he could preserve a place for himself in the Army. Failing that, they said, the general will seek some say over any shake-up or restructuring of the military. Diplomats and advisers to Father Aristide have said that they see no prospect of an arrangement that preserves a military role for General Cedras.
 
'Attempting a Dialogue'
 As he left Haiti for New York on Saturday, General Cedras said in a televised interview, "What we are attempting to do is to have a dialogue with him to see not only a proposal for his return, but to propose conditions by which he is to return, and in fact if that return can be possible."
Since his overthrow, Father Aristide has insisted on the removal of General Cedras from the armed forces. In recent months he has said the entire Haitian high command should be removed, along with the chief of police, as part of any settlement.
Diplomats said that two of the stickiest points of the negotiations, if the hurdle of General Cedras's resignation can be cleared, will be the restructuring of the armed forces and the naming of a new Government.
Haiti's Army-backed Prime Minister resigned this month, and some diplomats have expressed a concern that the sudden removal of all of the high command now would create a potentially unstable situation.

Worshipers Beaten in Haiti
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 27 (Reuters) -- Soldiers burst into a service at one of the city's largest churches today and began beating parishioners who held posters in support of Father Aristide, the state television reported.
The violence, at the church of Notre Dame, happened as the television was broadcasting a Mass in honor of Port-au-Prince's patron saint.
A few minutes after the beatings began, the television interrupted its transmission and rebroadcast a speech that General Cedras made on the eve of his departure for New York for talks with Father Aristide.
A priest at the church said at least 10 people had been arrested by soldiers in the incident.
Witnesses told the Haitian Press Agency that several elderly people were among those beaten by soldiers and armed civilians.
The incident began after some parishioners at the mass pulled out posters in support of Father Aristide and began shouting: "Long live Aristide! Down with the Army!"

HEADLINE: Deficit Taking Toll on Lawmakers' Dreams of Big-Science Projects

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
It took more than strutting astronauts and brilliant astrophysicists to spawn the miracles of moon walking, microchips and satellite communications. Congress wrote the checks.
But now the ink is running out. 
 The overwhelming House vote on Thursday to junk the Superconducting Supercollider proton-smasher was only the latest sign that the political consensus in favor of big science, wilting for years, has now virtually collapsed.
Only the day before, the House endorsed the remodeled smaller-scale Freedom Space Station by a single vote, and there is no assurance that the House will not reverse itself when it votes again on the program on Monday. The Senate is still a booster of space travel, but support is dwindling there, too.
 
Shift in Priorities
 Simply put, the very lawmakers who came of age marveling at "Star Trek" and "The Right Stuff" have scaled back their dreams of shaping the universe with space colonies across the galaxy. The Age of Tang has given way to the Age of Perot, and the budget deficit is the new target of choice.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a freshman Democrat from Manhattan, noted the reluctance with which he voted against the space station by saying he had designed amateur rockets as a teen-ager. "But with a $4 trillion national debt, difficult choices must be made," he continued. "It simply does not rise to a high-enough priority level to compete with social service."
Actually, the shift in priorities has been long in the making. Twenty-five years ago, Congressional appropriations for scientific research made up 5.2 percent of the Federal budget, compared with 1.7 percent this year. In the meantime, programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security that provide automatic benefits to everyone meeting certain criteria have ballooned to half of the budget.
"There is no lobby for the future," grumbled Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, the most prominent supporter in the Senate of the space station and the supercollider, which is being built in his state.
 
Jobs at Stake
 Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake in the two programs, which explains their bases of support in California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas, where the projects are being assembled. But while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Energy Department have tried to spread out the contracts to as many states as possible -- often sacrificing efficiency for political expediency -- big science has only marginal economic importance to most states.
In the big-science heyday of the 1960's, jobs and other economic factors were not the primary incentives for exploration and development. Just as World War II gave a huge boost to nuclear research, the cold war set a national priority to beat the Soviets to the Moon and beyond. President John F. Kennedy blew the clarion call, and Republicans and Democrats followed as a matter of patriotism.
But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the defense applications of space and physics research now far less urgent, lawmakers are forced to grapple with the pure scientific pros and cons. Only a few members of Congress are scientists, and most come to Washington with only the faintest understanding of high-energy physics.
That makes the big, expensive projects hard to sell, especially when they are plagued by annual cost overruns.
 
Weighing Theoretical Benefits
 What is the supercollider, and what is it supposed to do?
Based 30 feet under the cotton fields and cattle pastures around Waxahachie, Tex., it was planned as a 54-mile oval tunnel with giant magnets designed to smash protons against each other. With any luck, it could discover new sub-atomic particles that could provide clues to the origins of the universe and lead to advances in superconductivity.
Many physicists hope that such advances could provide several spinoff benefits, from elevated, high-velocity trains to improved imaging for medical diagnostics. But, liberals ask, what about the homeless who crowd our cities? And conservatives wonder, how can a $11 billion ditch with annual budget overruns be justified when higher taxes are strangling small business and the middle class?
"We're expected to keep shoveling money into this project without even knowing how big a hole in the budget it represents," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the Republican from upstate New York who led the House forces against the project in the floor debate. "The benefits are distant, theoretical and limited."
Most House members agreed with Mr. Boehlert, and the project was defeated 280 to 150, a margin so resounding that it has already had repercussions in the Senate, where support for the project is wider but increasingly shaky. The Senate is expected to vote narrowly in favor of the supercollider in late summer, but it is highly doubtful that a House-Senate conference committee can resurrect it.
 
Backing for Humans in Space
 The $25 billion space station is easier to sell, not only because it provides more jobs in more states than the supercollider but also because space still captures lawmakers' imagination.
Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, and Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, agree on little else but that the Government must continue to finance manned space travel.
"The space station will provide the opportunity for a permanent human presence in space," Mr. Gephardt said on the House floor before Wednesday's vote. "Investments in aeronautics and space programs are necessary to maintain our country's high-technology leadership and provide jobs."
Mr. Gingrich's imagery was downright cosmic. "The amount of money we are going to spend today is not decisive to the national debt, but it is decisive to our future in the universe," he said. "Fifteen years from now, when your children watch a Russian, or a Chinese, or a Japanese, or a European in space, and there is no American there, on this day you sealed our fate for a generation."
With all their combined fire power, the two leaders could manage only a single-vote victory, 216 to 215, authorizing the space station in Wednesday's vote. The House will reconsider the issue on Monday in a more critical appropriations vote, and a reversal is possible.
If so, the Senate is expected to save the project, at least for this year. But even proponents concede that prospects do not look bright for a project that is not due for completion until the turn of the century -- unless the budget deficit is brought under control.

HEADLINE: Cliffhanger: Can Early Movies Be Saved in Time?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
The art of the cinema may be forever, but the film stock is not. A four-volume report released late last week by the Library of Congress offers, for the first time, a comprehensive survey of film preservation in the United States by film studios, archives and individuals.
Entitled "Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation," the report describes a losing battle against time, with inadequately financed preservationists racing to fend off the threat posed by deterioration of film stock and to reconstruct the original versions of films that have been altered over time. 
 The task is formidable, and formidably expensive. And much damage is irreparable. Fewer than 20 percent of the feature films made in the 1920's and about 10 percent of the feature films made from 1910 to 1920 survive in complete form, the report states. Most simply crumbled to powder because the film stock until the early 1950's was nitrate-based.
 
Of Vinegar Syndrome
 For years, preservationists have transferred nitrate films to so-called safety film, on an acetate base. It turns out, though, that when subjected to extreme fluctuations in temperature and humidity, safety film is susceptible to a damaging chemical reaction called vinegar syndrome, in which the film base becomes unstable to the point that the film can no longer be run through a projector.
Although a much higher percentage of films from the sound era survives, those, too, face inevitable deterioration, because the color in Eastman film and its derivatives, introduced in 1953 and universally adopted by the film industry, fades over time to a uniform magenta. The process can be slowed but not halted, and for archivists to recreate a pristine color master print costs about $40,000 a film.
Chemistry is not the only problem. Films can undergo strange transformations over time. "We recently restored 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' " said David Francis, the director of the library's motion picture, broadcasting and recorded-sound division. "In the negative there were sections that had been blown up from 16-millimeter and inserted to replace parts of the original that had been destroyed." Researchers at the library chased down prints of the film and extracted the correct 35-millimeter versions of the interpolated film.
"Most people see older films on TV and don't see the real problems, but with the advent of high-definition TV you'll see many more of the faults," said Mr. Francis.
 
What Has Happened
 At the Museum of Modern Art, archivists have faced formidable problems in recreating the original release versions of D. W. Griffith's films. Griffith owned the rights to his films and often cut them up to make shorter films.
"Sometimes, pieces of the film are deposited in different places around the world," said Mary Lea Bandy, the director of the film department at the Museum of Modern Art, which has recently restored "His Girl Friday" and "On the Waterfront."
"You go back to the earliest surviving material, assemble everything from script to soundtrack to negative and you analyze it and recreate the original full-length version."
Mr. Francis said one unexpected finding in the report was the large number of American silent films in archives in Eastern Europe and Russia. These amount to about a third of all surviving silent-era films, to which European distributors acquired foreign rights and eventually donated to archives. The studios that made the films simply lost interest in the material with the arrival of sound films.
"The worst problem of all is newsreels," Mr. Francis said. "Very few of those are in archives. The collections are mainly used by stock-shop companies, so our entire newsreel heritage is in danger."
 
Which Films Suffer
 He continued: "It's often the orphans, as we call them, that suffer most: avant-garde films, newsreels, documentaries and silent films that no longer have value as an asset for companies that produced them."
In the meantime, Government money for film preservation, given out in the form of matching grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, has fallen to half its 1980 level, when dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation, the report states. Over the same period, the cost of preserving a 90-minute black-and-white silent feature has risen from $4,000 to more than $10,000.
The report was called for in by the National Film Preservation Act of 1992 and has information gained from public hearings, interviews and published documents and written statements from more than 100 organizations and individuals involved in film preservation. It is intended to provide an informational and analytical base for drafting a national film preservation program to coordinate the preservation efforts of archivists and commercial film studios.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Slapping Saddam's Wrist

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The most sought-after document in the capital today is the "military options list" presented to President Clinton after the F.B.I. and C.I.A. determined that the Government of Iraq had tried to assassinate a former U.S. President.
What were the Clinton choices after he saw the solid evidence that Saddam had tried to exact vengeance for his Desert Storm defeat? Forget the unrealistic extremes of doing nothing, or of sending a half-million men back to the Middle East to finish George Bush's half-done job. 
 The real decision was this: Does our Commander in Chief respond by using our air power to seriously damage Saddam's war machine and economic base -- setting back all hopes of recovery by years -- and driving home the lesson to state terrorists from Baghdad to Teheran to Khartoum that American retaliation will be swift and fierce? Or does he respond by making a solemn speech that hypes a pinprick action?
Mr. Clinton chose from among the weakest military options.
He could have ordered air strikes on the suspected new missile factories, chemical plants and nuclear facilities that Saddam is refusing to let U.N. inspectors see, and crippled the air defenses that now illuminate our patrollers in the no-fly zone.
He could have directed U.S. bombers located in Turkey to devastate Saddam's Republican Guard, source of his dictatorial power, now lined up in tanks and armored vehicles threatening the Kurds and Shiites.
He could have turned out the lights in Iraq and set back its oil-production capacity, which -- combined with a reduction of his Republican Guard and the arming of the anti-Saddam forces in the North -- could endanger the regime itself.
Not one of these reactions required U.N. approval; the murder plot was against a U.S. President. But Mr. Clinton chose the course that Stewart Alsop used to label "phony-tough": He threw a score of missiles at a building after its officials had left for the day.
This restraint was promptly embraced by doves: Representatives Pat Shroeder and Lee Hamilton hailed the risk-free demonstration of technology as "proportionate," as if the life of a U.S. President is worth one medium-sized office building.
But when one head of state tries to murder another, that is an act of war. If clear evidence had shown that Fidel Castro ordered the killing of President Kennedy, President Johnson would surely have used military force to depose the regime in Havana. (Target Bush's reaction to the anemic Clinton response was to say he supported our troops -- which, translated, means thanks a bunch.)
The National Security Council recommendation was camera-driven, not mission-driven. Clinton aides were more concerned with pictures of civilian casualties than with making an impact on the power reality in Iraq and the region. "We didn't want the story the next day to be a parade of dead secretaries," a triumphant Administration spokesman told me.
While the White House concentrated on how any military response would play on television screens, nobody put our invitation to respond unilaterally into a strategic context.
Saddam (and Syria's Assad) are sponsoring their terrorist Kurdish faction's assault on Turks in Europe and in Turkey, fostering tension in Germany among Turkish and Kurdish guest workers, keeping Turkey in turmoil.
Saddam has a plan and Clinton does not. This would have been the moment for the U.S. to crack back creatively. While our air force pounded Saddam's elite guard from bases in Turkey, our diplomats should have been forging an alliance of the new government in Ankara with the great majority of responsible Kurds to force out Saddam.
Maybe that's too complicated for the new team; maybe it thinks its pitiful wristslap will be taken for serious resolve; or maybe it thinks we can deal with state-sponsored terrorists by sending them a "proportionate" message rather than teaching them an unforgettable lesson.
If our anti-terrorist policy is to send messages circumscribed by what is to appear on screen, then Saddam and similar potentates will get the feeble Clinton message all too well: There is little risk in trying to assassinate a U.S. President or knock out a U.S. city.

HEADLINE: Bring Russia and Ukraine Into NATO Together;
Economic, Not Ethnic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Ukraine Lawmakers Balk at Anti-Crisis Plan" (news article, June 16) calls Ukraine's Donbas, where an explosion of strikes has occurred, a region where a majority of the population is ethnically Russian. 
 Actually, Russians are a minority in the Donbas (44 percent, according to the 1989 census), as they are in every region of Ukraine except the Crimea. It is true that the Donbas is a primarily Russian-speaking area, but as recent findings from my own study in Ukraine make clear, political attitudes between ostensibly Russified Ukrainians and the Russian ethnic minorities themselves are as sharp as they are divisive. You reported this last Nov. 8.
This may not bode well for the future integration into the Ukrainian state of the Russians who live in southeast Ukraine and the Crimea, as President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine is undoubtedly aware. But it also underlines that the instability in Ukraine is less an issue of dissatisfied Russians rising up against the Ukrainian Government than of disgruntled Russians and Ukrainians living under an economy in even worse shape than that of their Russian neighbors.
If Ukraine is to "slide into dictatorship" as Ukraine's Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma has so ominously warned, it will not be because of ethnic conflict.

HEADLINE: Blacks Rejecting Gay Rights As a Battle Equal to Theirs

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Ronald Prince has lived a gay life since his mid-teens. Now 43, he readily recalls moments when he hid his homosexuality rather than face public ridicule.
"In high school, when students would poke fun at 'faggots' or 'sissies,' I wouldn't speak up," he said. "I'd go along with the crowd." The facade he kept up included disguising what he considered potentially effeminate mannerisms. 
 He could conceal his homosexuality. He could not conceal his race. Mr. Prince, who lives in Manhattan, is black.
"A lot of times when you're black and gay, you don't know whether the discrimination is due to your blackness or your gayness," said Mr. Prince, who grew up in Birmingham, Ala., when it was segregated. He said he was called "nigger" and spat upon in white sections of town in the mid-1960's.
Mr. Prince said he had learned to live with the dichotomy that is his life. But like many other blacks, he is angry that leaders of the gay rights movement and some prominent blacks draw parallels between the civil rights struggle of the 60's and homosexuals' fight now for legal and social equality. The debate has intensified since the gay rights march in Washington in April.
Although some conservative blacks oppose homosexuality on religious grounds, many other blacks support legislation to guarantee equal rights for homosexuals. Still, many blacks draw the line at likening racism to anti-gay sentiment.
"A lot of blacks are upset that the feminist movement has pimped off the black movement," said Lou Palmer, who is black and has a call-in show on radio station WVON-AM in Chicago. "Now here comes the gay movement. Blacks resent it very much, because they do not see a parallel, nor do I."
In more than two dozen interviews with people on all sides of the issue, several blacks said that the discrimination that homosexuals experience was not on a level with racism.
Many homosexuals say, almost apologetically, that they do not mean to trivialize the black experience in America by likening the two groups' histories. But they argue that discrimination is discrimination.
 
'Oppression Has Many Faces'
 "I am a white gay man," said Thomas B. Stoddard, a leading gay-rights lawyer and the coordinator for the Campaign for Military Service, a group lobbying to allow homosexuals in the military. "I know I've had privileges that black gay men do not have."
He added, however, "I also know as a person who feels the scorn and discrimination of others that oppression has many faces."
But by comparing the two groups' sufferings, some blacks said, homosexuals are misappropriating the spirit and legacy of the black civil rights movement.
"I consider it offensively disrespectful of the recorded and unchronicled sufferings of millions of my people who were kidnapped, chained, shipped and sold like livestock," Vernon Jarrett, who is black and a columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, wrote in an April 25 column. "Gays were never declared three-fifths human by the Constitution."
Social historians say that there are similarities in the struggles against discrimination, but that there are also very real differences. Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College and the author of "Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal" (Scribner's, 1992), said: "By every measure I have seen, race runs deeper and does more damage than any other bias. While some white Americans may have cause for complaints, they still have the built-in advantage of not being black." Mr. Hacker is white.
Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who was an Assistant Attorney General in the 1960's, said many of the arguments used to fight the integration of the military in 1948 are being used today against homosexuals.
"They said we were too promiscuous, were cowardly and lazy," said Mr. Wilkins, who is black. "Some of the same things are being said about gays. There are all kinds of soldiers who are lazy, cowardly and promiscuous, and it has nothing to do with race or sexual orientation."
 
Hiding From Discrimination
 Mary Frances Berry, a member of the Federal Commission on Civil Rights and a professor of history and law at the University of Pennsylvania, said that anti-gay bias was clearly discrimination, but that being black in America was not the same as being gay. "When people try to equate the two," said Ms. Berry, who is black, "all they do is offend some black folks who recognize that it is not the same thing and might be willing to be supportive."
Even some blacks who acknowledged a common bond with the plight of homosexuals said they were unsympathetic to gay people, especially gay white men, who hid their sexual orientation as long as it was politically, economically and socially beneficial to do so.
"I can't go in a closet and hang up my race when it's convenient," said Vernetta Adams, a 24-year-old history major at the University of the District of Columbia. Ms. Adams is black and heterosexual. "Gays hid in the closet when they wanted to advance. Now they're out and demanding rights and yelling 'discrimination.' "
 
Religious Questions
 For years, many blacks, including members of the clergy, have, because of religion and race, distanced themselves from homosexuals and their struggle for acceptance. Among them are those who view homosexuality as deviant and morally wrong, and others who hold that the gay rights movement has been led by whites.
"They are asking to be recognized lawfully as a minority because homosexuality is immutable," said the Rev. Lester James, pastor of Zion Hill Baptist Church in Washington. "We say, 'No.' We will not agree to them saying they're just like us. Yes, Dr. King talked about loving everybody. We have not abdicated that. I believe God loves the individual homosexual, but He hates the homosexual life style."
Some view the comparison to racism as an act of desperation among homosexuals, who lack the strength in numbers of other groups subjected to discrimination, like women and blacks. Many sociologists estimate the size of the country's gay population at roughly 4 percent, though that and other estimates have been subjects of much debate.
Several blacks said insult was added to injury when prominent blacks like the Rev. Jesse Jackson and civil rights groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People not only voiced support for homosexuals but also stood before the marchers last April and referred to the 1963 march on Washington led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 
Mrs. King's Letter
 But many of those who marched on Washington 30 years ago, including Coretta Scott King, argue that failing to speak out against bigotry dishonors King's name and legacy. Mrs. King, for example, recently wrote a letter to Congress calling the military's ban on homosexuals "un-American."
And Mr. Jackson, speaking at the gay rights march in April, said: "Discrimination is discrimination. We're not talking about behavior; we're talking about status."
Dr. William Gibson, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., who also addressed the marchers, echoed Mr. Jackson's sentiment. "I felt it was right for the N.A.A.C.P. to be represented there," he said, "because our tradition, objective and constitution is the elimination of segregation and discrimination in all walks of life, for all citizens of this country."
The Rev. Lou Sheldon, an outspoken critic of homosexuality who heads the Traditional Values Coalition, which says that it is affiliated with 27,000 churches nationwide, said many of its black members were "absolutely outraged" that black civil rights leaders had endorsed the gay rights movement.
 
'Not a Civil Rights Issue'
 "The reason gays are making parallels," Mr. Sheldon said, "is that it may bring empathy from white men like me, who feel a collective sense of guilt about the way blacks have been treated. The fact remains that this is not a civil rights issue but a moral issue."
Caught in the middle of the argument are black homosexuals.
"There's always this debate within the lesbian and gay community: 'Are you black first or are you gay first?' " said Nadine Smith, an organizer of the April gay rights march who is black. "You can't stop being one. We've done that too long. Saying: 'I'm going to be black when I go to the N.A.A.C.P. meeting, so I'll stop being gay right now.' Or, 'I'm going to sit in on the Gay Pride community meeting, so I'm going to stop being black.' "
 
Racism Among Gays
 Black homosexuals also recognize that there is racism among homosexuals themselves. "There are all-white gay clubs, all-black gay clubs, Latino gay clubs," said Perry Watkins, a former Army sergeant who was one of two grand marshals of New York's gay pride parade yesterday. "Racism within the gay community is a big problem. The primary reason is that we are a direct reflection of the society from which we come, which is controlled by white males. When the gay community was formed and became political, the leaders were white men, and they brought their prejudices with them."
Mr. Watkins said none of the "anointed leadership" within the gay movement had asked him to lend his voice and support to the fight to allow homosexuals in the military, even though he was the only openly gay serviceman to have successfully challenged the military's anti-gay policy. He acknowledged his homosexuality when he was drafted in 1967 and was twice allowed to re-enlist before being discharged in 1984, after regulations were changed to bar all homosexuals from the military. In 1991 Mr. Watkins won a landmark lawsuit against the Army that resulted in his reinstatement, a promotion and his retiring with credit for 21 years of service.
Despite their differences with homosexuals on issues of civil rights, many blacks, including nearly all those interviewed for this article, support guarantees of equal rights for gay people. According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,154 adults conducted Feb. 9-11, 53 percent of blacks thought such legislation was necessary, as against only 40 percent of whites. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Many homosexuals see such support as a sign that on some level, blacks do understand the gay struggle and relate to their cause.
As Mr. Stoddard put it: "To a large degree we are bound together by our opponents. Those who hate blacks hate gay people, hate Jews and abuse women, and fighting on behalf of any of us will ultimately lead to the liberation of all of us."

HEADLINE: Barneys Takes On Uptown Set

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Over the last month at Bloomingdale's flagship store on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, workers have installed gleaming white marble steps to replace the worn, scuffed black flights that have linked the ground floor to the bustling mezzanine level for 15 years.
The stairs are perhaps the most telling evidence of the consternation wrinkling the brows of the merchants running the luxurious stores in one of the world's most fabled shopping districts, the area centered on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. 
 Having just sweated out the recent recession, these retailers are confronted with another threat: the arrival on Sept. 8 of a 230,000-square-foot Barneys New York at Madison Avenue and 61st Street.
"They're swabbing the decks of the battleships in preparation for the battle royal," said Alan G. Millstein, editor of the Fashion Network Report, a garment industry newsletter.
 
Renovation at Saks
 Bloomingdale's is not alone in its efforts. Saks Fifth Avenue, 11 blocks from the new store, has just completed a renovation of its men's store, aware of the Barneys reputation for having the broadest, deepest range of men's clothing in the country.
Little more than two years old, Bergdorf Goodman Men at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street seems most vulnerable to the uptown invasion by Barneys. But Bergdorf's chairman, Burton Tansky, is undaunted. "The bulk of their business is being done at price points below ours," he said, explaining that suits at Bergdorf's start at $750.
Across the street in its women's store, however, Bergdorf tore apart the entire fifth floor, and redid it with a dramatic interior design stocked with less expensive, hip clothing. Intentionally or not, the new department would seem to appeal to the younger, trendier customers who have flocked to the main Barneys store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street. The sixth floor at Bergdorf, which housed dresses, is getting a major face-lift, and the main, second and fourth floors have all received attention over the last year.
Jeffrey Sherman, president of Bloomingdale's, said the new stairs were part of a five-year renovation project, although he did concede that perhaps a few fixes had been added in anticipation of Barneys' arrival.
He said the impending opening has brought out the best in its competitors. "To the extent that a customer goes there it is not because Barneys will do things better, it's because Bloomingdale's won't be doing something right," he said. "We intend not to let that happen."
But Gene and Bob Pressman, the grandsons of Barney Pressman, the store's founder, and the orchestrators of the company's growth, contend that Barneys can bring something different to a district that probably has the highest density of Chanel suits for sale of any place in the world. "We're not derivative," Gene Pressman said.
He is certain that contrary to the prevailing wisdom (laced with not a little bit of wishfulness), the new store will not cannibalize sales in the Chelsea store, where comparable sales were up 14 percent in the fiscal year that ended last month. According to the company, which is privately held, sales exceeded $250 million in the last fiscal year and will be at least $400 million in the current fiscal year, which ends next May.
 
Study of Customers
 Bob Pressman said a study of customers showed that about one-third of them live within 20 blocks. Roughly another third are suburbanites, drawn in part by something no other large retailer in the city offers: free parking. The other third journey from various points, whether the Upper East Side, Los Angeles or Tokyo.
Bob Pressman said that fewer than 10 percent of the customers in Chelsea were tourists, whom he regards as a prime target for the Madison Avenue store. The Pressmans also think the store will attract a significant number of Barneys neophytes.
Joseph H. Ellis, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company who is considered by many to be the pre-eminent retail analyst in the country, said the move uptown is vital to Barneys.
"They've made the location at 17th and Seventh a success by virtue of their outstanding merchandising," said Mr. Ellis, who helped Barneys put together the real estate partnership with Isetan, the Japanese retail giant, that has financed its growth.
"You can't realize the full potential of a headquarters business like that in a location that requires a fairly lengthy cab ride away from tourism, and where you can't compete directly with your true competitors," he said.
The new paint, fixtures and increased emphasis on customer service in the neighboring uptown stores are not the only evidence of fear. In late April, Women's Wear Daily reported that several designers like Ralph Lauren, Ungaro and Karl Lagerfeld, who also creates the Chanel line, were refusing to allow Barneys to sell their wares in its uptown store.
Some designers said they did not want the store to compete with their own boutiques in the area, a rather weak excuse, because almost every other large retailer there already carries their lines. And a few hinted that those retailers pressured them not to sell to the new Barneys.
All the merchants strongly deny the suggestion that they put the squeeze on their vendors. But some have been busy planting unflattering speculation about Barneys in reporters' and vendors' ears. They suggest that the company's 13 branch stores are not doing well, that building a store on Madison Avenue will kill its business downtown, that the delays in opening the Madison Avenue store, originally scheduled to open in the spring of 1992, signal a disaster.
Some even intimate that Barney Pressman, who opened Barneys in 1923 in a sliver of a store on the corner it now has in Chelsea, is turning over in his grave at the thought of his business moving uptown.
All of the chatter is pure speculation. Barneys is a privately held business, and Barney Pressman's descendants populate its ranks and fiercely guard information about its performance. And because family members are the only people who know the truth about their business, anything they say publicly about it is discounted by competitors as containing a good dose of self-promotion.
 
Help From the Family
 Gene and Bob Pressman run the business with considerable help from the rest of their family. The older brother, Gene, is energetic and passionate with an eagle's eye for unusual, tasteful merchandise. Bob is warm and thoughtful, with a talent for making sure Gene's merchandising dreams do not bankrupt the company. Gene typically throws faded jeans and white shirts on his lean frame; Bob dresses his somewhat fuller figure in beautifully tailored suits from -- need you ask? -- Barneys.
"On the one hand, we're complimented that people are paying so much attention to us," Gene Pressman said. "But on the other hand, what's so annoying is that it's nothing more than pure speculation, and most of it is wrong."
The dispute over whether designers would abandon Barneys is just one example, he said, noting that some of the names that have been mentioned are collections Barney never has carried, and suggesting that others are simply not welcome on Madison Avenue, where they are already in every major store.
Barneys, for example, only carries two mainstream designer bridge lines, DKNY and Calvin Klein, eschewing Anne Klein II, Ellen Tracy and others that are the backbones of most full-line stores' business. The company is known for striking exclusive deals with designers like Kazuko Oshima, who designs delicate jewelry studded with crystals, or Andra Gabrielle, who makes fantasy lingerie.
 
Private-Label Apparel
 It also has a formidable array of private-label apparel, made from fabrics produced by the same Italian manufacturers that supply top designers and assembled in the same factories. Private brands give retailers exclusive merchandise and higher profit margins.
With almost five years' experience at being a national retailer under their belt and 13 baby Barneys scattered around the country, the Pressmans have changed the original concept. They have expanded smaller 6,000-square-foot stores to 20,000 square feet, and now devote between 40 and 50 percent of the space to men.
"We had a strong following around the country, they wanted Barneys, and there was no way in a store that size that we could give them 17th Street," Gene Pressman said.
Excluding expanded and renovated space, Bob Pressman said, the branch stores' comparable sales for the 12 months that ended in May were up 13 percent over the previous year. "Every branch store contributes a profit to the bottom line," he said. "Their sales per square foot are higher than their competitors, although they're not all at our standards yet."
Nonetheless, the brothers have no plans to open more of the smaller stores, which were originally conceived as part of a 25- to 100-store chain. They plan to open a 125,000- square-foot store in Beverly Hills, Calif., next spring.
The Pressmans promise that the uptown store, which cost $100 million when the company bought the site and has been undergoing what is likely to be tens of millions of dollars of renovation, will set new standards.
The question, retailing experts say, is not whether the new Barneys will be successful. Most people without an axe to grind believe it will.
The question is whether it will be successful enough to recoup the Pressman's and Isetan's investment.
Bob Pressman's prediction: "That store will be profitable in one year."

HEADLINE: Space Station Survives a Second Time in Congress

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Responding to a vigorous White House lobbying campaign, the House tonight narrowly preserved financing for the Freedom Space Station.
The defeat of an amendment to kill the station virtually assures another year of construction for the $25 billion project, but its razor-thin margin of 196 to 220 means that the station is likely to face annual life-and-death battles as expensive science research continues to lose support among deficit-conscious lawmakers. 
 Through most of the day, House Democratic and Republican strategists estimated they were at least a dozen votes short of defeating the amendment. The space station was saved last week by a single vote as part of a separate bill authorizing broad financing outlines for the program.
Over the weekend, President Clinton softened his opposition to the program by telephoning several lawmakers to argue that the space station was vital to protect high-wage jobs and sustain the country's technological edge. Vice President Al Gore, a strong supporter of the space station since his days as a Senator, spent much of today calling House members and meeting with a dozen lawmakers who were wavering.
 
Bipartisan Support
 The vote was on an amendment to an appropriations bill financing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Federal agencies. Joining to defeat the amendment were 108 Democrats and 112 Republicans. Voting for the amendment, and therefore against the space station, were 140 Democrats, 55 Republicans and 1 independent.
The goal of launching a permanently staffed orbital laboratory has gradually lost Congressional support ever since it was proposed by the Reagan Administration a decade ago, when the cold war was still raging and the budget deficit was a secondary concern. Cost overruns have further dampened enthusiasm, although the program retains strong bipartisan support from the delegations of Alabama, California, Florida and Texas, the states where the aerospace industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The narrow victory today came less than a week after the House voted overwhelmingly to halt financing for the Superconducting Supercollider, the proton-smasher designed to discover the origins of the universe.
 
Images of Debate
 Two hours of emotional debate on the space program was based as much, if not more, on economics as on science. Opponents called the program space-age pork, while supporters viewed it as a gateway from a defense-based economy to a high-technology future.
"The space station is defense conversion," said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California. "This is an essential transition program."
Referring to years of cost overruns on the project, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said, "NASA has led the Congress by the nose on this issue. We've spent $9 billion, and we have nothing to show for it. This project should be put on the shelf until we can afford it."
The space station is designed to sustain a permanent manned presence in space to prepare for long-range manned space travel and permanent colonies in the far reaches of the galaxy.

HEADLINE: A Mission Accomplished

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The Presidential commission responsible for deciding which of the nation's military bases to close in an era of shrinking budgets has finished its work until 1995, and the conclusion seems to be that the system worked: politics operated only on the margins.
Of course, civic leaders and politicians from many communities that lost bases have expressed anger and dismay at the outcome. But it was precisely to spare Congress those expressions of rage -- more specifically, to spare individual lawmakers the politically impossible task of casting votes to close installations employing thousands of workers in their districts -- that the commission was created in the first place, three years ago. 
 Largely following the Pentagon's recommendations, the commission dealt out its share of winners and losers. And in the half-dozen major cases in which it did not follow the Defense Department's lead, the panel found demonstrable flaws in the military's judgment.
Under its charter, the commission was to consider a base's military value, its return on investment and the economic impact that a shutdown would have on the local community. But the panel's decisions appear to have ignored economic impact except in the most extreme cases, as in the San Francisco Bay area, where the commission threw a bone to communities with doomed bases.
 
Head Against Heart
 Local economics -- that is to say, politics, which had once stopped efforts to streamline the shrinking military -- was for the most part not an element in the equation.
To be sure, the seven commissioners were tempted at times to discard their mandate to close a base rendered useless by declining military budgets and instead to follow their hearts. Before voting to close the Navy base and shipyard in Charleston, S.C., for instance, each panelist gave a long, agonizing apology to a community that had mounted a $1 million lobbying campaign to preserve the city's naval tradition, which dates to the Revolutionary War, when Charleston twice repelled attacks by the British fleet.
Indeed, although the commissioners made their decisions on the basis of hard facts and figures, in the end it may have been these expressions of empathy that earned credibility. "People wanted to see them as monsters, but they pulled off a P.R. miracle in being seen as real people," said Keith Cunningham, an analyst with Business Executives for National Security, a policy group in Washington.
 
Five Days of Votes
 Further, senior Pentagon officials said today that the panel had actually improved on the military's recommendations. "Their decisions are quite constructive and even strengthen our proposals," said John Deutch, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, who is overseeing a Pentagon effort to improve the delivery of Government assistance to communities that lose bases.
The panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, on Sunday completed five days of votes in which it decided to close 27 major bases and to expand or shrink 11 others. By law, President Clinton now has until July 15 to approve or reject the panel's decisions as a whole; although he may recommend modifications to the commission, he may not impose them. Congress will then consider the plan. Given the reductions in military spending, approval is virtually certain.
The commission's proposals would make deep reductions affecting all branches of the armed services and virtually every region of the country. More than 120,000 military and civilian jobs would be eliminated or uprooted.
In the New York metropolitan region, New Jersey gained at New York's expense. The panel agreed to make McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey a major troop-staging center on the East Coast and to close Plattsburgh Air Force Base in upstate New York.
While closing huge Navy bases in Charleston and the San Francisco Bay area, the panel granted consolation prizes to each region to ease the economic pain: Oakland keeps a Navy supply center, and Charleston was made the East Coast center for naval electronics-systems engineering.
Even with the altering of the Pentagon's list, the commission's recommendations will come close to the $3.1 billion in annual savings after the year 2000 that Defense Secretary Les Aspin's list was expected to yield.
The commission will reconvene in 1995, most likely with a few members from this year's panel, to consider what many military officials say will be even more closings, particularly for the Army. It was unclear whether James A. Courter, the former New Jersey Congressman who presided over the commission in 1991 and 1993 to much praise, would return in 1995.
Unlike the first Presidential base commission, which in 1988 angered local communities by making its decisions in private, the current commission, both this year and in 1991, engaged in a process that was extraordinarily public.
The commissioners reviewed individual bases as many as five different times: in field visits, hearings, staff reports, Congressional testimony and then last week's final deliberations. Except for a handful of classified military briefings, all the hearings were open. Indeed, the commissioners so jealousy guarded the process's public nature that they avoided even dining together in a quorum.
Using a set of recommendations from Mr. Aspin as their starting point, the commission then added 73 comparable installations, most of them minor. But only two bases that the commission added, Plattsburgh Air Force Base and Agana Naval Air Station in Guam, were designated for closing.
"We certainly exposed a lot of communities to a lot of concern by putting them on the list," said one commissioner, Hansford T. Johnson, a retired four-star Air Force general. "But without doing that we wouldn't have been able to know the ones to close."
In fact, one of the few criticisms of the panel was that it did not close enough bases. By law, the commission had to make its decisions based on current troop levels; it was not permitted to anticipate the additional cuts that Mr. Clinton has pledged.
Although a few communities will undoubtedly fight the commission's decisions in court, most are already planning on new uses for their bases. "Now is the time to capitalize on the teamwork we've developed since February and focus on rebuilding our future and our lives in other ways," Elizabeth Inabinet, head of the Charleston Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From High Court's Opinions on Radial Gerrymandering

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision today in Shaw v. Reno, holding that an electoral district of a "bizarre" or "irrational" shape can amount to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, even if its purpose is to increase black representation. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter each filed a dissenting opinion.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice O'Connor
This case involves two of the most complex and sensitive issues this Court has faced in recent years: the meaning of the constitutional "right" to vote, and the propriety of race-based state legislation designed to benefit members of historically disadvantaged racial minority groups. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	The first of the two majority-black districts contained in the revised plan, District 1, is somewhat hook-shaped. Centered in the northeast portion of the State, it moves southward until it tapers to a narrow band; then, with finger-like extensions, it reaches far into the southernmost part of the State near the South Carolina border. . . . 
 The second majority-black district, District 12, is even more unusually shaped. It is approximately 160 miles long and, for much of its length, no wider than the I-85 corridor. It winds in snake-like fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas "until it gobbles in enough enclaves of black neighborhoods.". . .
The Attorney General did not object to the General Assembly's revised plan. But numerous North Carolinians did. The North Carolina Republican Party and individual voters brought suit in Federal District Court alleging that the plan constituted an unconstitutional political gerrymander under Davis v. Bandemer, (1986). That claim was dismissed, see Pope v. Blue, (WDNC 1992), and this Court summarily affirmed, ------ (1992).
Shortly after the complaint in Pope v. Blue was filed, appellants instituted the present action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Appellants alleged not that the revised plan constituted a political gerrymander, nor that it violated the "one person, one vote" principle, see Reynolds v. Sims, (1964), but that the State had created an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The three-judge District Court granted the federal Appellees' motion to dismiss. . . .
The majority first took judicial notice of a fact omitted from appellants' complaint: that appellants are white. It rejected the argument that race-conscious redistricting to benefit minority voters is per se unconstitutional. The majority also rejected appellants' claim that North Carolina's reapportionment plan was impermissible. . . . The purposes of favoring minority voters and complying with the Voting Rights Act are not discriminatory in the constitutional sense, the court reasoned, and majority-minority districts have an impermissibly discriminatory effect only when they unfairly dilute or cancel out white voting strength. Because the State's purpose here was to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and because the General Assembly's plan did not lead to proportional underrepresentation of white voters statewide, the majority concluded that appellants had failed to state an equal protection claim.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It is unsettling how closely the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past.
An understanding of the nature of appellants' claim is critical to our resolution of the case. In their complaint, appellants did not claim that the General Assembly's reapportionment plan unconstitutionally "diluted" white voting strength. They did not even claim to be white. Rather, appellants' complaint alleged that the deliberate segregation of voters into separate districts on the basis of race violated their constitutional right to participate in a "color-blind" electoral process.
Despite their invocation of the ideal of a "color-blind" Constitution, see Plessy v. Ferguson, (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting), appellants appear to concede that race-conscious redistricting is not always unconstitutional. That concession is wise: This Court never has held that race-conscious state decision-making is impermissible in all circumstances. What appellants object to is redistricting legislation that is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that appellants have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted under the Equal Protection Clause.
The Equal Protection Clause provides that "(n)o State shall. . .deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, Sections 1. Its central purpose is to prevent the States from purposefully discriminating between individuals on the basis of race. Laws that explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds fall within the core of that prohibition.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race "are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality." They threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility. . . . Accordingly, we have held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires state legislation that expressly distinguishes among citizens because of their race to be narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.

 	 	 		. . .	 	At issue in Wright (v. Rockefeller, 1964) were four districts contained in a New York apportionment statute. The plaintiffs alleged that the statute excluded nonwhites from one district and concentrated them in the other three. Every member of the Court assumed that the plaintiffs' allegation that the statute "segregate(d) eligible voters by race and place of origin" stated a constitutional claim. The Justices disagreed only as to whether the plaintiffs had carried their burden of proof at trial. The dissenters thought the unusual shape of the district lines could "be explained only in racial terms." The majority, however, accepted the District Court's finding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the districts were in fact drawn on racial lines. Although the boundary lines were somewhat irregular, the majority reasoned, they were not so bizarre as to permit of no other conclusion. Indeed, because most of the nonwhite voters lived together in one area, it would have been difficult to construct voting districts without concentrations of nonwhite voters.
Wright illustrates the difficulty of determining from the face of a single-member districting plan that it purposefully distinguishes between voters on the basis of race. A reapportionment statute typically does not classify persons at all; it classifies tracts of land, or addresses. Moreover, redistricting differs from other kinds of state decision-making in that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of age, economic status, religious and political persuasion, and a variety of other demographic factors. That sort of race consciousness does not lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination.
The difficulty of proof, of course, does not mean that a racial gerrymander, once established, should receive less scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause than other state legislation classifying citizens by race. Moreover, it seems clear to us that proof sometimes will not be difficult at all. In some exceptional cases, a reapportionment plan may be so highly irregular that, on its face, it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to "segregat(e). . . voters" on the basis of race. So, too, would be a case in which a State concentrated a dispersed minority population in a single district by disregarding traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions. We emphasize that these criteria are important not because they are constitutionally required (they are not), but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines. . . .
Put differently, we believe that reapportionment is one area in which appearances do matter. A reapportionment plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to the same race, but who are otherwise widely separated by geographical and political boundaries, and who may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin, bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.

 	 	 		. . .	 	For these reasons, we conclude that a plaintiff challenging a reapportionment statute under the Equal Protection Clause may state a claim by alleging that the legislation, though race-neutral on its face, rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race, and that the separation lacks sufficient justification. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether or how a reapportionment plan that, on its face, can be explained in nonracial terms successfully could be challenged. Thus, we express no view as to whether "the intentional creation of majority-minority districts, without more" always gives rise to an equal-protection claim. We hold only that, on the facts of this case, plaintiffs have stated a claim sufficient to defeat the state appellees' motion to dismiss.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Racial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society. They reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin. Racial classifications with respect to voting carry particular dangers. Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions; it threatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters. . .
 
FROM THE DISSENTS
By Justice Souter
Today, the Court recognizes a new cause of action under which a State's electoral redistricting plan that includes a configuration "so bizarre," that it "rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race (without) sufficient justification," will be subjected to strict scrutiny. In my view there is no justification for the Court's determination to depart from our prior decisions. . .
Until today, the Court has analyzed equal-protection claims involving race in electoral districting differently from equal-protection claims involving other forms of governmental conduct . . .
As long as members of racial groups have the commonality of interest implicit in our ability to talk about concepts like "minority voting strength," and "dilution of minority votes," and as long as racial-bloc voting takes place, legislators will have to take race into account in order to avoid dilution of minority voting strength in the districting plans they adopt. One need look no further than the Voting Rights Act to understand that this may be required, and we have held that race may constitutionally be taken into account in order to comply with that Act.
A second distinction between districting and most other governmental decisions in which race has figured is that those other decisions using racial criteria characteristically occur in circumstances in which the use of race to the advantage of one person is necessarily at the obvious expense of a member of a different race. . . .
In districting, by contrast, the mere placement of an individual in one district instead of another denies no one a right or benefit provided to others.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Under our cases there is in general a requirement that in order to obtain relief under the Fourteenth Amendment, the purpose and effect of the districting must be to devalue the effectiveness of a voter compared to what, as a group member, he would otherwise be able to enjoy. . . .
If a cognizable harm like dilution or the abridgment of the right to participate in the electoral process is shown, the districting plan violates the Fourteenth Amendment. If not, it does not. Under this approach, in the absence of an allegation of such cognizable harm, there is no need for further scrutiny because a gerrymandering claim cannot be proven without the element of harm.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Court offers no adequate justification for treating the narrow category of bizarrely shaped district claims differently from other districting claims.
 
By Justice Blackmun
I join JUSTICE WHITE's dissenting opinion. The conscious use of race in redistricting does not violate the Equal Protection Clause unless the effect of the redistricting plan is to deny a particular group equal access to the political process or to minimize its voting strength unduly. It is particularly ironic that the case in which today's majority chooses to abandon settled law and to recognize for the first time this "analytically distinct" constitutional claim, ante, at 21, is a challenge by white voters to the plan under which North Carolina has sent black representatives to Congress for the first time since Reconstruction.
 
By Justice Stevens
For the reasons stated by JUSTICE WHITE, the decision of the District Court should be affirmed. I add these comments to emphasize that the two critical facts in this case are undisputed: first, the shape of District 12 is so bizarre that it must have been drawn for the purpose of either advantaging or disadvantaging a cognizable group of voters; and, second, regardless of that shape, it was drawn for the purpose of facilitating the election of a second black representative from North Carolina.
These unarguable facts, which the Court devotes most of its opinion to proving, give rise to three constitutional questions: Does the Constitution impose a requirement of contiguity or compactness on how the States may draw their electoral districts? Does the Equal Protection Clause prevent a State from drawing district boundaries for the purpose of facilitating the election of a member of an identifiable group of voters? And, finally, if the answer to the second question is generally "No," should it be different when the favored group is defined by race?
The first question is easy. There is no independent constitutional requirement of compactness or contiguity, and the Court's opinion (despite its many references to the shape of District 12) does not suggest otherwise.. . . .
As for the second question, I believe that the Equal Protection Clause is violated when the State creates the kind of uncouth district boundaries seen in Karcher v. Daggett, (1983), Gomillion v. Lightfoot, (1960), and this case, for the sole purpose of making it more difficult for members of a minority group to win an election. The duty to govern impartially is abused when a group with power over the electoral process defines electoral boundaries solely to enhance its own political strength at the expense of any weaker group. That duty, however, is not violated when the majority acts to facilitate the election of a member of a group that lacks such power. . . The difference between constitutional and unconstitutional gerrymanders has nothing to do with whether they are based on assumptions about the groups they affect, but whether their purpose is to enhance the power of the group in control of the districting process at the expense of any minority group, and thereby to strengthen the unequal distribution of electoral power.
If it is permissible to draw boundaries to provide adequate representation for rural voters, for union members, for Hasidic Jews, for Polish Americans, or for Republicans, it necessarily follows that it is permissible to do the same thing for members of the very minority group whose history in the United States gave birth to the Equal Protection Clause. . . .
 
By Justice White
The facts of this case mirror those presented in United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, (1977) (UJO), where the Court rejected a claim that creation of a majority-minority district violated the Constitution, either as a per se matter or in light of the circumstances leading to the creation of such a district. Of particular relevance, five of the Justices reasoned that members of the white majority could not plausibly argue that their influence over the political process had been unfairly cancelled, or that such had been the State's intent. Accordingly they held that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. On the same reasoning, I would affirm the district court's dismissal of appellants' claim in this instance.

Chart: "Of Race and Voting Rights"
Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina's Congressional redistricting might violate the rights of white voters. The decision was based on a challenge to the 12th District, one of two drawn to help elect blacks to Congress in 1992. The other is the First.
 "The existence of bizarre and uncouth district boundaries is powerful evidence of an ulterior purpose behind the shaping of those boundaries. . . Such evidence will always be useful in cases that lack other evidence of invidious intent. In this case, however, we know that the legislators' purpose was: The North Carolina Legislature drew District 12 to include a majority of African-American voters." -- Justice John Paul Stevens
 "It is unsettling how closely the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past . . . Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions." -- Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
 "I love the distirct because I can drive down I-85 with both car doors open and hit every person in the district. -- Mickey Michaux, Congressional candidate in the 12th District.
 "If you look at redistricting maps around the country you see an awful lot of bizarre shapes. What makes this decision so troubling is that it seems to rest on whether or not the district is compact, for which there is no objective standard." -- Frank Parker of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law

HEADLINE: THESUPREME COURT: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Put Judges in Charge of Deciding Reliability of Scientific Testimony

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
Ruling for the first time on the place of scientific evidence in Federal courtrooms, the Supreme Court today established Federal judges as active gatekeepers charged with insuring that "any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable."
The 7-to-2 decision invited judges to be aggressive in screening out ill-founded or speculative scientific theories. The Court held that judges should focus on the reasoning or methodology behind the scientific testimony, rather than on whether the conclusions of an expert witness have won general acceptance. 
 "We are confident that Federal judges possess the capacity to undertake this review," Justice Harry A. Blackmun said in the majority opinion.
In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist warned that the decision would require judges to become "amateur scientists," adding that the majority opinion was phrased in terms too general and abstract to guide the judges. Justice John Paul Stevens signed the dissenting opinion.
 
Case of Expert Testimony
 The decision came in an appeal of a lawsuit over whether a drug once widely prescribed for morning sickness during pregnancy caused birth defects. Two lower Federal courts in California had dismissed the lawsuit, brought by two families against Marion Merrell Dow, the maker of the drug, Bendectin.
The lower courts ruled that the expert testimony the plaintiffs wanted to present to the jury could not be admitted because it was not "generally accepted" in the scientific community, under a test that the Federal courts had developed over the last 70 years.
The Supreme Court ruled today that the "general acceptance" test had been supplanted by a broader and more flexible inquiry under the modern rules of evidence, which it defined today for the first time and ordered the lower courts to apply in this case. But while the decision reinstating the lawsuit was technically a victory for the plaintiffs, leaving the eventual outcome of the suit uncertain, the Supreme Court's ruling is likely in the long run to prove much more favorable to defendants than to plaintiffs.
The Court did not explicitly discuss the debate over so-called junk science that had drawn wide attention to this case not only from scientists, but also from critics of the civil justice system who maintain that the acceptance of invalid scientific theories in court foments wasteful litigation.
 
Focus on Different Quests
 But the Court was clearly aware of this debate, and underlying the majority opinion was a concern that judges would not do their jobs if they left it to juries to sort out untried or disputed theories.
"There are important differences between the quest for truth in the courtroom and the quest for truth in the laboratory," Justice Blackmun said. He said that while conjecture and the exploration of questionable theories is a valuable part of scientific inquiry, it is of "little use" in reaching binding legal judgments about past events.
"We recognize that in practice, a gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations," Justice Blackmun said. "That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes."
Lawyers for the families had argued that in adopting new rules of evidence in the 1970's, Congress intended to permit juries to resolve scientific disputes through the adversarial process in the same manner that they resolve disputes about economic theories or other complex subjects.
The Court rejected that approach today. Justice Blackmun said that while the jury was free to reach judgments on scientific evidence that the judge permitted it to consider, judges could either keep evidence from the jury or take from the jury the power to reach a judgment if the scientific evidence admitted at trial turned out to be insufficient to permit a "reasonable juror" to reach a conclusion.
In rejecting the "general acceptance" standard that looked to scientific witnesses' conclusions, the Court today took a broader view of the scientific process, with an emphasis on "methods and procedures."
Justice Blackmun said that "in order to qualify as scientific knowledge, an inference or assertion must be derived by the scientific method" and must have been tested or at least subject to testing. He said that while publication in a journal subject to peer review was not essential, it was a "relevant" factor for a judge to consider in assessing whether a method or technique was valid.
In the lawsuit that led to the decision, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, No. 92-102, the plaintiffs tried to present evidence from chemical studies and animal experiments to show that Bendectin had caused the missing or shortened limbs of two children, Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller.
The mothers of the two took the drug during pregnancy. The company argued that epidemiological studies of the effect of the drug in humans had failed to demonstrate that it caused limb defects. Both the Federal District Court in Los Angeles and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that evidence that did not rely on epidemiological studies would not be admissible at trial and dismissed the case.
There were also these developments today as the Court concluded its 1992-93 term and recessed for the summer:
 
Insurance Antitrust Case
 In a splintered decision, the Court kept alive a major antitrust case brought by 19 states as well as a group of private companies against 32 foreign and domestic insurance companies. The suit contends that the insurance companies conspired, by limiting the availability of a basic type of policy, to make it all but impossible to buy insurance coverage for long-term pollution and environmental damage.
The issue for the Court in the case, Hartford Fire Insurance v. California, No. 91-1111, was whether the insurance companies were immune from suit under any of several theories. In ruling two years ago that the lawsuit could go to trial, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, held that the domestic companies would forfeit their ordinary immunity from antitrust liability, provided by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, if it could be shown that they had conspired with the foreign companies.
In an opinion by Justice David H. Souter, the Court ruled unanimously today that the foreign involvement in the case did not deprive the domestic companies of their immunity. Neither, the Court said in a 5-to-4 portion of the opinion, were the foreign companies necessarily outside the reach of American antitrust law.
The central and most disputed portion of the case concerned the domestic companies' potential liability under another part of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. That law generally makes the "business of insurance" immune from Federal antitrust law. But the law strips the industry's immunity in the case of a "boycott." The question for the Court was how to define boycott.
In a portion of the opinion written by Justice Scalia in the 5-to-4 ruling, the Court defined "boycott" narrowly and in a way that may ultimately make it difficult for the states to prevail if the case goes to trial.
 
Double Jeopardy
 Voting 5 to 4, the Court overturned a much-disputed 1990 precedent that had broadened the definition of double jeopardy.
In the 1990 case, Grady v. Corbin, the Court had barred the prosecution of a man for vehicular homicide because he had already pleaded guilty to minor traffic offenses in the same accident. The judge who accepted the plea was unaware that there had been a fatality. In a 5-to-4 vote, the Court said that because the two prosecutions involved proof of the "same conduct" -- the accident -- the second was barred by the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.
In overturning that precedent today, the Court returned to its traditional view of double jeopardy, under which the question is not whether the two prosecutions require proof of the same conduct, but whether the two offenses have the same "elements."

HEADLINE: A Fervent 'No' To Assimilation In New America

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
For Guilienne Audelin, a 15-year-old Haitian-American who attends a predominantly black high school in Miami, assimilation is a dirty word. It means joining the ranks of the disaffected in her inner-city neighborhood, she said, and being stamped as a "dummy" by a broader American society that she believes does not see beyond color. It means abandoning her immigrant parents' dreams for her future, and she simply refuses to do that.
"Nothing could stop me from trying to have a better life than we have now," she said. 
 The first broad study of the children of immigrants in 50 years debunks a longstanding assumption about the American immigrant experience: that assimilation is the only path to success for immigrants' children.
Today's immigrants, like Guilienne's parents, are most likely to settle in inner-city neighborhoods, where assimilation often means joining a world that is antagonistic to the American mainstream. But, according to the new study by Johns Hopkins University, many prove successful by remaining in their insular ethnic communities and shutting out the apathy around them.
"This situation stands the cultural blueprint for the advancement of immigrant groups in American society on its head," said Alejandro Portes, the Johns Hopkins sociology professor who directed the study.
But the findings do not indicate that immigrants' children, like Guilienne, are growing up "un-American," attuned solely to the language and culture of their parents' homeland. In fact, the study found, most of them, while bilingual, prefer English to their parents' native language and speak it fluently, better than their parents' tongue. And most also hold on to the strong aspiration of social mobility through education that propelled earlier immigrants into the melting pot of American society.
 
Staying the Course
 Guilienne (pronounced ghee-HYEN), for instance, is not daunted by the fact that her parents, a garbage collector and a nurse's assistant, have only eighth-grade educations. Neither are her dreams marred by the widespread poverty in her Little Haiti neighborhood, which many of her peers will not escape. Unlike some other Haitian-Americans, she has chosen to ignore the peer pressure to be cool, bored and indifferent, preferring to remain true to the immigrant values of her hard-working parents.
"I will stay in school as many years as they tell me I have to in order to become a judge," Guilienne said.
Nonetheless, she and today's other children of immigrants are far different from the earlier 20th-century immigrants' children, who felt they had to reject the Old World to get ahead in the New. Today's children are predominantly Hispanic, Asian and Caribbean, facing racial barriers that did not exist for their European predecessors and economic barriers that threaten to condemn them to a swelling underclass.
Fifty years ago, the children of European immigrants were joining an expanding American industrial work force; today's second-generation Americans find their prospects for advancement in the working class limited.
The number of immigrants' children in the United States peaked in 1940 at roughly 28 million, but that number is expected to be surpassed any year now. In 1990, there were about 24.8 million immigrants' children, of whom about 7.7. million were born to immigrants who arrived after 1960.
 
Questioning Schoolchildren
 Professor Portes, whose research was largely financed by the Mellon Foundation, collaborated with Florida International University in Miami and the University of California at San Diego to complete his study of immigrants' children. It is the first such study since Irving Child's work, "Italian or American? The Second Generation in Conflict," in 1943. Teams of interviewers questioned 5,000 children of immigrants in the eighth and ninth grades, primarily in Miami and San Diego, on subjects like language use, discrimination and patriotism.
Predictably, the answers reflected significant differences between nationalities and between Miami, where Hispanic immigrants increasingly dominate the political and business life, and San Diego, where anti-immigrant sentiment is considered high and power remains largely with a white elite.
For instance, 45 percent of the Miami children reported experiencing discrimination, as against 64 percent in San Diego. And in Miami, the 45 percent broke down to 66 percent for Haitian-American children, but only 29 percent for the Cuban-Americans attending predominantly Cuban-American private schools.
"We'd go into a high school where most of the immigrant children were black, and ask if they'd ever encountered discrimination, and you'd hear this loud, 'Pssh!', like, 'What a stupid question,' " said Lisandro Perez, a Florida International sociologist. "Then we'd go into a private Cuban school in Miami, and the concept of discrimination was so alien that students practically didn't understand the question."
Miguel Salvat, for instance, a 14-year-old Cuban-American, said he had never experienced prejudice and firmly believed that everyone in America has the same opportunities regardless of race or ethnicity.
But, in the same city, Guilienne said she often encountered discrimination. "In America, they won't accept you for who you are," she said. "They look at the color of your skin, how you are dressed and how you look."
 
Speaking English
 Although Miami is among the most bilingual cities in the country, 99 percent of the children interviewed there said they spoke English well or very well. And contrary to what many advocates of English-only and English-first laws might expect, 94 percent of the Cuban-American students said they preferred English to Spanish.
In San Diego, 90 percent of the immigrants' children said that they spoke English well, but 9 percent said they spoke it poorly. Among the latter especially were Mexican-Americans, with 14 percent saying they spoke English poorly, Vietnamese-Americans (19 percent) and Laotian-Americans (23 percent). About 65 percent of all children said they preferred English to their parents' native language.
The longer the children have lived in the United States, the better their English. "All the children are well on their way to being fluent English speakers, even, one could argue, on the way to monolingualism," Professor Portes said. "It is the parents' language, not English, that is endangered."
About 70 percent of Haitian-American and Filipino-American children barely speak their parents' native language, the study found. (Guilienne said she spoke Creole fluently but preferred "proper English.") On the other hand, it found that about 70 percent of the children of Spanish-speaking immigrants speak Spanish fluently.
Most of the children interviewed, particularly those in California, were reluctant to call themselves Americans. And few accepted the pan-ethnic labels Hispanic and Asian. Like Guilienne and Miguel, they preferred Cuban or Cuban-American, Haitian or Haitian-American, and so on.
"I am proud of my blood," Guilienne said.

HEADLINE: Landscaper Admits to a Dozen Killings, Police Say

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
A 34-year-old unemployed Long Island landscaper, arrested after the New York State police discovered a body in the back of his pickup truck, has confessed to killing at least a dozen prostitutes and burying their bodies in remote parts of the New York City metropolitan region, the state police said yesterday.
They said the suspect, Joel Rifkin of East Meadow, L.I., described the string of killings after two state troopers found the decomposing body of a woman under a tarpaulin in his pickup truck when he was stopped for a traffic violation. 
 Maj. Anthony J. DiResta, commander of the state police on Long Island, said that "the degree of detail provided in the suspect's descriptions gives us reason to believe this may be the largest case of serial murder since the Arthur Shawcross killings" -- 11 murders in the Rochester area in the 1980's.
"All indications are that we have in custody a person who has committed multiple homicides," Major DiResta said. Other officials said Mr. Rifkin had given them a long list of approximately when he killed his victims and approximately where he left the bodies.
Law-enforcement officials from three states converged on the state police barracks in Farmingdale, L.I., hoping to establish connections between what Mr. Rifkin had said and unsolved cases in their files going back two years or more.
By last night, only one such connection had been made. John Gierasch, commander of the homicide unit in the Suffolk County police, said he had "reason to believe" that Mr. Rifkin was linked to a woman's body found on Route 59 in the Westhampton section of Southampton on May 9. He did not disclose what had led him to that conclusion.
The authorities began searching the ranch-style house where Mr. Rifkin lived with his 71-year-old mother and his sister, as well as locations on Long Island, in New York City and in Somers, N.Y. State police officials refused to give details of where they wanted to look in the three jurisdictions. But at the house, officers concentrated in the garage, where they clustered around a freezer. It was not clear what, if anything, they expected to find inside. Upstairs, other officers went through several bedrooms.
Investigators also took a flatbed truck to the Rifkin house last night. One official said it would be used to haul away Mr. Rifkin's other pickup truck, a twin of the one he was driving when he was caught, and two vans that he also owned. Early this morning officers were removing items from the house and garage and put a number of items, including a chain saw, into an evidence bag.
The horrifying discovery and the unexpected confession came after a wee-hours chase across Nassau County that began with a simple traffic violation: the troopers noticed that the suspect's tan Mazda was missing a license plate.
The chase that led to Mr. Rifkin's arrest began on the Southern State Parkway near the Wantagh Avenue exit at 3:15 A.M. yesterday and gained speed as he ignored orders to pull over that the troopers yelled through a loudspeaker. It ended 20 minutes later and about 10 miles away when Mr. Rifkin slammed into a light pole on Old Country Road at Washington Avenue in Mineola, L.I.
Capt. Walter Heesch of the state police said that as the troopers were handcuffing Mr. Rifkin for the license-plate violation, they realized that a foul odor was coming from the enclosed back end of the truck. One trooper pointed a flashlight in and reached under a tarpaulin that was covering the woman's body.
"He just put his hands up," said Trooper Sean Ruane, one of the officers who arrested him. "I said, 'Get out.' He got out of the car and just lay down on the ground. He never said a word."
Captain Heesch said Mr. Rifkin told investigators that he was on his way to bury the woman's body at Republic Airport in Farmingdale, L.I., when he was stopped. Captain Heesch said that the body appeared to have been "in a state of decomposition for three days." Major DiResta said that the woman had been strangled.
Captain Heesch said Mr. Rifkin told investigators that all of his victims were "New York City prostitutes, taken off the streets of New York City."
 
Sex and Murder
 Captain Heesch said Mr. Rifkin told investigators that the woman whose body was found in the back of truck was a prostitute he had patronized, apparently on Friday night in Manhattan.
Her identity was not immediately available. But the captain said her description was like that of the other women Mr. Rifkin said he had had sex with and then killed: they all were white and from New York City. The captain would not release the identities or ages of the women that the authorities believed matched the murders that Mr. Rifkin said he had committed, but said that investigators were reviewing cases from at least the last three years.
The New Jersey state police sent two detectives from its major crime unit to join the investigation. They had one case in particular in mind: the two-year-old unsolved murder of a woman whose badly decomposed body was found near an exit ramp on Interstate 80 in Sussex County, not far from an area truckers use as a rest stop.
The victim was known as "the tiger lady" because of a tattoo on her calf showing a leaping cat. "We were particularly interested in this one because the body was found along an interstate in close proximity to New York," a spokesman for the New Jersey state police said last night. But it was not clear last night whether there was any connection to the Long Island case.
New York City detectives were also sent to Long Island yesterday to listen to the suspect's confessions and to get as much detailed information on each killing he had described as they could, said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Tina Mohrmann.
There is no list of murdered or missing prostitutes to match the information against, the police said.
A check with the Missing Persons squad would also allow a detective in a Bronx precinct seeking to identify a body discovered there to learn that a missing person from Brooklyn answers the same description. Investigators will compare the information with computerized categories like unsolved female homicides.
But if a victim's body has never been found, that murder will not come up on the computer.
"It will involve a great deal of work, but the computer will make the work a great deal easier," Sergeant Mohrmann said.
Last night in East Meadow, where a room of the public library was named for the Rifkin family and where Mr. Rifkin's late father was a library trustee, neighbors were shocked after the police had roped off the Rifkins' ranch-style house.
A neighbor, Harold Reiter, described the suspect as a "pleasant young man" who was a little reclusive. But Mr. Reiter added, "He was never any trouble."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: Reapportionment;
COURT QUESTIONS DISTRICTS DRAWN TO AID MINORITIES

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today that designing legislative districts to increase black representation can violate the constitutional rights of white voters.
The decision casts doubt on the redistricting that brought North Carolina its first black members of Congress since Reconstruction, and possibly on districts in other regions that have been given bizarre shapes to insure the election of minority representatives. 
 The 5-to-4 ruling gave a group of white North Carolina voters the chance to prove that the state's new 12th District is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander that violates the white voters' right to equal protection of the laws. The district connects small black population centers in a 160-mile ribbon no wider in some places than the interstate highway that it follows.
 
O'Connor for the Majority
 The decision overturned a ruling last year by a special three-judge Federal District Court in North Carolina, which dismissed the challenge on the ground that Supreme Court precedents made it clear that white voters generally have no cause for complaint about districts drawn for the purpose of electing blacks.
In her majority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor drew a different lesson from the Court's precedents. Noting that the Court had struck down districting plans that excluded blacks, she said, "It is unsettling how closely the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past." [Excerpts, page A12.]
A reapportionment plan linking people who live far apart and who "may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin," Justice O'Connor said, "bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid."
 
White's Final Day
 The majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter all wrote dissenting opinions.
On his final day after more than 31 years on the Court, Justice White, who began his public career handling civil rights issues as a Justice Department official in the Kennedy Administration, said it was "both a fiction and a departure from settled equal protection principles" to regard the white voters as having a case.
Justice White noted that even with the creation of two black-majority districts in North Carolina, whites were still a majority in 10 of 12 districts, or 83 percent of the districts, while constituting 76 percent of the state's people. "Surely they cannot complain of discriminatory treatment," he said.
In ordering the District Court to give the white plaintiffs their day in court, the Justices left unanswered many questions about the breadth of their ruling today.
Justice O'Connor said there may be "wholly legitimate purposes" for concentrating members of a racial group in one or more districts while excluding them from others. She said "traditional districting principles" like keeping districts compact, contiguous and within existing political subdivisions could provide such a "race-neutral" rationale.
 
'Compelling Interest' Needed
 But the opinion cast doubt on the extent to which explicitly racial considerations of the sort frequently invoked in reapportionment cases, like the desire to remedy discrimination or avoid dilution of black voting strength, can justify districts that do not fit the traditional descriptions.
Justice O'Connor said the North Carolina district would have to be judged by the legal standard of "strict scrutiny" that the Court applies to discrimination on the basis of race. Under this standard, which can almost never be satisfied in practice, the state must show that a "compelling interest" made it necessary to treat people differently on the basis of race.
In one of the most potentially significant parts of the opinion, Justice O'Connor said that the fact that the North Carolina Legislature drew the disputed district to comply with the Federal Voting Rights Act was not, by itself, a "compelling state interest."
 
A Familiar Divide
 The state came up with the 12th District after the Justice Department had rejected an initial plan that provided for only one majority-black district, saying the state's black population was big enough to support two districts. The Justice Department's refusal to approve the plan under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act left the state with the option of going to court or complying; the Legislature's response was to draw the 12th District.
Justice O'Connor said today that while "the states certainly have a very strong interest in complying with Federal antidiscrimination laws that are constitutionally valid as interpreted and as applied," compliance with the Voting Rights Act does not provide immunity from constitutional challenge or give states "carte blanche to engage in racial gerrymandering."
The white plaintiffs in this case had argued that if the North Carolina plan was in fact required under the Voting Rights Act, then the law itself was unconstitutional. Justice O'Connor said that the District Court would be free to consider this argument when it reconsiders the case.
She also said that a district looking like North Carolina's 12th District could not be defended automatically as a remedy for past discrimination against black voters, a defense that the state put forward in this case. "Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions," she said.
The philosophical and constitutional divide on the Court in today's decision, Shaw v. Reno, No. 92-357, was familiar from the Court's bitter debates over affirmative action and similar race-conscious policies: whether distinctions made on the basis of race can ever be benign.
The dissenters stressed that white voters as a whole in North Carolina had suffered no injury from a relatively modest, though historic, step in equalizing power in the state. "The duty to govern impartially is abused when a group with power over the electoral process defines electoral boundaries solely to enhance its own political strength at the expense of any weaker group," Justice Stevens said, adding:
"That duty, however, is not violated when the majority acts to facilitate the election of a member of a group that lacks such power because it remains underrepresented in the state legislature -- whether that group is defined by political affiliation, by common economic interests, or by religious, ethnic, or racial characteristics."
 
Risks Are Seen
 In the majority's view, however, "racial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society," as Justice O'Connor said today. She said, "The very reason that the equal-protection clause demands strict scrutiny of all racial classifications is because without it, a court cannot determine whether or not the discrimination truly is benign."
Justice O'Connor said that one injury that districts of this type inflict is to perpetuate racial stereotypes and exacerbate patterns of racial-bloc voting. In addition, she said, representatives elected from such districts receive the "pernicious" message that their job is to represent only their racial group.
"This is altogether antithetical to our system of representative democracy," she said.

HEADLINE: Talks in Japan Fail to Fashion Trade Accord for Clinton Trip

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 28

 BODY:
Negotiations to define a new trade relationship between the United States and Japan broke off tonight in a deadlock, making it almost certain that no agreement will by forged by the time President Clinton arrives here next week for a summit meeting of industrial nations.
The failure is a blow to President Clinton, who has made a tougher stance with Japan a centerpiece of his efforts to revive the American economy. When they met in April, President Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, set a goal of developing a new framework to guide future talks on economic relations by the time the two men met again at the Group of Seven summit meeting.
 
Background of Upheaval
 With today's development, it appears that the meeting, which begins July 7, will be missing the announcements of two major agreements. Only last week, negotiators from the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Community failed to agree on broad measures to cut tariffs and revive global trade talks, although negotiators said there was still a chance that an accord could be reached. 
 Japan is expected to come under pressure from all the industrial nations at the summit meeting to reduce its trade surplus and help stimulate world economic growth.
The Japanese-American negotiations took place at a time of political upheaval in Japan, with elections coming next month that will probably change the Government. This situation may have made it difficult for the Japanese to make concessions, but participants on both sides said they believed the political situation did not slow down the negotiations.
The big split between the two sides came over America's demand for Japan to agree to the principle of numerical targets for opening specific markets and for cutting its trade surplus in general. The deadlock could damage already tense trade relations between the world's two largest economies. It might lead to increased calls in Congress or from American companies for steps to punish Japan or protect American industries.
"The relationship as it stands is badly corroded," a senior Administration official warned here tonight. "It is up to Japan where it wishes to see the bilateral economic relationship go."
The deadlock is also a sign of a shift in Japan's trading stance. In the past, Japan has always seemed willing to accommodate American demands in the interest of keeping good relations with a nation that it reveres as an older brother and which serves as a huge market for its cars and VCR's.
Japan said targets violated the principle of free trade. It also argued that it was impossible for a nation single-handedly to control its trade balance because that depends on the policies of trading partners as well.
Behind these philosophical arguments are more practical considerations. Washington believes numerical targets work, as shown by a market share target it attained in a semiconductor trade agreement. And Tokyo wants to avoid more such agreements and is drawing a line in the sand.
 
Japan Stands Firm
 American negotiators appeared to think that Japan, despite its publicly stated opposition to numerical targets in the last two months, would also yield once it reached the negotiating table. But during two days of talks here, Japan firmly stood its ground.
"They will be incorrect if they assume that Japan will always behave in the manner in which it behaved in the past -- yielding to pressure and compromising at all costs," a Japanese Government official said tonight. "This is not the kind of behavior Japan will be assuming in the future."
American and Japanese officials said tonight that the talks would continue, although no date had been set.
"Sometimes games go into extra innings," W. Bowman Cutter, the chairman of the American delegation, said at a news conference tonight. "We don't have any reason to believe we will not reach an agreement."
But Mr. Cutter, who is deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, said, "It would be difficult, but not impossible, to reach an agreement by the summit."
For Prime Minister Miyazawa, who lost a no-confidence vote in Parliament earlier this month and is now effectively a lame duck, the lack of an agreement might not mean much other than loss of one more chance to be in the spotlight.
For President Clinton, however, failure to establish the new trading relationship with Japan in the next few months could be seen as another broken promise.
 
An Overall Proposal
 The proposed framework would not be a specific agreement on market-opening measures. Rather, it is intended to be an overall proposal governing which issues will be discussed in the future and how they will be negotiated.
The framework would cover general issues like Japan's antitrust law and distribution system, replacing the existing series of talks known as the Structural Impediments Initiative. It is also expected to deal with specific sectors like autos and supercomputers. American trade practices, including "Buy American" programs, are also expected to be discussed.
The United States wants Japan to reduce its current-account surplus in a few years to 1 to 2 percent of its economic output from more than 3 percent now. In return, the United States is promising to reduce its Federal budget deficit by an amount already contemplated in President Clinton's tax and budget policies.
The American side, which maintains that Japan is far from a free trader, argued that numerical targets for access to Japan's markets would reduce trade friction because they would provide objective ways of determining whether a trade agreement was being fulfilled.
The United States has gradually softened its language on numerical targets, saying they did not have to have specific market shares but could be a variety of other quantitative and qualitative measures, like how many foreigners are on standards-setting bodies. Washington also said there would be no automatic levying of sanctions on Japan if targets were not met, although sanctions were not ruled out entirely.
 
Some Progress Made
 The two sides did make progress toward agreement on some categories for future talks. These include government procurement, regulatory reform, harmonization of rules in areas like intellectual property, and the carrying out of existing trade agreements. But Japan objected to the American idea of establishing a separate category for autos and auto parts.
The Japanese official said Japan was being encouraged to hold its ground by other Asian nations, which fear the United States will take the same approach with them. In addition, he said, Japan knows that many people in the United States are also against "managed trade."
Analysts have pointed out other reasons that Japan might be less willing to yield to American demands than in the past. A smaller percentage of its exports and investments are going to the United States as its attention shifts to Asia. And a new generation of Japanese leaders is less beholden to America for help in rebuilding after World War II.
American officials said it was too early to reassess their approach to trade with Japan. They said they hoped that Japan would eventually agree to the benchmarks as pressure grows on Japan from its trading partners. Japan has acknowledged its trade surplus should be cut.
"There is no disagreement among the parties that tangible progress is required," one American official said. "So we do believe we will come to an agreement on this."

HEADLINE: RAID ON BAGHDAD;
Clinton Overstates Impact Of Raid, His Aides Warn

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
President Clinton maintained today that the United States missile attack on Iraq had crippled its intelligence capacity, but senior Administration and intelligence officials conceded that he had overstated the case.
Mr. Clinton told reporters this morning that he had received a report from the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, "confirming that we did in fact cripple the Iraqi intelligence capacity, which was the intent of the action." 
 But senior officials said that while the attack on Sunday had destroyed the crucial wing of the walled six-story headquarters of the intelligence complex in the heart of Baghdad, it had not destroyed other intelligence-gathering networks.
The Administration has also expressed concern that a new showdown is looming over Iraq's refusal to permit weapons inspections by the United Nations.
 
Warning From Gore
 On morning television news programs, Vice President Al Gore warned Mr. Hussein not to retaliate for the attack. "If he does something that is prohibited under the United Nations resolutions, there will be a response," Mr. Gore said.
The complex that was attacked is the headquarters of Mukhabarat, the security arm and the domestic and foreign intelligence operation of the governing Baath Party, senior United States intelligence officials said.
The attack destroyed the communications and computer centers in the operations wing of the intelligence building, but neither Gen. Sabir al-Duri, the head of Mukhabarat and a close associate of Mr. Hussein, nor his top aides were believed to have been in the building at the time.
Mr. Hussein uses overlapping intelligence and security services to keep order, and the Administration did not attack the three other services.
 
The Assets That Remain
 They are the Military Intelligence Agency, which is in the armed forces' general headquarters and is headed by a half-brother of Mr. Hussein, Sidawi Ibrahim; the State Internal Security, which deals primarily with internal security, and Special Security, Mr. Hussein's personal intelligence police, which is across from the Presidential Palace.
Senior Administration officials said the target of the operation was Mukhabarat because that agency had plotted to assassinate George Bush during his visit to Kuwait in April. Kuwait has arrested 16 Iraqis in connection with the reported plot.
While insisting that the President had not intended to mislead anyone with his remarks, intelligence officials conceded that the main impact of the attack had been the disruption of his domestic rather than foreign operations. And a senior Administration official said Mr. Lake's briefing for Mr. Clinton had focused narrowly on the extensive damage to Mukhabarat, not to the broader issue of Mr. Hussein's intelligence capacity.
 
What Clinton Meant
 "We have done a good deal of damage to that building, which contains a good deal of communications equipment and computers," said one senior Administration official involved in the operation. "Clearly Iraq has an elaborate intelligence capability and an elaborate network. I don't think the President intended to suggest that Iraq doesn't continue to maintain an intelligence capability."
That view was echoed by Amatzia Baram, an Israeli expert on Iraq, who said in a telephone interview from Haifa, "This is mainly important as a psychological blow because it says we can get you in the heart. To say it is crippling is to say too much."
The President also sent Congress a letter outlining his decision to attack Babhdad.
"Based on the Government of Iraq's pattern of disregard for international law, I concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that new diplomatic initiatives or economic measures could influence the current Government of Iraq to cease planning future attacks against the United States."
He said any Iraqi violence, aggression or state-sponsored terrorism against the United States would result in "necessary and appropriate" measures to protect American citizens.
 
An Admiral's View
 Mr. Clinton's remarks this morning appeared to go beyond what Rear Adm. Michael W. Cramer, the chief intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Sunday.
Asked in a briefing about the impact of the attack on Iraq's intelligence network, Admiral Cramer said much of the communications capability, records, computer support and operations in the intelligence building suffered "major damage by this strike."
But he added: "I won't stand here and say that there aren't alternate facilities and alternate means that even the Iraqi Intelligence Service can go to and employ. But this is their headquarters, by far their most important facility, and it has suffered a major setback."
Mr. Clinton's sweeping statement about the significance of the attack was reminiscent of the assertions by President Bush and Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf during the Persian Gulf war that later proved to be untrue.
 
What Bush Meant
 In January 1991 Mr. Bush announced that allied bombers had "put Saddam out of the nuclear bomb-building business for a long time to come." A few days later, General Schwartzkopf said Iraq's ability to manufacture nuclear weapons had been "neutralized."
A few months later, the Bush Administration had to acknowledge that United States bombers had failed to destroy many of the nuclear sites that had been their targets, and that United Nations inspectors had uncovered secret nuclear installations and equipment.
The following January, Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, told a Congressional committee that Mr. Hussein could rebuild Iraq's ballistic missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs within a few years.
Administration policymakers say they do not believe Mr. Hussein will retaliate immediately, or directly, for the attack on Sunday.
They are concerned, though, about his refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
Officials said the weapons dispute would be handled through the United Nations. The Security Council warned Iraq last week that there would be "serious consequences" if Baghdad continued to prevent inspectors from setting up cameras to monitor the destruction of Iraqi missiles and from inspecting certain suspected chemical-weapon sites.

HEADLINE: Mandela and de Klerk to Send Similar Signals on U.S. Visits

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 28

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela's itinerary looks like (and is) a campaign tour: New York to Los Angeles, David Brinkley and "Good Morning America," fund-raising dinners and photo ops galore.
F. W. de Klerk's resembles (and is) the state visit of a lame-duck foreign leader. He will spend low-profile time with policy makers. 
 Except for a couple of poses with President Clinton, one at the White House and one when they come together on July 4 in Philadelphia to accept their joint award of the Liberty Medal, the two men plan to keep their distance. When asked, they will speak of each other more as rivals than as partners.
 
A Quest for New Investment
 All the same, the two South Africans arrive in America this week on a common mission: to reopen the economic spigots rusted shut by years of sanctions.
In their separate ways, they will be trying to persuade American business and the United States Government that South Africa is more stable than it looks, that the course to democracy is inexorable and that it is O.K. for America to come back.
Aides to Mr. Mandela said that as recently as a week ago, he had hoped to use this trip to formally call for the lifting of remaining international sanctions against South Africa -- the most important encouragement that he could give to American investors -- but whether he will do so is now uncertain.
The congress has said it will call for the repeal of sanctions only when an election date is firm and when a multiparty transitional committee has been created, with powers to keep the campaign fair.
The election date, next April 27, is due to be ratified by constitutional negotiators on Friday. The transitional arrangements are not likely to be in place before August, although a senior congress official said it might be enough for Mr. Mandela to call off sanctions if "the process is in motion."
While he is in the United States, Mr. Mandela will also be soliciting millions of dollars in cash, volunteers and technology to help his African National Congress wage an election campaign against President de Klerk's National Party.
Relations between the Government and the congress were strained again last Friday when white separatists smashed their way into the constitutional talks and occupied the building for two hours.
Mr. de Klerk was as much a target of the right-wing hatred as Mr. Mandela, but the attack -- and especially the Government's decision not to risk arresting the armed invaders on the spot -- have churned up a new cloud of suspicion that could make it difficult for Mr. Mandela to call off sanctions.
"It is very clear to us that the Government either has lost control of the security forces or the security forces are doing what the Government wants them to do," Mr. Mandela told reporters Saturday night before flying to a meeting of African leaders in Cairo.
 
21 Arrests Reported
 By tonight the police said they had arrested 21 of the several hundred invaders, not including any of their leaders.
President Bush ended Federal sanctions against investment in South Africa, but many American states and cities still refuse contracts to companies that invest in South Africa. South Africa is still denied loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Congress officials say Mr. Mandela desperately wants to welcome American business and world lenders back, knowing a surge of investment will make it easier for the next government to deliver on promises of jobs, housing and schools.
"Internationally we are losing opportunities," said Patrick "Terror" Lekota, a member of the congress's governing board. "We see capital flowing to Eastern Europe that could be coming to us."
 
Help for Campaign
 Mr. Mandela also knows that announcing the end of sanctions is one of the best ways to get the respectful attention of American business people, from who he hopes to extract pledges of cash and equipment for his election campaign.
Mr. Mandela is to arrive in New York on Tuesday from Cairo. Beginning with a Wednesday breakfast with Mayor David N. Dinkins, he is off and barnstorming for two weeks: Washington, Philadelphia, New York again, Chicago, Los Angeles, Indianapolis and Atlanta.
He will put the touch on New York financiers, Hollywood moguls, black business people, churches and labor unions.
Mr. Lekota, who oversees the congress's election campaign, said he hopes the trip will generate donations of car telephones, computers, fax machines, mobile video equipment and about $20 million in cash pledges, as well as advice on polling and fund-raising and possibly lists of eager university students interested in working as campaign volunteers.
"We are looking on the trip of the president as the last trip to the U.S. before the election," he said, referring to Mr. Mandela, who is president of the congress. "We are targeting all sectors of the American society."
Mr. de Klerk is to fly into Washington on Wednesday to spend a few days with members of Congress, Administration officials, World Bank officers and others on the fine points of reopening the financial pipeline.
"The United States has a role to play in this, just as it played a role in doing away with apartheid," said Harry H. Schwarz, the South African Ambassador to Washington.
The Ambassador said Mr. de Klerkwould urge President Clinton to support International Monetary Fund lending to South Africa and to plump for an aid package from the major industrialized nations. He will also try to speed an agreement making American enterprises here eligible for United States Government investment insurance, and will meet with members of Congress who are considering retaining a code of conduct for companies doing business in South Africa.
"Mandela will do the public things," said a South African official here. "De Klerk will be working on the mechanics. After all, if de Klerk calls for the lifting of sanctions, no one will listen."'
