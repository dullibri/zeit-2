HEADLINE: Exports Help Japan Show Robust Rate Of Growth

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, May 18 

 BODY:
The growth in the Japanese economy surpassed all expectations for the first quarter as a largely export-driven recovery broadened to include a pickup in consumer spending, government figures showed on Tuesday.
 Japan's gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, after vigorous growth in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the economy increased at a 6.4 percent annual pace, the fastest in 13 years. 
 But while last year's expansion was driven largely by exports to the United States and China, the most recent growth figures show that Japanese consumers are also contributing to the recovery, which is now nearly two years old. Economists had been predicting a first-quarter annual growth rate of 3.8 percent. 
 Better job prospects, rising corporate profits and a decline in bankruptcies are giving consumers confidence to spend more, economists say. Japan's unemployment rate fell to a three-year low of 4.7 percent in March; consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy, has been gradually rising. 
 Household spending has increased for five consecutive months, creeping up 0.2 percent in March from the month a year earlier, after a 5.2 percent jump in February. Economists are especially encouraged by figures showing consumers are spending not only on goods like cars and cellular phones, but on travel, dining and other services.
 ''This is a very good sign for the household sector,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, who contends that the increase in spending on travel and other nonessential services indicates consumers are genuinely becoming more optimistic. Over all, for the first quarter, household consumption grew at an annualized rate of 4.1 percent. 
 At the same time, government investment fell at an annual rate of 12.8 percent, a result of efforts by the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to reduce huge deficits built up over the last decade as previous administrations tried to revive a moribund economy with heavy doses of public spending.
 The healthy United States economy and rapid growth in China continued to support Japanese exports in the first quarter and to encourage companies to invest. A wide range of Japanese companies, from automakers and steel producers to electronics and industrial equipment manufacturers are enjoying robust profit growth because of growing overseas sales. 
 While cheap Chinese manufacturers were once seen as a threat to Japanese industry, increasingly companies see opportunities to expand sales in the fast-growing Chinese market or to use China as a low-cost production base to supply customers around the world.
 ''Japan and China are so complementary,'' said the business consultant and author Kenichi Ohmae. ''A greater, stronger, more successful China helps Japanese industries sharpen their focus on what they're good at.'' 
 The government said Monday that Japan's current account surplus -- a broad measure of trade in goods, services, tourism and investment -- rose in March for the ninth consecutive month, expanding 13 percent from the month a year earlier to 1.83 trillion yen ($16 billion). Rising exports to Asia, especially to China, were the main reason for the increase.
 In the last decade, two fledgling export recoveries in Japan died as consumption at home failed to take hold. But with both a widening of exports and signs of a rebound in consumption at home there is increasing optimism that the current recovery has staying power.
 Government figures released Monday provided further evidence that Japan's long battle with deflation may be ending. Prices that companies pay for goods and services rose in April at the fastest pace in four years, according to the figures, that economists said might be a prelude to more stable consumer prices. 
 Despite signs of improving demand at home, Japan's dependence on exports means it remains vulnerable to any changes in economic conditions abroad, economists say.
 And a sustained rebound in consumer spending is far from a sure thing. Although spending has been ticking higher, there has so far been no corresponding increase in incomes. And economists warn that the spending recovery will fade unless wages begin to rise.
 Many economists also say, however, that with rising corporate profits and fewer unemployed workers to compete for new jobs, it is just a matter of time before companies begin to pay their employees more. 
 Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist at Barclays Capital, expects companies to be more generous when they pay summer bonuses this year.

HEADLINE: When the Oil Disappears

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''A Crude Shock'' (column, May 14), Paul Krugman describes how the market deals with scarce oil supplies and gives the economist's view of the relevance of statistics like oil consumption per dollar of real G.D.P.
 But faith in the market and statistics should not obscure the bottom line: this will be the last century of majority fossil fuel use because of the energy demands of an increasing population. 
 Now is the time to make historic investments in efficiency and renewable energy research and development. For the sake of today's children, we need citizenship, self-control, common sense and community spirit to sustain humanity in a world of finite resources.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Americas: Dominican Republic: A New President

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
With a hard-fought election victory in hand, President-elect Leonel Fernandez, left, began preparing for the herculean challenge of pulling the country out of its worst economic crisis in decades. President Hipolito Mejia conceded defeat late Sunday even though the Electoral Board had only counted 3 percent of the votes. He said his own voter surveys had made it clear that he would lose. With 53 percent of the vote counted by yesterday afternoon, electoral officials said Mr. Fernandez, who was president from 1996 to 2000, was leading with 55 percent against Mr. Mejia's 35 percent. A third candidate had 9 percent. It was the first election in which Dominicans living abroad were able to vote, including 52,000 registered in the United States. Mr. Fernandez said his first move would be to meet with business owners. He said he would also start heavily courting foreign investors. He is set to assume the presidency on Aug. 16.

HEADLINE: Progress at Deutsche Telekom After Returning to Its Roots

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 17 

 BODY:
When Kai-Uwe Ricke steps before the shareholders of Deutsche Telekom at its annual meeting in a Cologne arena on Tuesday, he will probably be hailed as a savior -- and for good reason.
 Mr. Ricke took the helm of Deutsche Telekom in November 2002 at a time when the German telecommunications giant, the largest in Europe, was in turmoil. Its leadership was discredited, its global expansion in tatters, and it was sinking under an ocean of red ink. 
 Today, Deutsche Telekom is back above water, earning 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in 2003, after a 24.6 billion loss ($29.2 billion) in 2002. Mr. Ricke has whittled down its $64 billion in debt by almost a quarter, beating his own target and putting the company on a stable course.
 But toward what destination?
 ''We have the possibility to be the most profitable integrated telecommunications company in Europe,'' Mr. Ricke, 42, said in an interview at the company's headquarters in the former German capital, Bonn.
 Such a goal may suit Deutsche Telekom's battle-weary shareholders fine. But it seems remarkably modest for a company that was run by an empire-building chief executive, Ron Sommer, who once boasted of having a $100 billion war chest for deals around the world.
 ''Every time has the right C.E.O.,'' said Mr. Ricke, who was drafted a few months after Mr. Sommer was dismissed. ''We saw the hype. We saw the deep depression. Now we are back to normality.''
 Normality, for Mr. Ricke, means tending to Deutsche Telekom's core German fixed-line phone, mobile and Internet-access markets, as well as its thriving cellular franchise in the United States. It does not mean exporting the Telekom name into exotic new markets or services.
 In this regard, the company is like other German giants, from DaimlerChrysler to Bertelsmann, which have curtailed their global ambitions. As Germany's economy continues to sputter, its leading companies have, at least temporarily, lost their appetite for overseas expansion.
 ''If you are a visionary investor, you might think of it as boring,'' said Boris Boehm, a money manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''But coming back to your roots is good for investors.''
 Mr. Ricke is not retreating to Germany. Deutsche Telekom, for example, did not sell off its American cellular operations, despite being goaded by analysts, who saw it as an easy way to raise cash.
 But Mr. Ricke, whose father ran Deutsche Telekom when it was transformed from a state utility into a commercial company, clearly does not care if he is not known as a globe-trotting mogul, as his predecessor was.
 A lanky, genial man whose close-cropped hair has turned grayer in the last 18 months, Mr. Ricke favors incremental, often painful, steps: cutting costs, through a deep reduction in the number of employees, selling off extraneous assets, and raising profits in basic services. 
 In recent weeks, newspapers here predicted that Mr. Ricke would overhaul the company's four major lines of business. Critics say the structure, known as the ''four pillars,'' is outmoded in an era of seamlessly integrated communications. Yet he seems unlikely to do so.
 Mr. Ricke said it was a matter of making the four pillars -- fixed-line telephone, cellular, Internet access and technology systems -- work more closely together. ''We are where we are because we are organized as we are,'' he said, noting the company's return to profitability and growth.
 Still, some analysts doubt that Deutsche Telekom will be able to maintain its momentum without acting more boldly. They note that the company reduced its investment in MTS, a Russian mobile-phone provider that has one of the world's fastest-growing cellular businesses. It has also been unable to gain a majority stake in a Polish mobile operator, PTC.
 ''These are countries where the growth is really strong,'' said Frank Rothauge, an analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Frankfurt. ''It would be interesting for them to go for acquisitions there.''
 Mr. Ricke's decision to hold on to Deutsche Telekom's cellular operation in the United States looks wise. T-Mobile USA, as the unit is known, added 1.2 million customers in the first quarter of this year, nearly four times the number of T-Mobile's German operation, where subscriber growth and revenue per customer are as lackluster as the broader economy.
 With the American cellular market in the midst of consolidating, Mr. Ricke said he was not averse to selling T-Mobile USA, provided the price was right. Otherwise, he seems ready to compete for customers against newly enlarged rivals like Cingular, which now owns AT&T Wireless.
 ''I'm not in the U.S. to own a Rolls-Royce,'' Mr. Ricke said. ''I'm in the U.S. to get a reasonable rate of return.''
 The United States may act as a hedge against Germany in other ways. On Friday, the German Parliament passed a telecommunications law that opens the market to competition. That threatens Deutsche Telekom's local phone business, but more vitally, its Internet-access service. It now controls 90 percent of the market for high-speed digital subscriber lines.
 Mr. Ricke lobbied fiercely against a provision that would have required Deutsche Telekom to open its network and resell parts of it to competitors. Until 2008, rivals who want to use the network will have to buy a bundle of services from Deutsche Telekom, as they do now. 
 ''Certainly, we are losing market share,'' he said. ''But it should be in a way where I feel incentives to invest in the infrastructure.''
 Deutsche Telekom is not likely to face the full fury of competition as long as the German government owns 43 percent of its shares. But the government's position has come under question lately. With Berlin trying to plug a big hole in its budget, some analysts think it might sell down its stake.
 That prospect has weighed down Telekom's stock, which at just over 13 euros a share, is up only 20 percent since Mr. Sommer's ouster in July 2002. Shareholders may credit Mr. Ricke with keeping the company afloat, but he must still figure out how to make it take wing.

HEADLINE: Lowe's Earnings Are Up 8%; Kmart Rebounds From Loss

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Lowe's Companies and the Kmart Holding Corporation both reported profits yesterday. 
 Lowe's reported an 8 percent increase in first-quarter profit, helped by sales of higher-price items like kitchen cabinets and its expansion to big cities. 
 But the company's stock fell about 2 percent, to $49.68, yesterday on concerns about higher energy prices and rising interest rates, analysts said. 
 ''What we don't know is what's going to be the effect on home-improvement spending in the next 12 months,'' Sarah Henry, an analyst with Sovereign Asset Management, said. 
 Lowe's, based in Mooresville, N.C., reported first-quarter net income of $455 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with $421 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 54 cents a share.
 Sales rose 22 percent, to $8.68 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure, rose 9.9 percent, helped by higher lumber and building material prices. 
 Excluding a 16-cents-a-share impact from an accounting change, Lowe's said, earnings for the 2004 quarter would have been $581 million, or 73 cents a diluted share. 
 Kmart posted its second consecutive quarterly profit as it cut costs, driving its shares up nearly 10 percent even as sales tumbled after it closed hundreds of stores last year. 
 The discount retailer, which emerged from bankruptcy protection last May with a new management team, fewer stores and lower debt, has been focusing on building profits, even at the expense of sales.
 The company, based in Troy, Mich., said it earned $93 million, or 94 cents a share, in the first quarter ended April 28. For the period a year ago, Kmart lost $862 million while it was still in bankruptcy.
 Kmart said quarterly sales tumbled 25.3 percent, to $4.62 billion, reflecting the closing of 316 stores in the first quarter last year. The company shut about 600 of its 2,100 stores while reorganizing.
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell 12.9 percent. Kmart attributed the decline to special promotions that increased sales last year and to reduced advertising this year.
 Kmart shares rose $4.32, to $48.62.

HEADLINE: Bush and Kerry Mark Desegregation Where Suit Began

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan., May 17 

 BODY:
President Bush and Senator John Kerry descended on this Kansas city on Monday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that ended school segregation, with Mr. Kerry warning against persistent racial and economic disparities and Mr. Bush saying the nation ''has yet to reach the high calling of its own ideals.''
 The remarks by the president and Mr. Kerry, his likely Democratic opponent, came in two separate if perhaps unequal events to commemorate the anniversary of the case, Brown v. Board of Education, which sprang from this city 50 years ago. 
 With all the flourishes of a presidential visit, Mr. Bush marked the opening of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site at the former Monroe Elementary School, one of four all-black schools in Topeka that were at the center of the 1954 Supreme Court ruling. Air Force One flew directly over the school as it headed toward Forbes Field Airport, providing a roaring herald of the president's arrival and a dramatic picture for the local television stations covering the event live.
 ''On this day, in this place, we remember with gratitude the good souls who saw a great wrong, and stood their ground, and won their case,'' Mr. Bush said to a mostly white audience in an unusually brief speech of 12 minutes, which is about one-third the length of his standard stump speech. ''And we celebrate a milestone in the history of our glorious nation.''
 Mr. Bush warned that the ''habits of racism in America have not all been broken'' and urged that laws ''against racial discrimination must be vigorously enforced in education and housing and hiring and public accommodations.''
 Across town, Mr. Kerry attended a ceremony organized by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat, on the steps of the Capitol, in which Ms. Sebelius signed a proclamation marking the anniversary. To applause from an audience that appeared to be heavy with Democrats, Mr. Kerry painted a harsher portrait, that of a nation still torn by disparities in race and class.
 ''As far as we've come, we still have not met the promise of Brown,'' Mr. Kerry said on a cool, gray spring day. ''We have not met the promise of Brown when one-third of all African-American children are living in poverty. We have not met the promise of Brown when only 50 percent of African-American men in New York City have a job. We have not met the promise of Brown when nearly 20 million black and Hispanic Americans don't have basic health insurance.''
 As an indication of the extent to which the 2004 presidential race provided the backdrop for the day's ceremonies, Mr. Kerry received his loudest applause when he assailed the Bush administration for failing to finance its signature education law known as No Child Left Behind, the same law Mr. Bush later cited in talking about ways the government was working to end educational disparities.
 ''You cannot promise no child left behind and then pursue policies that leave millions of children behind every single day,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Because that promise is a promissory note to all of America's families that must be paid in full.''
 The anniversary here coincided with a moment that gay rights advocates hail as another civil rights milestone: the first day that Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry's home state, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But in a sign of uncertainty about how the debate over gay marriage might play in the campaign, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush made no mention of the events in Massachusetts in their speeches here.
 Mr. Bush, however, issued a statement urging Congress and states to pass a constitutional amendment ''defining and protecting marriage as a union of a man and a woman as husband and wife.''
 The commemoration brought the two candidates into unusually close contact, albeit in a Republican state that almost surely will not be in play this year. Accordingly, their visits were brief; Mr. Kerry flew off for Oregon, to campaign with Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, in one of the truly contested states this fall, while Mr. Bush flew to Atlanta, where he was expected to raise $3.2 million for the Republican Party at a fund-raiser at the home of Bob Nardelli, the chief executive of Home Depot.
 The appearance in this city of a president and his likely Democratic opponent created an undercurrent of competition between the events. Rarely have Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry been in the same state at the same time.
 When Mr. Kerry arrived at the airport to leave Topeka, he was instructed to quickly move his chartered jet off the runway before Air Force One approached and forced a shutdown of airspace. Mr. Kerry bristled when an aide, David Moorehouse, instructed him to hurry and sit down.
 ''Well, we have to taxi first, David,'' he responded.
 And at Mr. Kerry's event, an announcer asked members of the public to refrain from heading for their cars to give civil rights dignitaries time to make it to the other part of town to see Mr. Bush. Cheryl Brown Henderson, a daughter of the plaintiff in the original decision, Oliver Brown, delivered the opening remarks at the first ceremony, but slipped off the side of stage before Mr. Kerry began speaking. Ms. Henderson showed up at the Bush event.
 Among the prominent civil rights leaders who made their way to both events were the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who did not speak at either event, and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, a Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and who delivered a similar statement at the rallies.
 ''I am concerned about Osama bin Laden,'' Mr. Cummings said at the Kerry rally. ''I am concerned about the terrorists. But ladies and gentlemen, the greatest threat to our national security is our failure to educate our children.''
 Across town, Mr. Bush called for a continuing battle to end racial equality, and pointed to his No Child Left Behind law as the way to accomplish that.
 ''Many African Americans with no inheritance but their character need access to capital and the chance to own and build for the future,'' he said. ''And while our schools are no longer segregated by law, they are still not equal in opportunity and excellence. Justice requires more than a place in a school. Justice requires that every school teach every child in America.''

Leader of Iraqi Council Killed by Suicide Bomber
A suicide bomber killed the president of the Iraqi Governing Council and at least six other people at a checkpoint into the main headquarters for the American occupation forces in Iraq. Two American soldiers and five Iraqi civilians were wounded in the attack, the military said. A1

American commanders said they had discovered an Iraqi artillery shell containing sarin, one of the deadly nerve agents that Saddam Hussein said he had destroyed before the war began last year. A10

The American officer who was in charge of interrogations at Abu Ghraib prison told a senior Army investigator that intelligence officers sometimes instructed military police to force Iraqi detainees to strip naked and shackle them before they were questioned. A1

Interrogators from military intelligence told guards at Abu Ghraib to deprive detainees of sleep or food and would strip detainees and make them sleep naked in their cells, but their orders stopped well short of the graphic abuse seen in the photos, according to testimony from guards and investigators. A14

The Armed Services Committee said it would summon three senior military commanders to testify about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. A14

India Stock Market Crashes
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born leader of the Indian National Congress party, will formally stake a claim to be India's next prime minister, party officials said, after the country's stock market recorded its biggest single-day fall amid concerns over the new government's approach to economic reforms.

Gambia Rats Sniff Land Mines
The Gambian giant pouched rat may be as good a mine detector as man or nature has yet devised. They are abundant, cheap and easily transported. At three pounds, they are too light to detonate mines accidentally. They can sift the bouquet of land-mine aromas far better than any machine. A1

Massachusetts Becomes First to Allow Gay Unions
Hundreds of gays and lesbians lined city halls from Boston to the Berkshires as Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to allow same-sex couples to marry. A1

The mayor of New Paltz, who brought the same-sex marriage debate to New York state with solemnization ceremonies for 24 gay and lesbian couples in February, defended his action before the state Supreme Court in Kingston. A21

Ruling on Access for Disabled
States that fail to make their courthouses accessible to people with disabilities can be sued under federal disability law, the Supreme Court ruled in a significant break from recent decisions that gave the states broad immunity from suit under various federal laws. A16

HEADLINE: Calls to Ease Gasoline Prices By Taking Oil From Reserve

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats stepped up pressure Monday on the Bush administration to ease gasoline prices by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but administration officials plan to keep adding to the reserve until some time next year.
 On Tuesday, a group of Democrats led by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York will demand that the government release as much as 60 million barrels from the reserve over the next two months.
 A much larger group of lawmakers has called on the administration to stop adding to the reserve until prices settle down. In March, even before the most recent price increases, the Senate narrowly approved an amendment to budget legislation that would temporarily halt additions to the reserve. 
 Political pressure on the administration is almost certain to increase. The Energy Information Administration reported on Monday that last week the average price for regular gasoline climbed above $2 a gallon for the first time. Crude oil prices hovered above $41 a barrel, near the record reached last week.
 But administration officials remain opposed to any change in policy, saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was never intended to be used to move oil prices. Administration officials said on Monday that selling reserves would have a minuscule effect on gasoline prices and that the government stockpiles were intended to cope with true emergencies rather than simply high prices.
 The Department of Energy has been building up its oil reserves since shortly after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. The reserve has climbed from 592 million barrels in November 2001 to about 659 million barrels today. The administration goal is to reach 700 million barrels by sometime next year.
 The United States consumes about 20 million barrels of oil a day, about 12 million of them imported. 
 Industry analysts say tapping into the strategic reserve would have little influence on world supplies, but it could have a significant short-term effect.
 Douglas McIntyre, a senior oil market analyst at the Energy Information Administration, a nonpartisan statistical arm of the Department of Energy, said a ''rule of thumb'' was that an increase in supply of one million barrels a day translated into a decline in oil prices of $3 to $5 a barrel. That in turn would lead to a drop in gasoline prices of 7 to 12 cents a gallon.
 But Mr. McIntyre said the market reaction could vary greatly, both up and down from the standard estimates, depending on the amount of speculative activity in the markets and the overall conditions.
 Senate Democrats are far from one mind on the issue. Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has called for a temporary halt to filling the reserve, but he has not called for actually selling any of the stockpile.
 ''John Kerry believes this is a serious situation which is why he has called for a temporary halt to filling the S.P.R. and truly standing up to OPEC,'' said Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry. ''When is George Bush going to come up with a plan that helps these Americans cope with a gas crisis that is occurring on his watch? America is waiting.'' 
 In 2000, the Clinton administration tried to push down oil prices by lending out 30 million barrels of oil from the end of September to the end of December of that year. The results were mixed. According to Mr. McIntyre, crude oil prices dropped from about $37 a barrel to $30 in the first few days of the program. But prices bounced back to $36 shortly afterward, and then began to decline again as the nation experienced a much warmer winter than had been expected. By the end of December 2000, oil was down to about $32 a barrel.
 Oil companies are adamantly opposed to any use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
 John C. Felmy, chief economist with the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade association, said oil freed from the strategic reserve would be tiny in comparison with global supply and demand.
 ''You've got extraordinarily strong demand for petroleum, and very limited ability to expand output,'' Mr. Felmy said. 
 Thomas Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures, said global inventories of crude oil were not particularly low. Oil prices have been pushed higher by anxiety over possible disruptions in Iraq and other exporting countries, as well as by extremely high demand for gasoline.
 American refineries are running at about 96 percent capacity, but stockpiles of gasoline are about 5.2 million barrels lower than a year ago and 8.2 million barrels below the average of the last five years.
 ''The market has built a fear premium into the price,'' Mr. Bentz said. Releasing oil from the strategic reserve might well push crude oil prices down initially, he said, but the effect might well prove temporary and it might have little immediate effect on gasoline prices.

HEADLINE: Shares Plunge 11% in India on Jitters Over Election

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, May 17 

 BODY:
India's stock prices skidded more than 11 percent on Monday, thrown into turmoil by the confusion over the future of the country's economy under Sonia Gandhi's Congress Party and its left-leaning allies.
 In Mumbai, India's bellwether Sensex stock index, tumbled almost 17 percent, but trimmed the losses to settle at 4,505 points, its lowest close since October, and its biggest drop in 12 years. As prices crashed, trading was halted twice. 
 Since the surprising rejection of the government of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in elections ended last week, the ultimate shape of a ruling coalition led by the Congress Party has been unclear. 
 As the new government will need the support of India's Communist parties, the shape of its economic policy was even less clear. Some analysts said that in the current policy vacuum, the market could drop another 10 percent.
 ''It all depends on whether there is a clear economic policy spelled out by the government and endorsed by the left in the next few days,'' Sanjay Prakash, chief executive of HSBC Asset Management (India), said. Mr. Prakash manages $42 million in domestic equity funds, in addition to advising the London-based $1.9 billion HGIF India equity fund, the world's largest equity fund dedicated to India. 
 The disparate talk by the Communist parties on economic policy was the main cause for the collapse in equity prices, as investors faced up to the possibility of an unstable government and a possible U-turn in India's economic modernization.
 The market's steep fall came as markets around the world also tumbled, alarmed by expectations of higher interest rates in the United States, rising oil prices and China's efforts to cool its racing economy.
 Adrian Lim, investment manager of Asian equities at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia in Singapore, said the markets were generally nervous about the level of the new government's commitment to economic liberalization. Monday's tailspin, he said, was attributable to the socialist views expressed by allies of the Congress-led coalition, and the fast unwinding of trades financed on margin. The company manages $10 billion in the Asia-Pacific region.
 The general feeling was that the Communist parties would slow, if not reverse, the country's 13-year-old liberalization process, which had gained momentum under the Vajpayee government and had drawn the interest of foreign investors.
 ''In a market mostly driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals, we relate to the economic policies of the Congress, but not to that of the Communists,'' Mr. Prakash of HSBC Asset Management, said. The possibility of political instability loomed as the Communist parties, dominated by the Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist), said on Monday that they would not be part of the government. 
 Instead, they said, they would support the Congress government from the outside. This would allow the parties significant influence in government, with very little accountability. They could also withdraw their support at any moment, creating a political crisis.
 Communist parties won 62 seats in the recent federal elections and have become indispensable to the Congress Party. Congress and its allies, which together won 217 seats, need the support of the Communist parties to reach a majority in the 545-member Parliament.
 The lack of cohesion even among the Communist parties bewildered market players. Some spoke of nationalization, increases in subsidies, a halt in the sale of profitable state-owned oil companies, and greater job security for government workers. 
 When trading was halted a second time, angry brokers and investors held an impromptu protest on Dalal Street, the local equivalent of Wall Street, in Mumbai, shouting ''Down with Sonia Gandhi.''
 Seeking to reassure the markets, Manmohan Singh -- a Congress Party leader, former finance minister and the chief architect of India's liberalization program -- said, ''The new government's economic policy will be pro-growth, pro-investment, pro-savings and pro-employment.'' 
 The program of the Congress and the left-leaning parties, he added, would be committed to budget discipline, curbing wasteful spending, and emphasizing agriculture and pensions.
 He added that privatization of government-owned companies would continue, provided that it was in the national interest.
 S.K. Das, chief investment officer of LIC Mutual Fund, which manages some $1.1 billion in the financial markets, said that the possible end to privatization of government-owned companies had alarmed investors unduly. ''We will not panic. We see this as a buying opportunity,'' he said. LIC Mutual Fund is a unit of India's largest insurer, the government-owned Life Insurance Corporation.
 But experts said that the upheaval in the Indian markets was temporary.
 ''Today's correction is unwarranted and a knee-jerk reaction, especially in light of the strong fundamentals on both the economic and earnings front,'' said Sivasubramanian K.N., senior vice president and portfolio manager, equities, at Franklin Templeton (India), the country's largest private fund firm. 
 Mr. Sivasubramanian said that the fundamentals of the economy remained strong and that the change in government was unlikely to derail that. He said the coming months would offer a clearer picture of the new government's policies and its ability to manage a coalition. 
 Others were not so optimistic about the short-term outlook. ''The uncertainty will continue to drive market volatility in the next few months until there is more visibility about the government's economic priorities,'' said Mr. Lim of Aberdeen Asset Management.
 ''The anticipated budget announcement would add clarity and could crystallize the government's commitment to continued market reform,'' he added.

 BODY:

OVERALL PASSENGER TRAFFIC RISES -- United States airlines carried 43.5 million domestic passengers in February, an increase of 9.3 percent over February 2003, according to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Available seat miles, which measure capacity, were up 12.4 percent in February over the year-earlier month, the agency said. Delta Air Lines carried the most domestic passengers in February, and its main hub, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, remained the nation's busiest airport, with 2.8 million passenger boardings.

SNAG ON A380 DELIVERIES -- Virgin Atlantic, which had been one of the initial customers for the Airbus super-jumbo A380 jet in 2006, put off deliveries for more than a year of the six planes it had ordered. Airbus has said it has more than 125 orders for the A380. Virgin, a unit of the Virgin Group said it delayed deliveries because not enough world airports -- including Los Angeles International -- had begun making renovations necessary to accommodate the huge double-deck plane, which will carry from 550 to more than 850 passengers, depending on how it is configured. Los Angeles is considered a vital link because the A380 will be used on many trans-Pacific flights.

BUSINESS TRAVEL SPENDING JUMPS -- Universal Air Travel Plan, the global payment network for corporate air travel, said that the volume of spending handled by its charge cards exceeded $7 billion in 2003, a 10 percent increase over 2002. Growth rates accelerated significantly starting in October 2003 and continuing into this year, with March spending exceeding all forecasts, the company said. Universal Air Travel processes direct payments to airlines from companies buying airline tickets on its charge cards. The Air Transport Association, a trade group for domestic airlines, says that domestic revenue passenger miles grew 11.9 percent in April, compared with April 2002.

SPARTAN BUT CHEAP -- EasyHotel, a London-based economy hotel group, said it would open a hotel in central London later this year offering nightly rates as low as $9 (though the average room rate will be about $52). The hotel, at 14 Lexham Gardens, will have rooms resembling economy cabins on cruise ships. Rooms will be about 90 square feet and furnished with a double bed and a toilet, shower and sink. Telephones or televisions will not be available. Rates will vary, with the cheapest rates going to those who book earliest in off-peak times. Clean sheets will be provided, but guests need to bring their own towels. EasyHotel (www.easyhotel.com) is owned by easyGroup, the parent of the low-cost airline easyJet, which said it planned to expand the budget hotel concept to other world cities. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Lucent Fined $25 Million By S.E.C. In Fraud Case

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Lucent Technologies and nine former and current employees yesterday of fraudulently reporting nearly $1.2 billion in revenue. The agency also accused a former executive of WinStar Communications of engaging in a fraud scheme in which Lucent recorded $125 million in software sales to WinStar. 
 The accusations, made in a civil lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey, come after a three-year government inquiry into Lucent's inflation of its sales figures dating back to the 2000 fiscal year. 
 Lucent, the nation's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and three of the nine employees have agreed to settle with the government without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Lucent will not have to make any additional adjustments to its earnings statements, but it will pay a $25 million fine for not cooperating with the investigation, the largest penalty ever levied against a corporation for failure to cooperate. 
 The accusation against Lucent comes after smaller fines were levied against the Bank of America and Xerox and is emblematic of the S.E.C.'s growing frustration with evasive and obstructive behavior by companies under investigation.
 ''Stiff sanctions and exposure of their conduct will serve as a reminder to companies that only genuine cooperation serves the best interest of investors,'' Paul Berger, the S.E.C.'s associate director of enforcement, said in a statement.
 Shares of Lucent declined 18 cents, or 5.5 percent, to close at $3.10 yesterday. The announcements helped drag the Nasdaq composite index down 1.45 percent to 1,876. 
 Yesterday's move against Lucent added another jolt to the embattled telecommunications industry, whose fortunes have plummeted since the technology bubble burst several years ago. Industry analysts said some of Lucent's accounting problems stemmed from pressure to show stable sales and close deals even as the boom in spending on telecommunications equipment collapsed. 
 Companies are still paying the price for their aggressive accounting. Last month, the S.E.C. opened formal investigations of accounting irregularities against Lucent's biggest rival, Nortel Networks. The company, which is based near Toronto, has since fired several top executives and cut the 2003 profits it originally reported in half.
 Nortel is also grappling with a host of class-action lawsuits brought by investors. And on May 14, a federal grand jury in Dallas, where Nortel has major operations, subpoenaed financial and other records from the company as part of a new criminal investigation.
 The growing troubles at Nortel and the conclusion of this government case against Lucent comes amid a modest turnaround this year in the industry's financial outlook. The accounting problems, however, are starting to distract investors, who have dumped shares in Nortel and its rivals. 
 ''It's a serious blow to credibility to have this ugly monster rear its head when the industry smolders,'' said Susan Kalla, a telecommunications analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in New York. ''The timing couldn't be worse.''
 The case against Lucent dates back to November 2000, when the company alerted financial regulators about revenues it improperly recorded. S.E.C. regulators ultimately found that $511 million in revenue and $91 million in pretax income were prematurely recorded in the 2000 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30 that year. Another $637 million and $379 million in pretax income should not have been recognized at all.
 Lucent subsequently restated $679 million in sales, an act that prompted 54 class-action lawsuits by investors, who said they were intentionally misled by the company. 
 In December, Lucent settled those cases by agreeing to pay $517 million in cash and shares as compensation for shareholders, bond holders and other investors.
 In addition to improperly booking sales, Lucent employees on at least 10 occasions made illegal agreements with customers, including WinStar, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2001. 
 The three executives who settled with the government had worked on the WinStar account. William Plunkett, vice president for Lucent's Emerging Service Provider, will pay $110,000; Deborah Harris, who worked with Mr. Plunkett, will pay $100,000; and Vanessa Petrini, who reported to Ms. Harris, will pay a $60,000 fine and an additional $132,992 related to profits and interest on illegally booked sales.
 A Lucent spokeswoman said three of the nine executives named by the government are still working for the company, but declined to name them, leaving open the question of whether some defendants are still making accounting and management decisions at Lucent.
 The case against David Ackerman, the former WinStar executive, has not been settled.
 The settlements with Mr. Plunkett, Ms. Harris and Ms. Petrini, though, could foreshadow a coming criminal investigation. Prosecutors often try to reach agreements with midlevel employees and offer them immunity in future cases against more important executives, legal experts say.
 ''If there is a criminal case, they'll need some people to testify,'' said Bradford C. Lewis, a partner at Fenwick & West in Mountain View, Calif., who worked for seven years as an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District of California. ''It's a typical strategy.''

HEADLINE: A Filmed Taste of Lives Changed Since the Brown Case in 1954

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
On the evening before his documentary ''With All Deliberate Speed'' opened in theaters last week, the director Peter Gilbert had the singular career pleasure of showing it at the Library of Congress before an audience that included Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the Supreme Court and Cecilia Marshall, the widow of Justice Thurgood Marshall.
 And while Mr. Gilbert's take on the varied meanings of the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation case is one of several current documentaries on the topic, it is the only one playing in theaters nationwide.
 For Mr. Gilbert (who was the cinematographer and a producer for the acclaimed 1994 documentary ''Hoop Dreams,'' about a chase for basketball stardom), the only thing missing in Washington were his children, Leo and Fay. They were home in Chicago, taking school tests. But as Mr. Gilbert, who is white, said in a recent interview, their absence was tempered by the realization that both attend a public magnet school that has managed a strict racial balance, a legacy of the Brown decision handed down by the Supreme Court on May 17, 1954. 
 This 50th anniversary year of that decision has had the expected rush of books, articles, conversations and films about the issues explicit and implicit in Brown: race, education, class. Marshall argued the case before the court on which he later sat as the first black Supreme Court justice, starting in 1967.
 Mr. Gilbert, 46, whose many documentary credits include, ''Vietnam: Long Time Coming'' and ''Southern Tour,'' about race relations in Jackson, Miss., said he had a couple of goals when he began the film last September. He wanted to capture the lives of the mostly unknown plaintiffs in the five cases from around the country that were combined to become Brown v. Board of Education (from the case in Topeka, Kan.) when they reached the Supreme Court. He also wanted to get at the current reality of Brown's legacy.
 So (to the dislike of some critics) ''Deliberate Speed'' weaves back and forth between older people telling their stories and young people talking about their schools today. The focus is on two of the Brown cases: one in Farmville, Va., in Prince Edward County, which started with a student boycott led by 16-year-old Barbara Johns, and one in Summerton, S.C., in Clarendon County, which began with a father's request for a ''colored'' school bus so his children would not have to walk more than seven miles to school.
 Between the interviews and the archival scenes are the actors Joe Morton, Alicia Keys, Mekhi Phifer, Larenz Tate and Terry Kinney in dramatic readings. The audience in Mr. Gilbert's head was always young people.
 ''While I'm glad the film is in theaters, I look forward to it having another life when groups of schoolchildren are able to see it,'' said Mr. Gilbert, who is the film's producer and cinematographer as well as the director. He spoke in the offices of CameraPlanet, the Manhattan company that distributed his film theatrically. ''My hope is that it sparks some conversations about race.''
 The film, which takes its title from the high court's declaration in Brown that desegregation be carried out ''with all deliberate speed,'' opened on Friday in New York, Washington, Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago.
 At least two other major documentaries about the decision also use schoolchildren and contemporary stories to explore topics like busing, self-segregation, academic tracking, testing and the impact of economics.
 Stanley Nelson's ''Beyond Brown: Pursuing the Promise,'' which had its premiere on PBS last week and will be repeated this month, is a sweeping look at those issues since 1954. Mr. Nelson is an award-winning filmmaker whose 2003 documentary on the 1955 murder of Emmett Till played a role in the government's reopening of the case last week.
 ''Beyond Brown,'' includes the stories of two young black women, one from a struggling school who failed a standardized test and one who benefits academically and socially from being bused.
 And ''I Sit Where I Want: The Legacy of Brown v. Board of Education'' had its debut on Monday on the N, an MTV offshoot that bills itself as a nighttime cable network for tweens and teens. It will be repeated tomorrow. The hourlong film follows students at a racially mixed magnet school in Buffalo as they try to get their fellow students to do more racial mingling in the lunchroom and as biracial pairs spent time in each other's homes.
 That film was produced and directed by Whitney B. Dow, 42, who is white, and Marco Williams, 47, who is black. In 1998 they created Two Tone Productions, a New York-based company that makes documentaries about racial issues. Their feature-length film, ''Two Towns of Jasper,'' which examined the 1998 racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Tex., won several awards. Mr. Byrd was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged down rural roads for nearly three miles until his head and right shoulder came off.
 Given a mandate by the N to do something about the Brown anniversary, the filmmakers said they decided on a project jointly with the students. Mr. Dow led the discussions with white students, Mr. Williams with the black ones. Beyond airing their grievances and observations, they had a goal of lunchroom desegregation.
 ''One of the things that caught me off-guard was how aware they were of the self-segregation, with how comfortable they were with it,'' Mr. Dow said of the ''I sit'' film. ''I guess I was expecting more politically correct blather.'' Rather, he said, when he asked the white students to explore some advantages of whiteness, they talked about how low-income whites are disadvantaged compared with blacks who benefit from affirmative action.
 Mr. Gilbert said he completed his film with feelings of both hope and anger. ''One of the most incredible things I learned from the film was here were an oppressed people who believed in the constitution more than the people in power did,'' he said.
 The deliberate slowness and political timidity of the Supreme Court in dismantling desegregation allowed a racist backlash to fester, he said, making ''all deliberate speed'' a mockery.
 He also wondered, he said, if he could have been as courageous as the people he met, who resisted laws and customs at a great price. His camera caught Howard Smith in Prince Edward Country, Va., sobbing as he told how he and his sister were shipped off to white foster parents in Baltimore because school officials shut down the entire county school system for five years rather than desegregate. Other families endured everything from cross burnings to death threats. 
 Mr. Gilbert said he was captivated by the idea that people found a cause for which they were willing to die.
 ''I ask kids today, 'What are you willing to die for?' '' Mr. Gilbert said. ''Not one kid has had an answer. From the upper middle class all the way down. White, black, everything.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 30, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A film review of ''With All Deliberate Speed'' on May 14 and an article in The Arts on May 19 about its director, Peter Gilbert, misstated the source of the title. The words were from the Supreme Court's order on carrying out its desegregation ruling in the Brown v. Board of Education case, not from the ruling itself. A recent e-mail message from a reader pointed out the error.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fall, but Building Permits Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
Starts of new housing decreased in April, but permits to build homes exceeded expectations as builders anticipated steady demand underpinned by mortgage rates still relatively low.
 A report from the Commerce Department showed on Tuesday that home builders broke ground at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.969 million units last month, down 2.1 percent from an upward-revised 2.011 million in March. 
Analysts had expected housing starts at a pace of 1.99 million units. 
 ''They are a little lower than expected,'' said Richard Egelton, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Montreal, ''but they are still at pretty stratospheric levels.''
 Building permits, a sign of builder confidence, climbed to 1.999 million units in April, compared with an upward-revised pace of 1.975 million the month before. Analysts had expected permits to remain steady at some 1.95 million units. 
 The bank UBS, in an economic report, said, ''A recent rush to buy homes, telegraphed by yesterday's solid reading on the home builders survey and recent strong mortgage applications, suggests starts will stay robust near term, partly as buyers rush to avoid yet higher mortgage rates ahead.'' 
 The National Association of Home Builders said its housing index, a gauge of builder sentiment on sales and buyer traffic, registered 69 for May, unchanged from April. An index reading above 50 means that more builders see sales conditions as good than as poor. 
 Mortgage rates, which dipped near 40-year lows at the start of 2004, have risen in recent weeks as the economic rebound continues and the Federal Reserve offers stronger hints of increases to come in the benchmark short-term interest rate.

HEADLINE: Big Project Moves Forward on One-Acre Site

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
State and city officials are putting together more than $370 million in tax-exempt financing for a project in Lower Manhattan that is remarkable for the mix of uses on a single acre: an apartment tower, a business school, a dormitory, an art gallery, a hospital, a parking garage and a good-size store.
 The one-million-square-foot building, designed by Frank Gehry for Forest City Ratner Companies, would include 330,000 square feet of space for Pace University, whose main building is across Spruce Street, and a 25,000-square-foot ambulatory care unit for NYU Downtown Hospital, which stands next door on Beekman Street.
 The developers are hoping to get up to $243 million in tax-exempt Liberty Bond financing for the commercial part of the project, up to $130 million in Liberty Bond financing for the residential tower and about $10 million in tax savings for Pace, which will lease its space with an option to buy it after eight years.
 The state Liberty Development Corporation is expected today to formally declare its intent to issue the bonds for the commercial portion of the project. 
 Cobbling together such a complex financing package for such diverse users has involved tough negotiations.
 ''We clearly used the carrot and the stick in order to get this done,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday in a telephone interview.
 ''It's a very complicated deal,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''but it seemed to us to make such sense to have Pace and Forest City Ratner and NYU Downtown Hospital as partners. Everybody compromised.''
 A key stumbling block was a kind of paradox involving Pace and NYU Downtown. On one hand, to ensure its economic health, the hospital needed to get a good price for the parking lot on which the new tower is to be built. (One bond application form put the acquisition cost at $42 million.) But the higher the development cost, the harder it became for Pace, a nonprofit institution, to afford to be a part of the project.
 ''While the developer was open to discussions with Pace about its tenancy, it also has an alternative, high-value development strategy involving a fully residential building,'' according to a memorandum from Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, to the directors of the Liberty Development Corporation.
 ''After protracted negotiations,'' the memo continued, ''both sides had essentially walked away from the table and the developer was prepared to proceed with a residential deal. It was only significant pressure from the city that got the sides talking again.''
 What justified the effort, said Andrew M. Alper, the president of the City Economic Development Corporation, was that ''you have, in one project, an awful lot of elements that all add to the recovery of Lower Manhattan.'' That includes 600 students in the Pace dormitory, who will ''provide traffic for retailers downtown and enliven the streets.''
 Officials said the project would provide the equivalent of 1,546 full-time jobs in construction and development. They emphasized that no final actions had been taken yet on any of the applications. A similar point was made by David A. Caputo, the president of Pace, who said the deal awaited the approval of the university board.
 In addition to the dormitory, Pace would use its space to house the Lubin School of Business, other classrooms, an art gallery, the admissions office and dining areas.
 ''We see this as a major reaffirmation of our investment and commitment to Lower Manhattan and also to the business and corporate community,'' Dr. Caputo said. ''It gives a sense of an urban campus.''
 Forest City Ratner, which is the development partner of The New York Times Company in its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, has kept quiet about its downtown project during the negotiations and preliminary design work.
 James P. Stuckey, the executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, said yesterday that it is still too early even to say how tall the structure will be, since much depends on the layout of the apartment tower (estimated at 45 stories all by itself), the dormitory, the business school, the hospital unit and the plaza at the base of the building.
 The expected action by the Liberty Development Corporation today would allow the developer to begin spending money that would eventually be reimbursable from the bond financing.
 Given the involvement of Mr. Gehry, who is working for Forest City Ratner on the proposed Brooklyn arena for the Nets basketball team, Mr. Stuckey said, ''We have a lot of confidence that this building will become a postcard for Lower Manhattan.''
 He added, ''We love to do complicated projects.''

HEADLINE: Old Reflexes Hurting 2 Asian Economic Giants

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 18 

 BODY:
The more signs China and India have given in recent weeks that they may be drifting back toward a bigger government role in the economy, the more investors have punished their stock markets. 
 Though one is a democracy and the other a one-party dictatorship, India and China have followed similar economic policy arcs over the last half-century: decades of pervasive state intervention, with mostly dismal results, and then a shift in recent years toward deregulation and free markets, with spectacular results. 
 But investors have seen unhappy reminders of old habits in both countries lately. Leftists have gained greater influence in India's national elections, threatening to slow the sale of state-owned companies. China is trying to slow its fast-growing economy with more and more severe administrative dictates. 
 ''The biggest risk in China is the latent command-economy mentality,'' said Li Hui, head of China research for Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia. 
 To be sure, stock prices around the world have been falling in recent weeks, in response to rising oil prices, worries about Iraq and the prospect of higher interest rates in the United States. But the setbacks have been especially severe in India and China, which had two of the world's best-performing stock markets last year.
 The stock market in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, which nearly doubled in value last year, fell 6 percent on Friday and 11 percent on Monday after the opposition Congress Party defeated the ruling coalition at the polls and seemed to need the support of the Communist Party to form a new government.
 But on Tuesday, the benchmark Indian market index -- anticipating a decision to yield the leadership by Sonia Gandhi, head of the Congress Party and a politician seen as willing to cut deals with leftists on economic issues -- rebounded 8.3 percent. Investors were cheered by the possibility that Manmohan Singh, a former finance minister who helped start India's shift toward less government control of the economy in 1991, could be the Congress Party's choice instead. [World Business, Page W1.]
 For Chinese stocks, the damage has been more extensive and has lasted longer. Even after rising 3.9 percent on Tuesday, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, made up of big state-controlled mainland companies whose shares trade in Hong Kong, was still down by more than one-quarter from its high early in April. The index more than doubled in 2003, with practically all the gains posted late in the year, as China was being hailed for its apparent transformation into an increasingly free-market powerhouse reaping huge benefits from globalization.
 To brake what many economists describe as overheating in broad sections of the economy, including real estate, steel and autos, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao promised on May 6 that the government would take forceful action. That action has turned out to be re-regulation. 
 Officials have ordered limits on bank loans to a long list of industries, from textiles to printing. They have restricted the conversion of farmland to other uses, and have even had local officials detained for pursuing industrial projects that did not get advance approval from the central government.
 But Beijing has not used the policy tools that would be more familiar in market economies, like allowing the currency to appreciate or raising interest rates.
 Many economists say that an interest rate increase could still come any day. But new figures from the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday suggested that the impetus for a rate increase was fading. Investment in apartment buildings, factories and other fixed assets in April was 34.7 percent higher than a year earlier, the bureau said -- an extremely rapid growth rate, yet lower than the torrid March increase of 43.5 percent.
 ''Today's data are the first sign that an overheated economy is cooling,'' Tim Condon, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of ING, wrote in a report late Tuesday. 
 Still, industrial output, bank lending and foreign investment and lending continue to barrel ahead, according to figures released late last week, while inflation rose in April to 3.8 percent -- the highest year-over-year increase for a month in seven years.
 Li Yang, a member of the Chinese central bank's monetary policy committee, warned on Monday, ''If consumer prices become uncontrollable -- that is, rising above the bearable limit of 5 percent -- China may have to raise interest rates.''
 Economists tend to worry more about China's economy these days than India's, notwithstanding the election results. Accelerating Indian economic growth over the last few years has come partly from good harvests, but also from improved productivity and greater consumer demand by the upper middle class.
 By contrast, China's economy, while benefiting from foreign investment and rising exports, has relied more on heavy investment in new factories and apartment buildings. This construction has been financed mainly by loans from state-owned banks, which have an extremely poor track record foretelling viable projects from white elephants.
 Borrowers are not making timely payments on nearly half the banks' outstanding loans, often shielded by political connections and China's very weak debt-collection laws.
 The slide in Chinese stock prices is forcing delays in the initial public offerings of a series of Chinese companies. Some of the country's biggest and most reputable enterprises sold shares last year, raising about $19 billion in equity capital, led by the China Life Insurance Company's $3.5 billion offering. 
 But by and large, Chinese companies still rely overwhelmingly on bank loans -- much more so than even in Germany, where banks are much more important in corporate finance than in the United States.
 The financial disclosure and corporate governance requirements that go with being listed on stock exchanges have forced some discipline on those Chinese companies that have gone public. The recent decline in share prices is likely to set back that process, which Fred Hu, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said China badly needed.
 ''The biggest problem,'' Mr. Hu said, ''would be to hold back the structural reforms.''

HEADLINE: Tenant Outcry Pre-empts a Hearing on Rents in Nassau

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y., May 17 

 BODY:
If New York City's rent regulations seem problematic, consider Nassau County's system.
 Nassau's Rent Guidelines Board met here on Monday night for what was supposed to be this year's first hearing on rent rates, but it never happened.
 Instead, tenants and their two board representatives staged a walkout and threatened a boycott of future proceedings, accusing the system of favoring landlords.
 Among their complaints is that one of the designated public board members, who is supposed to be a neutral buffer between the landlord and tenant representatives, is a partner in the most prominent New York City law firm representing landlords. 
 Tenants also object that the board refuses to hold hearings in Hempstead, even though that village has half of Nassau's estimated 13,000 to 16,000 rent-regulated apartments. And they object that the board started hearings without releasing the annual report on landlord income and expenses, a basic document for calculating rents.
 ''We won't participate in a farce,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide group.
 The board's chairwoman, Catherine Kirk, called the walkout unfortunate and said it had deprived the board of testimony. Another member, John A. Mastromarino, called the exodus ''pretty grotesque.''
 The hearing effectively ended when the board's two tenant members proposed postponing it until the landlord income and expense report is filed, but they were outvoted. They stood up and left, joined by about 20 tenants in the audience.
 Two speakers who stayed were Hempstead's deputy mayor and a village councilman, who expressed concern that some board members had indicated a fear of meeting in Hempstead, which is mostly black and Hispanic. Mrs. Kirk, who is white, denied that contention and said that hearings would be held there ''in another year, I am sure.''
 This year's remaining hearings, on May 26 and June 8, will be in the Nassau County Legislature's chamber in Garden City, which has no rent-regulated apartments. Mrs. Kirk said that location ''is very close to Hempstead, and it isn't a hardship to get there.''
 Mr. McKee said: ''What's really going on is that they want to discourage turnout by tenants. A lot of people in Hempstead are poor, they don't have cars, and many are working two jobs to make ends meet, so it's really unfair.''
 After the Hempstead officials sat down, the rent board adjourned the session without any discussion of rents.
 In the lobby, tenants aired their complaints. The rent boards in New York City and Westchester County provide the landlord data before their hearings, said Mr. McKee, adding, ''It's pathetic but typical that the process in Nassau is backwards.''
 Tenants objected to Robert D. Goldstein, who has served as a public board member since 1998. He is a partner at Borah Goldstein Altschuler Schwartz & Nahins, New York City's biggest landlord law firm, a role that critics say poses a conflict of interest.
 Last year Mr. Goldstein never heard the testimony on Nassau's rents because he missed all four hearings, tenant groups say. But he showed up in time to vote with the landlord members for increases of 5 percent for one-year leases and 8 percent for two years.
 Those increases far exceeded inflation and came despite growing landlord profits, with an average net operating income over expenses of about 34 percent, critics said.
 Mr. Goldstein, the only one of the nine board members who was absent on Monday, defended his record in a telephone interview. He has always acted as ''someone trying to represent the interest of the public,'' he said. His law firm has ''virtually no practice in Nassau County, certainly none I'm involved in,'' he said.
 Three decades ago, as a tenant leader from Great Neck, Mr. Goldstein said, he served as a tenant member on the board for two years. And three years ago, he said, he sponsored a measure to help elderly tenants, angering landlords, who sued and overturned it.
 Tenant groups have long agitated for Mr. Goldstein's removal, and a replacement is finally in the works. But the County Legislature and the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal have been delayed in approving the new member, so Mr. Goldstein is lingering in office
 ''That a prominent landlord attorney should be a public member is an outrage,'' said the president of the Long Beach Tenants Coalition, Robert A. Rychlowski. ''It's a travesty that it has gone on as long as it has.''

HEADLINE: Errors Cited at Adelphia Trial

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A former vice president of the Adelphia Communications Corporation, James R. Brown, testified yesterday that the indictment of the company's founder, John J. Rigas, and two of his sons contained errors about fraud charges against the men.
 The 102-page indictment contends that Adelphia falsely claimed 5,300,517 basic cable subscribers on May 15, 2000. After reviewing documents, Mr. Brown said the actual number was 5,003,517, a number misstated in both the original indictment in September 2002, and an amended one filed nine months later. 
 ''Would you agree that the superseding indictment overstates the number of subscribers by approximately 297,000?'' Andrew J. Levander, a lawyer for Michael J. Rigas, asked Mr. Brown during his 10th day of testimony in Federal District Court in New York. Mr. Brown confirmed the errors in the 133rd paragraph of a 214-paragraph indictment.
 Mr. Levander asked about the differences during cross-examination to try to raise doubt about the government's case.
 Mr. Brown is testifying against John Rigas; two of his sons, Michael and Timothy; and a fourth man, Michael C. Mulcahey. All four are charged with bank fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of Adelphia.
 Mr. Brown, who pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges, is cooperating with prosecutors as part of a plea bargain. 
 The Rigases' indictment also misstated when Adelphia falsely claimed subscribers in Venezuela, Mr. Brown testified. The indictment contends that the inflation first occurred in the first quarter of 2000. Mr. Brown said the correct date was the third quarter.
 During cross-examination last week by Paul R. Grand, a lawyer for Timothy J. Rigas, Mr. Brown said prosecutors made another mistake in a transcript of a tape recording of a May 16, 2000, conference call with analysts. Mr. Brown said that Timothy Rigas, the former chief financial officer, falsely said the company upgraded about 60 percent of its cable lines to send and receive data.
 Mr. Grand played a tape of the call, and Mr. Brown said that he, not Timothy Rigas, made the false claim.
 ''That's what the tape indicates,'' Mr. Brown said last week. ''I was relying on the transcript before.''

HEADLINE: Suburban Sprawl? Study Says Trend Became History in 90's

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
A half-century of suburbanization paused in the late 1990's, even as public concern about suburban sprawl grew, according to a report on economic and demographic trends in 31 counties in and around New York City.
 The area's suburban ring continued to gain residents and jobs, but its core urban areas gained in those areas too, at nearly identical rates, reversing a pattern that began in 1945, the study found. It was written by two researchers at Rutgers, James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca, and will be released today. 
 ''I think there really is a fundamental shift going on,'' Dr. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, said in an interview, ''and the patterns of the last 50 years really are history.''
 The data match the public mood of recent years, he added: ''After 50 years of suburban growth, the psychology was, 'We don't want any more.''' 
 Development throughout the region accelerated in the 1990's, a decade in which the population increased by 1.8 million. In the preceding 21 years, it had grown by just 306,000.
 But Dr. Hughes and Dr. Seneca, a professor at the Bloustein school, found that much of that development was in the ''urban core,'' the five boroughs of New York City, and Hudson, Essex and Union Counties in New Jersey. A critical measure of that shift, Dr. Hughes said, is the distribution of new housing. The core counties' share of new building permits had declined to 15.7 percent in 1994; it grew to 39 percent in 2002. The core area matched the other 23 counties in population growth starting in 1990, Dr. Hughes said, and employment growth in the core caught up in the late 1990's, for the first time since World War II.
 Dr. Hughes, a demographer, and Professor Seneca, an economist, attributed the trends in part to traffic constraints in the suburbs and a shortage of land for development, especially as open-space preservation programs expanded. 
 They also found that housing demand was shifting away from single-family suburban development, and would continue to do so. 
 ''We get empty-nesters who were rattling around in their McMansions,'' Dr. Hughes said, while ''children of the baby boomers are the second great-growth sector. Both of these groups are not single-family-home-centric.''
 A third group, immigrants, favored urban housing, he said, which had fed higher-than-expected growth in the urban areas of northeastern New Jersey during the 1990's.

PERSON: Henry J. Everett

HEADLINE: Henry J. Everett, 78, Investor; Led Philanthropic Foundation

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Henry J. Everett, a New York investment manager, supporter of many Jewish, educational and cultural institutions and namesake of the acclaimed Everett Children's Adventure Garden in the Bronx, died on Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.
 The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Everett was the founder and longtime president of Lexington Associates, an investment partnership. For as many years, he also was in a philanthropic partnership with his wife, Edith. Their foundation, established in 1957, annually makes scores of donations ranging from seed money to million-dollar grants.
 The Everett Children's Adventure Garden, a 12-acre preserve, opened at the New York Botanical Garden in 1998, meandering past a marshy pond across a bridge into the city's oldest surviving forest. It cost $9 million to build and was hailed by the National Science Foundation as the most ambitious children's education project of its kind.
 Mr. Everett also established a Public Service Internship Program that in 15 years has placed about 2,000 college students in public service agencies that provide them with a summer's worth of job experience.
 Mr. Everett was a supporter of the national Teach for America corps and sat on the board of Hillel, the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life. He was an officer or board member of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the American Jewish Committee and the UJA-Federation of New York.
 Mr. Everett and his wife founded the Everett Comprehensive School in Hatzor, Israel, and continued to back the economic development of that town. He also benefited social and educational projects for Israel's minority Druse population.
 He was on the President's Council of National Public Radio, and he and his wife were also ardent supporters of the antismoking movement.
 Henry Everett was born to immigrant parents in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn. He began studying economics at Columbia but served with the Army combat engineers in the Philippines before graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1947.
 Two years later, he received a master's degree in finance at the Columbia School of Business and went to work for Abraham & Straus department stores. Doing market research he began to invest in securities and to advise friends about the ways of Wall Street.
 With the help of Edith, who got her broker's license, he was able to turn securities management into a profitable venture. He quit Abraham & Straus and in the early 1970's formed Lexington Associates. He retired as president in the mid-1990's, but remained active in business until 2002.
 Besides the former Edith Brenner, his wife of 54 years, he is survived by a son, David F., of Larchmont, N.Y.; a daughter, Carolyn, of Manhattan; a sister, Roslyn Mandelbaum, of Delray Beach, Fla.; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Wilmington Offices Revive Former Industrial Area

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., May 18 

 BODY:
A handful of recent office projects on this city's historic Christina River waterfront are challenging a long-held belief by planners and officials here that entertainment and recreational development is crucial to reviving the former industrial area.
 Despite years of planning and millions of public dollars spent to redevelop the area south of the central business district into a regional leisure-time destination, most of the major development activity in the last four years has been in office buildings for private businesses.
 Within the past year alone, more than $50 million in office projects were started or completed, including the $8 million renovation of a 1905-6 railroad building designed by the noted Philadelphia architect Frank Furness for the ING Direct savings bank. 
 The waterfront is now one of the state's most active office development locations in an otherwise weak market. Next year at this time, about 3,000 people are expected to be working there. 
 The latest project was started last Thursday when ground was broken on a $28 million headquarters for AAA Mid-Atlantic, one of the nation's top five car clubs. 
 After being in Philadelphia for more than 100 years, AAA Mid-Atlantic, which has planned its relocation for 2005, is proof to many that office development has more momentum on the riverfront than the original plans for shops and major art exhibitions.
 ''Urban planning is kind of like chemistry -- you never quite know how it's going to come together,'' said David L. Ames, professor of urban affairs at the University of Delaware. 
 Most of the projects are in a 1.5-mile stretch on the north side of the river from the Amtrak passenger station on South French Street to South Madison Street on the west. But office development is under way on both sides of the river, where property is divided among more than a dozen large and small landowners. 
 Office users can quickly list reasons they find the waterfront desirable.
 Arkadi Kuhlmann, chief executive of ING Direct, said a leading attraction was the easy rail and highway access to both New York and Washington. When he found a brick warehouse on the Christina River four years ago while scouting along Interstate 95, he was struck by its proximity to the Amtrak station. 
 ''That's Wilmington's big hidden secret,'' said the Canadian-born Mr. Kuhlmann. 
 What's more, Mr. Kuhlmann said, he was impressed by the unconventional appeal of the former industrial area. The savings bank, which deals with customers online, by traditional mail and telephone, or through its own Internet cafes, was not interested in moving into a homogeneous suburban park, he said. 
 ''When I looked at it and saw all the old buildings I thought it was perfect for offices,'' he said.
 Since 2000, ING Direct, the savings bank arm of the Dutch banking and insurance giant ING Group, has invested about $20 million in three historic buildings on the river, including renovating two railroad buildings designed by Mr. Furness. 
 Allen J. DeWalle, president of the nonprofit AAA Mid-Atlantic, said he made several trips to the waterfront to look at all the renovated buildings when the club made the decision to move out of Philadelphia.
 Thanks to a series of mergers in the 1990's, the club now serves 3.5 million members from northern New Jersey to southern Virginia.
 The Philadelphia office near 20th and Market Streets was constructed in 1968, had become too small and was no longer convenient for employees who travel to the club's more distant locations.
 Mr. DeWalle visited the headquarters of Juniper Bank, a credit card operation that moved into a historic shipbuilding structure just west of ING Direct in 2001. Juniper occupies an early 20th-century building where marine boilers were once manufactured in the Harlan plant of Bethlehem Steel. 
 The Riverfront Development Corporation, the state-supported company charged with redeveloping the riverfront, spent $15 million on the project. Now, Juniper is considering expanding on the river.
 The presence of both ING Direct and Juniper was a big factor in the decision to move to Wilmington, Mr. DeWalle said. The club rejected waterfront development in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J., because, as yet, they have not achieved a critical mass of office buildings, he said.
 ''It would have meant being too much of a pioneer,'' Mr. DeWalle said.
 Tevebaugh Associates, a Wilmington architectural firm, has designed a six-story red brick building for AAA Mid-Atlantic that will pick up the maritime features of the historic buildings, said the firm's president, James A. Tevebaugh.
 ''It's designed to give the impression that the building has gone through a series of expansions and additions,'' Mr. Tevebaugh said.
 The 150,000-square-foot building is being developed by the Commonwealth Group of Wilmington for AAA Mid-Atlantic, which signed a 15-year lease. 
 While there are restaurants on the riverfront, and a tiny version of Boston's Quincy Market, office users like the business feel of the area, said Philip Lipper, a managing director in the Edison, N.J., office of Julian J. Studley Inc., the real estate services concern that represented AAA Mid-Atlantic.
 Another attractive feature was the uncongested parklike nature of the waterfront, Mr. DeWalle said. 
 ''It kind of gave you the feel of an office park and yet it has all the amenities of being in the city,'' Mr. DeWalle said.
 The scene was far different 25 years ago when the area was full of decrepit buildings left over from the district's heyday as a shipyard and railroad car manufacturing center.
 Unlike the rocky and romantic Brandywine River nearby, the Christina in Wilmington is in the coastal plain and has a languid marshland beauty. It was on the banks of the tidal Christina that Swedes landed in 1638 to build the first permanent European settlement in the Delaware Valley.
 In the 19th and early 20th century, the flat banks of the navigable river had grown into a major shipbuilding center that supplied vessels for the Civil War and World War II. The area went into decline after the war and became isolated from the downtown as development moved north and west.
 Some of those buildings fell into disuse after the war, and became the foundation for the office renaissance of the last few years.
 The State of Delaware has spent more than $100 million on projects to spruce up the waterfront and spur development. One feature is a pedestrian walkway along the river with a park near the Amtrak station.
 The recent activity of office users like ING Direct, Juniper and AAA Mid-Atlantic has resulted in one speculative building project, although Wilmington's office market continues to struggle with high vacancies. The rate stands at 21.3 percent, up from the 10-year average of 17.7 percent, according to Jackson Cross Partners of Wilmington.
 A major landowner on the riverfront has started a $5 million renovation and expansion of a former office building from the World War II era. Pettinaro Enterprises of Newport, Del., which bought 86 acres on the river in 1986 for $1.2 million when it was still a wasteland, is asking $25 to $27 a square foot annually for space in the 60,000-square-foot building. AAA Mid-Atlantic is paying about $24 a square foot, Mr. Lipper said.
 Those rates are about 15 percent below top-of-the-market space near Rodney Square, said Pete Davisson, a partner with Jackson Cross Partners. Land is now selling for about $1 million an acre on the riverfront.
 The speculative office construction is a concern to some who worry the waterfront could begin to cannibalize the already soft downtown market.
 ''I think the development that has occurred on the riverfront to date has been very rational,'' said Christopher F. Buccini, a partner in Buccini/Pollin Group of New Castle, Del., a real estate development company that is building a new $12 million headquarters for its business on the south side of the Christina River. ''Fortunately, there isn't a lot of land left for speculative office development.''
 Michael S. Purzycki, executive director of the Riverfront Development Corporation, the state-supported company charged with redeveloping the waterfront, said that while the offices were ''a welcome turn of events,'' he did not want the area to be in competition with downtown. He said the riverfront corporation would not support any more speculative office development on the river.
 ''We don't want a whole lot more of offices. Now, we would like to start going back to those entertainment ideas we had earlier,'' he said.

HEADLINE: I.O.C. Misses Opportunity for Change

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
ALL that was lacking yesterday morning from a buoyant Bryant Park was a campfire and a rousing chorus of ''Kumbaya.'' This being Midtown Manhattan, celebration was instead served up in the form of breakfast croissants and an affirmative call from the International Olympic Committee.
 ''Two hurdles down, one to go,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gushed after the news from Lausanne, Switzerland, that New York City's drive for the 2012 Summer Olympics would march on, in full stride with City Hall as it champions a West Side Olympic stadium that would ultimately house the Jets. 
 As hurdles go, consider yesterday's more of a modest leap over a crack in the asphalt; the I.O.C.'s executive committee did some spring weaning in its latest episode of urban survivor, to be concluded in July 2005. 
 In: Paris, Madrid, London, New York and Moscow, rated in that order. Out: Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Havana and Leipzig, Germany. 
 ''My guess is they were pretty consistent with what the reports said about the technical capabilities of cities to host the games,'' said Jay L. Kriegel, the executive director of NYC2012.
 Whatever the criteria, the process of trimming the field to five from nine was another sad example of I.O.C. business as usual. Lost on the bureaucrats was the opportunity to promote the Olympics as a global enterprise, to follow the lead of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, which last week showed vision and courage by awarding South Africa the 2010 World Cup.
 New continent. New world. New order. The I.O.C. instead chose to eliminate the most intriguing aspirants. Rio was bidding to become the first South American host of the Games. Istanbul would have been a stirring choice in a time when people fear a war of civilizations and when a show of inclusiveness could have really counted.
 The Istanbul bid director, Yalcin Aksoy, said, ''A unique opportunity to stage the Games, for the first time in history, in a country with a predominantly Muslim population dedicated to secular parliamentary democracy is turned down.'' 
 The Brazilians called their rejection political. The Cubans accused the Olympics of prioritizing commercialism over pure sport. No doubt the rejected cities are lacking in infrastructure or luxury suites for fat cats in blazers, but by pitting New York against four European capitals, the I.O.C. continued a virtual century-old rotation that has placed 83 percent of all Olympics in European or North American cities. Close enough to satisfy American networks' prime-time needs and far, far away from where people of color reign. 
 They will always say it's about the facilities, but Bloomberg's buddy, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, has managed to hang this entire New York City movement on a radical West Side plan that even Kriegel conceded would be ''an enormously complicated project to pull off.''
 In its research on the NYC2012 bid, the I.O.C. executive committee apparently didn't bother to interview many West Side residents, who stand to be uprooted or put upon for years -- unlike the suburban journalists, including me, who just think the stadium would be better off in Queens.
 The naysayers, as Kriegel called them, aren't the only people worth listening to. There are respected sports men and women who are part of the NYC2012 team, like Bob Beamon, who grew up in Jamaica, Queens, and Allan Steinfeld of the New York Road Runners.
 Yesterday, I was introduced to Gail Marquis, who once rode the Q4 bus to Queens College, where she played for one of the early women's basketball powerhouses. She also played for the United States women's team in the 1976 Olympics.
 She now lives in Jersey City and works for J.P. Morgan Chase, but found her way to the NYC2012 board and has switched roles, from player to cheerleader.
 ''Maybe Dan Doctoroff has indoctrinated me,'' she said. ''But I bit the apple. I drank the juice. I look at this as part of the economic development of the city, as a way to improve and clean up the infrastructure, redo your subways, build more housing.''
 Bloomberg made sure he mentioned the poll in which 77 percent of New Yorkers said they wanted the Olympics. Unmentioned was a more ominous statistic, that No. 4 I.O.C. ranking. Not to mention, the difficulty of landing another Olympics in North America, at a time when the United States is not exactly winning world popularity contests, and after the 2010 Winter Games were awarded to Vancouver.
 Different country. Same continent. Old order. If it turns out it's Europe's turn in 2012, New York will be left with no Olympic party to plan for, only a remodeled view from New Jersey that colors the city Gang Green. Who besides the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, and Fireman Ed, his first fan, is dreaming of that?
 Asked yesterday if the football stadium could be used for a later Olympic bid should this one fail, Kriegel hedged. ''Our expectation is that the stadium will probably be built in Olympic configuration initially,'' he said. ''What will happen once it gets closed up, that's speculation.''
 In other words, it's 2012 or never. Once the Jets take possession, New York will be no more an Olympic city than Havana.

HEADLINE: Bush Asserts Israel's Right to Self-Defense

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
President Bush delivered a strong message of support for Israel to a pro-Israeli lobbying group on Tuesday, saying that Israel has a right to defend itself from terrorism and again backing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's proposal to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank.
 Mr. Bush was greeted with chants of ''four more years'' as he was introduced to the organization, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose members went on to cheer him repeatedly as he reiterated his view that the primary impediment to peace in the Middle East was the unwillingness of the Palestinian leadership to renounce terrorism. 
 The president's appearance before the group, known as Aipac, continued the White House's efforts to capitalize on his strong support for Israel to win over Jewish voters, who traditionally support Democrats by a large margin in presidential contests, in this year's election.
 ''The Israeli people have always had enemies at their borders and terrorists close at hand,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Again and again, Israel has defended itself with skill and heroism. And as a result of the courage of the Israeli people, Israel has earned the respect of the American people.''
 Mr. Bush alluded only in passing to the grievances of the Palestinians, and he only briefly mentioned the current fighting in Gaza, where Israeli forces reportedly killed at least 19 Palestinians on Tuesday in one of the biggest military operations there in years.
 ''The unfolding violence in the Gaza Strip is troubling and underscores the need for all parties to seize every opportunity for peace,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush drew parallels between the fight against terrorism being waged by the United States and Israel's battles with the Palestinians and their supporters. As he has for the past two years, he cast himself not as an honest broker for peace but as an ally of Israel in pressuring the Palestinian people to reject the leadership of Yasir Arafat, abandon terrorism and embark on a path of political and economic reform.
 ''The United States is strongly committed, and I am strongly committed, to the security of Israel as a vibrant Jewish state,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Israel is a democracy and a friend, and has every right to defend itself from terror.''
 Without mentioning that Mr. Sharon is scrambling to win support within Israel for his plan to withdraw from Gaza and portions of the West Bank, Mr. Bush described the plan as ''a bold, courageous step'' that could help bring about the goal of two states living in peace.
 Support for Israel and Mr. Sharon's government has become a central plank in the foreign policy advocated by conservative Christians, a development that has provided Israel with influential allies within the Republican leadership in Congress and forced Democrats to scramble to retain their hold on a big majority of Jewish voters.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Hysteria

 BODY:
With the election season moving into full swing as Americans start thinking about their summer travel plans, it's sadly predictable that politicians will try to curry favor with voters by playing silly blame games and proposing simplistic quick fixes for rising gasoline prices, which are averaging more than $2 a gallon. A case in point is the demand made yesterday by 20 Senate Democrats that the government release as much as 60 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next two months. 
 President Bush is rightly resisting the call. Since 9/11, the administration has been adding to the reserve in a disciplined manner, and it is closing in on its goal of filling up the reserve's capacity, 700 million barrels. Tapping the reserve to assuage motorists at a time of increasing security threats to already tight fuel supplies would be foolish. 
 As the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, correctly noted yesterday, ''The reserve is not there to simply try to change prices.'' In fact, the law calls for it to be tapped only in the event of supply disruptions. And even if Washington wanted to alleviate rising fuel costs, the reserve is not a very effective instrument for doing so, as President Bill Clinton learned in the fall of 2000. Experts estimate that at most, turning on the spigot now would knock only a few cents off a gallon. 
 Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, knows this, of course, and he demeans the seriousness of his own candidacy when he suggests that President Bush could single-handedly bring down fuel costs. Senator Kerry has urged the administration to stop buying oil for the reserve, as if that would make a difference. Fortunately, some residue of shame has kept him from joining the other Democrats calling for the reserve to be raided. The government's oil purchases have taken place at a time of higher prices, but they are not a major cause of the increase. 
 The real culprit behind rising energy costs is the roaring demand from growing economies, especially China's and the United States', though the volatile situation in the Middle East does seem to add a risk premium. Most of China's energy demand is for industrialization, which, in turn, contributes to the global economic recovery. In contrast, roughly half of the United States' petroleum demand is for personal consumption, primarily for cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s, a situation that, in turn, makes the nation ever more dependent on an increasingly endangered supply of foreign oil. 
 If $2-per-gallon sticker shock slowed sales of Hummers -- which get about 11 miles per gallon -- that would hardly qualify as a national tragedy. 
 Still, even Americans who don't drive gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s are feeling pain at the pump, and responsible political leaders have to prepare the public for this new reality. No comprehensive energy policy should overlook long-term means of encouraging conservation and minimizing our dependence on oil from the Persian Gulf region. Rather than pretending that there are facile switch-flipping fixes, Senator Kerry should be talking about bolstering conservation efforts and fuel economy standards, and encouraging new investment in refining capacity.
 In the meantime, we all need to keep the shrill hyperbole about ''record high'' oil prices in perspective. A barrel of oil now costs more than $40, but when adjusted for inflation, that price is less alarming. During past spikes, oil has cost well over twice that amount in today's dollars. Yes, high fuel costs could ultimately endanger the economic recovery, but there is no reason to believe that they will do so at this level.

HEADLINE: French Stake Seen as Part Of Rescue For Alstom

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER and KATRIN BENNHOLD; Paul Meller reported from Brussels for this article and Katrin Bennhold from Paris.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 18 

 BODY:
France will acquire almost a third of the nearly bankrupt French industrial group Alstom in a proposed rescue bid, and the European Commission will not oppose such a move, people close to the talks said on Tuesday.
 Efforts to safeguard Alstom, beyond a short-term rescue by the French government, appeared to intensify. The company's top executives will meet German politicians and the head of the German industrial group Siemens soon to discuss French-German industrial policy, the German economics minister, Wolfgang Clement, said in Cairo on Tuesday.
 Alstom's chief executive, Patrick Kron, and its chief financial officer, Philippe Jaffre, will meet with the chief executive of Siemens, Heinrich von Pierer; Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany; and the prime minister of France, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, this month or in early June, Mr. Clement said. Mr. Clement said that he and the French finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, would also attend the meeting. 
 The meeting will develop ideas first set forth last week by Mr. Schroder and President Jacques Chirac of France in a joint statement about the need for European governments to intervene to create ''the industrial champions that Europe needs'' to compete with large American companies.
 The European competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said on Monday that he had reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Sarkozy on a rescue of Alstom that would be within the union's state aid rules. The details of the agreement are being fleshed out this week, but neither Mr. Monti nor Mr. Sarkozy gave any hints on the shape of the rescue.
 But a person close to the French government's planning said that 500 million euros of the 800 million euros in cash the French government gave Alstom last summer might be returned to France in the form of stock.
 This would increase the government's stake in Alstom to more than 33.3 percent from around 20 percent now. Any amount above 33.3 percent is considered a controlling stake in France.
 The European Commission would not allow France to take control of Alstom, so the French government is trying to persuade Alstom's banks to also convert at least part of the 1.2 billion euros they are owed into shares, the person said, to dilute the government's stake in the company.
 The banks are looking to convert 700 million euros of the 1.2 billion euros owed into stock, the person said. Thus, as much as 1.2 billion euros of Alstom debt to the state and banks would be turned into stock instead of being repaid.
 To ensure further dilution of the government's stake and also to give the company access to cash, the French government has proposed a capital increase worth about 1 billion euros. Along with the converted debt, that would amount to an increase of about 2.2 billion euros for Alstom, the person said.
 Converting government loans into Alstom shares was initially considered by Mr. Sarkozy's predecessor, Francis Mer, last September. But the European Commission was unhappy about the French state's swapping aid for shares, because it believed that no rational private investor would ever take a stake in a company as troubled as Alstom.
 Now it appears that the commission is ready to accept an equity swap that would hand the French state up to 31.5 percent of Alstom's shares, according to another person who follows Alstom and insisted on not being identified. 
 While meeting the commission's main concerns about the French government's cash injection into Alstom last year, the swap for equity fails to address the regulator's concerns about the loan guarantee of 2.275 billion euros that the state gave Alstom along with the cash injection last year.
 To address this, the company would have to make substantial divestments, the person said. 
 ''The bigger the public stake, the more the firm will have to divest,'' the person said, adding that the move would have to involve sale of core businesses, ''not just peripheral operations.''
 Speaking in New York Tuesday, Mr. Monti said the divestments would have to come from Alstom's transport division, according to a report by Bloomberg News.
 The person said that the French government would agree on the necessary divestments with the European Commission by the end of this week, as well as the creation of partnerships for Alstom divisions with companies like Siemens and Areva, France's state-owned nuclear power station maker. 
 But he added that the exact shape of a final solution for Alstom may not take shape until the end of June. ''The decision has to be adopted by June 30th,'' he said, adding that this would give Mr. Sarkozy the time to explore a French-German solution involving Siemens.

HEADLINE: With Chief Missing, Colombia Militias Gain Leverage

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: SANTAFE DE RALITO, Colombia 

 BODY:
The disappearance and possible murder of Carlos Castano, the longtime leader of Colombia's right-wing paramilitary forces, have increased the bargaining power of the paramilitaries in disarmament negotiations with the government, Western diplomats and human rights officials said in a series of interviews.
 The talks, considered a cornerstone of President Alvaro Uribe's plan to pacify Colombia, stalled after the disappearance of Mr. Castano. To get them moving again, the government in early May granted 10 paramilitary commanders a 142-square-mile safe haven where they could resume negotiations free from threat of arrest or extradition to the United States on drug-trafficking charges.
 But Western diplomats and political analysts questioned the wisdom of embarking on talks with the fierce drug-trafficking militias, which were formed in the early 1980's to fight Marxist rebels. ''These are some of the biggest, most ruthless drug dealers in the world, period,'' a Western diplomat said in early May. ''They are essentially negotiating with much more organized, much more dangerous Pablo Escobars,'' the diplomat said, referring to the late cocaine kingpin. ''Because these guys actually have some clout, and much more organizational skills than the rebels, they are deadly.'' 
 Indeed, some commanders of the group, a loose coalition of paramilitary factions calling itself the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, had discussed in April the assassination of Mr. Uribe as a way of gaining leverage in the negotiations, the president said in an address.
 Critics of the government's bargaining strategy say the paramilitary commanders have no intention of changing their ways. ''The leaders of these groups are under the impression that they can keep pressing the state for additional concessions to ensure that after they pass some sort of bureaucratic procedure they will continue doing business as usual in Colombia, in terms of trafficking and enjoying their wealth and the illicit assets they control,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, who directs operations in Latin America for Human Rights Watch. 
 In the talks with the government that began last fall, Mr. Castano roiled his fellow commanders by recommending that they accept modest prison terms for their crimes and to surrender their ill-gotten fortunes, vast tracts of land and foreign bank accounts. ''He openly expressed that these groups should demobilize, even if it meant paying a few years of jail time or confinement,'' said someone who sits at the table. 
 He had already inflamed them by publicly acknowledging the paramilitary group's role in assassinations and massacres, admitting that 70 percent of its funding came from the cocaine trade and calling on the commanders to stop trafficking. Eighteen of those men, including Diego Fernando Murillo, Salvatore Mancuso, Ivan Roberto Duque and Mr. Castano's older brother, Vicente Castano, were recently classified as major drug traffickers by the United States Treasury Department. 
 Diplomats said the paramilitary leaders were prepared to serve time under house arrest, in their own homes, as long as they could keep their assets. But the commanders balked at imprisonment and forfeiture, and were adamant about gaining a guarantee of protection from American extradition requests, which could result in trial in the United States and long prison terms. 
 Rivalries, exacerbated by the threat of extradition, touched off an internecine war in the 15,000-member paramilitary group. That battle ended, officials and diplomats said, with Mr. Castano's disappearance and the emergence of commanders who American officials say are major drug traffickers.
 Despite Mr. Castano's disappearance, some who sit at the peace table, like the Roman Catholic bishop Julio Cesar Vidal, said in interviews that they doubted that the paramilitaries would battle with the state, since the paramilitaries are likely to get the best deal with Mr. Uribe.
 Still, the possibility of blowback has been worrisome throughout the talks because the paramilitaries, unlike the rebels, are entrenched in Colombia's institutions, including the military, the police and the attorney general's office. Its fighters control whole neighborhoods in many Colombian cities, and the group has been supported in the past by wealthy and influential Colombians.
 ''They are politically very able, which the rebels are not, and they are more popular in certain areas,'' the Western diplomat said of the paramilitaries.
 In a tour in early May of Cordoba, a state in the north that is the traditional heart of the paramilitary movement, it was clear that contrary to the government's assertions, the paramilitaries enjoyed a lock-down control that made them more influential than the traditional enemies of the state, the left-wing guerrillas, ever were. Interviewed here in this town in Cordoba where talks are taking place, a local commander said the organization did everything from paving roads to paying teachers' salaries to punishing law-breakers, even summarily executing those who violate paramilitary edicts.
 ''We are the de-facto state in all areas we occupy -- in health, in education, in roadwork, everything that the state should offer,'' said the commander, who goes by the nom de guerre Miguel Antonio. ''We are the law here.''
 The Self-Defense Forces also draw strength and financing from their close alliance with Colombia's most infamous drug cartel, the Norte del Valle group, which American officials said recently had exported more than 500 metric tons of cocaine worth $10 billion to the United States since 1990. In an indictment against nine cartel members unsealed in Washington, American officials accused the Self-Defense Forces of protecting the cartel's drug routes, laboratories and members.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration, which has extensive operations in Colombia, said the group was even more involved in drug trafficking than were the left-wing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which in recent years have lost control of many of the country's drug-producing regions to the paramilitaries.
 ''They pale in comparison,'' a D.E.A. official who analyzes Colombia's drug trade said of the rebels in a recent interview.
 On the surface, this verdant region is one of tranquillity and prosperity. Cattle graze as far as the eye can see, and people here say the economy is chugging along. Many here claim to live in one of the safest parts of Colombia.
 Miguel Antonio, the local commander in Santafe de Ralito, denies that the group is involved in drug trafficking, or that it would ever battle the government. But he also made clear that paramilitary commanders were not about to serve jail terms, not after they embarked on a war against the rebels because of the government's inability to control its own territory. ''We're illegal,'' he said, ''but we're legitimate.''
 Sitting in his rambling house, drinking coffee and taking calls from friends congratulating him on his 51st birthday, Miguel Antonio pointed to his pet jaguar, Freckles. ''Would you like me to put you in a cage?'' he asked rhetorically. ''Neither would my pet jaguar.''
 He also stressed that the federation was negotiating from a position of strength. ''We are not defeated,'' he said. ''We are strong.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Nominated for 5th Term at Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
President Bush formally nominated Alan Greenspan for a fifth four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, fulfilling a pledge Mr. Bush made last year and reassuring investors about the most powerful economic post in the country.
 Mr. Greenspan, 78, has already been Fed chairman for nearly 17 years and has navigated the economy through the boom of the 1990's as well as through two recessions, two stock market crashes, terrorist attacks and two separate wars in Iraq. 
 If the Senate confirms him to another term as chairman, which is regarded as certain, Mr. Greenspan would be allowed to serve until his separate 14-year term as a Fed governor expires in January 2006. 
 Because Mr. Bush announced nearly a year ago that he wanted Mr. Greenspan to remain at the Fed for another term, the only question in recent weeks was why the White House had waited to nominate him until just one month before his current term expires. 
 Officials at both the White House and Fed said on Wednesday that there had been no last-minute reluctance or, as some on Wall Street had speculated, any intention to pressure the central bank into keeping interest rates low.
 ''Alan Greenspan,'' Mr. Bush said in a written statement on Wednesday, ''has done a superb job as chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve system, and I have great confidence in his economic stewardship.''
 Mr. Greenspan quickly accepted the invitation. ''I am honored to be nominated by President Bush and if confirmed by the Senate, to continue my service as chairman,'' he said in a written statement. 
 Despite his age and his extraordinarily long tenure as Fed chairman, exceeded only by that of William McChesney Martin Jr. from 1951 to 1970, Mr. Greenspan continues to wield enormous power over the economy and to display bold judgment on monetary policy.
 To shore up the economy during a three-year plunge in employment that only now seems to be ending, Mr. Greenspan's Fed sharply cut interest rates, provoking a boom in housing, home-refinancing and consumer spending.
 Mr. Greenspan, a Republican who served as chairman of President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisers, has arguably been Mr. Bush's most powerful ally on economic issues.
 Defying conventional wisdom, Mr. Greenspan's policies of rock-bottom interest rates greatly softened the economic downturn of 2001 and a succession of economic shocks since. 
 Even though business executives drastically cut back on both corporate investment and hiring until late last year, the Fed's low interest rates pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy as homeowners sharply cut their mortgage payments and pulled cash out of their houses through refinancing.
 Only now, after employers have added more than 700,000 jobs in the first four months of 2004, is the Fed expected to start raising rates -- almost certainly beginning at the end of June. 
 Allen Sinai, president of Decision Economics, an economic forecasting firm, said Mr. Greenspan's credibility in financial markets and in political circles is almost unmatched.
 ''Greenspan is absolutely the best Fed chairman we have ever had,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''The U.S. has been very fortunate, and the world, too, to have had Chairman Greenspan leading the Fed.''
 Despite his Republican affiliation, Mr. Greenspan also enjoys widespread influence among Democrats. Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the expected Democratic choice to run for president, quickly congratulated the Fed chairman on his renomination and alluded to Mr. Greenspan's collaborative relationship with the Clinton administration.
 ''Alan Greenspan's overall record as chairman of the Federal Reserve has been one of distinction,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''During the 1990's, when Chairman Greenspan worked alongside a president committed to fiscal discipline, the American people saw the benefits of historic job growth, surpluses and the longest economic expansion in history.''
 Mr. Greenspan often clashed with top officials in the Reagan administration as well as those in the first Bush administration, when White House officials sometimes tried to push the Fed into lowering interest rates.
 But the current President Bush has taken care to avoid any hint of conflict with the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Greenspan has maintained close ties to important White House officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney.
 Mr. Greenspan recently warned that the federal deficit, which is expected to surpass $400 billion this year, poses a major obstacle to long-term economic stability. But he measured his words carefully, and he has sided with the Bush administration by urging Congress to reduce the deficit through spending cuts rather than tax increases.
 Ted Truman, a former Fed official as well as a senior Treasury official under President Bill Clinton, said he doubted that the White House had delayed Mr. Greenspan's nomination to put pressure on him.
 But he said Wall Street would have been happier if Mr. Bush had acted more quickly. ''This one is not particularly tidy,'' Mr. Truman said. ''They should have announced it in January and had him confirmed in February.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Urge Bush To Act on Gasoline Prices

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM; Jodi Wilgoren reported from Portland for this article, and David E. Rosenbaum from Washington.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., May 18 

 BODY:
Seizing on record-high gas prices averaging more than $2 a gallon, Senator John Kerry and other Democrats on Tuesday made their most coordinated attack yet on President Bush's energy policy, saying he should immediately push OPEC to expand oil production. 
 ''Where's the president?'' Mr. Kerry, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, asked about 100 people gathered at a job-training center here. ''George Bush has no plan, doesn't address it, doesn't seem to care that every American family is paying more to go to work, for the products that they get, to be able to get to school, to be able to do all the things Americans do in the course of a summer.'' 
 In Washington, several Democratic senators went further, calling on Mr. Bush to begin withdrawing oil from the reserve. But Mr. Kerry said he was not yet advocating such a step. ''We may get there,'' he said, ''but I'm not doing that at this point.'' He said, however, he would not continue to add to the reserve.
 The White House quickly rejected tapping the reserve, saying it was to be used for national emergencies.Mr. Kerry's comments, made at the start of a forum intended to focus on lost jobs and then repeated for the television cameras, were part of an effort that included a news conference by the chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a conference call by three Democratic governors. 
 It is a common tactic for a White House challenger to blame the incumbent for high gas prices, but it can be risky, especially because gas prices tend to rise in the summer and then drop before the November elections. The current price is a record in relative terms, but when inflation is taken into account, gasoline is cheaper than it was in 1981, when prices peaked at just under $3 a gallon in 2004 dollars.
 Still, gas prices are a pocketbook issue, and polls show they are a concern across the country.
 More than half of those responding to one April survey said the surge had caused a financial hardship in their families, while a March study found that 56 percent of respondents thought the country faced a major problem with gas prices, with 13 percent calling it a crisis.
 ''That tax cut that the president is so proud of is being eaten completely by the rise in gasoline prices,'' Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan said on the conference call, saying that the 42-cent rise in average gas prices since Mr. Bush took office had cost consumers $42 billion a year. 
 Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa said, ''American businesses can't afford the increase that this gas crisis is causing on the cost of their goods and services, and it's going to put a screeching halt to job creation in this country, at a time when we are desperately in need of jobs.''
 Four years ago Mr. Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill blamed the Clinton administration for a gas-price increase, saying the administration had no coherent domestic energy policy and in imposing clean-air regulations had allowed prices as high as $2.39 a gallon in the Midwest.
 Republicans on Tuesday struck some of the same chords by accusing Mr. Kerry and fellow Democrats in Congress of blocking Mr. Bush's energy plan, which would encourage domestic oil drilling to reduce dependence on foreign oil.
 Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Bush ''believes, like Americans do, the gas prices are too high.'' The reason for the increase, Mr. McClellan said, was that Congress had not approved Mr. Bush's ''comprehensive energy plan to address this problem.''
 At the Bush campaign headquarters, Steve Schmidt, a spokesman, said that Mr. Kerry ''has a lifetime record of voting for higher gas taxes,'' referring mainly to votes on larger budget-balancing bills.
 On Tuesday, Democrats hit the issue repeatedly. On Capitol Hill, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York led a group of Democrats in calling for the release of 60 million gallons from the nation's reserve over the next two months. ''The president is coming down on the side of big oil and Saudi Arabia over the needs of American drivers and the economy,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 The party's chairman, Terry McAuliffe, blamed the Bush administration's ties to the oil industry for the high prices and as examples he named the president, Vice President Dick Cheney and cabinet members Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, and Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary.
 Mr. McAuliffe, Mr. Vilsack and Mr. Kerry each cited a comment Mr. Bush made in 2000 while campaigning in New Hampshire, when he said that as president, he would ''jawbone'' leaders from Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations to pressure them to expand oil production.
 ''Well, I haven't seen any jawboning, have you?'' Mr. Kerry asked the crowd here. Referring to reports in a recent book by Bob Woodward that Mr. Bush and a Saudi prince had discussed oil prices and their effect on elections in the United States, Mr. Kerry added, ''All I read about are sweetheart deals with Saudi Arabia.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Iraq on the Hustings: Too Much Finesse, Not Enough Facing Up,'' by Francis X. Clines (Editorial Observer, May 17):
 Message to John Kerry: Americans have rarely been so upset -- over Iraq, the sabotage of international relations, the economy, gas prices, health care.
 All the while, George W. Bush's message remains: The sun is shining (although it's raining).
 Mr. Kerry, do for us what Mr. Bush seems incapable of: Become the Great Listener.

HEADLINE: Booting Up Interactive Art In Shows of Prizewinners

BYLINE: By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL

 BODY:
A historic survey of interactive art seems as if it would reach back all the way to, oh, last October. And it would seem that such art would be forgotten as soon as the screens and speakers were unplugged. 
 But two exhibitions opening tomorrow in New York are out to prove that interactive art has not only lasting value, but a lengthy past. The exhibitions, under the banner ''Digital Avant-Garde,'' were assembled by Ars Electronica, an electronic-art center and festival in Linz, Austria. This year Ars, as new-media artists call it, is celebrating 25 years of sometimes controversial existence. 
 Gerfried Stocker, managing director of the Ars Electronica Center, said the center's first American exhibitions would demonstrate ''a sense of the relevance of digital art, that it's not just a fashionable thing that appeared for a few years during the new-economy hype.'' 
 Mr. Stocker worked with curators at Eyebeam, a media-art center in Chelsea, and the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens to organize the exhibitions, which run through July 18. At Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, ''Prix Selections'' will present eight artworks that have won awards in Ars's annual high-tech art competition. At the Moving Image museum, ''Interactions/Art and Technology'' will show a dozen projects created by artist-residency programs at Futurelab, Ars's research center. 
 Some works are nearly 15 years old, but Mr. Stocker said age had not diminished their impact. For instance ''Legible City,'' a 1990 work by the Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw, allows a viewer pedaling a real bicycle to tour a virtual version of Manhattan projected on a large screen. Mr. Stocker said the work demonstrated that ''we are inside the information landscape.'' 
 Although interactive art is the core of the Ars mission, Ars also has supported more commercial areas of high-tech creativity, including computer animation. This weekend the Moving Image museum, at 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, in Astoria, is to show three hourlong programs of short films that have won Ars prizes for computer animation. A schedule is available at www.aec.at/nyc. 
 Ars has awarded its top computer-animation prize to several Pixar films, including ''Toy Story'' and ''Monsters Inc.'' Pete Docter, a writer who collected the prize for ''Toy Story'' in 1996, said that as he accepted the award, ''it was almost like being a rock star.'' 
 Mr. Docter, an Oscar-nominated writer and director, may not need recognition from a small Austrian arts organization. But for the digital artists working at the field's margins, a paid Ars residency or the cash accompanying each prize can provide much-needed support. 
 Ars Electronica started in 1979 as an offshoot of an annual music festival in Linz devoted to the composer Anton Bruckner. A gritty steel town of 150,000 people on the Danube, Linz wanted to distinguish itself artistically from Vienna and Salzburg. 
 The weeklong festival attracts more than 30,000 people every September. In 1996 Ars opened its permanent home, a $17 million center containing a museum and the research center. Benjamin Weil, Eyebeam's artistic director, said that Ars provided ''a certain level of critical thinking applied to the field, which is not necessarily readily available elsewhere.'' 
 Ars has occasionally courted controversy. Critics complain that it is more interested in technology than art and that annual festival themes such as ''Next Sex'' merely attract attention.
 Armin Medosch, an artist and curator, said the festival has shown a ''lack of judgment regarding its overall agenda by focusing on tech over art, on hype over content.'' 
 The New York exhibitions were not a prelude to Ars opening an American outpost, Mr. Stocker said. But he said that the exhibitions would not have been possible in the past, when galleries were less familiar with the technical demands of presenting interactive art. Their recent interest, he said, suggests digital art is gaining acceptance.

HEADLINE: Sharp Words From China For Leader Of Taiwan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and CHRIS BUCKLEY; Joseph Kahn reported from Beijing for this article and Chris Buckley from Taipei, Taiwan.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Thursday, May 20 

 BODY:
China stepped up its attacks on Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, even as he was sworn into office for a second term on Thursday, warning that it would force Taiwan to remain part of China even if that resulted in international isolation and severe economic pain.
 Militant statements in the official media and stark warnings by several of China's leading Taiwan experts appeared designed to discount in advance some mildly conciliatory comments Mr. Chen made Thursday morning in his inaugural address, while emphasizing Beijing's readiness to attack if he pursued a course toward formal independence.
 Mr. Chen, delivering his address in a downpour in front of Taiwan's presidential palace, said he would undertake constitutional reform, as he has long promised. But he ruled out using the reform process to effect changes to the country's sovereignty and left the door open to reunification down the road, if Taiwan's 23 million people choose to support it. 
 ''This is my responsibility to history that I present to the Taiwan people and government a new constitution before my term ends on 2008,'' Mr. Chen said, following through on a campaign promise.
 But at least in part to alleviate Chinese concerns that a new Taiwanese constitution would result in a formal severing of Taiwan's remaining ties to the mainland, Mr. Chen vowed to exclude questions of sovereignty.
 ''I am fully aware that consensus has yet to be reached on national sovereignty, territory and the subject of unification and independence,'' he said. ''I clearly state here that such issues will not be included in the scope of constitutional reforms.''
 Despite those comments, which were largely anticipated, mainland Chinese leaders appear to have reached a new consensus that there is little prospect of negotiating with Mr. Chen, who narrowly won re-election in a disputed poll in March, and that Beijing must eliminate doubts that it is prepared to attack to enforce its will.
 ''No one will pay any attention to his words, even if he talks at great length,'' said Xu Shiquan, one of China's most senior advisers on Taiwan affairs, said of Mr. Chen. ''China will pay any price to prevent independence.''
 The rising tensions underscore the risks for the United States, which has been cast as an intermediary between China and Taiwan. Washington recognizes China's sovereignty but has also vowed to defend the island, a democracy, against any attack from China. It is Taiwan's main supplier of weapons.
 China took the unusual step of briefing the United States on the text of a new Taiwan policy before its publication on Monday morning. Mr. Chen sent emissaries to Washington earlier this month to discuss his inaugural address, American and Taiwanese officials said.
 A senior Bush administration official said mediation ''had reduced the chances of miscalculation'' at a difficult time. But he also acknowledged that the two sides had become increasingly antagonistic and political tensions had increased even as economic ties flourished.
 A former American government official who discussed Taiwan policy with civilian and military leaders in Beijing last week said China had determined that Mr. Chen had already ''crossed the red line'' after campaigning on a platform that China felt amounted to supporting independence. The former official said he was repeatedly warned that China had little choice but to attack if Mr. Chen fulfilled past pledges to solidify Taiwan's national identity.
 ''I don't think they want to use force,'' the former official said. ''But the pessimism is striking. There's a sense they have no choice now.''
 On Monday, China released its highest level statement on Taiwan policy in several years, outlining a variety of benefits Taiwan might receive, including closer economic ties, reduced military tensions and more diplomatic ''living space,'' but only if Taiwan fully accepted the ''One China'' principle under which Beijing claims sovereignty.
 At the same time, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said the Communist Party would ''seriously consider'' enacting a law that would require Taiwan and China to reunify by a certain date, either voluntarily or by force.
 Mr. Chen has sent conflicting signals in the past about whether he intends to try to formalize Taiwan's de facto independence. But he has repeatedly rejected the ''One China'' policy, and his aides made clear this week that he was not prepared to discuss China's sovereignty claims at this time.
 The most delicate issue is how Mr. Chen carries out constitutional reform and whether he will adhere to his promise to steer clear of sovereignty questions. Mr. Chen said his plan for ''constitutional re-engineering'' will focus mainly on the structure of Taiwan's government and enforcing rule of law and human rights.
 American officials have said they expect Mr. Chen to promise not to seek independence through constitutional reform. Yet Mr. Chen must respond to broad support among his core constituency for concrete steps to show that Taiwan is realizing its national identity, and to broad opposition to accepting Chinese rule.

HEADLINE: Amiable Unhitching, With a Prod

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
MICHELLE GESKY'S first divorce took three years, tens of thousands of dollars and incalculable heartache. A settlement was reached before trial, but not without appearances before the judge and the assignment of a social worker to defuse a thorny custody issue. 
 Now Ms. Gesky, 41, is divorcing again, determined ''to get past the emotion and not make what is already terrible worse.'' She also wants all three of her children, two from her first marriage and one from her second, to be spared the acrimony. 
 Her husband, Tom, 36, does not bear the same scars. But he, too, hopes for a divorce where the couple ''can care for each other afterward, like the friends we once were'' and congenially raise their infant daughter. 
 With those goals in mind, the Geskys decided to try a process called collaborative divorce. Invented more than a decade ago by Stuart G. Webb, a burned-out Minneapolis matrimonial lawyer, it is gaining in popularity around the nation and has recently made its way to New York State. 
 On a recent evening, at a four-way negotiating session in White Plains with their lawyers, the couple sat shoulder to shoulder on adjoining chairs. It was a peaceful tableau. They didn't recoil from each other's touch. Nor did they bicker or fall silent at moments of disagreement. 
 Already they had made progress toward decisions about selling their house, dividing their pensions and designing a joint child custody arrangement. 
 They were considering their daughter's changing needs: nursery school soon, later ballet or bassoon lessons, boyfriends, college. The lawyers chimed in with what-ifs. A stranger in the room could not have told which lawyer represented which client. 
 ''I've lived through the process of a contentious, adversarial, drawn-out, money-hungry divorce, and it's devastating,'' Ms. Gesky said. ''This time I don't want that pain. I want clarity and release.'' 
 Collaborative divorce is now available in 35 states and much of Canada. According to Mr. Webb, who simultaneously gave up litigation and became a Buddhist, 4,500 lawyers nationwide have been trained in the protocol, which halves the legal costs of divorce. New York, where state laws make dissolving a marriage costlier and arguably nastier than anywhere in the nation, is a relative newcomer, with collaborative lawyers first taking cases about two years ago.
 In some ways, the method resembles mediation in its problem-solving approach. But rather than a neutral mediator, each party brings a lawyer to the sessions, as advocate and adviser. But the very format changes how lawyers behave. 
 ''We are by nature competitive,'' said Barry Berkman, who organized the first group of collaborative divorce lawyers in New York City and Westchester County after learning about the process at a California symposium. ''Otherwise we'd be botanists.''
 Most matrimonial lawyers measure success by who won, and for how much. ''This is different,'' he said. ''Success is a resolution that works for both parties.'' 
 The cornerstone of the process -- and its most controversial element -- is that the two lawyers sign a pledge to withdraw from the case if either of their clients decides to go to court. This gives the lawyers an economic incentive to leave adversarial habits behind. It also encourages clients to stay at the bargaining table, since bolting means starting over with new counsel. 
 Collaborative divorce also requires a full disclosure of assets and respectful behavior at all negotiating sessions. Yelling, table-pounding, threatening and stalling are against the rules. 
 The settlement is shaped by figuring out what works for the couple. One husband split an inheritance with his wife to break a logjam, although he was not required to by law. One wife gave ground on weightier items because her husband agreed to continue changing the screens and storm windows every year.
 Because this is not how most lawyers think, Mr. Berkman said, those practicing collaborative divorce generally meet in the equivalent of support groups. The 40 lawyers in New York City and its northern suburbs gather monthly to discuss their shared cases. 
 At one recent meeting in White Plains, Amy Carron Day and Marc Fleisher figured out how to lower the decibel level by beginning sessions with safe topics and coaching the husband to show more support for his quick-to-anger wife. At another meeting, Robin Carton explained to Neil Kozek that her client felt he was ''saber rattling'' when he made reference to what might happen if they went to court, a tactic collaborative lawyers are supposed to leave behind. 
 There is no nationwide tally of how many cases have been settled this way, and leaders of the movement are only now talking of the need to collect systematic data. But they point to the dramatic experience when collaborative divorce was introduced in Medicine Hat, in the Canadian province of Alberta. 
 All 29 of the lawyers who regularly practice matrimonial law in Medicine Hat, population 51,000, have now been trained in the collaborative process, according to Janis Pritchard, the first president of the collaborative lawyers' association there, who describes herself as a former ''barracuda litigator.'' 
 Within six months of the training of half the lawyers in 2000, the filing of motions fell by 50 percent. By 2001, after the next group was trained, filings had fallen an additional 25 percent. Collaborative techniques are now being tried in Medicine Hat by corporate, real estate and trust lawyers. 
 Most in the New York group continue to do litigation, mediation and collaborative divorce. But many do less and less litigation, and some have abandoned it entirely. 
 ''I can't bring myself to go that route anymore,'' said Katherine Eisold Miller, Mr. Gesky's collaborative lawyer, who was a big-firm litigator for 15 years. Ms. Miller's career change has been eased by her background; both her parents are therapists. ''This feels very natural to me,'' she said. 
 As a dispute resolution process, collaborative divorce shares the so-called interest-based bargaining techniques of mediation. But many lawyers who practice mediation say that it is not suitable for marriages with a ''power imbalance,'' since the parties are generally in the room without advocates and hire lawyers only when it is time to draft and submit an agreement. 
 Mr. Berkman offered several examples of power imbalance: A wife of 25 years who had always said ''yes, dear'' about money matters. A guilt-ridden adulterer willing to ''give away the store.'' A jilted spouse ''so depressed she can't think straight.'' Ms. Miller cited her own divorce, where mediation failed, she said, because her ex-husband couldn't stand that she ''knew the lingo'' and he didn't. 
 Even the matrimonial lawyers who have reservations about collaborative divorce prefer it to mediation. The cynical explanation might be that mediation, which is also done by mental health professionals, takes business from lawyers.
 But Ann Diamond, a litigator at Sheresky Aronson & Mayefsky in Manhattan, said that she was ''dead set against'' mediation because anguished husbands or wives need ''someone to stand behind, someone to be the heavy.'' (Mediators permit each party to have a lawyer with them, but most couples forgo the extra expense.) 
 Ms. Diamond, and others, worry that the collaborative lawyers' pledge not to take a case to court could in some cases actually run up a client's bill. Let's say the husband decides to go to court. The wife, Ms. Diamond said, is then also forced to start from scratch.
 While more than 90 percent of divorce cases are uncontested, those that wind up in litigation generally cost two to three times as much as a comparable case handled collaboratively, according to lawyers familiar with fees for both methods. 
 Richard A. Abrams, a New York City litigator who has also joined the local collaborative law group, cited this example: A collaborative divorce that required half a dozen two-hour negotiating sessions, no outside forensic experts and a draft agreement would cost a couple about $15,000 in Manhattan. In litigation, with a routine number of status conferences in court but no complicated motions, discovery or trial, the same divorce would cost at least $30,000. 
 Lisa Headley, with a 20-year marriage and a 10-year-old daughter, was ''so mad and hurt'' when her husband, Brian McCormick, asked for a divorce that her first instinct was revenge. One visit to a lawyer whom Ms. Headley, 45, described as ''a barracuda'' slowed her rush to court. 
 Then she consulted a mediator but decided ''you have to be very strong and know exactly what you want, and I was a basket case and didn't think I could do that.'' Instead, she hired Mr. Fleisher for a collaborative divorce. ''I needed someone on my side,'' she said, but not someone who was going to say, 'You're going to pay, buddy.' In the end, I had to live with myself.'' 
 Custody was never an issue, and the couple had no significant property to fight over. After a half-dozen sessions there was an agreement ready to be signed. Ms. Headley wanted her daughter to attend the same church each Sunday, but was persuaded that it was regular worship that mattered, not where. She kept the living room rug, but parted with the bedroom set. 
 ''It seems so silly now,'' Ms. Headley said. ''But they told us it happens to everyone, so I didn't feel like such a fool. And they kept pointing out the progress we were making.''
 ''I'm not saying it wasn't awful,'' she said, ''but I'd recommend it to anyone.''

HEADLINE: In the Era of Cheap DVD's, Anyone Can Be a Producer

BYLINE: By PETER WAYNER

 BODY:
IN the fall, on the Monday after each University of Texas football game, the university's athletic department produces a bulk mailing for the post office: DVD's containing a complete video of the game, interviews with the coaches and other features.
 There may be more college football on television than ever before, but even so, schools like Texas with prominent football teams can't count on reaching a national audience every Saturday. So the university offers DVD's of its 12 games as a $300 package; so far about 300 fans around the country are subscribers.
 Sports events may seem an unlikely subject for distribution by DVD, but football games are far from the only discs in the mail carrier's bag these days. Independent filmmakers, specialty magazine publishers, artists, educators -- all those with a video to sell, no matter how narrow the niche -- are turning out DVD's and distributing them through the mail. It's a trend that began in the era of videotape but has accelerated with DVD's because they are inexpensive to duplicate and ship. 
 ''The costs have come down, and it's an open market to put whatever you can on a disc,'' said Maureen Healy, publisher of DVD News, a trade publication.
 Poetry Television, for example, a San Francisco-based group devoted to verse, sells a DVD of readings, ''Weapons of Mass Production: The Spoken War'' for $20 through its Web site, www.poetrytelevision.com. The DVD is part of a planned subscription series.
 ''We're looking to reach at least 500 subscriptions by the end of the year,'' said Isaias Rodriguez, the group's founder. ''It's a small number, but it will have a huge impact.''
 For $29.95, fans of mountainboarding (a sport best described as all-terrain skateboarding) can subscribe to a year of Mountainboard Video Mag on three DVD's (www.mountainboardvideomag.com). Each installment contains video of daredevil runs and spills, interviews and features on the sport's culture.
 And Primedia Workplace Learning, a division of the media company Primedia, ships programs of continuing education for firefighters, police officers and other emergency workers on disc so that lessons can be paused and replayed between calls. February's selection was ''The A and the B: Airways and Breathing.''
 As these and other projects demonstrate, even 500 cable or satellite channels aren't enough for a nation filled with so many stories, lessons and events. DVD distribution has helped create a market for specialized visual programming. 
 At its most developed, DVD distribution includes companies like Netflix, which rents movies -- everything from Hollywood blockbusters to small art films -- to consumers by mail. Netflix (www.netflix.com), which charges a flat monthly fee for rentals, had revenues of $272 million last year.
 Beyond Netflix, lots of individuals and groups are producing videos in a market that is as varied and heterogenous as the book industry. The market has even spawned companies like CustomFlix (www.customflix.com), the equivalent of a custom book publisher, which for a fee will duplicate DVD's in small runs and help distribute and sell them. 
 Consider Jimi Petulla, a man who says he invested $400,000 of his own money to produce ''Reversal,'' a semi-autobiographical film he wrote and starred in. 
 Mr. Petulla said that several early screenings of the film about a high-school wrestler and his father brought about 20 distribution offers from companies specializing in smaller independent films. The terms, however, were too onerous.
 ''I've met so many people who've done good little movies, and they've never seen a penny from their distributors,'' he said. ''It's insane what these companies can get away with.''
 Instead, Mr. Petulla began making the DVD's himself. To date, he said, the film has grossed about $650,000 and continues to bring in $15,000 to $18,000 a month. The discs sell for $29.95 at www.reversaldvd.com.
 John Geyer, the vice president for marketing at CustomFlix, tells the story of a customer who made ''RoadRace,'' a movie about people who race motorcycles on weekends. ''He's an accountant,'' Mr. Geyer said. ''I think he works for a Fortune 500 company and he races motorcycles on the weekend. He went around and put five video cameras on his bike. In two months he sold $10,000 worth of his product.''
 Mark Brereton, the movie's director, is also the director of credit and payroll for the tire maker Pirelli North America. ''I just wanted to film a few things and make something for my friends as a memento,'' he said. ''Then I showed it to some friends and they said, if you put a bit more work on it, you can take it out and sell it.''
 The final version included video shot from the motorcycle of a friend who races, along with music from a local band. Mr. Brereton is at work documenting this racing season and promises that the next DVD will incorporate suggestions from fans.
 Both Mr. Petulla and Mr. Brereton showed a knack for marketing. The DVD for ''Reversal,'' for example, includes testimonials from celebrities like the gymnastic gold medalist Shannon Miller and the track and field star Carl Lewis. Once he received these endorsements, Mr. Petulla paid college students $10 an hour to spread the word about the film by e-mailing wrestling groups, electronic newsletters and Web sites.
 Mr. Brereton gained publicity by donating $5 from the sale of each disc to a charity for equipping racetracks with special barriers that can reduce the injury during a crash. Now several Web sites that report on motorcycle racing carry notices about his generosity, and also mention the film.
 In some cases, DVD producers get lucky. Mary Dalton, a professor of communications at Wake Forest University, also creates documentaries, including one about an artist named Sam McMillan.
 When an article about Mr. McMillan appeared in Smithsonian magazine, Ms. Dalton started receiving requests for copies. So she started making 50 copies at a time, storing them in her bedroom and selling them online.
 The Internet is more cost-effective as a medium for advertising and selling DVD's that are delivered by mail than as a video distribution network. Andrew M. Odlyzko, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies the evolution of broadband, says that it would cost $5 to $10 to deliver the four gigabytes of data on a standard DVD over the best high-speed Internet connection.
 Discs, on the other hand, cost between 60 cents and a dollar to fabricate and can be sent through the mail for the price of a first-class stamp. Moreover, some DVD's contain 9 or even 18 gigabytes of data. These cost slightly more to duplicate, but no more to ship.
 Videographers for the Poetry Channel discovered the cost advantage recently. They captured poetry readings for the local cable public access channel, then jumped to the Internet when they realized that it would extend their reach beyond the San Francisco Bay area. The video clips at their Web site, however, were small and often took a long time to download.
 ''The DVD subscription allows people to affordably get more content,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, adding that their new DVD burner will enable them to duplicate the DVD's themselves. 
 The notion of DVD's by subscription is growing because of its simplicity and economic stability. Craig Lillard is the owner of Visual Realities, a company that ships a disc called ''Video Illustrations for Youth Ministry'' to churches four times a year. The vignettes come in two formats and can be displayed either with a standard DVD player or incorporated into a PowerPoint presentation.
 ''Why sell one when you can sell four at one time?'' Mr. Lillard said. ''That's really how we started our business. We were selling four videos when we hadn't finished one of them. We were getting payment up front.''
 CustomFlix and a number of other companies are hoping to help serve niche markets in a similar way. Amazon, for example, stocks DVD's and videotapes from small companies alongside films from major studios. The DVD creator must produce the duplicate DVD's. Amazon collects 55 percent of the list price for the service.
 CustomFlix offers a more sophisticated service, bundling manufacturing, order processing, payment collection and shipping. A filmmaker pays $50 to open an account and $9.95 for each film that is produced on demand. The filmmaker receives any revenue beyond that. If the title is popular, the profits can rise because CustomFlix's price drops to $7.95 per disc after 20 copies and $6.95 per disc after 50 copies.
 While these companies can help deliver the discs to a niche marketplace, they can't do much for the greater challenge of finding a large audience. It is still difficult for small productions to break into the larger marketplace.
 Warren Lieberfarb, the former head of Warner Home Video, said that the big studios continue to dominate the stores and other major distribution channels. ''There's a concentration of retail distribution,'' he said. Although companies like Amazon are doing a good job of reaching out through the Web, he said, ''specialty retail akin to what's happened in books and music just hasn't materialized.''
 ''It's hard to get into a store,'' said Ms. Healy of DVD News. ''It's the same problem that we've always had with this industry. The studios dominate the distribution.''
 ''You can sell it online,'' she said, ''but then you've got to get your Web site out there.''

Archdiocese of Newark Facing Church Closings
 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark has begun a major reorganization effort that requires its 235 parishes to examine how efficiently each is using its resources and calls on 48 of them to consider mergers or realignments that would result in some churches being closed.
 Officials said they could not say how many churches were in danger of closing because each of the 48 parishes -- the last vestiges of declining European immigrant populations in older urban areas like Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth -- will have a say in their fate over the coming months. But under recommendations released by a task force named by Archbishop John J. Myers in April 2002, 16 of the 48 churches would probably close and another 11 could close. The officials did not rule out closing or realigning more churches in the future. 
 Newark, celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, is the seventh largest American archdiocese in population, with 1.3 million Catholics. PAGE B1

HEADLINE: Pinning Hopes for a Rally on a Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The good news that the economy has added hundreds of thousands of jobs and that corporate profits are rising quickly has done little for the stock market. So just what might ignite a stock rally?
 Some stock analysts say the spark will be evidence that the American economy is not heating up, but cooling down.
 While it sounds contrarian, a modest cooling off is what Federal Reserve policy makers will be aiming for when they raise their benchmark interest rate, as anticipated, in the months ahead. 
 A cooling down would also curb fears of higher inflation, which has been accelerating this year and could push interest rates higher and unnerve stock investors. 
 ''The best news we could have is that the economy is beginning to slow down,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management. Though he acknowledges that both job growth and earnings would also be reduced, he said the impact could be offset as interest rates stop rising -- or even fall -- and as inflation expectations are contained.
 ''A moderation in growth, when it comes, will be good news first for bonds and then for stocks,'' he predicted. Stocks could use some good news. After reaching recent peaks on Feb. 11, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 7.5 percent since then and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has dropped 6 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, which reached its recent peak on Jan. 26, has fallen 11.9 percent since then. 
 A slowdown is certain, Mr. Schweitzer says, because rising interest rates and rising inflation are cutting into consumer spending while the impact of President Bush's tax cuts is fading.
 High oil and gasoline prices are also crimping consumer and business budgets. And the uncertainty generated by the war in Iraq and the presidential race could also act as a brake on the economy. Still the cooler economy may not show up until the second half of the year, leading to a sustainable stock rally sometime next year. 
 The average forecast of 53 economists is that the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, will grow at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the third quarter and 4 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a 4.9 percent pace in the 12 months ended in March, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators. On a year over year basis, growth is forecast to slow to a 3.8 percent rate next year, from 4.6 percent this year. 
 The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that earnings will increase 13.5 percent for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index in the second half of the year, compared with a year earlier. That would be a decline from the 22.7 percent increase forecast for the first half of this year by Thomson Financial. 
 Mr. Schweitzer adds that despite these forecasts, investors are not likely to jump back into stocks until they are convinced that growth is merely slowing, not declining, and that it has restrained price increases. 
 Inflation, however, could upset Mr. Schweitzer's hopes for a new stock rally and the best laid plans of Fed policy makers, who have kept rates low for longer than many expected in an effort to avoid deflation and to assure that the economic growth became sustained.
 Part of that plan was to accept a little more inflation than usual. And some analysts argue that the economy has already gotten it.
 In April, the Producer Price Index for finished goods jumped 0.7 percent, more than twice the Wall Street forecast, while the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, climbed 0.3 percent, above the 0.2 percent consensus forecast.
 Over the 12 months ended in April, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent, up from a rate of 1.7 percent through February and March. The core rate rose 1.8 percent over the 12 months through April, up from a 1.6 percent pace in March and 1.1 percent in January. 
 ''One of the reasons why Fed officials are so confident about the inflation outlook is that they believe that inflation expectations are low and well anchored,'' Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP wrote in his weekly report to clients. Expectations are low, he added, because investors are confident the Fed is determined to curb price increases. 
 But ''there is a limit to how many inconvenient inflation reports the Fed can ignore before that determination is called into question,'' he added.
 Ian Sheperdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, says that the Fed has already failed to show enough determination to curb inflation by waiting so long to raise its benchmark, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks.
 ''If the payroll figures haven't convinced you the Fed has left the funds rate at 1 percent for too long,'' he wrote this week, referring to the surprisingly large number of new jobs created in March and April, ''the latest C.P.I. report should have done the trick.''
 He argued that the Fed is now far enough behind the inflation curve that its first rate increase should be half a percentage point and as soon as possible.
 But a half-point increase, instead of the anticipated quarter-point, might unsettle investors, who could focus on the possibility that the economy and corporate earnings would slow too much. And that would not be much of a catalyst for stocks.

HEADLINE: Designing for Nonviolence

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
IF the pen is mightier than the sword, then a handful of graphic design students hope some images will prove more powerful than riot shields and police batons. 
 In anticipation of the Group of 8 summit meeting convening June 8 on Sea Island in Georgia, students at the Savannah College of Art and Design, about 70 miles to its north, have designed posters urging demonstrators to speak out, but not destroy Savannah's historic buildings. Midlevel diplomats and journalists will be staying in Savannah, and local officials say they have heard that as many as 70,000 demonstrators may be concentrated there. 
 Using simple imagery, five graduate students and their professor, Scott Boylston, developed the posters as part of a class project on social communication. On Monday, 1,000 copies of each of the six posters will be posted on campus, in shop windows and in city buildings. The college and the city of Savannah are splitting the $4,000 cost of printing and distribution. 
 While trawling for ideas for the project, Mr. Boylston called Bucky Burnsed, the public affairs officer of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. ''I wanted to do something that was engaged with a social issue,'' Mr. Boylston said. ''I figured I'd get something like street crime or car theft.''
 Instead, Mr. Burnsed suggested that the students design posters addressing the issue of free speech at the G-8 meeting. The students, who represent a variety of political beliefs -- or lack thereof -- decided the posters should convey what they deemed a politically neutral message balancing free speech with responsibility.
 Mr. Boylston, who said he plans to participate in some of the G-8 protests against the Iraq war and in support of environmental causes and equitable working conditions, said, ''I wanted to remove my personal opinions from the project.''
 Citing the use of graphic design in propaganda and dissent, he suggested the students choose a typeface, Futura, that Mr. Boylston said has been used by both governments and their antagonists. The students selected a limited color palette of blue, orange and off-white to keep their message direct. And they decided that each poster should focus on one of three symbols: a brick, a hand or an egg. 
 Donna Smith, 24, photographed a cracked egg held between a finger and a thumb, and placed the slogan ''Hold It Together'' across the bottom of the crack. ''I just like the idea of the egg being this shell that protects the chicken or yolk or the life that's inside,'' Ms. Smith said. ''Yet it's so fragile at the same time.'' 
 Ms. Smith, who described herself as apolitical, said the egg represented the idea that ''free speech protects us and is what makes us Americans.'' 
 ''And at the same time, it's a fragile line,'' she said. ''We can cross it, and it becomes a whole other thing.'' 
 Aaron Shurts, 23, photographed a precariously balanced stack of bricks; one brick sticks out and is highlighted with scribbled orange lines. Arrows pointing to and from the brick are captioned ''Push or Pull?'' Mr. Shurts said he was inspired by Jenga, a game in which players try to pull blocks from a stacked tower without causing it to topple. 
 ''The bricks and the tower represent how fragile our society really is, and that same line between free speech and chaos and rioting can be crossed very easily,'' Mr. Shurts said. At the bottom of the poster, Mr. Shurts wrote a paragraph ending with the phrase, ''Responsibility is a way of life, treat it well.''
 Although the project had been suggested in part by the police, the students said they did not see themselves as government mouthpieces. ''We weren't trying to take a political stance, but help people not to be violent while they practice free speech,'' said Kelly Koon, 23, who said she opposes the war in Iraq.
 Although the demonstrations have not even started, some of the people planning to protest during the G-8 summit meeting are already scuffling with the police -- over who should take credit for inspiring the posters. 
 William Pleasant, a leader of a local protest committee, sputtered when he heard that Mr. Boylston and Mr. Burnsed were crediting the police department with providing the germ of the idea. 
 ''The posters did not evolve from the Savannah-Chatham County Police Department,'' Mr. Pleasant said, adding that he, a fellow protester and Mr. Boylston had brainstormed ideas that may have led to some of the posters before the police were involved. 
 Mr. Boylston, however, said that he had originally spoken with the police department before embarking on the project. 
 Mr. Burnsed said that he had had no idea that his original suggestion would come to fruition but that he was very pleased with the result and hoped the posters would persuade visitors and demonstrators that ''nobody's opinion is worth destroying property, especially property as precious as some of our really historic properties.''
 In any case, Mr. Pleasant said he was happy with the message of the posters. He praised them as ''very compelling'' and ''understated and well considered.''

HEADLINE: Rates Rise, Changing Face Of Home Sales

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
As mortgage rates climb, fewer home owners are refinancing their old loans, and potential purchasers are reconsidering when -- or whether -- to buy. Their choices could reshape the housing market ahead, economists said, and even affect other spending decisions.
 Refinancings, which accounted for more than half of all the home loans last year, are shrinking fast. After three years of easily switching to better terms on their mortgages and frequently taking out cash, consumers can no longer rely so heavily on refinancing to shore up their family budgets and maintain their spending. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday that refinancing activity fell 17 percent last week to its lowest level since the start of the year, as the standard 30-year mortgage rate has risen to 6.2 percent since flirting with 45-year lows in mid-March. In the intervening weeks, refinancing activity has fallen almost two-thirds. 
 ''What consumers are seeing for the first time is a rapid rise in rates,'' said Anthony Meola, executive vice president for home loans production at Washington Mutual, a big servicer of home loans. 
 The sharp appreciation in home prices that consumers have come to rely on for household wealth will probably diminish if rates continue to rise, though the National Association of Realtors estimates that the 30-year rate would have to rise to 8 percent to seriously impede home sales. Rising rates make homes more expensive for consumers and will damp total home sales and home prices. 
 At the average fixed rate of 5.34 percent recorded last March by the Mortgage Bankers Association, a monthly payment of $1,000 would have covered a 30-year mortgage of about $180,000. Using last week's rate of 6.21 percent, that $1,000 payment could handle $164,000.
 But in the short term, people are buying homes at an enthusiastic pace. Many people planning to buy have already applied for a loan, and some may act quickly to avoid being priced out of the home they desire. ''Whenever interest rates rise, people jump off fences, so there's some of that going on,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. 
 Two weeks ago, applications for home loans, excluding refinancings, were near a record level and fell only 8 percent last week, said the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 ''What this tells us is that home sales will stay very strong at least until the middle of the summer,'' said David Berson, chief economist of Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage finance company.
 After three months of shopping for a home, Haroon Rashid, a purchasing associate for a textile company in New York, applied two days ago for pre-approval on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. ''I would like to buy as soon as possible before the interest rates go up even more,'' said Mr. Rashid, 29, who is hoping to find a two-bedroom house or condo in New Jersey for less than $200,000. He was quoted a rate of 6.27 percent. ''My friend got a house just two months ago -- he got 5.3 percent.''
 According to bankers, many home buyers are asking for adjustable rates, in search of the lowest monthly payment. And they are reacting more quickly than they have in the past, propelling adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.'s, to 35.2 percent of all mortgage applications last week.
 The only other times that adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for such a large share of the applications were in January 2000 and November 1994, said Douglas Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. In those cases, the average 30-year rate had risen at least 2 percentage points from its lows before adjustable loans gained such popularity. This time the rate has climbed only 1.30 percentage points since touching its low last June. 
 ''For a much smaller increase in long-term interest rates, we've got a much larger increase in A.R.M. share,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 Some anecdotal evidence suggests that nervous sellers are cutting their asking prices in certain markets. Barbara Simmons, the owner of Realty World Equity Center in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said that Ventura County, particularly Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Camarillo, ''has seen more price reductions in the last two weeks than I have seen in the last two years.'' 
 Some homeowners are eager to sell because they believe home prices have risen as much as they can, especially now that mortgage rates are increasing. ''Our response to the interest rates going up was to sell our house instead of refinance,'' said Lori Mackey, a children's author and the founder of a financial literacy group for children. She and her husband, Dana, closed the sale of their home in Agoura Hills, Calif., on Monday for $860,000, a gain of $320,000 in the two years they have owned it.
 ''I can't believe it,'' Ms. Mackey, 42, said. ''We are now debt free, have savings, and still plenty of money left over to buy another house.'' She said they would wait to buy a new home because they expect that the higher interest rates would drive prices down.
 Still, mortgage rates are exceedingly low by historical standards. For instance, the average 30-year rate over the last 10 years is 7.3 percent, and the lowest rate in the 1990's was 6.83 percents, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm based in Pompton Plains, N.J. 
 ''That doesn't make it any less painful perhaps, but some perspective is necessary,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates. ''Interest rates cannot be considered to be high, by any means.'' 
 Walt Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, agreed: ''Interest rates are still at their lowest levels since the 1960's, and for the lion's share of buyers, it has no impact. But the low-to-moderate income homebuyers -- they are being priced out.''
 Still, consumers seem spooked. ''We see some overreacting,'' said Robert Walters, chief economist of Quicken Loans in Livonia, Mich. ''They say, 'Rates are rising, I need to lock in a 30-year rate.' But the rate environment is less important than matching a mortgage to your situation. 
 Unlike other rate increases in the last year, this time many consumers feel more confident about their jobs and about earning enough money to pay more, housing economists said. 
 ''It's important to note that the reason interest rates are rising is because of a healthier economy,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''And that provides consumers with the wherewithal to buy homes.''

The fate of George Kritikos's strip club here, where his Greek immigrant American dream has collided with the city's renovation vision, may now depend on the bar's connection to the baseball legend Babe Ruth.
 A Baltimore native, the Babe, George Herman Ruth Jr., bought the bar, known as Ruth's Cafe, for his father, George Sr., in 1916.
 At the time, Ruth was a star pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Two years later, the Red Sox won their last World Series. And his father died in a brawl outside the bar. 
 It is a history Mr. Kritikos has come to know well. Indeed, he has learned all he can about his building's ties to Ruth after the city passed an ordinance in March marking his small rowhouse club, the Goddess, for a possible condemnation under eminent domain to make way for an urban renewal project.
 Mr. Kritikos did not buy the spot on Eutaw Street because of its baseball lore, but for its location. Not only is his club near Camden Yards, the home stadium for the Baltimore Orioles, but it is strolling distance to the M&T Bank Stadium, where the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League play; the city's convention center; and the Inner Harbor, the city's waterfront shopping area.
 Mr. Kritikos, who has owned the building nine years, said he had spent $300,000 renovating it into a business catering to a natural clientele. '''You got two stadiums here,'' Mr. Kritikos said. ''You got the convention center. You got the hotels. It doesn't get more prime than this.''
 Inside the club, the only tribute to Babe Ruth is a laminated photograph hanging behind the bar that shows father and son in ties, vests and bartender aprons posing behind a hulking wooden bar. It has long since been replaced with a newer model that serves as a precarious runway for the club's high-heeled entertainment.
 Mr. Kritikos is hoping to get the building listed on the National Historic Register and thwart any efforts to tear it down to make way for new development.
 The Goddess happens to stand at the gateway of Baltimore's Westside Project, a 100-block urban renewal project to restore this mix of ornate banks, former department stores and small shops.
 The Westside's showpiece to date is the Hippodrome Theater at the France Merrick Performing Arts Center, a onetime grand movie house two blocks up Eutaw Street that reopened in February.
 Across the street from the theater is a $200 million complex of housing, parking and 35,000 square feet of retail space. Farther north an old hotel and department store have been renovated as two condominium complexes; the University of Maryland Hospital's expanding campus can be found there as well.
 Mayor Martin O'Malley approved a city council bill in March that allowed the city to use eminent domain to purchase the Goddess and other buildings in a two-block area.
 ''Being that it's a gateway into the Westside, those two blocks become pretty significant,'' said Sharon Grinnell, chief operating officer for the Baltimore Development Corporation, which is overseeing the development of the Westside.
 Ms. Grinnell said that the agency had nothing against adult entertainment in that location. The corner, though, connects Camden Yards to the west side; while the development agency has no specific plans for it, she said, it wants the option to develop the area. 
 Mr. Kritikos is only the latest small business owner to get embroiled in the city's Westside Project. While the neighborhood's days of large department stores disappeared decades ago, these streets still thrived as a shopping district for lower-income households, anchored by the city's 222-year-old Lexington Market. 
 But when the Westside Project began six years ago, small businesses from hatmakers to electronic shops were relocated. Some shut down for good. The agency also negotiated with the state about which historic buildings should be saved and which could be torn down, Ms. Grinnell said.
 John Murphy, a lawyer for Mr. Kritikos, said he did not know about the Goddess's link to Babe Ruth until he was sitting in it with his client.
 ''He went over and got that picture and brought it over to me and I saw Babe Ruth standing there,'' Mr. Murphy recalled. ''That's a big deal.'' 
 Ms. Grinnell questioned the new emphasis on the club's history. ''The building has been there how long?'' she said. ''And it's operating as adult entertainment and all of a sudden you want to play up the significance of Babe Ruth.'' 
 In Baltimore, the most celebrated site remaining from Babe Ruth's formative years is his grandmother's house, where he was born just before his mother moved away. That house is now the Babe Ruth Museum, which is not ''getting in the middle'' of the dispute, said Laurie Ward, spokeswoman for the museum. ''We have our own historical site to promote and maintain so we can't take up the cause for the bar.''
 Other than the museum, there is no well-marked Ruthian historic site. George Ruth owned several bars, including one that was once located in what is now center field in Camden Yards. The only other Ruth-related site is the Saint Mary's Industrial School, now named the Cardinal Gibbons School, where he lived and played ball.
 Other than installing a brass plaque honoring Ruth, Mr. Kritikos hesitates to make use of the building's legacy. But he would like to take advantage of the corner.
 ''The strip club business is not the issue,'' he said. ''We know we can make it over and make money. Anybody who knows about location, knows location is the most important thing.''

HEADLINE: Dow Rally Fizzles, but the Nasdaq Ends Slightly Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street's rally faltered yesterday as rising oil prices deflated the market's enthusiasm over strong earnings from the technology bellwethers Hewlett-Packard and Applied Materials. Prices ended mixed, and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up a triple-digit advance and closed with a loss.
 Investor sentiment seemed to swing toward embracing good news as a buying opportunity, rather than selling for a quick profit as was the case in the last few months. But as oil prices rose and stocks plummeted in late trading, it was clear that Wall Street remained susceptible to the smallest negative news. 
 Benchmark crude oil traded at a record $41.50 a barrel in the futures market, up 96 cents.
 ''We've had strong earnings and have seen oil prices come down a bit over the past few days,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist and senior vice president for S.W. Bach & Company. ''But we need those trends to continue in order to sustain any kind of rally.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 30.80 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,937.71. The Dow had been up 123.99 earlier in the session. 
 The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.35 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,898.17, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.81 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,088.68.
 Few market-moving catalysts remain now that earnings season is winding down, and another geopolitical incident could cause stocks to fall to new near-term lows. Even without major events to move the markets, maintaining a rally will be difficult.
 ''The markets will really be stuck in a range for a while,'' said Russ Koesterich, United States equity strategist at the State Street Corporation. ''I think you break out of the range when you get some feeling from the Fed that they don't see a problem with inflation. That could be a while -- even after the elections.''
 Some investors remained bullish, however. If the Federal Reserve raises benchmark interest rates in June, as is widely expected, the removal of uncertainty for the market could create a buying opportunity -- as long as oil prices can be brought under control and overseas events cooperate.
 ''If the Fed moves in June with a small rate hike and a very benign statement, and we see oil decline under $40, the combination of those two is going to be very powerful for the market,'' said Matt Kelmon of the Kelmoore Strategy Funds.
 Hewlett-Packard, a Dow component, posted a 34 percent gain in quarterly profit after Tuesday's session, matching Wall Street expectations. The computer maker, which increased its sales outlook for the second half of the year despite intense competition, rose 72 cents, to $20.55.
 Applied Materials lost 21 cents, to $18.64, after spending much of the session in positive territory. The chip-manufacturing equipment maker announced an 82 percent surge in sales from a year ago and beat analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share.
 Losses were pared at Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which announced its fourth-quarter profit two months late because of accounting problems in its European divisions. Goodyear, which had an 11 percent sales increase, was up 40 cents, at $8.56.
 The bookseller Borders Group beat Wall Street estimates by 2 cents a share on a 10.6 percent increase in sales from a year ago.
 But Prudential downgraded both Borders and Barnes & Noble because of concerns over the coming year's outlook. Borders lost 37 cents, to $22.33, while Barnes & Noble fell 77 cents, to $28.31.

Treasury Prices Decline
By Bloomberg News
 Treasury prices fell yesterday on concern that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at a pace that is too slow to keep inflation from accelerating.
 New signs of global inflation emerged from Europe, where minutes from the latest meeting from the Bank of England, which raised its benchmark rate by a quarter point on May 6, showed that the central bank considered a half-point increase to restrain gains in consumer prices. 
 The Fed said on May 4 that its key rate could be raised at a ''measured'' pace.
 The 10-year Treasury fell 10/32, to a price of 99 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.77 percent from 4.73 percent on Tuesday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dipped 10/32, to 98 18/32. The bond's yield climbed to 5.48 percent from 5.45 percent on Tuesday.

To the Editor:
 You say, ''A barrel of oil now costs more than $40, but when adjusted for inflation, that price is less alarming'' (editorial, May 19).
 It should be remembered that many nonprofessional laborers have not received a similar inflation adjustment in their hourly wages, and that is just cause for their alarm over the rise in prices at the pump!

HEADLINE: The Big Three Fear That Toyota Is Becoming the Big One

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 19 

 BODY:
Toyota may not quite be the world's largest automaker, based on vehicle sales, but it is firmly buckled in the industry's driver's seat. 
 That reality was reinforced last week when Toyota reported $10.2 billion in earnings for its latest fiscal year, which ended in March, the most ever made in a single year by a Japanese company. 
 Toyota made more than General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler combined. In fact, its earnings were more than double the combined earnings of those companies in their most recent fiscal years. 
 ''It has the kind of momentum in the market that hasn't been seen since the glory years of G.M.'s heyday,'' said Peter M. DeLorenzo, an industry consultant, in a commentary on his Web site, autoextremist.com.
 Consistent profits have allowed Toyota to bankroll environmental technologies, like hybrid engine systems, and take risks, like starting a youth-focused brand, Scion, he said. And it has increased the pressure on everyone else.
 Toyota's recent earnings report coincided with an unusually blunt speech to the Detroit Economic Club last week from the chief executive of one of the domestic industry's largest suppliers, Richard E. Dauch of American Axle and Manufacturing. 
 ''Like it or not, Detroit is in the cross hairs of world automotive competition,'' he said in his speech, adding that ''never before in my nearly 40-year automotive career have I seen General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler Group all losing market share at the same time'' in the United States.
 Four decades ago, G.M. alone commanded more than half the American market. Now G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which includes Mercedes, have about 62 percent combined, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. In just five years, Toyota's share of the United States market has risen to 11.9 percent from 8.7 percent.
 Detroit's problems are the nation's problems. G.M., Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler provide health and pension benefits to hundreds of thousands of citizens and are critical to the Midwestern economy. (Toyota, however, is critical to some parts of the country; it employs roughly 31,000 people and has plants in places like Georgetown, Ky., and Princeton, Ind., and is building a truck plant in San Antonio.) 
 For Detroit, there have been some positive signs. G.M., the world's largest automaker by volume, has become increasingly competitive in its productivity and by many quality measures, though it has suffered a spate of recalls recently. Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has led his company out of steep losses and back to profitability. Chrysler has a new wave of cars and trucks coming out. 
 But losses in market share and the reliance by the traditional Big Three on rebates and cheap financing are among the things that make many big investors wary. In the most recent Fortune 500, which ranks American companies by revenue, G.M. and Ford appeared as Nos. 3 and 4. But they ranked 80th and 87th in terms of market value, trailing the likes of Gillette and First Data, the owner of Western Union. 
 ''I generally tend to favor the Asian manufacturers because I think it will be very difficult for the American automakers to reverse their market-share slide,'' said Anmol Mehra, the manager of the $5 billion Fidelity Select Automotive fund, in a commentary published by Fidelity Investments, the world's largest mutual fund company. Toyota is the only carmaker among the fund's top five holdings. 
 Capital Research, however, another large fund company, has built up a 12 percent stake in G.M. worth about $3.2 billion, according to the fund tracking site bigdough.com. 
 Neither Fidelity nor Capital discusses specific stock investments with reporters. 
 Mr. Dauch, in an interview Wednesday, pointed to problems that automakers and other domestic manufacturers cannot control: high taxes, overregulation, a legal system that allows too many lawsuits, and noncompetitive health care costs. In short, he said, he thinks that American policy is just not making it in the global marketplace.
 Other experts cite more controllable problems. Toyota has long been a benchmark for reliability and manufacturing prowess, and its Lexus brand routinely tops quality surveys. Competitors have been closing the gap in recent years, notably G.M. and Hyundai, the South Korean automaker. 
 But in a business that sells one of the most expensive and complex consumer goods, perceptions are slow to change, and the upheavals of many automakers leave customers bitter. Though some rivals have lurched between strategies and management fads in the past, Toyota's culture of continuous improvement has yielded consistency. 
 ''I respect them and admire them, largely because they've been very consistent in their strategy,'' Mr. Ford said in a recent interview. ''It's a management problem'' at the Big Three, he added. ''Many of us have been inconsistent over the last 20 years in pursuing our strategies.''
 Dealers and suppliers have also had rocky relationships with the American automakers at times. 
 Kenneth B. Gilman, chief executive of the Asbury Automotive Group, a publicly traded dealership group, said that Toyota and Honda considered dealers more as partners than the Big Three automakers did. 
 ''For Toyota, the relationship with the dealers has been structured to be win-win, whereas that has not always been the case with the domestics,'' he said, adding that the Big Three should use their vast network of dealers more to their advantage. 
 Toyota is now behind G.M. and in a dead heat with Ford as the world's second or third largest automaker, depending how one counts, with DaimlerChrysler trailing them all. Toyota aims to expand its global market share to 15 percent by the end of the decade, just above where G.M. is now. 
 ''Because of Toyota's advantageous position and unbelievable cash flow,'' Mr. DeLorenzo, the consultant, said, ''they can press their advantage.''

HEADLINE: Intel Balks At a Request To Expense Stock Options

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 19 

 BODY:
A majority of shareholders at the Intel Corporation challenged management on a contentious issue by backing a resolution calling for employee stock options to be treated as a normal business expense, Intel announced Wednesday at its annual meeting.
 But as long as accounting regulators permit it, the company's executives said, Intel would continue to report stock options -- fiercely defended in Silicon Valley and widely used in technology companies as a popular form of compensation -- in a way that does not show up as a direct cost on its profit-and-loss statements. 
 Although Intel strongly opposed the shareholder proposal, 54 percent of the 5.7 billion votes cast backed the advisory referendum calling on the board to establish a policy expensing all future stock options, the company said. The vote represented a symbolic victory for those advocating the expensing of options. 
 As this debate has raged, Intel's senior management has been outspoken in its belief that expensing stock options would be bad both for the company and the entire technology industry. On Wednesday, Intel's top executives stuck to the same script.
 ''I will continue to advocate that we should not do expensing,'' Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, told wire service reporters after the meeting. He answered ''yes'' when asked if he thought shareholders were wrong to vote in favor of the resolution, which was sponsored by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America pension fund.
 Many companies, especially in high technology, say that freely dispensing stock options is critically important in attracting talent to new ventures and that requiring them to be treated as an expense when issued will stifle innovation and economic growth. More recently, executives have argued that there is no good way to measure the value of options.
 Craig R. Barrett, Intel's chief executive, told the 300 or so shareholders assembled at a convention center near its headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., that valuing the cost of employee stock options requires accountants to make their best guess of their future worth, meaning that Intel's financial statements ''would in fact be less accurate, not more'' if it adopted the shareholder recommendation. But supporters of the proposal argue that more transparent reporting would contribute to the long-term health of the stock.
 In the last few years, more than 100 of the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have voluntarily begun to expense options, adopting various methods for estimating their future value.
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to rule later this year that all publicly traded companies in the United States should expense employee stock options starting in 2005, following a similar rule adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 Intel, along with much of the rest of Silicon Valley, has mounted a lobbying effort in Congress to block the standards board. But unlike a similar effort, which succeeded in forcing regulators to back down roughly a decade ago, the industry faces an uphill struggle to prevail this time.
 Critics charge that relegating the cost of employee stock options to a footnote is a way of hiding an enormous expense that would impact a company's bottom line if treated as a routine cost like other forms of compensation.
 Wednesday's vote marks a reversal among Intel shareholders, who defeated a similar referendum at last year's annual meeting, when the pro-expensing forces received only 48 percent of the vote.
 ''It is Mr. Barrett's view that this is such a divisive issue, with roughly equal support on both sides, that it doesn't make sense to make a change at this time,'' said Bill Calder, an Intel spokesman. 
 Intel joins a growing list of technology companies whose shareholders have called on company officers to count options as an expense. Shareholders at the Hewlett-Packard Company, the computer systems giant, and PeopleSoft Inc., the maker of software systems for large corporations, passed similar resolutions in mid-March. Stockholders in Apple Computer Inc. did so in 2003.
 ''Our board did acknowledge the resolution, which was nonbinding, and said it would take it under advisement,'' a spokesman for PeopleSoft said. ''The board has yet to make any decision.'' Hewlett-Packard offered a near-identical statement.
 ''Most stockholder resolutions are nonbinding,'' said Paul Hodgson, a senior researcher at The Corporate Library, a proponent of expensing stock options. Typically, the only binding resolutions, he said, are those put forward by the company's management.
 ''The campaign against expensing options has been supported with the greatest enthusiasm among tech companies because it's inside those companies that stock options are used most widely,'' Mr. Hodgson said.
 At least one major technology company, the Microsoft Corporation, has moved away from the use of stock options as compensation. Employees there are granted actual stock, rather than options, which are worth something only if a company's stock rises above the price on the day an option is granted. 
 But Intel, like many other technology companies, plans to wait until regulators insist on a change.
 ''We will follow the rules of the land,'' said Mr. Bryant, the chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: Narrow Path for New Biotech Food Crops

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 19 

 BODY:
As a research scientist at the world's largest vegetable seed company, David Tricoli used genetic engineering to create a virus-resistant melon, something that conventional plant breeders had been unable to develop. 
 But the company, Seminis, dropped the melon project and most of its other work on biotech vegetables because of the high costs of obtaining regulatory approval and perceived consumer resistance. 
 ''There are things that growers need and want, but it's just too difficult to get them out,'' said Mr. Tricoli, who left Seminis in 2001 after the cutbacks and now works at the University of California, Davis. ''In biotech, we have a solution to the problem, but it's just sitting there.'' 
 The melon is emblematic of a problem in agricultural biotechnology: the small number of crops that are genetically engineered. 
 Agricultural biotechnology continues to spread in the United States and worldwide, and proponents see signs that the crops are becoming more accepted. On Wednesday, as expected, the European Commission decided to allow imports of a genetically engineered sweet corn developed by the Swiss company Syngenta, ending a six-year European moratorium on the approval of biotech food. 
 But to the extent biotechnology is growing, it is in a narrow range. Some 99 percent of the crops are grown in six countries -- the United States, Argentina, Canada, Brazil, China and South Africa. And virtually all the worldwide acreage is devoted to only four crops: soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. 
 With these four, genetic engineering caught on before consumer resistance gathered force a few years ago. These crops are also largely used for animal feed, clothing or to make oil and other ingredients for processed foods rather than eaten directly -- something that has helped them gain acceptance. 
 But recent attempts to move genetic engineering to other crops has met resistance, or at least fear by food companies and farmers that consumers will balk. And these days, many experts say, the time and money involved in clearing regulatory hurdles make it uneconomical to apply biotechnology to any but the most widely grown crops. 
 Just last week, Monsanto shelved plans to introduce the world's first genetically modified wheat because some American and Canadian farmers worried that European and Japanese buyers would shun not only the modified wheat but all their wheat. 
 In April, California rebuffed a request by Ventria Bioscience, a small company in Sacramento, to increase its acreage of an experimental rice crop engineered to produce human proteins for use in nutritional supplements. Some rice farmers had also worried about the effect of such a crop on exports to Japan. 
 And the current edition of California Agriculture magazine laments a sharp falloff in efforts to develop genetically engineered fruit and vegetables -- small crops compared with corn and soybeans. 
 The first genetically engineered crop introduced, in 1994, was a tomato, and some genetically engineered papayas and squash are on the market. But the number of field trials in the United States involving biotech fruit and vegetables has plummeted to about 20 in 2003 from about 120 in 1999, an article in California Agriculture said. 
 The situation allows both supporters and opponents of gene-altered crops to claim victory. The supporters point to the increased acreage and the recent moves by Brazil, one of the world's largest soybean growers, toward allowing farmers to plant genetically engineered soybeans.
 Yet opponents can say that the narrow range of biotech crops is a sign that the technology has stalled. Not only are there just four crops, but they are still limited to two main traits introduced by genetic engineering: insect resistance and herbicide resistance. 
 ''Fifteen years ago, I would have predicted far more diversity in products, based on what companies were saying and what scientists were saying,'' said Jane Rissler of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group skeptical of genetic engineering. ''It's quite surprising it's limited to these two traits.'' 
 The narrow range of crops means that biotechnology may not realize its full potential. On Monday, for instance, the Food and Agriculture Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, issued a report saying that the technology, despite its promise, was not yet doing much to help feed the world's poor because it was not being applied to the sorts of crops grown in developing countries -- like potatoes, cassava, rice, wheat, millet and sorghum.
 Some American farmers also worry that their crops will not benefit from the latest technology. Even as some expressed relief last week when Monsanto shelved its transgenic wheat, others formed Growers for Wheat Biotechnology to push for genetic engineering. 
 There is also a question of how much the agricultural biotechnology industry can continue to expand without new crops, or at least new traits for the same four crops. In the United States, more than 80 percent of soybeans and nearly that share of cotton are already genetically engineered. 
 The pace of new product introductions has fallen sharply. In the last three years, only two crops a year have been the subject of consultations with the Food and Drug Administration before marketing. In the late 1990's, it was not unusual for a dozen crops to go through this process each year. 
 And the new developments are mainly variations on the same themes. ''Within the regulatory pipeline, there's not a lot that looks dramatically new that we're aware of,'' said Michael Rodemeyer, executive director of the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology, a research organization in Washington. 
 Monsanto, the widely acknowledged leader in crop biotechnology, said a few years ago that it would concentrate on soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat. Its plan for growth, at least for the next few years, is to expand acreage of the existing crops and come out with variations and combinations of the same traits. 
 Its plan for corn, detailed in an investor presentation in November, is instructive. Monsanto first came out in 1997 with BT corn, containing a bacterial toxin that makes the crop resistant to the corn borer. Then it introduced corn that was resistant to its Roundup herbicide -- a trait it first used in soybeans, which allows weed killer to be liberally applied without fear of killing the plant. More recently, it introduced a different BT corn, resistant to another pest, the rootworm.
 One reason for the difficulty that new gene-altered crops have is that food companies and farmers are reluctant to risk losing even a little bit of market share or attracting protests. Virus-resistant biotech potatoes were taken off the market by Monsanto after big potato processors and fast-food companies told growers that they did not want them. Lettuce growers in California balked at the introduction of Roundup Ready lettuce, said Kent J. Bradford, a professor of vegetable crops and director of the seed biotechnology center at Davis. 
 For smaller crops, the economic barriers now loom as large as customer resistance. Keith Redenbaugh, associate director for regulatory affairs at Seminis Vegetable Seeds, and Alan McHughen, a plant biotechnologist at the University of California at Riverside, wrote in California Agriculture magazine that some companies budget $50 million above what they spend on a conventional crop to bring a biotech seed to market, given the health and environmental tests required. The entire market for iceberg lettuce seeds is $27 million a year, they said, which is why it might be difficult to develop transgenic lettuce. 
 Some experts say the biotechnology companies must develop crops that offer more for the consumer or the food companies, not just the farmer. And, even with the cutbacks, there are still many crops in development. Syngenta is developing the StayRipe banana, which would remain edible up to five days longer than a conventional banana. It hopes to introduce the product around 2007. 
 Monsanto says it is working on soybeans that would produce healthier oils, either reducing harmful transfats or increasing the levels of the omega fatty acids that are good for the heart. But the company says its first such product, not expected for a few years, will be developed by conventional breeding. 
 ''The whole area is being held hostage until we get a great consumer trait that can pull these things through the market,'' Dr. Bradford said.
 And even consumer traits do not guarantee success. That first biotechnology crop, the 1994 Flavr Savr tomato, had a consumer-friendly trait: delayed rotting. But it failed in the United States for various reasons, like the problems growing, breeding and distributing it at low enough cost. Consumer opposition was not that big a factor, although some people thought that the tomato did not taste any better than conventional ones.

HEADLINE: A Guilty Plea Over Insider Trading at Enron

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The former corporate secretary of Enron, Paula Rieker, pleaded guilty to insider trading yesterday in Federal District Court in Houston and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of the company. 
 According to court papers filed by the Justice Department, Ms. Rieker, 49, made insider trades in July 2001 to avoid significant losses in Enron Broadband Services. 
 She also agreed to pay $499,333 to settle Securities and Exchange Commission accusations that included a claim she provided ''substantial assistance to Enron executives and senior managers'' in misleading the public about the company's finances. 
 The S.E.C. did not identify the executives. 
 William McLucas, a former S.E.C. enforcement director who investigated Enron's collapse for the company's board, said Ms. Rieker scheduled and attended almost all Enron board meetings, including several hastily arranged sessions in the fall of 2001 when Enron's financial crisis became public. 
 ''She would have been present for any and all meetings and executive sessions of the board,'' Mr. McLucas, a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering in Washington, said in an interview before the settlement. ''She was on late-night conference calls and emergency sessions. But I don't know what other bits of info she would be privy to that the board members would not.'' 
 In settling with the S.E.C., Ms. Rieker neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, an S.E.C. news release said. She also agreed to be barred from acting as the officer or director of a public company, the S.E.C. said. 
 Ms. Rieker pleaded guilty to selling 18,380 Enron shares in July 2001 after she learned that the company's broadband services division was ''experiencing significant problems'' and would have to report a $102 million loss for the quarter, according to court papers. That was more than the company had previously forecast for the entire year. 
 Ms. Rieker collected $629,000 from the stock sale, the papers said. 
 She first faced questions from investors about Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions in 1999, when the company disclosed that a senior officer was also running a partnership that did business with Enron, according to company documents released by Congress. 
 The senior officer was Andrew S. Fastow, who faces up to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to commit wire and securities fraud.

HEADLINE: Philharmonic To Give Home A New Interior

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The New York Philharmonic has decided to rebuild the inside of Avery Fisher Hall with a more intimate, acoustically improved auditorium and boldly redesigned public spaces while leaving the shell intact, the orchestra said yesterday.
 For years the Philharmonic has wrestled with the poor acoustics of Avery Fisher Hall, which have yet to improve despite various attempts and which contributed to the orchestra's interest last summer in merging with Carnegie Hall. 
 The new plan, agreed to by the Philharmonic at a recent board meeting and endorsed by Lincoln Center, which owns the 42-year-old hall, comes seven months after the orchestra abandoned discussions to move to Carnegie Hall. 
 The project would require the orchestra to be out of its home for one to two seasons and could cost as much as $300 million, those involved say. [An Appraisal, Page B3.] 
 The renovation could not begin until Lincoln Center's redesign of West 65th Street and Alice Tully Hall is complete in 2009, Lincoln Center executives said, because they do not want to have two halls out of commission at the same time.
 ''I think we've all said, 'If you're going to do something to the hall, there should be a transformative look to the place, and we and Lincoln Center would like to pursue that as an objective,''' said Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the Philharmonic. 
 ''It's not just the acoustics,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''I've always said the problem with the acoustics here are comparisons to Carnegie Hall. We need to make the hall more livable, more attractive. The bars, restaurants, staircases -- all of that needs to be thought about and updated. There's nothing wrong with bringing it into the 21st century. New York deserves that.''
 Reconstructing the interior has been tried before, most famously in 1976, by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. 
 Mr. Mehta stressed that there were several issues to be resolved, like the logistics of moving to a temporary location, something he asserted would be more complicated than the Museum of Modern Art's temporary move to Queens during the renovation of its Midtown home, still underway. ''It's one thing going to an essentially free exhibition space in Queens,'' he said, ''but to go out and pay $80 to $90 for a ticket, I don't know how people would do it.''
 In deciding on a large-scale renovation of the interior, the Philharmonic has decided against the two other options that had been under consideration. At one point the Philharmonic considered tearing down the entire building and starting over from scratch, a plan that was largely rejected as too costly, time-consuming and full of other problems given that the Avery Fisher family threatened legal action if the hall's name was changed.
 An internal renovation allows the orchestra to offer the auditorium as a naming opportunity for a large donor, an enticement generally considered essential for such an ambitious fund-raising effort.
 The Philharmonic also considered doing minor renovations to improve the hall without substantially changing its look, a strategy that seemed prudent a year ago during an economic downturn that affected donations to the arts and charities. But with the economy improving, this approach seemed overly cautious and unexciting, officials said. 
 ''What you want is a state-of-the-art facility,'' said Bruce Crawford, the chairman of Lincoln Center. ''You want Avery Fisher Hall to be aesthetically at the forefront. To do a patch job doesn't really make sense.''
 This kind of thinking was in part inspired by the enthusiastic reaction last month to Diller, Scofidio & Renfro's plans for redesigning West 65th Street, people involved with the project said. The successful opening of Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall, home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, in October was also a motivating factor, they said.
 The orchestra and Lincoln Center have agreed to share in the fund-raising for the renovation; a chairman will be appointed to lead the effort, Mr. Crawford said. 
 The Philharmonic must figure out how to juggle this kind of capital campaign with its current plans to increase its endowment by $75 million, to $263 million from $188 million. The orchestra is projecting a deficit of $3.3 million for the fiscal year that ends Aug. 31, a shortfall its officials attribute to investment losses. 
 When the New York Philharmonic last considered how to renovate the hall, before the planned merger with Carnegie Hall, Norman Foster was the architect selected to come up with a plan. Lord Foster has transformed the interiors of buildings to great acclaim, including the Reichstag in Berlin and the British Museum.
 Among his ideas was eliminating the third balcony and raising the ceiling up to the roof to create greater acoustical volume. The Foster plan proposed shifting the auditorium to create space for a smaller recital hall that could also be used for lectures and educational programming, people familiar with the plans said.
 Some Philharmonic board members have said it is important to create a second space for more adventuresome programming to attract new audiences. This seems particularly pressing given the opening of Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall's third and more experimental stage, last fall.
 The Philharmonic plans to revisit the Foster plans, although the architect has not been officially designated and the specifics of the renovation have yet to be resolved. ''We still want Foster to do it,'' Mr. Crawford said.
 Mr. Mehta said he believed that Avery Fisher Hall, which has 2,738 seats, would benefit from a more intimate setting, with a platform stage surrounded by audience members on all sides -- as in Disney Hall -- and 350 fewer seats. ''You're listening to music, and we have a hall that is rather long,'' he said. ''Today I think people feel they want to be more involved.''
 In addition to being the landlord at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center presents its own programming there -- Great Performers, Mostly Mozart, the Lincoln Center Festival, for example -- although the Philharmonic dominates the schedule. A renovation of Avery Fisher Hall would require Lincoln Center to find temporary quarters for these events. 
 Ideally the Philharmonic would like to build its temporary home in Damrosch Park, between the Metropolitan Opera House and the New York State Theater, so the orchestra could remain on campus and reduce the risk of losing some of its audience. 
 But creating an acoustically adequate temporary theater, with office space, would be difficult, and costly, those involved say. The idea, which was explored before the Philharmonic turned to Carnegie Hall, had been estimated at about $30 million. A tent of the kind used by the Big Apple Circus in Damrosch Park would not be acoustically suitable, Lincoln Center officials pointed out. 
 The Philharmonic is also considering the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street. Under its previous music director, Kurt Masur, the orchestra looked at the armory as a summer home or as a setting for more informal concerts modeled after the London Proms, to attract a young audience.
 Mr. Mehta said a temporary move to Carnegie Hall was not an option because it would force Carnegie Hall to oust its regular presentations.
 The Philharmonic's redevelopment team is being led by Katherine G. Farley, the chairwoman of the board's real estate committee. Ms. Farley, who also serves on Lincoln Center's board, was instrumental in pursuing the merger with Carnegie even as she was leading the Philharmonic's renovation plans for Avery Fisher Hall, prompting some to question her loyalties at the time. Ms. Farley's husband, the developer Jerry I. Speyer, is on the board of Carnegie Hall. 
 Last June, Mr. Mehta said in an interview that he hoped to earmark $3 million to $4 million for a new pipe organ when Avery Fisher Hall was rebuilt or renovated. Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, said the possibility of an organ had yet to be resolved, along with many other issues. 
 ''We've got a lot of work to do and a lot of time to spend with one another,'' Mr. Levy said.

HEADLINE: To Get Weapons Away From Iraqis, the Army Sets Up an Arms Bazaar

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 19 

 BODY:
In the year since Saddam Hussein was overthrown, American-led troops have used a wide range of force to combat insurgents opposed to the military occupation. This week the army tried a new approach to silence Iraqi guns:
 Buy them.
 In their first program of its kind in Baghdad, American troops engaged in a weapons buyback program. It began on Saturday and was so popular that it was extended for another two days. 
 By Tuesday night hundreds of Iraqis had been paid $761,357 for 56,536 items, from bullets to assault rifles to mortars and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to the military. The soldiers set up well-guarded sales tables at three locations -- a field, a cigarette factory and a soccer stadium surrounded by an empty lot.
 ''This is probably the only place in Baghdad where they can walk up with an R.P.G. launcher and not have a coalition soldier shoot at them,'' said Col. Robert Abrams, commander of the troops carrying out the program on a dusty lot outside Baghdad.
 ''We are trying to get as many weapons as possible out of their hands and into ours,'' said Capt. Bill Williams.
 Around him, soldiers wandered among hundreds of AK-47 assault rifles piled up in the old soccer stadium, just outside of the slum of Sadr City, one of Baghdad's worst areas of fighting between insurgents and American forces.
 Iraqi forces formed the first line of defense at the stadium, forcing men into line and making sure that the weapons were not loaded before their owners were allowed past the barbed wire to wait their turn.
 Inside the walled stadium, American soldiers sat behind portable tables.
 Iraqis carried their rifles in old sugar and rice sacks. One little boy carried a plastic bag full of bullets. Another clutched a handful of explosives primers. ''Scrap,'' an American soldier said after he examined those, and flung them into a garbage heap.
 An Iraqi man was shown to an American soldier seated behind the grenades table.
 ''One grenade,'' said the man.
 ''Just one grenade?'' said the soldier incredulously.
 The man handed it over and received a voucher for $20.
 The Americans had to draft their price list based on what the Iraqi police had told them were above the black-market rates.
 ''It's not like you can go to WalMart and find out what the prices are,'' Captain Williams said.
 A Strella antiaircraft missile, complete with a launcher and sights, earned $500. AK-47's, the weapon of choice in Iraq, sold for $200 the first few days, but by Tuesday the price was down to $125 to narrow the margin above the black-market price.
 But rocket-propelled grenade launchers that sold for $160 in the first few days rose to $220 by Tuesday at the Sadr City cigarette factory because the Americans found that Iraqis were not interested enough to sell them at the lower price.
 In addition to the economy of supply and demand, prices were negotiable in the true spirit of Middle Eastern market bargaining.
 A man named Ali was not satisfied with the price of $160 quoted by Sgt. First Class John Westcott for his brand new Russian RPK machine gun.
 ''This is new!'' he said, peeling back the wrapping further on the weapon, which was shiny with oil. ''I want $200 for it.''
 Sergeant Westcott reflected. ''O.K.,'' he said. ''Bump up the RPK to $200!''
 Ali walked away a satisfied man, pocketing $600 for his two AK-47's and his RPK, and $75 for an old BKC machine gun that if it had not been broken and rusty would have earned him $500.
 ''I have two kids,'' said Ali, a 38-year-old satellite engineer. ''It would take me four months to earn this.''
 The weapons program highlighted the type of conflict the American forces are fighting in Baghdad and other cities. Claylike rolls of PE-4A explosive were turned in for $40 each. Insurgents pack Pepsi cans with the explosive to booby trap convoys, soldiers said.
 There were tank-mounted machine guns that could be fired from cars. Mortars suggested a hit-and-run force.
 ''They pretty much fight urban guerrilla tactics with any weapons they have,'' said First Sgt. Corey Sanders at the Sadr City cigarette factory program. ''They'll put the mortar system in the trunk of a car.''
 Many Iraqis would not give their names to a reporter, because they were afraid of retaliation from militias. Some men sent the women of their household or their children to turn in the weapons because they feared arrest.
 After the Iraqis received their vouchers and stood on another line to be paid, they complained about the prices.
 ''This mortar is a heavy weapon,'' said Karim Abdel-Selim, a middle-aged man in the payment line. ''It is worth twice as much as the $200 I am getting for it. But there are many more where it came from.''
 A little girl approached an American soldier, asking for more than the $20 she had gotten for ammunition rounds. ''Just write in another $5 on the voucher,'' an Iraqi bystander urged her.
 Iraqi men are allowed to keep one weapon each. Pistols are not allowed, because they are easily concealed, but one AK-47 is permissible for household security.
 Some Iraqi men said that with the money they had made they could go out and buy more weapons from the black market.
 ''We sell them the old ones and buy new ones on the black market,'' said Ali Mohsin. ''I sold one AK-47 that I did not need, but what I am really good at is firing a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.''

HEADLINE: Highway spending is meant to be a public investment in the nation's infrastructure that pays off for everyone. Does it?

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness'' (HarperCollins).

 BODY:
CONGRESS and the White House are wrangling over how much the federal government should spend on highways.
 The White House proposed a $256 billion budget for roads, bridges and transit over the next six years. (The previous six-year measure, which expired last year, cost $218 billion.) The House passed a $284 billion version, while the Senate further upped the ante to $318 billion. The White House threatens to veto those amounts as too lavish. 
 To political analysts, the highway bill is a popular program that has fallen prey to partisan, and intraparty, bickering. Lost in the dispute is the economic question: What are we getting for our money?
 Unlike such transfer programs as Medicare or Social Security, which redistribute existing income, the money the government spends on infrastructure isn't supposed to simply shift resources from one group to another. It's meant as public investment: spending that enhances productivity and thus increases the country's future income, making everyone better off.
 The returns on those investments don't come back to the Treasury directly, the way private-sector returns do to investors. But in theory, infrastructure investments benefit taxpayers indirectly by increasing the nation's wealth.
 How effective is the investment?
 In an article in the March issue of The Journal of Urban Economics, two economists look at exactly how highway spending increases productivity -- by lowering businesses' inventory and logistics costs -- and calculate how the returns on highway spending have changed over time.
 To make that calculation, Chad Shirley of the RAND Corporation and Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution used census data on the inventory levels at 50,000 to 75,000 individual plants from 1973 to 1996. They looked at how infrastructure investment, both within each plant's state and across state lines, affected those costs, holding constant other influences like interest rates and changing inventory practices.
 The results are striking. Infrastructure spending does indeed lower inventory and logistics costs, increasing productivity. But the rate of return plummeted over time, from more than 15 percent in the 1970's to less than 5 percent in the 1980's and 1990's. (These figures are corrected for inflation.)
 There's a logical reason for those diminishing returns.
 ''By the late 1970's, the Interstate highway system was substantially completed,'' the economists write. ''During the past two decades, the primary objective of highway spending has shifted from expanding the nation's capital stock to maintaining it. Undoubtedly, the improvement in costs and service from such investments and the concomitant reduction in plants' inventories cannot compare with those produced by the construction of thousands of miles of new roads.''
 The changing value of new infrastructure investment, Dr. Winston explains in an interview, helps to reconcile two distinct lines of economic research.
 Macroeconomists have emphasized the returns of government infrastructure spending, arguing that public investment is important to spur economic productivity.
 Transportation economists, meanwhile, have looked at the specific details of the system: how roads are paid for, where they are built, what trade-offs are made between upfront construction costs and maintenance, whether road users pay the full costs they incur, and so forth.
 This research has ''consistently found very poor performance -- lots of inefficiencies,'' Dr. Winston said. ''The stuff is mispriced. The stuff is improperly built. There's a huge amount of waste.''
 How could infrastructure spending be both productive and inefficient?
 One possible explanation is that as the system has matured, the inefficiencies have become more important, dragging down the returns on new spending.
 Consider the choice between the immediate cost of building thicker roads in the first place and the long-term cost of repairing thinner roads as they wear down. An economic calculation would have suggested much thicker Interstate highways, even ignoring the cost of disrupting traffic with repairs.
 But the Interstates were built relatively thin, in part because of political pressures to get the system spread everywhere as quickly as possible. Now they're wearing out, and money must go for repairs. That investment, while necessary, is inefficient and yields a relatively low return.
 At the same time, Dr. Winston notes, the absolute amount of highway spending has gone up. Even good returns tend to diminish from the first dollar to the last.
 ''Even if the possibility for getting returns had not changed since the 70's, you're going to get lower rates of return just because you're pumping more money into the system,'' he said.
 Of course, drivers might not care much about economic returns if highway spending reduced congestion. Wasted time isn't counted in government productivity statistics, but it's still costly.
 Unfortunately, a new unpublished working paper by Dr. Winston and a Brookings colleague, Ashley Langer, suggests that highway spending isn't doing much to reduce congestion costs either.
 On average, they write, ''one dollar of annual highway spending reduces the annual congestion costs to road users only 8 cents.'' This is not a return on a one-time investment but a continuing expense; we have to keep spending that dollar to get the 8 cents.
 Dr. Winston cautions that the specific number may change as the working paper is revised, but that the general point -- a very small effect -- seems certain.
 While the papers attack the problem in different ways, Dr. Winston said: ''The touchstone of the whole enterprise is trying to say, What are we getting for this spending? The returns on this are really low.''
 But, he acknowledges, neither Congress nor the White House seems terribly interested in the economic questions. ''It's tough to get the debate centered on the issues we're talking about,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Attention Deficit Disorder in a Most Peculiar Empire

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

COLOSSUS
The Price of America's Empire
By Niall Ferguson
384 pages. Penguin Press. $25.95.
 The British historian Niall Ferguson seems to have one unshakable conviction: that empire, to borrow a phrase from Martha Stewart, can be a good thing.
 In his last book, ''Empire,'' published just a year ago as the statue of Saddam Hussein came tumbling down in Baghdad, the author celebrated the achievements of the late British Empire and exhorted the United States to accept its role as the British Empire's successor. Many of the positive achievements Mr. Ferguson cited as a legacy of the British Empire -- like the exportation of democracy and liberal capitalism -- uncannily echoed aims articulated by Bush administration proponents of the war against Iraq.
 In the perplexing and sometimes self-contradictory new book ''Colossus,'' being published as problems in Iraq continue to metastasize, Mr. Ferguson again sings the praises of empire. But while he argues that America should openly embrace an imperial role -- ''many parts of the world would benefit from a period of American rule,'' he asserts -- he devotes much of this book to examining why America's imperial undertakings in the past have been ''almost invariably short-lived and their results ephemeral.''
 Shrugging off assertions by American politicians like President Bush that the country does not have imperial ambitions or traits, Mr. Ferguson writes: ''The United States today is an empire -- but a peculiar kind of empire. It is vastly wealthy. It is militarily peerless. It has astonishing cultural reach. Yet by comparison with other empires it often struggles to impose its will beyond its shores. Its successes in exporting American institutions to foreign lands have been outnumbered by its failures.''
 Like his earlier books, ''Colossus'' shows off Mr. Ferguson's narrative elan and his ease in using political, economic and literary references to shore up his arguments about history. But like his last book, it is also a fiercely didactic work, often hobbled by its commitment to certain idees fixes.
 Mr. Ferguson discusses the positive legacy of the British Empire at length in these pages but whitewashes its dark side (i.e., land-grabbing, exploitation of slaves in the 18th century and brutal put-downs of challenges to imperial authority). And he fails to come to terms with the tectonic changes wrought by independence movements and ethnic and religious politics in the years since the end of World War II.
 Assuming a smug, paternalistic tone, he suggests that for some countries, ''some form of imperial governance, meaning a partial or complete suspension of their national sovereignty, might be better than full independence, not just for a few months or years but for decades.'' Yet in laying out both the altruistic and the self-interested arguments for empire (from promoting economic growth to containing terrorism and regional wars), he fails to grapple with the question of how these unnamed countries might feel about being occupied or governed by an imperial power -- how nationalism and religious convictions can fuel rage and dissent, and lead to broader animosities and destabilization. In short, he seems to have anticipated little of the anger and resentment that Iraqis are now displaying toward the United States.
 The more persuasive parts of this book deal not with Mr. Ferguson's prescriptions for global order but with his retrospective analysis of America's conflicted attitude toward expansion and annexation. After rapidly spreading westward across the North American continent, he notes, the nation eschewed ''the voracious appetite for territorial expansion overseas that characterized the empires of the West European seaboard,'' electing to embrace the notion ''that foreigners will Americanize themselves without the need for formal rule.''
 The acquisition of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, like the long-term occupation and rebuilding of Japan and West Germany after World War II, Mr. Ferguson suggests, are the exceptions in American ventures abroad. More typical, in his view, are America's ''history of spasmodic intervention in Central America and the Caribbean that has continued to the present day'' and its costly experience in the Philippines.
 According to Mr. Ferguson, there are ''seven characteristic phases of American engagement'' -- phases that may be of particular interest to the reader right now, given the last year's events in Iraq. Those seven phases are: 1) ''impressive initial military success,'' 2) ''a flawed assessment of indigenous sentiment,'' 3) ''a strategy of limited war and gradual escalation of forces,'' 4) ''domestic disillusionment in the face of protracted and nasty conflict,'' 5) ''premature democratization,'' 6) ''the ascendancy of domestic economic considerations'' and 7) ''ultimate withdrawal.''
 Why, Mr. Ferguson asks, has the United States had such a disappointing record ''when it has sought to bring about changes of political regime abroad''? He comes up with three primary reasons: America's ''economic deficit'' (which in his view is due not to grandiose overseas military plans, but to ''a chronic mismatch between earlier Social Security legislation'' and ''the changing demographics of American society''); its ''manpower deficit'' (meaning the lack, compared with that of imperial Britain, of well-educated people eager to live for many years abroad as settlers or administrators); and finally, ''its attention deficit.''
 Mr. Ferguson regards America's A.D.D. as the most important factor and attributes it to both the country's historical ambivalence about imperialism and the nature of its political process. Presidential elections every four years, combined with midterm congressional elections, he suggests, tend to make office-holders wary of long, unpopular or expensive foreign commitments. Some of the United States' worst failures abroad in Vietnam, Cuba and Haiti, he argues, can be attributed to the ''fatal combination of inadequate resources for nonmilitary purposes and a truncated time horizon.''
 If, he goes on, ''the United States finally submits to political pressure at home and abroad by withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan before their economic reconstruction has been achieved, the scene will not be wholly unfamiliar. The limits of American power will be laid bare when the global Terminator finally admits: 'I won't be back.' '' 
 In the end, Mr. Ferguson concludes, the United States ''looks unlikely to be an effective liberal empire without some profound changes in its economic structure, its social makeup and its political culture'' -- a conclusion that begs the question of why he began calling for America to embrace its imperial destiny in the first place.

HEADLINE: China Fuels Brazil's Dream of Being a Steel Power

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 20 

 BODY:
Blessed with abundant raw materials, cheap labor and top-notch technology, Brazil is looking to become a major player in the global steel industry with the help of some deep-pocketed foreign friends.
 Despite recent efforts in China to cool its red-hot economy, Brazil's steel industry is racing to keep up with the demand there, investing billions of dollars to increase its production capacity by more than 30 percent in the next four years. While the bulk of the financing is expected to come from Brazil's own steel industry and local banks, international steel companies are also getting in on the action to guarantee a steady flow of resources back home.
 Leading the way are global heavyweights like the Baosteel Shanghai Group of China and Arcelor of Luxembourg, both of which are still planning to build blast furnaces to churn out steel in Brazil. The Dongkuk Steel Mill Company of South Korea and the Italian metals group Danieli are also helping to finance the construction of a $700 million steel slab plant in the northeastern Brazilian state of Ceara. 
 Brazil, the largest economy in South America, has long had big dreams about steel. But years of sluggish economic growth and the high cost of credit kept the industry from expanding faster. With China's voracious appetite for raw materials having breathed life into steel companies across the globe, Brazil is among the main beneficiaries.
 ''The plans this time for these facilities look as though they are well founded, mainly because they are on the basis of the need for steel from a growing economy in China and will partially be funded by outside sources with a lot of money,'' said Karlis Kirsis, a managing partner at World Steel Dynamics, a steel research group in New Jersey.
 To be sure, now that the Chinese government is taking steps to stop the economy from overheating, many analysts fear that China may not need as much foreign steel as initially thought. Indeed, when Chinese authorities recently said they were considering canceling some construction projects and even temporarily forbidding banks from making loans, share prices in Brazilian steel companies sank on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange on fears of diminished demand.
 Others, however, say those fears are overblown.
 ''Even if China's economy starts to cool off,'' said Germano Mendes De Paula, a steel specialist at the Federal University of Uberlandia in Minas Gerais, ''millions of Chinese are leaving the countryside each year to move to cities. It's not hard to imagine the demand for housing, and thus steel, that migration like that generates.'' 
 ''Demand from China may shrink a bit, but it's not going to dry up anytime soon,'' he added. 
 The prospect of steady demand from China has steel makers just about everywhere looking to increase production, stoking concerns about a possible glut of steel that could drive down prices. Even so, a low-cost producer like Brazil appears better positioned than most to weather the storm, if there is one.
 ''If anyone is going to be able keep raising production capacity, it's Brazil,'' said Luciana Machado, a steel analyst at Fator Corretora, a Sao Paulo brokerage firm. ''It's simply not feasible for other countries, even the big steel consumers, to keep raising output because they don't have all the conditions that Brazil does.''
 Drawn by Brazil's vast reserves of iron ore, an essential ingredient of steel, Baosteel is joining forces with the Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, or C.V.R.D., as it is widely known, to build a $1.5 billion steel mill in Sao Luis, a coastal city in the poor northeastern state of Maranhao. Instead of shipping iron ore back to China, Baosteel hopes to save money by shipping lighter, ready-to-go steel slabs from Sao Luis, which is only a few days by ship from the Panama Canal.
 The plant is expected to produce about 3.5 million metric tons of steel a year by 2007 and eventually expand output to 7.5 million tons. Arcelor, which is the world's largest steel maker, and Brazil's state-run National Bank of Economic and Social Development are also considering investing in the project.
 In addition, the bank recently signed a letter of intent to offer $110 million in financing for a separate steel slab plant further to the east in Ceara, where the state government is trying to woo foreign investors by guaranteeing natural gas supplies for the venture. Dongkuk Steel and Danieli have already signed up for the project, as has C.V.R.D., the world's biggest producer and exporter of iron ore. The plant is expected to produce 1.5 million tons of steel for export by the middle of 2006, bringing in about $600 million a year in revenue.
 Brazil is not relying only on outsiders to bankroll its steel boom. The Brazilian Steel Institute, a trade association, announced late last month that the industry planned to invest $7.4 billion through the end of 2008 to raise production by 10 million tons a year, to 44 million. If the plan is a success, Brazil would jump from the world's ninth-largest steel producer to No.6, displacing Germany.
 ''What we're seeing today is a great window of opportunity for the Brazilian steel industry to grow, and in a big way,'' said Gabriel Stoliar, executive director of strategic planning at C.V.R.D., which brought in a record $1.55 billion in profit last year. ''But we can't waste time. The time to invest is now so we can guarantee our place in the world.''
 While some of the extra capacity will be consumed domestically, most is likely to be exported to faster-growing economies abroad, especially China. The Chinese gobbled up 2.4 million tons of Brazilian steel in 2003, or $730 million worth, making it the country's top export market ahead of the United States. China is on track to import even more from Brazil this year.
 Betting that China will continue to play a crucial role in Brazil's economic future, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is heading to Beijing on Friday in a bid to expand trade. It will be the first visit to China by a Brazilian head of state in nine years.
 Almost 400 Brazilian business leaders have signed up to join Mr. da Silva on the six-day trip, some hoping to persuade the Chinese to invest in infrastructure projects in Brazil to speed up the export of raw materials like iron ore and other goods. Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, already traveled to China in March to lobby the Chinese to help finance as much as $5 billion in railways and roads in Brazil. 
 ''Without a doubt, China has been a huge stimulus for steel makers everywhere, but we're particularly important to them because of our iron ore,'' said Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter, president of Grupo Gerdau, the Brazilian steel company.

HEADLINE: April Uptick In Index Used To Forecast

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A private research group said yesterday that its closely watched indicator of future economic activity edged up in April, providing more evidence of a sustained recovery. 
 In other economic news, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 12,000, to 345,000 last week. That was higher than the 326,000 forecast by analysts. But the more stable four-week moving average of claims declined to 333,500, the lowest level since November 2000. 
 The Conference Board said its composite index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in April, after a revised gain of 0.8 percent in March. The latest increase was slightly lower than the 0.2 percent rise forecast by analysts. 
 But together with a March reading that was notably stronger than first reported, the April uptick points to an economy with plenty of momentum, economists said. 
 ''If you look at where the index stood before today's number and where it stands now, it's showing a good potential for growth,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. ''We're still growing at an above-average rate, and it looks like that kind of growth can continue.'' 
 The index is tracked as a measure of the economy's direction during the coming six months. Of the 10 components making up the index, 4 increased last month, including the real money supply, building permits and stock prices. 
 The economic reading reported by the Conference Board means the leading index has risen 1.8 percent over the last six months, and signals a likelihood of strong growth through the third quarter of this year. 
 ''While there are growing concerns about rising gasoline prices this spring, as well as worries about what happens after all the tax refunds have been spent, the indicators are not signaling any softening in America's basic economic fundamentals,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the Conference Board. 
 The Conference Board also said its gauge of current economic activity continued to strengthen in April, rising 0.3 percent. 
 At the same time, the group's lagging index, which reflects the economic climate in the recent past, increased 0.2 percent last month, after a 0.1 percent dip in March. 
 The slight rise in the leading indicators in April comes after a significant increase in March. The board had originally reported a 0.3 percent increase, but revised that figure to 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Off to a Showroom, Diploma in Hand

BYLINE: By LISA KALIS

 BODY:
WITH high-school graduation time -- and, for the lucky, the concomitant high-school graduation car -- approaching, a growing number of teenagers and their parents have been hitting Web sites, scanning the papers and visiting dealers' lots. They are weighing factors like price, safety and gas mileage against the harder-to-define hipness factor to come up with a car they can agree on. 
 And what do American teenagers want in their driveways? 
 Believe it or not, a Honda Civic.
 The reason: ''It's easy to trick up a Civic,'' said Michael Wood, a vice president at the consulting firm of Teenage Research Unlimited of Northbrook, Ill., which this spring surveyed people nationwide aged 12 to 19 about what car they'd most like to have. ''Teens have definitely increased their interest in customizing cars.'' 
 Indeed, while many parents may remember longing for the muscle cars from their own high school parking lots -- Pontiac Trans Ams and Chevrolet Camaros -- what young drivers are looking for these days is not so much pure horsepower as ''something fun to drive, that doesn't look like Mom and Dad's vehicle,'' said Jeff Brodoski, an auto analyst at Troy, Mich., office of J. D. Power & Associates. 
 In a 2003 poll, 40 percent of the drivers aged 18 to 24 said that their cars should express their personalities (30 percent in that age group said a car's purpose is to go from place to place), according to Simmons Market Research in New York.
 Nate Carroll, 17, a high-school senior in Virginia Beach, said that he hadn't decided exactly what kind of car he wanted (his parents are willing to spend up to $20,000, ruling out his top choice, the $25,000 Toyota Celica GT-S), but he has already picked out his accessories: a cold-air intake and a cat-back exhaust system to bolster horsepower. He thinks they'd be handy on the street, and maybe even on a track or two. ''I'll probably do actual races,'' he said.
 He is hardly the only one planning to load up on things like body graphics kits, big tires and fancy rims. Inspired in part by shows like MTV's ''Pimp My Ride,'' in which wrecks are dressed up with everything from hand-tooled leather to espresso machines, young drivers are increasingly contributing to the $29 billion auto accessories market, according to the Specialty Equipment Market Association. In many cases they're adding these parts to what are, essentially, budget-priced family cars. Rounding out Teen Research's top five teenager cars were the Ford Mustang (Mr. Brodoski called it ''the only true affordable muscle car'' left), followed by the Honda Accord, Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Chevy Cavalier.
 Despite the add-ons, ''the resale value doesn't go up,'' said Toby Ristau, manager of the J. C. Whitney aftermarket shop in LaSalle, Ill., where most customers are under 25 -- and 80 percent of the parts are built for Hondas. ''You can put in $3,000 worth of parts, and it's still only worth Blue Book.''
 Teenagers haven't necessarily given up their longing for speed and power. ''They want a little rocket,'' said Steve Trisdale, who sells new and used cars in Amesbury, Mass. They just don't often get it. At Marietta Sportscar, a specialty used-car dealer outside Atlanta, Glen Williams, a salesman, said that he sometimes found teenagers by the expensive Audis or certain high-horsepower Volkswagens. But ''typically they get steered away from those,'' he said. ''The kids are usually wanting more, and the parents are wanting less.'' The families who shop there -- about 150 a year -- often agree on a basic five-year-old Volkswagen Jetta, at about $10,000 to $15,000.
 Indeed, Frances Zapanta, 18, estimates that there were close to 30 Jettas at her high school, in Bakersfield, Calif. She, however, took another route. Knowing that her parents would buy her a car when she graduated, she spent a year researching models, taking test drives and studying crash ratings online. ''I'm really paranoid about things,'' she said. ''I wanted to have a car that's safe.'' Her final choice: a $33,000 2003 BMW 325i. She acknowledged, ''It's a fun car to drive.'' 
 Whatever the wheels, a growing number of young drivers have their own. This spring, 16 percent of teenagers aged 16 to 19 planned to buy a used car in the next 12 months, while another 15 percent planned to buy a new car, according to Teenage Research. That's up from 13 percent for used and 12 percent for new in 1999. The poll didn't ask who would pay, but parents usually carry at least part of the cost for this age group -- as well as some of the insurance responsibility. Victoria Larson, an Allstate agent in Bartlett, Ill., said that most of her clients with children add teenagers to their existing policies, since it's much less expensive than taking out new ones.
 And if teenagers' car choices seem ''not quite as aspirational as you might imagine,'' as Andy Turton, president of the research firm of TNS Automotive said, that might be partly driven by insurance considerations. Premiums vary by location, car and driving record, but a teenage boy with a good driving record could end up paying $1,000 a year extra if the car is a high-performance vehicle like the Ford Focus SVT rather than a comparably priced Honda Civic EX sedan.
 It's something Twyla Tuten of North Augusta, S.C., thought about when she bought her daughter a graduation car three years ago. She was most concerned with reliability and price, and while she didn't mind a sporty-looking car, Ms. Tuten preferred a model ''that wouldn't give her as much speed -- that becomes an insurance issue.'' The family settled on a 2002 Saturn Coupe. (Her daughter felt that too many teenagers already had Civics, their other choice.)
 Of course, cost is not the only factor prompting parents to favor certain models. ''He wants a small car, like a sports car. I say, no way,'' said Kwang Moon about his son Jansen, 18, who graduates in New York this year. ''Every month I see a car accident.'' He says an S.U.V. will be safer, something like his own Toyota 4Runner.
 His son hasn't given up yet. ''I'm trying to convince them to buy me a Mazda6,'' he said. ''It'll be easier to park. It looks nice, too.'' 
 Even when parents get their way, teenagers don't always cooperate. Michael Wood of Teenage Research knows one teenager who inherited a cushy Jeep Grand Cherokee from his mother and had the doors taken off to make it more like a classic Jeep. ''Everywhere he went, he literally stopped traffic,'' Mr. Wood said. ''It was a way to get noticed.''
 And as some students learn, there's big a difference between getting a car and being able to use it. When Chris Kilpatrick graduated from high school in 2001, his parents agreed to buy him a two-year-old $13,000 Mitsubishi Gallant. To dress it up, he quickly added 15-spoke wheels, a roaring muffler, new speakers, two subwoofers and a rear spoiler for $1,500. The only problem: His grades have been so low that his parents have refused to let him take the car to college in Gainesville, Fla. ''I kept getting D's,'' said Mr. Kilpatrick, now a junior. ''Their platform was that it would be a distraction,'' he said. So it is sitting in his family's driveway, 90 miles from his dorm. There is some good news. He pulled his grades up last semester and hopes to take it with him in the fall.

HEADLINE: Ruling Grants 900 Illinois Judges Back Pay

BYLINE: By JO NAPOLITANO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 20 

 BODY:
The State Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Illinois must pay back wages to its 900 judges, including those on the high court, effectively ending a dispute that had gone on for nearly a year. 
 The court said Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich violated the state Constitution last July when he vetoed a 2.8 percent cost of living increase for the judges. The annual increases were established by a legislative resolution in 1990. 
 After the veto, the judges ordered Comptroller Daniel W. Hynes to pay the raises. He refused, and the state attorney general intervened, saying the court had acted without a case before it. The ruling on Thursday came in a case brought by two judges in Cook County.
 The governor's office said the judges should not have pressed for more money when the state was already slashing its budget, making significant cuts across the board. 
 ''We think that the decision is unfair to all the workers in Illinois sharing in the sacrifice to help pull the state out of its worst fiscal crisis ever,'' said Abby Ottenhoff, a spokeswoman for the governor. ''When the state is facing historic deficits and we have to make difficult decisions as to how to use our resources, it is unfair for any public official to have an increase in pay when we need to focus on how to meet the needs of the people of Illinois in terms of education, health care and public services.''
 Mr. Hynes said the judges would get their money, a total of $3.8 million for the 2004 fiscal year.
 He said the issue had raised important constitutional questions that needed to be resolved in court. 
 ''The Supreme Court has provided that resolution, and we will pay the vouchers once they have been submitted by the administrative office of the Illinois courts,'' he said in a statement on Thursday. 
 The court, citing numerous occasions in which judges' salaries were threatened, including the Depression, held that the governor had no right to flout the law even in the toughest fiscal times. 
 ''The adverse economic conditions facing so many of our fellow citizens have taken an inevitable toll on the state's treasury,'' Justice Philip J. Rarick wrote. ''As administrators of the judiciary, we make every effort to economize whenever and however we can. One thing we cannot do, however, is ignore the Constitution of Illinois.'' 
 The court has long maintained that the judicial branch of government must have protected salaries and cost of living raises so that they may act as an independent body free from the fear that an unfavorable ruling might jeopardize their pay. 
 ''One of the principal means by which the founding fathers sought to protect the judiciary was by denying the other branches of government the power to diminish judicial compensation,'' Justice Rarick said. 
 Judges here earn more than $127,000 a year. Supreme Court justices earn $158,000.

More than 17,000 employers in the United States have discontinued their traditional pension plans in the last 10 years. Countless others have scaled them back. Such pensions, with their promise of guaranteed, gold-watch-to-grave income, are considered by many companies to be too costly and cumbersome, and, in their view, it is only a matter of time before they disappear completely. 
 Now, though, one big employer is resisting the tide. This month, the United Methodist Church voted at its quadrennial meeting to start an old-fashioned, defined-benefit pension plan for its 25,000 American pastors and lay employees -- the very type of plan that so many companies have scuttled. 
 The United Methodist Church appears to be the first sizable employer to create such a pension plan in many years. The church has about $12 billion in other types of retirement plans, putting it on a par with big pension plan sponsors like Bank of America and Dow Chemical. The Methodists' new plan will cover about as many people as the one that R.J. Reynolds runs for its employees in the United States. 
 The only other recent pension start-up known to regulators is a much smaller plan, created last year for the police and firefighters of Lighthouse Point, Fla. 
 For older workers, the birth of a brand-new pension fund holds out tantalizing possibilities. As aging baby boomers have begun to contemplate their retirements, some have shown renewed appreciation for the defined-benefit pension.
 In the booming 1990's, workers happily enjoyed the gains they recorded on their defined-contribution plans -- like the 401(k) -- that companies often set up to replace their discontinued pension plans.
 But the bursting of the stock market bubble showed how quickly a hard-earned 401(k) balance could melt away, and the sturdy old pension began to look better by contrast. 
 A pension is guaranteed by the government and is paid as a stream of checks from a pooled trust. Retirees who have them do not have to worry about investing badly or outliving their assets. The rekindled interest in traditional pensions, however, comes at a time when most employers have decided that it makes no sense to start a pension fund. 
 Defined-contribution plans are widely seen as simpler to set up and cheaper to offer. They offer employers tax advantages, just as traditional pensions do, but they do not involve making promises that an employer may not be willing or able to keep 40 years hence. 
 Nor do defined-contribution plans require companies to set aside money in a trust fund to comply with complex federal regulations. More than two-thirds of America's 500 largest companies still run such pension funds, but they have complained for years that the federal funding rules were confusing and punitive, forcing them to lock away cash at times when cash was unavailable, among other burdens.
 In the last few years, so many companies complained and threatened to drop out of the pension business that Congress voted in April to relax the rules somewhat.
 Against that unhappy backdrop, the United Methodists offer a rare sign that not everyone thinks pensions are a losing proposition.
 ''I guess I'm old-fashioned,'' said Barbara Boigegrain, secretary general of the United Methodist Church's General Board of Pension and Health Benefits. ''But I don't feel that a defined-contribution plan only is necessarily the best way to take care of employees. Especially for a large, stable organization that has a considerable future in front of it.''
 The United Methodists have a couple of big advantages over profit-making companies in their ability to offer pensions. Churches are allowed to opt out of the federal pension insurance program, for one thing. Those that do, like the United Methodists, are no longer required to follow the much-criticized federal pension rules. For-profit companies have no choice but to follow the law or close down their pension funds.
 Nor are the United Methodists trying to run a business on behalf of investors. They have no shareholders who might see large sums piling up in a pension fund and complain that the money would have been better spent on business pursuits. 
 But the United Methodists could set an example for others not subject to the federal pension rules. Potential converts include county hospitals, state universities, police and fire brigades, public and parochial school systems, professional associations and other employers outside the private sector. 
 Church officials say that in any case, they can justify their decision on solid financial grounds. Their experience running a 401(k)-like defined-contribution plan left them unconvinced that such programs are cheaper and simpler to run than pension funds. Their defined-contribution plan has been an administrative nightmare, with volunteer workers in thousands of far-flung churches doing the payroll deductions and paperwork, according to their own systems and schedules. 
 ''Every time the money gets transferred, or somebody transfers the wrong amount, or does it late, it's just a mess,'' said Ron Gebhardtsbauer, a United Methodist pension trustee who is also the senior pension fellow of the American Academy of Actuaries. ''It was obvious that a defined-benefit plan would be easier to administer.'' 
 Mr. Gebhardtsbauer said that making one big pension contribution a year, leaving the individual churches out of the administration, would significantly reduce the paper chase. ''More of the money,'' he predicted, ''can be spent on benefits.'' 
 In addition, the United Methodists' existing retirement plan was troubled by its own success. The denomination followed the unusual policy of managing all pastors' retirement accounts for them, on the thinking that their time was better spent on the ministry than the stock market.
 By 1999, their investments had reaped such big returns that some pastors could retire, withdraw their retirement balances, and buy annuities that paid better incomes than they would have earned by staying in the pulpit.
 ''We pushed them out the door,'' Mr. Gebhardtsbauer said. ''That was a mistake. Under a defined-benefit plan, you don't waste that money. You don't give too much away in some years.''
 The church has decided to keep its defined-contribution plan going, so that pastors can still have a chance at the big payouts the retirees got in 1999. But that plan will be scaled back so that it provides only about a quarter of a pastor's total benefit in a typical year.
 Instead, pensions will become the foundation of future retirement. The new plan will follow a conventional pension formula that pegs pastors' benefits to their final pay. Pastors who work 40 years, for example, should receive a pension of half their final pay.
 After the trustees agreed to propose a traditional pension plan, Woody Bedell, an official of the pension board, spent about a year and a half traveling to the denomination's 63 regional conferences, which are the basic unit of governance, and explaining it to local officials and lay people.
 ''There was certainly negativity,'' Mr. Bedell recalled. ''All they thought about was: 'This is another unfunded liability. You're putting a greater financial strain on the conferences. Nobody else in the United States is doing this.''' 
 He said he told skeptics that the only way to offer long-term financial security to pastors was to create a pension plan. ''Otherwise you're putting all the risk on the participant,'' he said. ''They've got everything to gain, but they're also at the risk of losing.'' 
 When the matter came to the plenary floor of the quadrennial meeting this month, it was passed by a 75 percent vote, Mr. Bedell said.

HEADLINE: 50 Condos Are Planned for Asbury Park

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Betting on signs that the long-hoped-for renewal of Asbury Park, N.J., is starting to catch on, a developer plans to turn an empty office building into 25 condominiums and build an adjacent building with 25 more residences on a block sandwiched between this faded resort city's recovering downtown and its oceanfront.
 Work will start in two weeks on the $7 million-plus conversion of the six-story 1920's building at 501 Grand Avenue, once the headquarters of Jersey Central Power and Light. Renamed Asbury Grand, it will be reshaped into 900- to 1,500-square-foot apartments, some with ocean views. There will also be 5,500 square feet of ground-level commercial space as part of the conversion, which is being designed by WORK, a Manhattan architectural firm, and is to be completed by the first quarter of 2005. 
 Construction of the new building will not start until most or all of the residences in the conversion are sold, said Harvey Schultz, a principal of Asbury Grand Partners, the developer. Other principals include Frank Mandia and the Murnick family, who had owned the land as well as the limestone-colored brick building.
 Mr. Schultz, who grew up near Asbury Park, said the amount of development taking place now persuaded the partners to invest in the city. ''It has started to come back,'' said Mr. Schultz, who also is a principal of the Schultz Organization/TCN Worldwide, a commercial real estate services company in Woodbridge, N.J.
 In the more than 30 years since race riots drove out much of Asbury Park's middle class, there have been a few unsuccessful plans for its rebound. But in the last 18 months, the 12-block central business district, which had become a virtual ghost town, has slowly revived.
 Thomas Gilmour, the city's director of economic development, said that in that time 38 businesses had opened in formerly boarded-up downtown buildings, while the upper floors were being turned into housing, mainly condos. He added that 244 residences had been completed or were under way or about to begin, with most of the rest of the downtown buildings spoken for.
 One of the larger developments is the conversion to 61 rental apartments of the vacant Steinbach department store, formerly the Commercial Hotel, on Cookman Avenue. The transformation of the five-story, 19th-century building, which is listed on both the State and National Registers of Historic Places, is to begin next month, said Carter S. Sackman, a principal of Emory Realty of Manhattan, the developer. An average 1,000-square-foot apartment will rent for $1,300 to $1,500 a month, he said.
 There also are signs of success from the current $1 billion mixed-use redevelopment plan for the oceanfront and several nearby blocks. One is that Asbury Partners, the city-designated master redeveloper of the 56-acre redevelopment area, will complete the restoration of the nearly milelong boardwalk by July. 
 Also, work is to start late this summer on the first 146 town houses and condos of the 3,000 residences planned for the redevelopment area. They are expected to sell at prices starting from mid-$300,000's for the condos and in the $400,000 range for the town houses, according to the developer, the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, N.J. Those residences will rise on two blocks between Cookman and Lake Avenues along Wesley Lake at the southern end of the redevelopment area. Kushner will ultimately build 750 residences.
 At the northern end of the redevelopment area, Paramount Homes of Jackson Township, N.J., will start construction in November on 153 waterfront condos. Prices are expected to range from $400,000 to $800,000.
 Mr. Schultz, the developer of the Asbury Grand, said the location of the Grand Avenue building and lot was a key to his decision to proceed. The properties are near the ocean and downtown, and two blocks from the New Jersey Transit train station. 
 Mark Brown, a sales associate at the residential brokerage firm Gloria Nilson/GMAC who is marketing the conversion, said that last year 64 condos were sold downtown for $100,000 to $375,000, up from the 29 apartments that sold the previous year for $104,000 to $215,000.
 Prices at the Asbury Grand have not yet been finally set, he said, but an average 1,100-square-foot apartment is expected to sell for $330,000. Sales are to start by July.

Broadway

* ''ASSASSINS.'' This is what they always wanted, isn't it? A clear shot at the big time, where people would have to pay attention to them? More than a decade after they first surfaced to critical shudders and head-scratching, the unhappy have-nots of ''Assassins'' -- the glitteringly dark musical by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman about Americans who dream of killing their country's presidents -- have finally made it to Broadway. So can these desperate people, whose greatest fear is of being thought small, actually expand in proportion to the lavish production they have been given? Oh boy, can they ever. Accompanied by a sumptuously full orchestra and portrayed by a cast that finds the magnetism in rage and resentment, the frightening title characters of ''Assassins'' are restating their demand to be noticed in this Roundabout Theater Company production. And under Joe Mantello's direction, they are doing so with an eloquence and an intensity that make a compelling case for a show once regarded as a mere curiosity as a major piece from a major composer (1:50). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25 (Ben Brantley).

''BOMBAY DREAMS.'' Colors don't come any juicier than those that saturate this $14 million musical about movie-love Bollywood-style. Scarcely a scene goes by that isn't splashed with gorgeous heaping helpings of oranges, golds, greens, purples, yellows and more shades of pink than even Estee Lauder had names for. Yet such is the perverse spell cast by this friendly, flat and finally unengaging tale of glamorous movie stars and lovable untouchables that everything seems to melt into one neutral blur before your eyes, like a monochromatic symphony in the key of beige. A R Rahman's score has a certain rhythmic infectiousness. And as a self-centered Bollywood screen siren, the deliciously superficial Ayesha Dharker helps turn the central production numbers into lively paeans to Bollywood kitsch (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $42.25 to $101.25 (Brantley).

+ ''CAROLINE, OR CHANGE.'' A carefully wrought, impeccably performed chamber opera from Tony Kushner (''Angels in America'') and Jeanine Tesori (''Thoroughly Modern Millie''), directed by George C. Wolfe. In temperament this sung-through show is much like its stoical, uncompromising title character (Tonya Pinkins), a black maid for a Southern Jewish family in 1963. A current of self-denial runs through ''Caroline,'' from a libretto that refuses to sentimentalize its heroine to its deliberately fragmented score that avoids anthems of uplift. The tone throughout is evenhanded, slightly distanced compassion as people of different classes are revealed as pawns of a corrupting economic structure. Ms. Pinkins, who has never been better, gives an intense, controlled and commanding performance. In ambition and achievement, ''Caroline'' handily tops this season's new musicals. But it is almost too good to be good (2:35). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $101 (Brantley).

*+ ''FROZEN.'' For a play centered on a serial murderer of little girls, Bryony Lavery's humane, intelligent drama is striking for its sustained aura of ordinariness. ''Frozen'' is indeed the story of the brutal killing of a child and its repercussions. Yet no trace of sensationalism colors Doug Hughes's beautifully acted, carefully considered production, which stars Swoosie Kurtz (as the child's mother), Brian F. O'Byrne (as the murderer) and Laila Robins (as an academic specializing in serial killers). No sinister, spine-tingling music or screams of terror and pain are heard. Instead, a contemplative quiet enfolds the stage. And the characters, who often speak in monologues, don't so much vent their intense emotions as betray them through involuntary eruptions that they quickly stifle. In the age of the Amber Alert and Megan's Law, ''Frozen'' brings a coolly discursive attitude to a hot-button subject. This is not to say it is in any way unfeeling (2:15). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $85 (Brantley).

*+ ''JUMPERS.'' Acrobatics aren't just for athletes in this high-flying revival of Tom Stoppard's 1972 play. Though the show features an enthusiastic team of bouncing gymnasts, everyone in ''Jumpers'' jumps, in one way or another -- verbally, emotionally, morally. And with a cast headed by Simon Russell Beale, in a dazzling Broadway debut, such exertions turn this comic mystery of murder, marriage and metaphysics into one of the most entertaining exercise sessions available. Leaps of faith, back-flipping politics, somersaulting, self-inverting words and free-falling nervous breakdowns are all on offer in the restless, relativistic world of ''Jumpers.'' The director David Leveaux appropriately serves up a show that never seems to stop spinning, from its chic revolving set to the frantic, farcical movements of its characters. But at the same time, this luscious import from the Royal National Theater in London, which also stars the divine Essie Davis, finds a wounded, hungry heart beneath the razzle-dazzle (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tickets: $60 to $95 (Brantley).

Off Broadway

''GUINEA PIG SOLO.'' The mesmerizing John Ortiz scales new heights of calisthenic despair in Brett C. Leonard's portrait of a harrowed veteran of the war in Iraq, trying to stay sane in New York City. As a lost man with a short fuse, Mr. Ortiz leaps and bounds like an anguished Douglas Fairbanks. The play is a latter-day reworking of ''Woyzeck,'' Georg Buchner's great fragmented drama from the 1830's. But people in Mr. Leonard's world talk a lot more than than Buchner's characters do. This is not an asset. No matter how frenetically delivered, the dialogue and especially the monologues feel cumbersomely overstated, like messages carved in stone. On the other hand, Ian Belton's staging and Mr. Ortiz's performance are both precise and exhaustingly energetic, with some resonant repeated images. A production of the LAByrinth Theater Company, which specializes in lives of desperation that are anything but quiet (2:10). Public Theater/Shiva Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Brantley).

''HOMEBODY/KABUL.'' Though Linda Emond is onstage for less than a quarter of a nearly four-hour play, she dominates this revised and enriched production of Tony Kushner's ambitious, jagged work from 2001. And it may always be the curse and blessing of ''Homebody/Kabul'' that it begins with her character's solitary, elliptical reflections on the distant city of Kabul, Afghanistan, from her cozy, cloistered home in London. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Emond have made the Homebody one of the richest, most rewarding characters in American theater. But if it's still true that nothing else in ''Homebody/Kabul'' comes close to matching that monologue, the gap has been narrowed with this production, directed by Frank Galati. Much of this has to do with the radiant Maggie Gyllenhaal as Priscilla, the Homebody's daughter, who spends most of the play searching in the city of Kabul for her ever-elusive mother. If the play remains severely imbalanced, it has also acquired a more fluid humanity (3:50). Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, (718) 636-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 1 and 7:30; Sundays at 1 p.m. Tickets: :$25 to $65 (Brantley).

*+ ''THE NORMAL HEART.'' This absorbing revival allows you to register some of the gale force with which Larry Kramer's play hit New York in 1985. In portraying the early impact of AIDS, Mr. Kramer lashed out at the institutions and individuals of power he felt had looked away from a crisis-in-the-making, including The New York Times and Mayor Edward I. Koch. Dramas that run high fevers of social outrage tend to cool off over time, of course. But there is nothing quaint about this production, directed by David Esbjornson and starring Raul Esparza as Ned Weeks, the truth-telling gay writer who is Mr. Kramer's alter ego. At its best, this production has the fraught urgency of a dispatch from a war zone. And it illuminates a poignant, quieter pattern of a longing to connect in a world that keeps building new walls among people (2:45). Public Theater/Anspacher Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).

* ''WHERE DO WE LIVE'' What makes disparate lives converge briefly, then go their separate ways again? Why do people cross the usual borders of race, age or sex? This is Christopher Shinn's main theme. In ''Where Do We Live'' these people are lovers, neighbors, friends, rivals and business partners. And the play unfolds just before Sept. 11, 2001. Stephen (Luke MacFarlane), a writer, is in love with Tyler (Jacob Pitts), a sleek young actor. Stephen is serious about his liberal politics; Tyler's trust fund frees him to take acting classes and go to auditions. Stephen's neighbor Timothy (Daryl Edwards) is a middle-aged black man with one leg who started borrowing cigarettes and now borrows small sums of money. And Timothy lives with Shedrick, who deals drugs. Suspicion flourishes in both households, as does resentment. Mr. Shinn is a skilled craftsman. Yet the craft shows so much that it dulls the emotions. What I like best about ''Where Do We Live'' is its ambition (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Margo Jefferson).

Last Chance

+ ''ENGAGED.'' Everything looks decorous and refined in the Victorian world of ''Engaged.'' This being a play by W. S. Gilbert, the decorous and the refined provide a light cover for strategic lunacy. Everything looks delightful in the Theater for a New Audience production, directed by Doug Hughes; the problems lie almost everywhere else. The outcome is a heavy tramp through a play that needs to be an airy romp. Gilbert satirizes the gap between emotional proprieties and financial greed, and he parodies the English fad for the rustic. Marriages and engagements are made and unmade at top speed, and there are moments of antic madness. To be staged effectively, ''Engaged'' should be cut. Most important, it must be directed with musical lightness and speed (2:05). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8 ; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60 (Jefferson).

+ ''MATCH.'' Playing an aging choreographer named Tobi in Stephen Belber's slender and soggy new comedy, Frank Langella is a convincingly contradictory mix of small-town American folksiness and aesthetic worldliness. He makes you feel, as only a fine actor can, that his character is both deeply familiar and original, and you're ready to follow him wherever he wants to take you. Wherever, in this case, turns out to be a narrow cul-de-sac. It's a tribute to Mr. Langella's skills that you keep praying that Mr. Belber's schematic, soft-centered script will take some radical and surprising turn. As it is, this story of a solitary man forced to exhume a long-buried secret is an itchy tease of a play. Directed with a light hand by Nicholas Martin, ''Match'' also features Ray Liotta and the appealing Jane Adams (2:10). Plymouth Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $81.25 (Brantley).

HEADLINE: In Indonesia, Unions Hit a Roadblock: Contract Labor

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 20 

 BODY:
Only six years after being allowed to flourish following the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia's fledgling labor movement is backfiring on workers like Luluk Setyowati.
 Last year, Ms. Luluk helped organize a union at CV Lengtat Tangerang Leather, a factory outside Jakarta that makes pieces for exported gloves and shoes. Then in November, she organized a protest against what union members say were broken promises by the company to increase employee benefits.
 The company responded by locking out Ms. Luluk and her fellow demonstrators, replacing them with temporary contract workers. It has not paid them, and, to avoid paying a severance, it has not fired them. 
 ''When we asked them if they needed us any more, they just said 'No,''' said Ms. Luluk, who has resorted to selling fried bananas in the local market.
 Unions, suppressed by then President Suharto of Indonesia for more than 30 years, made a resounding comeback after the International Monetary Fund required the country to adopt Western-style labor rights in 1998 as part of its $14.1 billion economic rescue package. But competition from China and other countries that ban independent trade unions has since undercut efforts to raise labor standards. 
 Frustrated by the proliferation of unions and confusing laws on employment, more and more Indonesian companies are replacing employees with contract laborers who cannot bargain, or are moving their jobs to nonunion countries.
 A push for ''labor flexibility'' is taking place around developing Asia, labor experts say, with manufacturers pressuring governments to make it less expensive to hire and fire.
 ''The cost of termination is too high,'' forcing the move toward contract workers, said Djimanto, secretary general of the Employers' Association of Indonesia, who uses only one name.
 To union leaders, though, ''labor flexibility'' is just a euphemism for reducing benefits. ''Every country is now competing to reduce worker rights,'' said Rustam Aksam, president of the Indonesian Trade Unions Congress. ''We're racing to the bottom.''
 And, said Rajasegaran Govindasamy, secretary general of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress in Kuala Lumpur, ''China is being used as an excuse.''
 Some economists say that the falling price of Asian labor is perpetuating the chronic trade imbalance between the United States and Asia that they say imperils the global economy. 
 Since most Asians cannot afford to buy the goods they make, their economies rely on exporting those goods, mainly to the United States. Pushing Asian wages higher, they argue, would help turn the world's sweatshop into a powerful consumer market that would help redress the imbalance.
 ''What we need is for the United States to say, 'We're not going to buy your products unless you can verify you pay a minimum wage,''' said Richard Duncan, a former consultant to the I.M.F., who is now a financial analyst based in Hong Kong. ''You've got to increase the wages of these people so they can buy what they're making.''
 Other economists disagree, arguing that in a global market for investment, jobs go to the most productive work force. Besides, they say, cheap Chinese labor and union activism rank well below corruption and political instability among the things driving Indonesian jobs and foreign investment to countries like China, India and Vietnam. Foreign investors have pulled at least $12.4 billion out of Indonesia since 1998.
 President Suharto's repression of unions was part of a strategy to promote exports by luring foreign investors with cheap labor. After a bloody purge of Communists and leftist labor leaders in 1965, he allowed only one union, whose leaders his government appointed directly.
 But after 1998, the union movement burgeoned. Indonesia now has at least 70 national trade unions and as many as 10,000 factory unions. Employers were often confronted by several unions at once, all demanding to bargain on behalf of workers. ''Companies wouldn't know who to deal with,'' said Carmelo C. Noriel, chief technical adviser at the International Labor Organization's office in Jakarta.
 The unions have helped improve conditions and push minimum wages higher in a country where most people earn less than $2 a day. In Jakarta, wages have risen 60 percent in three years, to 671,550 rupiah (about $75) a month. And higher wages are helping to stimulate consumer spending, an important factor in Indonesia's 4.8 percent economic growth rate.
 But the unions have also emerged as an obstacle to the corporate restructuring the I.M.F. demanded. In 2001, for instance, workers at Semen Gresik, a cement company, helped scuttle government attempts to sell the company to Cemex of Mexico. The following year, unions blocked attempts to sell Bank Central Asia to Standard Chartered, fearing that the British bank would cut jobs. 
 ''The main problem was lack of consultation,'' said Saepul Tavip, secretary general of the Association of Indonesian Trade Unions, which organized protests at the bank. ''The government never talked to the union.''
 Executives and some union leaders also say that unscrupulous labor activists use the threat of demonstrations and strikes to blackmail companies. ''Corruption is a big problem in labor unions,'' said Nella Fernandez, personnel manager at the Indonesian coal mining company Multi Harapan Utama.
 Government officials say strikes and demonstrations are scaring off foreign investors. When Sony decided to close a home audio factory last year in Indonesia, the country's trade minister blamed a series of labor disputes there. Sony, however, said a global restructuring of production, not union problems, were behind the decision. And unions say that the number of strikes has decreased.
 Still, economists say higher wages are costing Indonesia jobs. The World Bank estimates that formal-sector wages in Jakarta now surpass those in Shanghai, Beijing or Hanoi. Every 10 percent gain in minimum wages has been accompanied by a six-tenths of a percent drop in formal employment, the bank estimates, pushing more workers into the sector of the economy operating outside a regulatory framework.
 And wage increases in Indonesia, economists say, are not being matched by gains in productivity. According to World Bank statistics, the value added per worker in Indonesia is about two-thirds that in China and about half that in India.
 What Indonesians need is better education, some economists say. ''Without skilled labor, productivity cannot be improved,'' said Anton Gunawan, head of economic analysis at Citibank in Jakarta.
 But the biggest disputes between unions and employers are not over the minimum wage, but rather over how much workers should be paid when they are laid off. With no national unemployment insurance, Indonesian workers rely on their severance pay when they lose their jobs. Depending on how long they have been employed, they are entitled to up to two-and-a-half years of severance.
 Employers circumvent the severance obligation by hiring workers on short-term contracts or from labor agencies.
 Some textile factories are putting entire factory floors under outside contracts, union leaders say. By law, companies cannot outsource jobs that are core to their business or keep a worker on outside contract for more than three years. But labor exports say violations and loopholes abound.
 Oil companies, for example, use subcontracted workers for all but the most sophisticated jobs, with some contract laborers kept on for up to 25 years. One union is suing ChevronTexaco's local subsidiary for failing to give its security guards permanent employment, saying they are core to the company's operations. ChevronTexaco declined comment.
 CV Lengtat started using contracted labor in 2000, Ms. Luluk said. Last September, the company agreed to give contract workers with three years' experience full-time employment. When the company reneged on that and other promises, she said, she organized the demonstration.
 CV Lengtat did not respond to requests for comment.
 A local labor court has ordered the union and the company to negotiate a settlement, but CV Lengtat has refused, saying the workers resigned.
 Ms. Luluk no longer expects to get her job back. But she does hope the company will eventually come up with some cash, ''enough money to set up our own companies,'' she said, ''because we were really hurt.''

HEADLINE: A Natural Gas Option

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your May 14 Business Day article ''Fears Drain Support for Natural Gas Terminals'' crystallized the challenges facing those who try to meet the United States' growing energy needs. Just because an energy project is unfamiliar -- whether it is construction of a wind farm or a terminal to receive liquefied natural gas -- does not mean it isn't vital.
 Almost all of the natural gas used in Japan -- one of the world's most sophisticated economies -- arrives there in a condensed liquefied form. During the last 40 years, liquefied natural gas ships have covered 60 million miles with no major incidents. 
 Liquefied natural gas represents a small but growing part of the United States' natural gas supply and one of the best midterm options for bringing prices down for the 66 million homes, schools, businesses, electric power plants and other customers that rely on clean, efficient natural gas.

HEADLINE: 'Yuva'

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:

Directed by Mani Ratnam
In Hindi, with English subtitles
Not rated, 160 minutes
 Mani Ratnam's ''Yuva,'' a Bollywood feature that opens today nationwide, has a sharp political edge that is rare in Hindi-language films, celebrated as they are for their wildly exuberant production numbers and sugary love stories. 
 These elements are certainly present in ''Yuva,'' which features a bouncy score by India's leading pop composer, A R Rahman (whose music is also the basis of the current Broadway musical ''Bombay Dreams''), and no fewer than three star-crossed couples. Their romantic ups-and-downs are patiently chronicled over the course of the film's 160 minutes. 
 But Mr. Ratnam, a prolific filmmaker who usually works in the Tamil-language cinema of southern India rather than the Hindi cinema centered in Mumbai (the former Bombay), uses the Bollywood conventions to get at a social reality. The title translates as ''Youth,'' and Mr. Ratnam means to provide a generational portrait through his three male protagonists, each drawn from a different stratum of Indian society in contemporary Calcutta. 
 The middle-class Michael (Ajay Devgan) is a brilliant student who turns down an opportunity to study in America to lead a local revolt against a corrupt establishment politician played by Om Puri, in a role refreshingly removed from the cuddly patriarchs he has played in English-language films like ''East Is East.'' The upper-class Arjun (Vivek Oberoi) is a charming wastrel looking forward to emigrating to America, whose life is transformed when he falls under Michael's reformist spell.
 The most interesting character is Lallan (played, in a simmering, charismatic performance, by Abhishek Bachchan), a street thug who becomes an enforcer for the party in power. Left out of India's economic miracle, he is an unpredictable, violent man who believes in self-preservation above all, in stark and pointed contrast to his coddled counterparts. 
 Mr. Ratnam is a dynamic, natural filmmaker who happily uses every device at his disposal, from rapid-fire MTV editing to sped-up action scenes that recall silent serials, to keep his lengthy film moving at a brisk pace. The film flags only when Mr. Ratnam must turn his attention to the soggy romantic subplots, in which each of the men must deal with the demands for domesticity made by their adoring but subtly domineering female companions.

HEADLINE: How Fears of Rising U.S. Interest Rates Sent World Markets Reeling

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
COULD stock markets in Brazil and China, not to mention the junk bond market in the United States and the price of gold, really be suffering because the Federal Reserve is sending out hints that it will raise short-term interest rates?
 The answer is yes. Only now is it becoming clear just how much of the market froth of 2003 was based on what is known as the carry trade, in which people borrowed dollars cheaply and invested them in all manner of markets.
 That process accelerated as 2004 began. ''We had a cluster of financed trades around the turn of the year, all funded by cheap U.S. credit with a falling dollar,'' said David Bowers, the London-based chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. But as it became clear that rates would rise, and as the dollar recovered some of its losses, ''Now we have the prospect of people being forced to liquidate.'' 
 The first really good jobs report in the United States came out on April 2 -- pointing to a robust economy that would finally force the Fed to move toward tightening monetary policy -- and within days markets around the world were heading down. From April 6 through their lows this week, markets in Brazil, Argentina, India and Turkey all lost at least 20 percent of their value. 
 That sounds like an emerging market story, but it goes further. Gold, which is supposed to be a haven in times of economic uncertainty, and copper, a traditional measure of worldwide economic strength, have also shown significant losses. Developed markets also suffered, although not as much.
 There are always local explanations available for any market move, and some of them are reasonable. India's election results came as a shock, and the news in Iraq has been alarming. But the magnitude of the falls reflects just how much demand had been increased by the flood of leveraged buyers.
 There was a time when regulators worried about the impact of leverage on both markets and speculators. But they long ago gave up that fight. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, argued during the bubble that changing the rules to limit margin loans on share purchases would affect only small traders, since others could get leverage with derivatives.
 Remember when, after the Long-Term Capital fiasco, the investment banks said they would be more cautious in lending to hedge funds? A new survey by Greenwich Associates, a pension consultant, finds that brokers have loosened the purse strings. They are making bigger loans and imposing less stringent terms.
 The hedge funds have not just found it possible to increase their leverage. There has also been what Greenwich calls ''a flood of pension capital'' going into hedge funds. Now some of what that money bought has been sold, alarming a lot of other investors.
 Every month, Merrill Lynch surveys global money managers about whether they are taking on more or less risk than they normally do. Back in January, they claimed to love risk. Now they say they are avoiding it.
 That survey also showed that managers had raised their cash positions rapidly as prices fell. The proportion with more cash than usual rose to its highest level since March 2003, just as many markets were hitting bottom.
 Some of that cash no doubt was put to work this week, as suddenly rising prices made heavy cash positions look foolish, at least for a few days.
 A market recovery will be encouraging to Mr. Greenspan, who hopes to avoid a repeat of the turmoil in 1994, when the Fed surprised traders by raising rates. But the decline itself serves as a warning that there is no way to know just how much speculation was brought on by super-low interest rates. Nor is there any way to be sure how much of that leverage has now been unwound.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

''ARCADIA AND METROPOLIS: MASTERWORKS OF GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM FROM THE NATIONALGALERIE BERLIN,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through June 7. In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Nationalgalerie Berlin has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* ''THE ART DECO BOOKBINDINGS OF PIERRE LEGRAIN AND ROSE ADLER,'' New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through June 12. The achievement of two French bookbinders is showcased in this sumptuous exhibition of 45 hand-bound rare editions and manuscripts of major French writers from Stendhal to Breton, commissioned by the couturier, collector and philanthropist Jacques Doucet. Only a few have been exhibited before. Their extraordinary exteriors are usually treated as a single flat surface and decorated with bold geometric designs, accented with crocodile, lizard, snakeskin, metal and gemstone. Legrain and Adler are credited with modernizing bookbinding and the show leaves little doubt that they did. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 4. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

* ''AN ENDURING VISION: 17th- TO 20TH-CENTURY JAPANESE PAINTING FROM THE GITTER-YELEN COLLECTION,'' Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, through June 20. Six schools of Japanese art that flourished during the Edo period (1615-1868) and on into the 20th century -- Nanga, Zenga, Rinpa, Maruyama-Shijo, Ukiyo-e and the Eccentrics -- are celebrated with about 75 examples from an outstanding private collection. With screens, hanging scrolls, albums and fans depicting flora and fauna, the forces of nature, abstract mountainscapes, genre scenes and calligraphy, done by some of the era's best artists, the show provides a rich acquaintance with four centuries of Japanese art. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 65+, $3 (Glueck).

* ''FASHIONING FICTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY SINCE 1990,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Road and Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9600, through June 28. With its first exhibition of fashion photography, the Modern dips a toe into a very large body of water, and dithers. The works by 13 artists and fashion photographers, including Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Phillip-Lorca diCorcia and Cedric Buchet, focuses on the recent uses of narrative in both magazine features and advertising. How recent this development is could be debated, but mainly the Modern seems determined to make everything look like appropriation art. This seems unnecessary in a museum known for showing all kinds of everyday design objects. The show sticks too closely to the mainstream fashion press, which keeps it too superficial, too polite and in some ways misleading. Largely missing are the field's raunchy underbelly and cheap thrills: the intimations of heroin chic, grunge, homoeroticism and teenage sex that can make perusing a fashion magazine feel like a vaguely subversive act. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Smith).

* ''GUSTAV KLUTSIS AND VALENTINA KULAGINA: PHOTOGRAPHY AND MONTAGE AFTER CONSTRUCTIVISM'' AND ''WAR IN IRAQ: THE COORDINATES OF CONFLICT, PHOTOGRAPHS BY VII,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through May 30. Provocatively buttressed by two smaller shows, these imposing exhibitions dovetail into a chillingly informative examination of the roles of photography in art, history and science. The political, the personal and the formal alternate energetically in the first exhibition in this country devoted to Klutsis and Kulagina, who were married, and is primarily the tale of an artist whose striking photomontage posters helped establish the graphic look of the young Soviet Union, until Stalin had him assassinated. ''War in Iraq'' makes manifest the kinds of events that swirled around but rarely registered within the work of Klutsis or Kulagina. Starting with the ruins at ground zero, 53 images by nine intrepid photojournalists associated with the agency VII record the havoc that war, violence, dictatorial regimes and fanatical faith have wrought in our own time. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Smith).

''THE 179TH ANNUAL,'' National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through June 20. This year's nonmember invitational version of its annual exhibition continues a praiseworthy trend toward greater openness to the new. It includes known nonconservatives like Tara Donovan, Polly Apfelbaum, Barnaby Furnas, Jessica Stockholder, Mel Kendrick, Ida Applebroog, Whitfield Lovell and Joel Shapiro. Also notable are Pier Consagra's zany, faux-Rococo ink drawing of a sleeping bumpkin; Laurie Fendrich's glossy, richly colored update of Constructivist painting; Robert Taplin's double sculptural portrait of a seated woman -- clothed and unclothed -- finely made of painted concrete; and Barbara Takenaga's cosmic abstract painting made from countless little dots. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $5 (Ken Johnson).

''THE PIERRE AND MARIA-GAETANA MATISSE COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710), through June 26, 2005 in three installments. This heterogeneous array of paintings, sculptures and works on paper was once owned by the Manhattan-based art dealer Pierre Matisse (1900-1989) and his wife, Maria-Gaetana (1943-2001). Most of the material came to the Met after Mrs. Matisse's death. It includes sexy paintings by Balthus, Magritte and Wifredo Lam, batty ones by Jean Dubuffet, and a feminist icon in a self-portrait by Leonora Carrington. A selection of the rich, calm, pleasurable art of Henri Matisse, Pierre's father, takes pride of place. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).

* ''WHERE GODS AND MORTALS MEET: CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN URHOBO ART,'' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Aug. 16. This engrossing show documents aspects of a so-called traditional African art as it existed in the recent past, and as it survives in a 21st-century world. Africa in this case means a society called the Urhobo of the Niger Delta, and the art ranges from spectacular larger than life-size figures of ancestor spirits to carvings of grotesque beasts with gaping, saber-toothed mouths, images meant to both encourage and control male aggression. Although some sculptures are now rarely produced in their original forms, they are in the paintings and prints of Bruce Onobrakpeya, a contemporary Delta-born artist of international stature, in whose art Urhobo traditions live on. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter)

* WHITNEY BIENNIAL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through May 30. Easily the best biennial in a long time. The spirit is upbeat and ingratiating -- almost polite -- on the surface at least, with a utopian streak and a youth-heavy emphasis on gloss and craft. There's plenty of painting and drawing, ratifying the much-hyped trend, and multigenerational work, stressing ecstatic engagement and meticulousness. But the real story is the stress on the handmade in general, on materiality in whatever medium -- a change from the politics-heavy, slacker installations of recent years. The cross-generational dialogue is an interesting subtext. Among the younger set utopia does not mean 1960's-style radicalism; it implies something unattainable, except perhaps in a hand-me-down form, and therefore smaller and inherently poignant. Look for a few standout works from artists both younger and older, including Yayoi Kusama, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Julie Mehretu, Jim Hodges, Eve Sussman, Raymond Pettibon, Slater Bradley, Robert Mangold and Stan Brakhage, who died last year. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Kimmelman).

* ''FRED WILSON, OBJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS: 1979-2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through July 4. Mr. Wilson, who represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale, made his reputation with conceptually pointed, technically polished and visually engaging installations and objects that focused on excavating American racial history and illustrating the exclusionary power of cultural institutions shaped by social, economic and ideological domination. Elements of his subversive museum projects appear in this traveling show, along with sculptures and a fine, short new film. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, $1 (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

* ''GARDEN IN DELFT: WILLEM DE KOONING LANDSCAPES 1928-1988,'' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through June 26. For the centennial of Willem de Kooning's birth, this exhibition of 14 canvases represents a jubilant skip through his long career, with emphasis on his relationship to landscape. Never mind that the suggestion of abstracted still lifes sometimes seems equally strong, especially in two unfamiliar canvases from the late 1930's. A third painting, titled ''Still Life'' and dated circa 1929, may well be the earliest de Kooning painting most of us have ever seen. Its crisp shapes and deep primary colors suggest the influence of Joseph Stella and look forward to David Hockney. A second de Kooning tribute, at the Richard Gray Gallery upstairs through May 29, features four paintings from the 1940's and 50's that lean toward, or land in, the realm of figuration (Smith).

* JEFF KOONS, ''Highlights of 25 Years,'' C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 5. This excellent 27-piece survey touches on all phases of Mr. Koons's career, including greatest hits like the basketballs mysteriously hovering in aquarium tanks; the Mylar ''Rabbit'' balloon cast in shiny stainless steel; and the sexy blonde embracing the Pink Panther in glazed ceramic. The climax of the show is the 10-foot-tall ''Balloon Dog.'' Made of stainless steel and coated in coppery translucent orange, it is a breathtaking symbol of the inflationary euphoria and anxiety of our times (Johnson).

MARKUS LUPERTZ, ''About the Three Graces,'' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through May 28. Mr. Lupertz, usually mentioned along with Georg Baselitz, Sigmar Polke and Anselm Kiefer as a German Neo-Expressionist star of the 1980's, here presents four massive heads cast in bronze. Tinted in primary colors, these boulderlike representations of the Three Graces, Hera, Venus and Athene, plus one of Paris, look as if they were gouged out of the earth and pummeled into shape by an impatient giant (Johnson)

FRANK STELLA, ''Exotic Birds,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through June 5. Looking at Mr. Stella's three big, splashily painted reliefs from a 1976 series, it is easy to forget how shockingly flamboyant they seemed in their day. Now, with their curvy, tilting forms cut from honeycomb-core aluminum panels, and neatly puzzled together within wide slanting frames, they seem prettily demure compared to what has happened since in painting as well as in sculpture (Johnson).

''WEEGEE'S STORY,'' Ubu, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 23. Wielding his 4x5 Speed Graphic with a master's touch, the New York tabloid photographer Weegee probably shot more murders and fires during his heyday, the 1930's and 40's, than anyone in the business. But his passion for the city also drew him to its many other photo opportunities: the strivers and the homeless, festivities and freaks, politicians and celebrities, posh avenues and mean streets. This show of 220 Weegee vintage photographs, culled from a collection assembled over a 30-year period by the Berlin dealer Hendrik Berinson, reveals his remarkable range (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

* DAISY YOUNGBLOOD, McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 688-5951, through May 29. Ms. Youngblood, who is in her late 50's and lives in Costa Rica, won a MacArthur award last year for her exquisitely sensitive, usually small ceramic sculptures of animals and human spiritual gurus. Here are 18 works dating from 1975 to 2003 in which the interest is mainly in the magical tension between the raw clay and the lifelike, psychologically evocative forms and gestures of animal and human bodies (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

LOUISE BELCOURT, ''Wriggling Philosophical Life,'' Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through May 29. Ms. Belcourt paints lovable, extremely simplified, sharply contoured pictures of what look like sunlit monumentalized sofa cushions under powder blue skies. Actually they are images of garden hedges in a small northern Quebec town where she grew up. With their attractively glossy, brush-textured surfaces they adroitly juggle the influences of Color Field painting, Pop and Surrealism (Johnson).

HANS BENDA, ''Kissing the Ground,'' M. Y. Art Prospects, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 268-7132, through May 29. Women and landscapes get equal time in this German artist's small, meticulously painted oils, and sometimes they share one composition. The young women, mainly Asian and very today, are unabashedly erotic; the landscapes not at all. In one fetching scene an innocent-looking young thing leans casually against the stone balustrade of a serious architectural balcony, wearing a loosely laced black corset and nothing else. Behind her is a North German Renaissance view of a blue sky with wisps of cloud and a stand of green foliage. As a play on Old Master painting it's amusing, but it's the quality of his painting more than his subject matter that makes Mr. Benda's work viable (Glueck).

* WILLEM DE KOONING, ''A Centennial Celebration,'' Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-1111, through June 19. This beautifully installed 40-work survey begins with several previously unexhibited late ''ribbon'' paintings with their wafting, tangling strands of color that intimate both landscapes and still lifes but are, above all, abstract. The presentation seems to argue that de Kooning, like his younger colleague Philip Guston, would still have ample art historical stature had he made no other paintings than these, produced during the decade before he descended into Alzheimer's disease. But the show then backtracks through most of the artist's development, making the counter argument by demonstrating the many divergent and crisscrossing paths he took to reach his final distillation (Smith).

DONALD JUDD, ''Single Stacks 1964-69,'' Van de Weghe, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 929-6633, through May 28. The wall-mounted boxes featured here look like units from Judd's vertical ladderlike works. Different ones are made of shiny copper, stainless steel or galvanized steel; some have plexiglass panels casting colored light on the walls below. The installation is elegant and funereal: the sculptures are like containers for the ashes of Modernism. Or they might be Pandora's boxes, from which the demonic energies of pluralism would soon emerge (Johnson).

* CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN, ''Images a la Carte,'' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through July 2. Made mostly on blue-lined notebook pages the size of index cards, using pencil, ink and watercolor, these wonderfully lively and keenly observed drawings depict shrimp cocktails, crabcakes, salads, sandwiches, a banana split, tarts, cheese cakes and other elaborate restaurant fare, interspersed with simpler items like a lemon slice, an apple core and a piece of cornbread. Mr. Oldenburg drew them; his longtime partner, Ms. van Bruggen, contributed ideas (Johnson).

* WILLIAM SCOTT, Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through June 5. Pots, dishes, fruits, vases and other domestic shapes form the basis for much of this Scottish-born painter's imagery, magically reduced to lyrical, luminous ghosts of themselves. Scott, a figure of some importance in postwar British art, was well known in New York, too. This small but engrossing show progresses from 1954 to 1977, and in his spare, sensual paintings shape, space and color play beautifully together (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

''DOGS + CATS,'' American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530, through June 12. This lively exhibition includes more than 60 feline or canine representations in two or three dimensions. Some are by self-taught artists. A big colorful painting by Jean Metcalf has cats and dogs in it but features a formal parade of rats carrying wounded birds on stretchers. Many are by unknown craftsmen, like the smoothly carved wooden head of a boxer with brown glass eyes and the functional dog-shaped bench in the form of a wooden slab with branches that have been turned into legs (Johnson).

JOHN KESSLER, ''Global Village Idiot,'' Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through June 5. Mr. Kessler's Rube Goldberg-style contraptions incorporating computers, video equipment, photographs, electric lights and motors reflect on terrorism, airplane safety, fashion, pornography and media saturation. Their ingenious workings are absorbing to study, but unlike the beautifully made mechanized sculptures for which he became known in the 1980's and 90's, these have a raw, unfinished look, as if they had been built in the secret basement workshop of an angry and paranoid electrical engineer (Johnson).

LEONARD KOSCIANSKI, OK Harris, 383 West Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 431-3600, through May 29. For two decades Mr. Koscianski has been painting dreamy, slightly cartoonish, Magic Realist pictures of dogs, boars, hawks and other wild animals in violent Darwinian action. This show finds him in top form. It also includes glowing images of butterflies and tropical flowers that radiate a lush erotic heat (Johnson).

MARTIN PARR, ''Think of England,'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166, through May 28. You may have to be English to get very excited about this influential, controversial and popular English photographer of everyday life. He has a satiric novelist's eye for sociologically telling details, but what is most compelling in the large prints here is the shrill color, which imparts a repulsive artificiality to his images of formally garbed people at the races or tackily outfitted people at garden parties (Johnson).

LAMAR PETERSON, ''Milk and Cookies,'' Deitch Projects, 26 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through June 5. The basic ingredients of Mr. Peterson's paintings seem friendly enough: tropical vacation spots, cute pets, quality family time. So does the tasty, candy-colored cartoon-realist style he has couched them in. But something -- maybe everything -- is wrong in this inorganically Disneyesque world, populated exclusively by African-Americans and robots. The racial dimension stands out at first, but the stereotypes he deals with are those of middle-class culture at large, one glutted on fantasies of perfection and excess (Cotter).

HOWARDENA PINDELL, ''Works on Paper 1968-2004,'' Sragow, 73 Spring Street, (212) 219-1793, through June 5. Ms. Pindell belongs to an understudied generation of African-American artists who were working with abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960's and 70's. The earliest drawings in this jewel-like show are composed of sequences of words and numbers arranged in patterns on graph paper, and suggest roots in postminimalism. Later she made collages of small circles, hand-punched from sheets of blank or printed paper. In her recent three-dimensional prints, the dots are suspended in clusters on grids made of threads, and the early words and numbers become the names and coordinates of constellations (Cotter).

GERHARD RICHTER, ''Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo,'' Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through June 26. Here is one of the very few sculptures made by Mr. Richter, the immensely influential German painter, during his career. It consists of two plaster heads cast from life, slathered in gray paint and mounted on pedestals. One head is Mr. Richter's; the other, his fellow German painter Blinky Palermo. Facing each other with closed eyes, in a gallery that is empty but for a small study version in a shadow box on the wall, the faux classical sculptures create an ambience of dry existential ennui (Johnson).

T. L. SOLIEN, ''Hollow,'' Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161, through June 5. If you were around in the early 80's you may remember Mr. Solien's intriguingly quirky paintings from the 1983 Whitney Biennial. His last show in New York was 14 years ago, so it is good to see that he is still making beguiling paintings while living in Wisconsin. Mixing abstraction, appropriated cartoons, and illustrations and images of homey, old-time interiors, the paintings create a haunting narrative blend of the domestic and the hallucinatory (Johnson).

Other Galleries

''CONCRETE REALITIES,'' ''The Art of Carmen Herrera, Fanny Sanin and Mira Schendel,'' Latin Collector, 153 Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-7813, through May 29. This crisp show picks up a thread of geometric abstraction in 20th-century Latin America art, and follows it in the work of three women who have made significant constributions to its history. Ms. Herrera, born in Cuba, is represented by big, bold, wittily shaped forms. Ms. Sanin's paintings of intersecting planes in warm colors suggest architecture and textile designs. Ms. Schendel's work actually looks like woven fabric, the geometry slightly off-kilter, the edges uneven and soft. It offers yet another reason to consider geometric abstraction one the great experimental inventions of modern art (Cotter).

''THE DEVONSHIRE INHERITANCE: FIVE CENTURIES OF COLLECTING AT CHATSWORTH,'' Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through June 20. The stately English country home Chatsworth has been occupied since its construction in 1552 by the Cavendish family, headed by a long succession of dukes and duchesses of Devonshire. They have enriched it with notable collections of fine and decorative arts, an awesome library of books and manuscripts, scientific instruments, silver, furniture and needlework. A glimpse of these treasures is provided by this show, which has works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Durer and Lucian Freud; books and drawings by Andrea Palladio; a spectacular jewelry ensemble worn at the coronation of Czar Alexander II and much else to light up the eyes of the most jaded connoisseur. The next step is a visit to Chatsworth itself, still a private home for the Cavendishes but very much open to the public (Glueck).

''TACTICAL ACTION,'' Gigantic Artspace, 59 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-6762, through June 10. This lively but crowded and unfocused exhibition is designed to promote leftish dissidence. Highlights include scenes of the war in Iraq, drawn on location by Steve Mumford; clever anticorporate lenticular photographs by David Byrne and Danielle Spencer; David Krippendorff's noirish video about the eroticism of hate; Michele Pred's American flag sculpture, made from pen knives confiscated at airports; and a mock prison visitors' booth, with a soundtrack about teenage gang violence, by Dread Scott (Johnson).

Last Chance

MIN KIM, ATM Gallery, 170 Avenue B, near 10th Street, East Village, (212) 375-0349, through Sunday. Ms. Kim's finely made paint-and-ink work amounts to a a kind of child's vision of Eden. A nude, doe-eyed prepubescent girl meets a boy, almost her twin, in a garden dominated by a glitter-producing tree; their story of Paradise Found comes to an ambiguous conclusion in a Chinese-style landscape overhung with tangle of snaking black lines. Ms. Kim's application of cartoon-style sweetness to an adult-style morality tale is common in new art and can easily be arch or sappy. She makes it work by presenting innocence more or less straight: threatened from without, unblemished from within (Cotter).

* ''OCEAN FLOWERS: IMPRESSIONS FROM NATURE,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. Dense with ethereal images and silhouettes of seaweed, this unusual exhibition shows how the needs of Victorian botanists, book publishers and inspired amateurs pushed traditional drawing and printmaking into the realm of photography without so much as touching a lens. The driving force was the need to get the wonders of nature down on paper, one way or another. Those ways run riot here and provide a startlingly revised view of the mongrel hands-on origins of the age of mechanical reproduction (Smith).

HEADLINE: Extra $150 Million Is Found to Pay for Housing for the Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The nation's top housing official told Congress yesterday that the federal government had unearthed an extra $150 million to help housing agencies absorb cuts to the government's main housing program for poor Americans.
 Alphonso Jackson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, told the House Financial Services Committee that the money would be divided among 525 agencies, or about one-fifth of those that participate in what is popularly known as the Section 8 voucher program. But it was not immediately clear from either HUD or some of the agencies that stood to be the most affected, especially in New York City, how the money would be divided and whether the $150 million would cover the projected shortfall. 
 The announcement represents an olive branch on HUD's part in the face of mounting pressure after a regulatory change one month ago that Bush administration officials had said would help to control spiraling housing costs, but critics said would gut Section 8.
 In the past, the federal government paid the full cost of the 1.9 million rent vouchers given to poor tenants nationwide to help them pay for housing. But in the last three years, the Section 8 budget nationwide has surged 27 percent. So on April 22, HUD told housing agencies that, for the current fiscal year, it would pay the cost of a voucher only as of last August, plus an inflation adjustment.
 That calculation, according to housing agencies, threatened to penalize places like New York, where the cost of providing vouchers has climbed faster than inflation. New York officials estimated that the change could lead to a shortfall of at least $55.5 million, and perhaps force them to freeze the number of vouchers, demand more money from tenants or even evict tenants because of inadequate financing.
 Over all, housing agencies stood to lose at least $270 million under the regulatory change, said John Bohm, director of legislative programs for the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
 But in testimony yesterday, Mr. Jackson said HUD would use $150 million that was left over from its 2003 budget. 
 ''These steps should alleviate the funding challenges some public housing authorities were anticipating when HUD recently adopted Congressionally mandated formula changes to Section 8 funding,'' he said. ''We will continue to work hand-in-hand with the public housing authorities to apply the funding cap in the fairest manner possible.''
 Still, initial reaction was cautious, or even dubious, something that was not surprising given the frequent clashes between housing groups and the Bush administration.
 Howard Marder, a spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority, said that while the city did not have any information yet as to whether New York's share would compensate for its shortfall, ''we're pleased the secretary realized that there is a problem.''
 But Barbara Sard, director of housing policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington research group, said the additional funds, while welcome, constituted money that was already due hundreds of agencies that were simply waiting to be reimbursed.
 And Kay Gibbs, the Democratic spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee, suggested that HUD's announcement might have been a matter of too little, too late, since some agencies had either begun to reduce payments to landlords, or in at least one case, to evict tenants.
 ''A number of housing authorities have already taken action that can't be undone,'' Ms. Gibbs said. ''Irreparable harm has been done, and has shaken the confidence of this program.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Offers Little Hope On Fuel Prices

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, May 20 

 BODY:
The president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Thursday that there was little the group could do to lower fuel prices anytime soon, because OPEC's oil production quotas were not the main problem. His remarks contradicted statements last week by Saudi Arabia, the cartel's leading producer, calling for increases in the quotas to ease price pressures. 
 Purnomo Yusgiantoro, who is both the cartel's president and the energy minister of Indonesia, said that the recent sharp rise in retail prices for gasoline and other fuels was ''due to factors beyond OPEC's scope.'' In a meeting with reporters Thursday morning, Mr. Purnomo said that speculation, geopolitics and structural problems in the United States gasoline market were to blame for the run-up in pump prices in America. 
 Even so, he said, representatives of OPEC members will meet informally this weekend at an oil industry conference in Amsterdam to consider Saudi Arabia's proposals for raising production quotas by 1.5 million barrels a day.
 Analysts said such a step would be largely symbolic, since almost all the cartel's members were already exceeding their quotas and pumping as much oil as they could.
 ''The price today is a high price, and we want it to be lower,'' Mr. Purnomo said in an interview Thursday afternoon at the Indonesian Embassy in London. But it would be very difficult for OPEC to overcome high prices by itself, he said, because simply pumping more crude would not address shortages of refinery capacity and other ''downstream'' bottlenecks and problems. 
 Fuel prices are becoming a more significant political issue in the United States, with pressure mounting on the Bush administration to act, by tapping the strategic petroleum reserve or by getting OPEC to produce more oil. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, who was also in London on Thursday, told reporters that he planned to discuss ways of cooling prices with OPEC members at the Amsterdam meeting, but declined to give specifics.
 On Thursday, seven state attorneys general sent a letter to President Bush, asking him to urge Attorney General John Ashcroft to join them in investigating whether oil and gas companies and OPEC are colluding to drive up prices. 
 ''We're asking the federal government to prove that it won't be a prisoner of energy interests in this country or worldwide,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, during a conference call with reporters. 
 Investigations into possible antitrust violations have often been conducted in the past when oil prices rose, but they have generally found little if any evidence of wrongdoing. ''Just because we have not found it does not mean it's not happening,'' said Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general, during the call. 
 The 11 members of OPEC produce about one-third of the world's oil supply. Iraq is a member, but it has not been included in quota agreements since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Policy makers who had hoped that production in Iraq would revive and help bring down world prices have so far been disappointed. Though sanctions on Iraq were lifted after the United States-led invasion in March, persistent sabotage has held down the amount of oil the country has been able to ship.
 At the root of the global problem, Mr. Purnomo said, is global demand for oil that is far outrunning forecasts. ''Everyone got it wrong,'' he said, adding that OPEC was awaiting the results of a study about the effects of oil prices ranging up to $34 a barrel over the long term, rather than the range of $22 to $28 a barrel the cartel had assumed before. The benchmark grade of light, sweet crude for June delivery closed at $40.92 a barrel in New York, down 58 cents from Wednesday's close. 
 Oil experts said Mr. Purnomo's assessment of the causes of high oil prices and OPEC's ability to affect them were a mixture of political posturing and fact. 
 ''He's half right,'' said Fareed Mohamedi, chief economist for PFC Energy, a Washington-based consulting firm. Strong demand for crude oil and gasoline have helped drive prices up, Mr. Mohamedi said, but ''it's also the issue that OPEC and especially Saudi Arabia have not fully opened up the taps.'' 
 Other experts said that only Saudi Arabia still had enough idle production capacity to affect global oil prices and that an increase in quotas for the rest of OPEC was meaningless. Already, the group as a whole is producing about 2 million barrels a day more than its 23.5 million barrel quota; raising the quota would only put a different label on what is already going on, they said.
 ''This is more of a public relations exercise'' than a serious plan to lower prices, said Leo Drollas, deputy director and chief economist at the Center for Energy Studies, a London-based research firm. 
 In response to the criticism, Mr. Purnomo said that the Saudi plan was just a proposal and that the members of the cartel had not approved it. Other ideas may also be considered, he said, without giving details. 
 In addition to an overall shortage of refining capacity in the United States, where refineries are running at more than 95 percent of their maximum, Mr. Purnomo said that variations in auto emissions standards from state to state also drove fuel prices higher. ''You can't easily move excess capacity from state to state,'' he said. 
 The state attorneys general agreed on Thursday that adopting a single national standard could alleviate some supply problems. Analysts said that would also make it less difficult for refineries overseas to supply the American market.
 No matter what OPEC decides to do, there is little or no chance of relief in June, Mr. Purnomo said, because the tankers used to carry crude oil to market are already booked for the month and no more are available. ''I cannot change production in June,'' he said. 
 Mr. Purnomo also met with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, as Britain calls its finance minister. Afterward, Mr. Purnomo described the meeting as an exchange of ideas that did not include pressure on OPEC. But Mr. Brown issued a statement saying that ''it is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the world economy that OPEC act now to achieve a more sustainable oil price.''

HEADLINE: But a Push Is On to Interest Donors in Unsung Spots

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Even during tough economic times, getting private money to keep up the public's most famous parks has never been terribly hard. Groups like the Central Park Conservancy have a long history of bringing in philanthropic dollars, concerts and film programs in places like Bryant Park have thrived, and scores of nonprofit groups have raised money or rolled up their sleeves to plant flowers in the city's more affluent neighborhoods. 
 But over the last two years, the Parks Department has tried to spread that private-sector help across the entire city, particularly to parks that serve poor residents. 
 The Parks Department, with the help of City Hall, has been pushing donors toward some of the city's most needy patches of green, and when donors insist on putting their money toward flagship parks, focusing city dollars toward the less celebrated parks. 
 Last year, for example, the Bloomberg administration joined with the City Parks Foundation to concentrate on 16 parks in Astoria, Long Island City, Harlem, Highbridge and Red Hook for immediate improvements. A plan to offer naming rights to companies willing to give money to support parks has been spreading slowly across the city. 
 In January, the financier Carl C. Icahn donated $10 million to help complete a track and field stadium at Randalls Island Park, the largest gift ever from a donor to a city park outside Central Park. And on the other end of the spectrum, the Target Corporation donated $35,000 to keep the fountains outside City Hall and the city's borough halls decorated with foliage during the winter, in exchange for small signs noting its sponsorship.
 ''The Parks Department was always supportive,'' said David Rivel, the executive director of the City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports neighborhood parks. ''But the thing that is different about this administration is that we were able to have a strategic conversation about focusing efforts in low-income neighborhood parks.''
 The city offered the foundation $20 million in capital money for the 16 small parks, while the foundation brought in $5 million, a partnership Mr. Rivel called ''unprecedented.'' 
 The focus is driven in part by City Hall, where Patricia E. Harris, the deputy mayor for administration, has been directing donors toward the mayor's favorite beneficiaries: ''The mayor's priorities include parks, education and the arts,'' Ms. Harris said, ''and those are great areas to fund-raise for because so many New Yorkers are interested in funding them.'' 
 Ms. Harris has longstanding relationships with philanthropic groups, stemming from her days in the Art Commission under Mayor Edward I. Koch, and her years at Bloomberg L.P. managing its giving program. Often, potential donors call looking for something to do, and Ms. Harris or Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, are ready with suggestions. 
 For instance, when the columnist Liz Smith raised $200,000 from readers during the budget crisis, the city allocated half for the Fund for Public Schools, and half to the Parks Department to train college and high school students to build nature trails and collect ecological data.
 The Parks Department has also tried to get communities to rally around smaller parks and raise money for them. For example, a volunteer committee (which includes Dr. Ruth Westheimer) was recently established to raise $5 million for Fort Tryon Park and the Heather Garden in Washington Heights. 
 ''A lot of people want to do things in Central Park, but there are only a few opportunities,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''So when people are not sure what they are going to do, we send them to projects that otherwise would not have had donors.'' 
 One such example was Randalls Island. Mr. Icahn, who has donated millions of dollars to causes here in his hometown city, was looking for a new project to finance. He was introduced to Mr. Benepe last summer, who presented him with a list of parks projects that included Randalls Island, where the storied but dilapidated Downing Stadium was being replaced. 
 On a chilly spring afternoon, Mr. Benepe took Mr. Icahn to see where seating for 10,000 spectators, a 400-meter running track, and a regulation-size soccer field were under construction. After taking a brief peek, Mr. Icahn took his cellphone and repaired to a giant I-beam for 45 minutes, where he closed a business deal. 
 Mr. Benepe was in a slight panic, wondering if Mr. Icahn was going to fall in love. He did, and now Mr. Icahn, whose gift completed the roof and light towers on the project, will see his name towering over the stadium, visible from the F.D.R. Drive. 
 The Randalls Island project, which has been developing for several years, is expected to provide world-class track and field facilities for local communities and schools, especially in the adjacent Harlem and Bronx neighborhoods. The $40 million project is also financed by $20 million in public funds and another $10 million in private donations, and will be open next spring.
 Other areas around Randalls Island for which the Parks Department would love to find donors -- who would also get to see their names in lights -- include a stadium for Gallic football, a water park at the island's northern tip and a tennis center to replace the aging stadium. 
 Some nonprofit groups that specialize in rejuvenating parks in less affluent areas say the city still has a long way to go. ''The challenge is greatest in underserved parks,'' said Joseph Pupello, president of the New York Restoration Project. 
 But Mr. Benepe said that enticing more donors to give to small parks and offering corporate naming rights was part of an overall strategy to increase private money, volunteerism and general revenues from outside the city budget for his parks.
 Exhibit A: among the city's 1,700 parks or playgrounds, 50 percent have been adopted by volunteers, up from 40 percent a year ago, he said. And nine nonprofit groups have together raised $60 million for parks restoration, which Mr. Benepe says he believes is a $10 million increase over two years ago.
 The department is also trying to raise more money through concessions and rentals of parks. It recently closed a deal to get more than $180 million in combined rent and capital improvements at seven city-owned golf courses over the next 20 years. In the first year of the contract, the city will receive nearly double the rent it did in 2002; an increase to $4.6 million from $2.5 million. 
 ''We have developed a more sophisticated approach to charitable fund-raising and new forms of partnerships,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''The level of involvement from both private citizens and corporations and nonprofit groups is the way of doing business now. The days of the Parks Department strictly being a municipal enterprise without working with the community and having people assisting are gone and will never return.''

HEADLINE: House Approves $447 Billion in Spending for Military

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
The House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a $447 billion military package that includes the extra $25 billion sought by the Bush administration to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through early next year.
 Authors of the measure, which passed by a bipartisan margin of 391 to 34, said it was specifically geared toward the needs of those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing $1 billion for new vehicle armor, replenishing stockpiles of arms and ammunition and giving military personnel a pay raise and other benefits.
 ''This is the year of the troops,'' said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
 The House defied a veto threat from the administration by keeping a two-year delay on a round of military base closings set for next year, easily defeating an effort to require the closings to move forward in 2005. Mr. Hunter and other senior Republicans said they did not expect the Pentagon's spending plan for the year beginning Oct. 1 to be rejected over the base closing provision. 
 Senators were moving much more slowly with their own $422 billion measure and abandoned hope of finishing before leaving on their Memorial Day break. Both the House and Senate were considering the proposals against the backdrop of the prison scandal in Iraq and continuing unrest and uncertainty there.
 ''We are in a war,'' said Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ''Neither the country nor this Congress was united in initiating the conflict, but we stand now as one with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines fighting it.''
 House Democrats complained throughout two days of debate that they were prevented from offering important amendments, but in the end most of them supported the legislation. Some Democrats said the $400 million for body armor and other ''force protection'' provisions showed that the troops dispatched to Iraq were ill-equipped in the first place. ''There is no excuse for us to send our soldiers into harm's way without this most basic protection,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York.
 Among the personnel benefits in the measure are a 3.5 percent pay increase, a raise in hazardous duty and family separation pay, improved survivor benefits and elimination of a limit on the construction of military housing. The measure also allows for adding 30,000 troops in the Army over the next three years and 9,000 in the Marine Corps.
 Democrats again failed to strip the measure of money for researching a new nuclear weapon capable of penetrating underground bunkers. But Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, Democrat of California, noted that the 214-to-204 vote was closer than a similar effort last year, which she read as a sign of growing skepticism about new nuclear devices. Opponents of the nuclear program say it could spur proliferation.
 The most significant fight was over the plan to proceed next year with the base closings, an important matter for lawmakers trying to protect facilities in their districts. Opponents of delaying the base closings said that the military needed to get moving on shutting under-used facilities and that the economic impact on communities was exaggerated.
 But supporters of the two-year delay said the makeup of the armed forces was undergoing significant changes given the conflict in Iraq and that it would be impractical to proceed next year before a study of overseas installations was finished.
 ''Too many balls are in the air,'' said Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the subcommittee on military readiness. Mr. Hefley prevailed, 259 to 162, against the push to keep the closings on track. That decision sets up an eventual showdown with the Senate, which this week narrowly defeated an effort to delay the closings.
 The House also gave its support to tearing down the Abu Ghraib prison, the scene of the abuse of Iraq detainees, and replacing it with a new facility. But lawmakers defeated a Democratic push for a special Congressional inquiry into the abuse as Democrats complained that the House was failing in oversight of the war.
 The debate in the Senate got off track this week when the Armed Services Committee spent much of Wednesday on its third hearing into the prison abuse cases. Lawmakers will take the bill up again in about 10 days. The Senate consideration promises to be more contentious than the House, though the outcome is likely to be the same, with a wide approval for the measure.
 Both parties are near agreement on incorporating the $25 billion in war money in the Senate measure. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is trying to add a requirement that President Bush deliver a report on his strategy for stabilizing Iraq. Democrats also intend to challenge the spending on new nuclear weapons and money for missile defense while proposing a troop increase beyond that adopted by the House.

HEADLINE: Mutiny by 4 Republicans Over Bush's Tax Cutting Forces Delay on the Budget Vote

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
Unable to a squelch a six-week mutiny over President Bush's tax-cutting agenda, Senate Republican leaders on Thursday conceded that they could not muster enough votes to pass a $2.4 trillion budget plan and abruptly postponed a vote until at least next month.
 ''It's premature to bring it to a vote tonight,'' said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, after spending much of the day trying to persuade a handful of centrist Republicans to abandon their insistence that any new tax cuts be paid for with either spending cuts or tax increases.
 The decision, coming on the same day that Mr. Bush made a high-profile plea for approval of the budget on a last-minute trip to Capitol Hill, was a major setback for the president, and reflected growing unease about his goal of permanently extending the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. It was also a sign of bitter rifts between House and Senate Republicans and between House leaders and Senate moderates, some of whom openly traded insults earlier this week. 
 Democrats wasted little time in using the moment to denounce Mr. Bush's economic agenda.
 ''Welcome to the big leagues,'' said Representative Rahm Emmanuel, Democrat of Illinois, a former White House aide in the Clinton Administration. ''This is not only an example of their being unable to govern, it's an example of the failure of their economic policies.''
 Congressional analysts have estimated that the cost of making the tax cuts permanent could total nearly $2 trillion over the next 10 years. The budget impasse, which began in March, was over whether to impose a ''pay as you go'' rule that would require Congress to offset the cost of new tax cuts.
 Mr. Bush and House Republicans adamantly opposed any such restrictions, as they would have made it almost impossible to make last year's tax cuts permanent.
 But in the Senate, a handful of centrist Republicans teamed up with Democrats in March and succeeded in attaching the pay-as-you-go rule to the budget resolution by a two-vote majority. House and Senate leaders agreed on a compromise that would have essentially postponed the major decisions until next year, but all four of the Republican dissenters rejected the deal as unacceptable.
 Although Mr. Frist said he still hoped to pass a budget resolution when Congress returns in early June from its Memorial Day recess, Republicans and Democrats said the impasse will not be easy to resolve.
 ''I would have been surprised if the budget had passed today,'' said Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''I knew if there were holdouts they weren't going to change at the last minute. ''
 The battle on Thursday was over a central difference between budget resolutions passed earlier this year by the House and Senate.
 Four Senate moderates -- John McCain of Arizona, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- had insisted on attaching a provision that would have applied pay-as-you-go-rules for the next five years.
 The House budget resolution called only for a pay-as-you-go rule that would apply to new spending programs outside of defense and domestic security. The Bush administration staunchly supported the House approach, determined to permanently extend the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 rather than let them expire over the next several years.
 Senate Republicans needed two more votes to reverse the earlier budget vote in March, but none of the four moderates were willing to give much ground.
 ''It sounds like an obscure technical issue, but it is extremely important,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonprofit research group that campaigns for lower budget deficits. ''It is becoming a major rift within the Republican Party.''
 Mr. McCain let it be known this month that he would go along with imposing pay-as-you-go rules for three years instead of five, but House Republicans said they would only accept the restriction for one year.
 In what seemed like a last-ditch effort at agreement, Mr. Frist and other Senate leaders agreed with House leaders on a one-year plan that would allow Congress to extend for one year three major tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year.
 But as the pressure to reach a deal increased, Mr. McCain scathingly attacked the ''fat cats'' who were not willing to make sacrifices while fighting a war. That prompted an angry retort earlier this week from the Republican House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who said Mr. McCain, a decorated war veteran and former prisoner of war, ought to appreciate the sacrifices being made by soldiers in Iraq.
 Mr. McCain fired back on Thursday. ''I fondly remember a time when real Republicans stood for fiscal responsibility,'' he said. ''Apparently, those days are long gone for some of those in our party.''
 By Thursday morning, Republican leaders had all but abandoned hope of persuading any of their four rebellious colleagues and tried in vain to find one or two conservative Democrats who might change their views.
 Mr. Bush came to Capitol Hill, in part to talk about Iraq but also to appeal for support on the budget.
 ''I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and pass this budget so that we can continue making progress on our shared agenda of building a safer, stronger, and better America,'' Mr. Bush said in a statement after meeting with House and Senate Republicans.
 The failure of Senate Republicans to pass a budget resolution does not mean that any of last year's tax cuts will necessarily expire.
 Both House and Senate budget plans would have left room to extend those tax cuts without finding ways to pay for them, at least for the next few years.

HEADLINE: The Russian Contender For King of the Oil Patch

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 20 

 BODY:
By rights, Russia should have a world-class energy company. It has 6 percent of the world's oil reserves and pumps 10 percent of daily global production, rivaling Saudi Arabia. And its economy has rebounded as oil-consuming nations east and west turn increasingly to Russia for energy supplies. 
 The decade of sharp-elbowed deal making that shaped the Russian industry yielded two leading contenders for the global energy big leagues. One, Yukos, was a clear favorite in the capital markets: run by a charismatic, financially astute young chairman, eager to do business the Western way, emphasizing transparency and technical skill, and open to deals with giants like Exxon Mobil. 
 But Yukos fell from grace last year, after its chairman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, locked political horns with the Kremlin and found himself arrested and jailed on fraud and embezzlement charges, while the company fights a $3 billion assessment for back taxes. 
 The other contender, Lukoil, has no such troubles. Its president, Vagit Y. Alekperov, gets along very well with President Vladimir V. Putin, who even took time out from a state visit to the United States last September to cut the ribbon at a new Lukoil gas station on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 But the very things that make Lukoil work in Russia are holding it back in the rest of the world, analysts and industry experts say: Lukoil remains a very Russian company, with all that has come to imply, from its complex structure and opaque finances to its inefficiency and dependence on the good will of the Kremlin.
 The company's ambitions are plain: Mr. Alekperov has been saying since 1996 that the company aims to be the biggest producer in the world, and that the ''seven sisters'' of the oil industry ''now have a brother.'' 
 Lukoil's reserves, which by some measures are second in the world only to Exxon Mobil's, give weight to its claim; so does its major retail presence in Europe and in the United States, with the purchase of 1,300 Getty gas stations in 2001 and 800 more from ConocoPhillips this year. 
 Mr. Alekperov said in an interview that Lukoil was looking for refineries to lease in the United States so that American drivers ''will have us as one of the major producers of gasoline.''
 Whatever else it may be, Lukoil is immense. In April it reported that it had 20.06 billion barrels of proven oil and gas reserves at the beginning of the year, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier. Lukoil reports its reserves under rules of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and those rules are somewhat more permissive than the Securities and Exchange Commission rules that govern American companies; even so, its resources put it in a class with international majors like ChevronTexaco, PetroChina, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell and Total.
 For years, though, Lukoil lagged rivals like Yukos and Sibneft at the wellhead and in the stock market. Putting modern methods and technology to work in its Soviet-era oil fields much faster than Lukoil did, Yukos caught up to it in daily production in the late 1990's, and averaged 1.61 million barrels a day in 2003, ahead of Lukoil's 1.58 million. 
 Last fall, Yukos and Sibneft agreed to merge in a deal that would have eclipsed Lukoil, but the billionaire investor who controls Sibneft, Roman A. Abramovich, called it off after prosecutors arrested Mr. Khodorkovsky at gunpoint last October. Yukos and Sibneft are still trying to disentangle themselves as Mr. Khodorkovsky awaits trial. 
 Mr. Alekperov, the career oil man who built Lukoil, could hardly be more different from Mr. Khodorkovsky, a banker 13 years his junior, in background and politics. Born in Azerbaijan in 1950, one of five children raised by a single mother, and trained as an engineer, Mr. Alekperov worked his way up through the Soviet oil industry to be deputy minister of energy in 1990 and 1991, as the Communist era was lurching toward its end. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Mr. Alekperov was in a position to cherry-pick the best oil and gas assets as they were privatized. 
 Both men want more export pipelines built in Russia to ease bottlenecks, but where Mr. Khodorkovsky has advocated private projects to compete with Transneft, the state pipeline monopoly, Mr. Alekperov has avoided challenging Transneft.
 Where Mr. Khodorkovsky financed opposition parties and advertised his own presidential ambitions, Mr. Alekperov stayed close to Mr. Putin and his ruling party, United Russia. 
 Where Mr. Khodorkovsky argued publicly that Russia should drop its opposition to the United States-led invasion and occupation of Iraq, Mr. Alekperov stayed quiet in public, choosing instead to have Lukoil cooperate with the American authorities behind the scenes, training employees in the new Iraqi oil ministry and supplying northern provinces with fuel. 
 Lukoil's hope in Iraq is to win back its lucrative West Qurna oil concession, which Saddam Hussein annulled just before the invasion last March. ''Our contract is solid,'' Mr. Alekperov said, adding that much depends on the handover of sovereignty to Iraqis planned for June 30. 
 At the same time, Lukoil is solidifying its beachhead in the United States, gradually converting its Getty stations to display the red-and-white Lukoil logo. And at home, it is moving into production of natural gas, another sector where prices are quite high and Russia has huge deposits, mostly controlled by Gazprom, the state gas-distribution monopoly. 
 ''We have pretty good reserves in the Yamal region'' in Russia's far north, Mr. Alekperov said. ''And we have an arrangement with Gazprom to sell them gas.'' 
 Yukos and its managers, meanwhile, have had to spend time responding to attacks from the tax ministry, local prosecutors, and other officials questioning its oil production licenses. 
 Though publicly traded as a single entity, Lukoil is structured more like a decentralized web of fiefs, and some investors say it is often unclear how profits flow to the center of the group or whether its published accounts fully capture what is going on. 
 ''Some of the units within Lukoil, like Permneft, are, in management terms, very autonomous,'' said Ian Hague, co-manager of Firebird, a hedge fund specializing in Russian investments. ''The amount of oil they're producing, as compared to net income, seems to show that large sums -- hundreds of millions of dollars -- are going places not clear to investors.'' 
 Mr. Hague noted that Lukoil's sales, general and administrative costs appear to be much higher than those of rivals like Sibneft and Yukos. Renaissance Capital, a brokerage house in Moscow, calculates the difference at $2.10 for each barrel it produces. 
 ''Investors don't like things that are difficult to explain,'' Mr. Hague said. ''If Lukoil is running an expensive ship, meaning more of their money goes to administrative costs than others, investors view that as a problem.''
 According to an analysis by UBS Brunswick, Lukoil earned about $5.36 for each barrel of oil it pumped in 2002; Yukos made about $5.53. Those figures are almost certainly much higher today, thanks to export prices that have risen by more than 30 percent since then. The Russian industry could export much more if the ports and pipelines existed to handle the greater volume; as it is, much of its oil remains stranded in the glutted domestic market, where it can be bought for less than $8 a barrel. 
 Stocks of American majors like Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco are now trading at price-to-earnings multiples in the mid-teens, based on estimated earnings over the next year. But Lukoil's multiple is just 7.9, in the middle of the Russian oil pack. 
 William Browder, who manages Hermitage, a hedge fund specializing in Russia that holds Lukoil shares, said that the company's stock is undervalued because of investor-unfriendly business practices and profits that are weaker than they should be. 
 With more than 600 affiliated companies and 160 subsidiaries, Mr. Browder said, ''the structure of Lukoil makes investors' access to future cash flows very uncertain.'' 
 Lukoil is making little progress on a two-year-old promise to sell poorly performing or noncore units like banking and construction companies. But a bigger worry about Lukoil, investors and analysts say, is the way it handles exports: selling oil at below-market prices to offshore affiliates who resell it to customers at full price. 
 Mr. Browder said that profits from this arrangement, known as transfer pricing and common in the Russian oil industry, are not finding their way back to Lukoil's bottom line. He estimated that Lukoil had forgone about $1 billion in earnings from 2000 to 2003 because of transfer pricing; if not for that, he said, the company's stock would now be worth $40 a share instead of $27. A Lukoil spokesman said he could not comment on Mr. Browder's assessment. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Alekperov promised that the offshore affiliates would be merged into a wholly owned Lukoil subsidiary called Litasco, but so far only 29 percent of Lukoil's exports are passing through Litasco.
 ''Lukoil investors should insist on termination of transfer pricing practices and full consolidation'' of Lukoil's exports, Mr. Browder said. A Lukoil spokesman said the company was not done with its restructuring yet.
 The Russian government has decided to sell its remaining 7.6 percent stake in Lukoil, perhaps by the end of the year, Mr. Alekperov said. For a while, investors hoped that the shares would go in a block to a Western oil major, perhaps ConocoPhillips, which is working with Lukoil in developing the Timan Pechora field. ConocoPhillips is also talking to Lukoil about refining some of its crude oil in Scotland for sale in North America. But the Kremlin is now cool to the idea of foreign companies taking large stakes in Russian oil producers, making such a sale unlikely. 
 ''In this world, nothing is impossible,'' he said. ''But we're oriented as an independent company. We have international oil rights, and we're a global company.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies Continue to Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
Personal bankruptcies rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, continuing the upward trend of recent years but marking a more moderate increase than in earlier months, data released Friday showed. 
 New personal bankruptcy filings rose to 1,618,062 in that period from 1,573,720 in the 12 months ended March 31, 2003, according to the data from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
 The upward trend has continued despite signs of recovery in the economy as effects linger from the consumer spending binge of the 1990's, and the historically low interest rates that encouraged borrowing and built up heavy household debt. The rate of bankruptcies generally lags behind direction changes in other economic indicators.

HEADLINE: Conservative Group Amplifies Voice of Protestant Orthodoxy

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
As Presbyterians prepare to gather for their General Assembly in Richmond, Va., next month, a band of determined conservatives is advancing a plan to split the church along liberal and orthodox lines. Another divorce proposal shook the United Methodist convention in Pittsburgh earlier this month, while conservative Episcopalians have already broken away to form a dissident network of their own.
 In each denomination, the flashpoint is homosexuality, but there is another common denominator as well. In each case, the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a small organization based in Washington, has helped incubate traditionalist insurrections against the liberal politics of the denomination's leaders.
 With financing from a handful of conservative donors, including the Scaife family foundations, the Bradley and Olin Foundations and Howard and Roberta Ahmanson's Fieldstead & Company, the 23-year-old institute is now playing a pivotal role in the biggest battle over the future of American Protestantism since churches split over slavery at the time of the Civil War. 
 The institute has brought together previously disconnected conservative groups within each denomination to share resources and tactics, including forcing heresy trials of gay clergy members, winning seats on judicial committees and urging congregations to withhold money from their denomination's headquarters. 
 When the Episcopal Church elected an openly gay bishop last summer, the institute organized and housed a conservative secessionist group called the American Anglican Council, which still occupies an office down the hall. When a conservative Methodist minister floated a breakup proposal at a private breakfast earlier this month, an institute staff member transcribed the speech and posted it on the institute's Web site, where it instantly became a rallying cry for disaffected Methodists.
 At the Presbyterian Church's assembly last year, the institute helped block a policy statement that said whether parents were single or gay made no difference to the moral status of a family, and in the process it won the appointment of a staff member to a committee to rewrite the policy for this year's meeting.
 Although the institute has an annual budget of just less than $1 million and a staff of fewer than a dozen, liberals and conservatives alike say it is having an outsized effect on the dynamics of American politics by counteracting the liberal influence of the mainline Protestant churches. Together, the Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal churches have 12.5 million members, and for decades they and other mainline denominations have provided theological backbone and foot soldiers for liberal causes like abortion rights, racial and economic equality, the nuclear freeze, environmentalism and anti-war movements. 
 For their part, the institute and its allies say they are saving the denominations from themselves by agitating for a return to biblical orthodoxy. They argue that the churches' liberalism has contributed to their steep decline over the last 30 years even as more conservative evangelical churches have grown. 
 ''It's pretty clear that the church elite in the mainline denominations are to the left of the people in the pews,'' said Diane Knippers, the institute's president and an Episcopalian who helped found the American Anglican Council and now sits on its board. 
 The group has often called on conservatives to change the liberal denominations from within, especially in the relatively more conservative Methodist and Presbyterian churches. But Mrs. Knippers said she could support the notion of divorce for irreconcilable differences, though perhaps with liberals leaving. ''Rather than be embroiled in legal battles in church courts over sexuality, let's find a gracious way to say, 'We will let you leave this system because you believe it violates your conscience.'''
 More liberal Protestants argue that the institute's financial backers are interfering with the theological disputes mainly for broader, secular political reasons. ''The mainline denominations are a strategic piece on the chess board that the right wing is trying to dominate,'' said Alfred F. Ross, president and founder of the Institute for Democracy Studies, a liberal New York-based research organization that produced a report in 2000 on the institute's influence in the Presbyterian Church. 
 ''It will give them access to three important pieces,'' said Mr. Ross, a lawyer and former official with the Planned Parenthood Federation. ''One is the Sunday pulpit. Two is millions of dollars of capacity internally, with control of church newsletters and pension funds. And three is foreign missions,'' which dispense missionaries, and with them their brand of Christianity, around the world.
 The Rev. Robert Edgar, a former Democratic congressman who is general secretary of the National Council of Churches, an ecumenical alliance that is dominated by the mainline churches and is a principal target of the institute's criticism, argued that it spoke for only about a third of mainline churchgoers. ''They have caused so many internal issues,'' he said, ''that some progressive leaders are afraid to take the courageous positions they would have taken a few decades ago, because a third of their parishioners would cut their legs off.''
 But in an interview last week, Roberta Ahmanson, a member of the institute's board and the wife of Howard Ahmanson, a banking heir from California, contended that the institute's orthodoxy resonated more widely.
 In addition, she argued that the liberal churches were often operating off endowments left by previous generations who were unlikely to share their modern views.
 ''The Christian community isn't just who is alive,'' Mrs. Ahmanson said. ''Christians believe that we are in communion with the living and the dead. We pray each week for the living and the dead, and most of the previous generations are in disagreement with a lot of this stuff.'' 
 ''If you take the weight of Christianity for 2,000 years,'' she continued, ''all that weight is on the orthodox side.''
 Mrs. Knippers and Mrs. Ahmanson noted that the impetus for the founding of the institute came from a labor union activist, not right-wing financiers. Mrs. Knippers said the initial idea came from David Jessup, a staunchly anti-Communist union activist and Methodist who objected to church aid to Vietnam and Nicaragua under their leftist regimes. 
 The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Roman Catholic priest and former Lutheran minister, wrote its founding statement, and other neoconservatives joined an advisory board. (In addition to Father Neuhaus, the institute's board of directors currently includes Mary Ellen Bork, wife of Judge Robert H. Bork; Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard and Fox News; and Michael Novak of the American Enterprise Institute.)
 Ms. Knippers, who spoke during two interviews in the last three months, said that during the 1980's the institute's initial budget of about $300,000 came from a few conservative foundations, including the Scaife family foundations, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation, as well as from the Ahmansons' philanthropic arm, Fieldstead & Company. 
 Some conservative foundations said they supported the institute as a broader effort to build a conservative infrastructure in many fields after decades of liberal ascendancy had shut out the right.
 James Piereson, executive director of the Olin Foundation, said it saw the institute as a Protestant counterpart to the conservative magazine Commentary for Jews or Father Neuhaus's journal First Things for Catholics. ''If no one commented on and criticized the churches' political activities, it would appear that this was an unobjectionable religious position that was being brought to bear instead of a controversial position,'' he said, adding that ''the sexuality issues and the liturgical issues in the churches have never been of great interest to us.''
 Mrs. Ahmanson, who is Presbyterian, said she and her husband, who is Episcopalian, were motivated mainly by theological concerns. ''My husband and I are what we call classical Christians,'' Mrs. Ahmanson said, explaining their view that Christians should stick to the fifth century St. Vincent of Lerins's orthodox standard of ''what has been held everywhere in every time by everyone.'' She added, ''It is only in the last hundred years or so that there has been an elite, if you will, who have argued with that.'' 
 After the fall of communism, Mrs. Knippers said, the institute's focus on policing the churches' support for leftists abroad faded away. ''We talked about whether the I.R.D. should just fold up,'' she said.
 Instead the institute turned more of its attention to social issues closer to home. ''In the seminaries, what replaced the liberation theology of the 80's was a radical feminist theology,'' Mrs. Knippers said, noting that in 1993 the Presbyterian Church organized a conference encouraging women to ''re-imagine'' God in a new way. ''And if feminism was the theology du jour on many campuses in the 90's, now it is homosexuality that is the issue.''
 Feminism and homosexuality are also subjects that make for much more effective fund-raising appeals than foreign policy, marketers say. And in recent years the institute has broadened its direct-mail fund-raising to cover roughly 60 percent of its annual budget, Mrs. Knippers said.
 By 1989, fundamentalists had recently taken over the Southern Baptist Convention. And in the liberal mainline churches, the conservative Presbyterian Lay Committee and the Methodist group Good News were already growing. ''We have had for a number of years a good number of renewal groups,'' said Parker Williamson, chief of the Lay Committee. ''But the I.R.D. and Diane Knippers have been a wonderful help.''
 Now, as Presbyterians prepare for their General Assembly, Alan Wisdom, the institute's Presbyterian director, says representatives of the institute will be there in force, calling attention to any liberal positions coming out of the church, distributing position papers to delegates and lobbying them in a conservative direction. 
 Mr. Wisdom said the institute did not support the idea of a Presbyterian breakup, and almost no one expects a split at this year's General Assembly. But some conservatives are already drawing up a plan they call ''gracious separation'' to divide the church's assets. ''If we don't see significant changes in the next two General Assemblies, I suspect we are going to see some manifestation of separation,'' Mr. Williamson of the Lay Committee said. ''I hope and pray it would be gracious.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about the Institute on Religion and Democracy, which has backed traditionalist causes in Protestant denominations, misidentified the group it helped organize after the Episcopal Church ordained an openly gay bishop last year. It is the Anglican Communion Network -- also called the Network of Anglican Communion Dioceses and Parishes. (The American Anglican Council was founded in 1995 by conservative Episcopalians, including the president of the institute, but not by the institute itself. The council was the principal organizer of the Anglican Communion Network.)

HEADLINE: Saudis Offer To Increase Oil Output By About 6%

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
In an effort to drive down record crude oil prices, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, offered on Friday to increase its output by at least 500,000 barrels, to 9 million barrels a day, starting June 1.
 In contrast to an earlier suggestion by the country that OPEC increase its quotas, the offer is important because it would truly add more oil to the market rather than simply formalizing existing overproduction by the group's members. 
 With global demand relentlessly high, oil prices rose above $40 a barrel in New York on May 11 and remained there until Friday. Nearly all oil-producing countries are pumping at maximum capacity, and almost all the world's spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia. 
 The offer, made by the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, at a conference in Amsterdam and confirmed by an official at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, shows the mounting concern -- even among oil producers reaping a windfall from high prices -- that oil has become so expensive and volatile that it could slow economic growth and encourage the development of alternative fuels, Saudi officials and oil experts said. 
 The price of oil fell on news of the announcement, settling at $39.93 a barrel for July delivery in New York on Friday. While that dip may signal that some oil traders believe that the Saudis can make good on their offer, the additional oil that could appear on the market may not be enough to push prices sharply lower.
 ''Over time, those extra barrels will make a difference,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy adviser at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. But Ms. Jaffe and other experts warned that Saudi oil takes about six weeks to arrive in the United States and make its way through refineries before reaching consumers, which may mute the effect on gasoline prices.
 ''We're trying to salvage the winter heating oil season now,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ''We're not trying to salvage the gasoline season any more.''
 As the de facto leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Saudis tried to quell the oil markets about two weeks ago by announcing that they would suggest to OPEC an increase of its official quota by 1.5 million barrels a day. Oil traders, however, dismissed that offer because OPEC members are already exceeding the official quota of 23.5 million barrels a day by about 2.2 million barrels, industry experts estimated, as they seek to cash in on the high prices. The old Saudi suggestion, then, would have only formalized part of the existing situation without releasing additional oil onto the markets.
 But the latest announcement, while calling for an increase in the official quota by 2 million barrels a day, was considerably strengthened by the Saudi offer to pump more oil and to sell it to all comers. Echoing Mr. Naimi's comments in Amsterdam, Adel al-Jubeir, a spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, said his country would increase its output about 6 percent to at least 9 million barrels a day by June 1. The country is pumping about 8.5 million barrels a day now, industry analysts said, and has the capacity to produce about 10.5 million barrels a day on a sustained basis. 
 The increase in the official OPEC quota is expected to be discussed by the cartel's members at an international conference in Amsterdam over the weekend. Some OPEC officials, including those from Indonesia and Venezuela, have argued that the market is awash in oil and extra barrels are not needed. They argue that prices are high largely because of speculation by hedge funds and refinery bottlenecks in the United States.
 But the Saudi announcement is also an effort to restore the country's credibility as an astute manager of global oil markets -- one that has traditionally turned its valves off and on to find the right balance in oil prices to enrich its oil-producing allies without harming the global economy. Even if the rest of OPEC balks at the suggestion, most industry analysts think the Saudis will proceed with their plan.
 ''They will go ahead and produce the extra oil,'' said Roger Diwan, managing director at PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. ''They don't like the feeling that things are out of control, that prices are out of their control. If they do this, they could still get $35 a barrel, which is a very good year when they can still make lots of money. And people will think that the Saudis did something good for them.''
 Over the last week, high fuel prices have flared as a presidential campaign issue as Democrats and Republicans have traded accusations that neither side has done enough to shield American consumers.
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the fragile nature of diplomatic discussions, a Saudi official dismissed speculation that the Saudis were helping the United States with more oil now to ensure President Bush's re-election. He noted instead that the two countries regularly talk about oil supplies, especially when prices are so high.
 ''When prices get out of control, there are discussions along the lines of 'are you doing something about it?''' the official said. ''And our answer is, 'Absolutely.' There is no divergence here between the interests of the two countries.''

HEADLINE: Attention, Bank Robbers: No Need to Case Austin. It's Already Taken.

BYLINE: By NATHAN LEVY

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., May 21 

 BODY:
In a city that congratulates itself on all its oddities, a torrent of bank robberies this year is giving new meaning to the local slogan, Keep Austin Weird.
 From Jan. 1 through Monday, Austin, the capital of Texas, had 27 attempted bank robberies, compared with 4 for the same period in 2003, and 18 for all of last year, according to Austin police. Some of the robbers hit several banks, and all but one have been unarmed, said Lt. Charles Black, who is heading the investigation. 
 One thief, hardly blending in, wore a cowboy hat. Another shed his trousers after the holdup and, seeking a new look, fled in short pants he was wearing underneath. The latest robbery occurred Monday.
 Law enforcement officials attribute the surge to newly arrived or out-of-town criminals, and desperate individuals aiming to satisfy heroin addictions. The Austin police dismiss any link between the struggling economy here and the fortunes of the local population, which numbers about 670,000. 
 ''Historically, for us, we don't have a lot of bank robberies,'' said Lieutenant Black, 49, who has been on the force for a quarter of a century and last recalled such an uptick in 1992, when Austin had 28 bank holdups. 
 The Austin police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have solved 17 of the 27 bank robberies, a clearance rate of 63 percent, while the 2003 F.B.I. national figure is 66 percent, said a bureau spokeswoman in Washington. The suspect who used the gun has not been caught, Lieutenant Black said, and the amount of money stolen per robbery has ranged from $400 to nearly $10,000.
 The number of bank robberies statewide varies, Lieutenant Black said. Houston, San Antonio and Waco have not seen a noticeable increase, while Dallas has had twice as many as a year ago, he said. Nationally, the number of bank robberies in 2003 was 8,561, an 11.5 percent jump from 2002, according to F.B.I. figures.
 On May 4, a federal grand jury in Austin indicted Ernest Rodriguez Jr., a San Antonio man, on five counts of bank robbery. Mr. Rodriguez, the so-called Cowboy Bandit, wore Western headgear during five holdups and was suspected of others in Dallas and Corpus Christi. He was arrested on April 14 after leaving the Travis County Credit Union, where a teller identified him as the same man who robbed the office in March. 
 Eric Warr, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Austin, said he told his students, ''Only idiots rob banks today where the chance of getting caught is so high.'' A large majority of robbers do not wear disguises, he said, even though security cameras inside banks are widespread. ''There are no more professional criminals in this business.''
 In one example of amateur bank robbers in Austin, Jose Garcia, 22, took his long pants off shortly after he robbed a Compass Bank on April 28 in southern Austin, expecting that his shorts underneath would give him a different appearance, Lieutenant Black said. 
 But, the police said, Mr. Garcia left his driver's license in his pants, which were discarded several hundred yards from the bank. Police officers found the pants and the license inside, and confirmed his picture with the bank. 
 Shortly afterward, officers spotted a possible intruder entering a nearby apartment complex, and began knocking on doors to locate him. Mr. Garcia, who lives elsewhere, answered the door of an apartment of an acquaintance and was arrested, Lieutenant Black said. 
 The large number of robberies in a short period has strained the resources of local law enforcement, Lieutenant Black said. Further, the F.B.I.'s priorities are counterterrorism and counterintelligence, said Rene Salinas, an F.B.I. spokesman in San Antonio. ''They're now moving us away from bank robberies since 9/11,'' he said.
 No one here questions the need for banks and the police to work together to improve safety measures as the robberies have continued. Banks use a variety of measures to prevent robberies, Mr. Warr said, mentioning exploding dye packs, devices that are stuck within bills which spray red dye on the criminal and the stolen money when activated. 
 Lieutenant Black added that banks emphasized different techniques. Some use silent alarms wired directly to cash bins, and some plant transmitters in money. 
 The police are also encouraging banks to post signs at their entrances requesting customers remove hats and sunglasses to allow for better pictures on the security cameras.

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing in Crisis

 BODY:
House Republicans who authorized cuts in federal housing subsidies for the poor are now fuming over the bad publicity about the cuts. It's strange that anyone was surprised at the negative reaction. The cuts place tenants in some cities at risk of losing subsidized housing, and financial institutions are beginning to express doubts about continuing to participate in the kinds of development projects that have built much of the nation's affordable housing. 
 If the lawmakers really regret the damage they have done, there is still time for them to undo it. The recent promise by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to shovel an extra dollop of money into the current program won't do the trick. HUD needs to rethink its hostile approach to paying for the critical Section 8 program, which furnishes rent subsidies for two million of the country's most vulnerable families.
 Section 8 has survived the generation-long assault on public housing because it is based partly in the private sector. Rather than building affordable housing itself, the government has guaranteed subsidies for rents in the private market. Families, most of them living at or below the poverty level, pay 30 percent of their incomes toward rent, and Section 8 vouchers pay the remainder. Developers used the Section 8 guarantees as backing when they raised money for low- or mixed-income developments.
 But despite its theoretical commitment to the private market, HUD has gotten tired of meeting the fast-rising housing prices in some markets. It announced recently -- with Congressional blessing -- that it would no longer pay the full cost of the vouchers. It froze federal funds at the level of August 2003, plus an adjustment for inflation.
 This is a tactic the Bush administration has used in other areas as it tries to halt open-ended commitments for federal funds in favor of set block grants. A ''block grant,'' however, is simply a cut by another name. Neither the poor nor the local housing authorities have the power to make rents conform to those dictates. In high-cost areas like New York and San Francisco, officials will have trouble finding landlords and builders who will accept Section 8 tenants because the vouchers will no longer provide a predictable level of support. Families who have been lucky enough to get Section 8 help may wind up having to pay more rent.
 Perhaps worst of all, the financial community has begun to react. A New England bank has scrapped an innovative home mortgage program aimed at promoting home ownership through Section 8. Wall Street bond traders have warned that the cuts could cause the bond market to lose faith in Section 8-related programs, undermining the bonding process that makes it possible to build affordable housing. 
 The incomes of the poor do not expand just because real estate values do. If these ill-advised cuts are allowed to stand, a public-private partnership that has been producing affordable housing since the Nixon years will wither and die.

HEADLINE: Tiger Claw or the 1-4-5? Depends on Where You Live

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
On West 145th Street, between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, people have their own way of saying hello. When neighbors want to salute each other, they often use the 1-4-5, a three-part greeting that consists of a single finger to the nose, four placed on the chest above the heart, then a light five-finger slap. 
 A few blocks north, on West 151st Street, the custom differs. 
 There, teenagers employ an intricate exchange of grips, chops and waves that ends with touching forefingers and thumbs. It goes by many names, but some call it the Taliban. 
 Down on West 135th Street, where Jamaican immigrants play dominoes on the sidewalk, there is yet another common welcome signal, called the Tiger Claw, in which interlocking fingers held at eye level push against each other.
 It has been said many times that New York is a city with eight million stories, and, to a careful observer, that figure might appear to be rivaled by the number of handshakes used each day in the city's neighborhoods. 
 ''We'll never know every single handshake,'' Michael Britto, a filmmaker, said one recent afternoon, as he stood in front of the Apollo Theater on West 125th Street with a three-person film crew. ''But we want to do a good survey so people can see how wide the range is.''
 For the past year, Mr. Britto, 35, has been in search of the daps, pounds and clasps of New York and beyond for a documentary called ''Gimme Five: History of a Handshake.''
 ''I like finding out the history of things people don't pay attention to,'' he said. ''And I like getting people to think about things in their everyday life that they take for granted.'' 
 On this afternoon, the crew captured Curtis Young, 48, of Bedford-Stuyvesant as he demonstrated a four-part grip that ended with a raised symbolizing black power.
 ''That's from the late 60's and early 70's,'' he said. ''It was something we did to show our togetherness.'' 
 He was followed by Omari Moore, 18, of Harlem who showed a handshake that began with three hand slaps and ended in a half embrace. Mr. Moore, who said that he grew up in military bases around the world and that he had learned the handshake from his father, a serviceman, said the initial three slaps stood for ''welcome, strength and unity.'' 
 Over the next three hours, as they wandered east from the theater toward Malcolm X Boulevard, Mr. Britto and the crew filmed about 20 different handshakes, some with names like the Brotherly Love, the K&D (named after the first initials of its two inventors), the Elverson Shake (named after a middle school in North Philadelphia), and what was described as a Cherokee-Apache handshake, demonstrated by a man who goes by Eagle Eye.
 During the filming, Mr. Britto was director, interviewer, grip and gaffer. He ordered rowdy teenagers out of his frame, halted shooting when rumbling trucks or blaring sirens drowned out conversation and coaxed passers-by into becoming participants. Not all of them were amenable. A group of Masons who were registering voters on West 125th Street near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, told the crew that handshakes were a highly personal matter. 
 Mr. Britto, who made a documentary about a Harlem artist, James de la Vega, in 2000, said he got the idea for his current project two years ago, while he was teaching video production to high school children in Harlem and saw students exchanging arcane handshakes.
 With some help from Film Video/Arts, a nonprofit foundation, he went out on the streets with his camera and shot a 10-minute trailer. In October, he received a grant of $12,500 from the New York State Council on the Arts.
 Since then he has filmed 60 hours of film, which he plans to edit to 60 minutes. Mr. Britto has filmed veteran soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., describing the daps, or hand slaps, they used to maintain solidarity and morale while serving in Vietnam. He has filmed Cornel West, a Princeton professor, discussing how the human element of handshakes can transcend class and economic barriers.
 And he has filmed a man who insisted that he invented the pound, in which greeters touch the knuckles of their clenched fists, in 1992 on Astor Place, while recovering from an injured thumb. The man described how he believed his signature shake was copied by the New York Mets and subsequently achieved worldwide recognition.
 ''That guy was great,'' Mr. Britto said. ''Everyone who sees that part of the footage laughs.'' 
 Filming has not always been easy. Gang members have angrily refused to show him handshakes and accused him of being a police officer. Last fall on West 135th Street, a man whom he filmed without permission chased him for a block before Mr. Britto persuaded the man that he had no sinister intent.
 Much of Mr. Britto's filming has been done in Harlem (he lives in 1-4-5 territory), but he has also filmed in Flushing, East New York, the West Village and New Jersey. A friend will contribute video from New Zealand.
 Some of Mr. Britto's most enthusiastic subjects on West 125th Street were a group of teenagers visiting from Philadelphia, who eagerly demonstrated several handshakes they had made up. Andrew Jenkins, 14, showed one in which he and a friend staggered unevenly toward each other while grimacing, rolling their eyes and holding a crooked wrist at shoulder level. After touching their wrists, the two teenagers embraced.
 ''That's called the Crazy Shake,'' Andrew said. ''We do it because it's fun. And all the girls like it, too.''

HEADLINE: Drop in Oil Prices Helps Nudge Shares to a Higher Close

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after a call by Saudi Arabia for higher oil production drove oil prices below $40 a barrel, easing worries that soaring energy costs could derail the recovering economy.
 Shares of airlines rallied as the drop in oil prices reassured investors jittery about higher jet fuel costs, but energy shares fell, tracking the decline in crude prices.
 ''The big factor today is that oil fell below $40, which is a huge plus for the market,'' said Victor Pugliese, managing director at the First Albany Corporation. ''I think all the bad news over the past few weeks is finally being absorbed into the market.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,966.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.37 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,093.56. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 15.50 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,912.09.
 But trading activity was slow, and traders cautioned against reading too much into the market's gains. Volume on the Nasdaq was among the lightest it has been this year, a Nasdaq spokesman said.
 The gains in the stock market were not enough to keep blue chips from notching their fourth week of losses.
 The Dow ended the week down 0.5 percent, while the S.&P. 500 lost 0.2 percent for the week. The Nasdaq, however, broke its three-week losing streak, finishing up 0.4 percent.
 Volume on the Big Board was 1.26 billion shares, below the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 1.37 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq, well below last year's 1.69 billion daily average.
 Shares of Alcoa, the big aluminum producer, gained 18 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $29.48, after rising to a session high of $30.12. The company said it would cut almost 10 percent of the work force at its auto affiliate in Mexico, citing lower production.
 The stock of Nordstrom, the department store chain, surged a day after the company said its quarterly profit soared 153 percent, driven by strong sales and better use of technology to help track inventory and trends. Shares rose $2.67, or 7.2 percent, to $39.90 and were among the biggest percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia soared after a Secret Service laboratory director was accused by federal prosecutors of perjury during his testimony at the trial of Martha Stewart and her broker, Peter E. Bacanovic. A United States attorney said the false testimony should have no effect on the convictions. Still, shares of Martha Stewart Living jumped 8.8 percent, or 75 cents, to $9.30, after rising almost 22 percent earlier to a session high of $10.49.
 Among decliners, Marvel Enterprises slumped, a day after the publisher of ''Spider-Man'' and other comic books said two executives had sold a portion of their stake in the company. Shares of Marvel fell 77 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $19.53.
 SBC Communications grabbed headlines as the union representing 100,000 workers in 13 states began a four-day strike after talks for a new contract ground to a halt over health care and job security. Shares of SBC edged up 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $24.33. 
 In the Treasury market, bond prices fell with the decline in the cost of oil.
 ''If oil prices fall, it will help to stimulate economic activity -- the profit outlook will be better,'' said Tony J. Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller, Tabak & Company. ''Also, lower oil would bring down costs, making stocks the better asset class.'' 
 The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 99 30/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.76 percent from 4.70 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond fell 18/32, to 98 26/32, while its yield rose to 5.46 percent from 5.42 percent.

HEADLINE: That Perfect Game

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Michael Coffey (Op-Ed, May 20) theorizes that economics is responsible for an increase in the number of perfect games. 
 This rise, from four perfect games in the first 60 years of the 20th century to 11 in the last four and a half decades, is better explained by two factors: more major league teams playing more games per season, and dumb luck.

HEADLINE: A New Strategy Document Calls Attention to the Transition Between War and Peace

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has approved a new national military strategy that makes clear to the nation's war planners that they must pay greater attention to preparing for the complicated and dangerous transition between the end of major combat operations and the return of civil authority.
 That is the very stage of events that is proving so daunting now in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The new strategy seems to be seeking ways to avoid similar problems in any future war.
 ''Winning decisively will require synchronizing and integrating major combat operations, stability operations and significant postconflict interagency operations to establish conditions of stability and security favorable to the United States,'' the strategy document states. 
 While the American military was widely praised for its swift offensive into Iraq that captured Baghdad in just three weeks, the subsequent fight against a tenacious insurgency, combined with a political process that appears to be stumbling in advance of the June 30 transition to Iraqi sovereignty, makes clear that victory cannot yet be declared in the war in Iraq.
 In its broadest terms, the ''National Military Strategy 2004'' sets priorities for America's senior officers, including the job of winning against terrorism, increasing the ability of the four armed services to fight together and transforming the military with new technologies and fresh concepts even as it is stretched by multiple deployments.
 In authorizing the new military strategy, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also defines three core missions for the regional war-fighting commanders and heads of the armed services: to protect the United States, to prevent conflict and surprise attacks and to prevail against adversaries.
 A 23-page draft of the unclassified strategy document has circulated at the Pentagon since it was signed by General Myers and forwarded for approval to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in advance of delivery to Congress. The complete document also contains a classified risk assessment by General Myers.
 A copy was obtained by The New York Times, and two senior Defense Department officials discussed its major themes on Friday. 
 The new national military strategy serves as the connective tissue between strategy documents from the nation's civilian leaders -- the president and the defense secretary -- and turns those broad objectives into thematic marching orders for the regional combatant commanders, who plan and fight wars, and for the service chiefs, who organize, train and equip the military.
 General Myers did not mention his new military strategy during testimony on Friday before the House Armed Services Committee, but he spoke of the need to integrate the military and political missions.
 ''It applies to the war on terrorism; it also applies to the efforts in Iraq,'' he said. ''From a military standpoint, we can't lose militarily, but we can't win with the military alone.'' Victory will require efforts on ''the political and the economic fronts as well,'' he said.
 A central theme of the strategy is making clear to commanders that adapting to new threats, adopting new doctrine and fielding new technology, in particular for surveillance and reconnaissance, must move ahead even as the military is stressed by global deployments and the continuing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 ''We will transform the armed forces 'in stride' -- fielding new capabilities and adopting new operational concepts while actively taking the fight to terrorists,'' General Myers wrote in a foreword. 
 The strategy set forth by the general is a departure from the last strategy document, written in 1997, which ordered the military to shape the strategic environment, maintain the ability to respond and prepare for future threats.
 In a section on protecting the United States, the document states: ''Our first line of defense is abroad and includes mutually supporting activities with U.S. allies to counter threats close to their source. Closer to home, the armed forces use their capabilities to secure strategic air, land, sea and space approaches to the United States and its territory.''
 Preventing conflict and surprise attacks has taken on crucial importance in an era when adversaries possess or seek biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, the document states, and it urges strong alliances that ''contribute to mutual security, tend to deter aggression and help set conditions for success in combat if deterrence fails.''
 But the document notes that ''the potentially catastrophic impact of an attack against the United States, its allies and its interests may necessitate actions in self-defense to pre-empt adversaries before they can attack.''
 It warns that ''the character of conflict has changed, necessitating capabilities to defeat a wide range of adversaries from states to non-state actors.''
 The military must have the correct size and abilities to ''swiftly defeat adversaries in overlapping campaigns while preserving the option to expand operations in one of those campaigns to achieve more comprehensive objectives,'' it adds.
 Without specifically noting the current strain on the American military, the strategy guidance says that ''combatant commanders must consider the effect of their current posture when undertaking new operations,'' in particular preserving missions in the global campaign against terrorism as they develop their requests for forces. It warns commanders to be aware that in the current threat environment and with high rates of military deployments, ''some important capabilities may not be readily available at the outset of a subsequent conflict.''
 These ''extremely demanding circumstances'' of the military's role in fighting terror, the strategy declares, ''are likely to endure for the foreseeable future.''
 The military is also ordered to achieve ''decision superiority,'' the ability ''to make decisions better and faster than an adversary.''
 The national military strategy synthesizes the White House ''National Security Strategy'' issued by President Bush, which defined a new doctrine authorizing pre-emptive attacks on hostile states and terrorists who represent potential threats to the United States, especially those who may be amassing unconventional weapons. And it builds on strategy documents issued by Mr. Rumsfeld, in particular the Quadrennial Defense Review.
 Mr. Rumsfeld's new ''National Defense Strategy'' is due later this year, and the new military strategy was written in parallel and in close consultation with that effort, Pentagon officials said.

HEADLINE: Monsanto Wins Patent Case On Plant Genes

BYLINE: By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 21 

 BODY:
In a case central to the international debate over the right to patent gene-engineered organisms, Canada's Supreme Court ruled on Friday that a Saskatchewan farmer infringed Monsanto's patent on genetically modified canola, even though he said the seeds landed in his fields by accident. 
 While the ruling upholds Monsanto's patent rights, there is no immediate financial benefit to the company. The court said Monsanto was not entitled to profits earned by the farmer, Percy Schmeiser, from his genetically modified crop because he had not financially benefited from the plants' engineered ability to withstand Monsanto's herbicide Roundup. 
 Mr. Schmeiser and his supporters, including numerous farm and environmental groups, expressed disappointment that the court had confirmed Monsanto's right to patent a plant gene and control its use by farmers. 
 ''It's not nearly the victory that we were looking for,'' Mr. Schmeiser said at a news conference in Saskatoon.
 Pat Mooney, executive director of ETC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said the ruling suggested that ''wherever a gene wanders, it's under Monsanto's control.'' 
 But a patent law expert, Eileen McMahon, a partner at the Toronto law firm Torys, hailed the ruling as ''a fantastic decision in terms of biotechnology and patents.'' According to Ms. McMahon, ''we have a strong signal that cells and genes are patentable.''
 Monsanto also welcomed the decision, saying in a news release that it ''has set a world standard in intellectual property protection.''
 While Canadian court decisions have no direct bearing on American law, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, said that the Canadian judgment could nonetheless have an impact on similar claims by Monsanto against American farmers. 
 Almost 100 such cases have so far gone to trial in the United States, and farmers have paid penalties averaging $100,000 each to Monsanto. Mr. Kimbrell said if American courts followed the Canadian court's example in not requiring Mr. Schmeiser to repay his profits, it might reduce the economic incentive for Monsanto to pursue other farmers.
 The case involving Mr. Schmeiser, who is 73, had become a rallying point for critics of genetically modified plants. ''He touched upon a long-standing issue that is not resolved globally,'' said Thomas Redick, a partner at Gallop Johnson and Neuman, a law firm in St. Louis. 
 In 1997, while spraying around power poles and ditches with Monsanto's Roundup herbicide near a three-acre canola field, Mr. Schmeiser noticed that some canola plants were unaffected by the weed killer. He then sprayed the entire field, and discovered that most of the plants were unfazed.
 After he harvested that year's canola crop, Mr. Schmeiser stored a sizable quantify of seed from the Roundup-resistant plot, which he used as part of his planting the following year of 1,000 acres of canola.
 A Monsanto investigator had taken samples in 1997 from canola plants growing along a road next to one of Mr. Schmeiser's fields. Testing revealed that the herbicide-resistant plants were Monsanto's genetically modified canola, known as Roundup Ready, which is specifically designed to resist Roundup herbicide. The company confronted Mr. Schmeiser in March 1998, warning him that planting the Roundup-resistant seeds he had saved would infringe the company's patent rights. He planted them anyway. 
 Mr. Schmeiser has surmised that the genetically modified seed either blew onto his property from neighboring farms or fell off passing trucks. Monsanto acknowledged that Mr Schmeiser had never placed an order for Roundup Ready canola.
 The company nevertheless contended that no matter how Mr. Schmeiser obtained the Roundup Ready product, he should have signed a ''technology use agreement'' and paid the regular licensing fee of 15 Canadian dollars an acre. Under the licensing agreement, farmers are not allowed to save any seed for replanting and must buy new seed each year from Monsanto. 
 In Friday's judgment, which upholds rulings by two lower courts, the Supreme Court concluded by a 5-to-4 margin that Mr. Schmeiser had ''actively cultivated'' Roundup Ready canola as part of his business, thereby infringing Monsanto's patent. 
 ''We emphasize that we are not concerned here with the innocent discovery by farmers of 'blow-by' patented plants on their land or in their cultivated fields,'' the judges wrote. 
 Nor, they said, were they concerned with the scope of Monsanto's patent or ''the wisdom and social utility of the genetic modification of genes and cells.''
 ''The patented genes and cells are not merely a 'part' of the plant,'' the court said. ''Rather, the patented genes are present throughout the genetically modified plant and the patented cells compose its entire physical structure.'' 
 Under Friday's ruling, Mr. Schmeiser is barred from using Roundup Ready canola unless he pays Monsanto's license fee. He must also hand over to the company any Roundup Ready seed still in his possession.
 Nevertheless, the court set aside the lower courts' decision that Mr. Schmeiser owed Monsanto 19,800 Canadian dollars in profits. The Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Schmeiser had earned the same profit from the Monsanto product as he would have from ordinary canola. It also overruled the lower courts' decision that Mr. Schmeiser was responsible for Monsanto's legal costs.
 Farmers and environmental groups, among others, have mounted campaigns in several parts of the world against patents on genetically modified products, on the grounds that no commercial enterprise has sole rights to a living organism.
 A court in southeastern France fined three people 600 euros ($722) each on Friday for destroying Monsanto test fields of genetically modified crops and awarded the company 4,000 euros in compensation for the damage. Similar charges have been brought in 11 other cases in France in the last six years.

HEADLINE: Arab Meeting Expected to Produce Mostly Criticism of U.S.

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: TUNIS, May 21 

 BODY:
Arab leaders gathering for a summit meeting on Saturday and Sunday in this North African capital are expected to issue a collective criticism of the United States for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and what they view as the anemic American effort toward ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
 They probably will also issue a joint statement favoring domestic political reform that political activists and other analysts call far too diluted. Wrangling over wording acceptable to league members forced a two-month delay in the meeting.
 The Bush administration had hoped that this summit meeting would showcase a greater political openness in the Arab world stemming from the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Instead, it appears likely that it will highlight how spiraling violence in Iraq, as well as in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, is hobbling attempts to reshape the region. 
 ''It will be difficult for America to promote democratic change, given the great failure in Iraq,'' said Wahid Abdel Maguid, an Egyptian political analyst at Al Ahram Center for Strategic Studies. ''The model doesn't exist, plus the U.S. doesn't have the moral credibility that it used to have to impose its will on other countries.'' 
 A draft version of the final communique sharply censures the United States for the mistreatment of Iraqi inmates at Abu Ghraib prison and elsewhere. 
 ''The Arab leaders strongly condemn the inhumane and immoral crimes and practices committed by the occupation forces against the Iraqi detainees in the prisons and demand that the perpetrators of these crimes be tried,'' the draft document reads in part. It also calls for an effective United Nations role in ending the occupation of Iraq.
 The draft criticizes President Bush's recent statements supporting Israel's permanent control over some Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and rejecting Palestinian refugees' ''right of return'' to what is now Israel. 
 The document suggests that the Bush administration should be working on carrying out the president's vision of a Palestinian state rather than undermining negotiating positions needed to solve such problems. It also condemns the recent Israeli incursion into the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, which has claimed about 40 Palestinian lives. 
 On the issue of political reform, it suggests that the Arab leaders will commit themselves to the general idea, saying they are ''determined to continue the steps toward comprehensive reform already started.'' 
 Some Arab officials call that commitment a historic achievement. 
 ''This is the first time this is being considered by the Arab League, and it is a good start,'' said Hossam Zaki, the spokesman for the league, noting the difficulty in getting 22 different nations to agree on any such fundamental change. ''These issues are extremely critical and delicate.''
 The fight over the reform wording, among other issues, provoked tensions in March that prompted the Tunisian president to postpone the meeting. The tension started in the winter, when the Bush administration made known that it would introduce its own blueprint for Arab reform at the meeting of eight leading industrialized nations in June. 
 The Arabs balked at the idea of reform plans being imposed on them and scrambled to come up with their own outline before June. Some of the smaller countries, including Tunisia, Jordan and Bahrain, pushed for more specific language than larger Arab nations like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. 
 The working document is a compromise, but Arab press reports were predicting further tension because the smaller countries have been invited to take part in the Group of Eight meeting while the larger ones have not. 
 Political experts said the proposals had been watered down to the point that they were open to wide interpretation. The draft document, for example, calls for ''responsible freedom of expression'' rather than outright freedom of speech, giving despotic governments plenty of leeway to crush anything they deem irresponsible. 
 Three of Tunisia's tiny opposition parties issued a statement calling on the Arab League to bolster its reform agenda by issuing a specific timetable and a mechanism for carrying it out. 
 The statement included a long list of specific measures. On freedom of speech, for example, it called for Arab League members to commit themselves to steps like freeing up the licenses and distribution of newspapers, ending state monopolies on radio and television and ending controls over the Internet. 
 But even the authors of the petition conceded that the Arab public in general was paying far more attention to the violence in Iraq and the Palestinian territories than to reform in their own countries. 
 ''It would be a discussion without any credibility if they talk about reform while people in Iraq and in Palestine are living under occupation and being tortured,'' said Rashid Khashana, a Tunisian political activist and journalist.
 Indeed, the problem of the Arab League, especially in recent years, is that the general public views it as all talk and no action. Much of the drama in recent decades has been caused by spats among individual countries. 
 Last year, when they were supposed to be finding a way to prevent the American invasion of Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, got into a argument over which of them was the greater lackey of the West.
 This year, the crown prince is staying away, along with the leaders of all the Persian Gulf states except Qatar, the presidents of Yemen and Sudan and the interim leader of Iraq. 
 Some Tunisians said they would like the meeting to issue a statement supporting the Iraqi resistance to the American-led occupation, but they do not expect that to happen. In fact, they do not expect much. 
 ''They provide no real solutions, and even if they did, nobody is committed to these resolutions and no one can impose it on the others,'' said Asma Allam, a 24-year-old economics student walking along one of Tunis's leafy main avenues. ''So what is the point?''

Witness in Stewart Trial Charged With Perjury
The case against Martha Stewart took a strange new twist when the government charged an important witness with lying repeatedly at trial. Larry F. Stewart, the laboratory director for the Secret Service who served as the prosecutors' expert on ink, was charged with two counts of perjury, essentially for exaggerating his role in analyzing the ink on critical documents used as evidence at the trial and for lying about his knowledge of a a technical book his lab colleagues were writing.
 While lawyers said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Stewart's statements, if indeed false, would result in a successful appeal, the perjury charges offer fresh and potent ammunition to lawyers for Ms. Stewart. [Page. A1.]

Texas Oilman in Deal With Enron
Oscar S. Wyatt, left, the Texas oilman known for his dealings with Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein, is back in the energy business. Mr. Wyatt and a group of investors agreed to buy Enron's natural-gas pipelines in North America for $2.2 billion. Mr. Wyatt, 79, is part of a group called NuCoastal -- which includes Citigroup, Arclight Capital Partners and Kelso & Company. The deal would give Mr. Wyatt and his partners control over CrossCountry Energy, an Enron operation with 1,100 employees and 9,900 miles of pipelines. [C14.]

Disney Directors Meet With Funds

Google, the search-engine provider, amended its $2.718 billion initial public offering, adding 29 underwriters and revising some of the financial information in its filing. [C14.]

AOL Described as 'Stabilizing'
America Online is ''stabilizing'' after losing subscribers for six consecutive quarters, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of its parent, Time Warner, said at the company's annual meeting. Mr. Parsons reiterated that Time Warner might make a bid for Adelphia Communications, the cable company. [C4.]

Stocks Edge Up as Oil Prices Ease
Stocks rose after a call by Saudi Arabia for higher oil production drove oil prices below $40 a barrel, easing worries that soaring energy costs could derail the recovering economy. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,966.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.37 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,093.56. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 15.50 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,912.09. [C4.]

No Political Rebound With Jobs
Despite a big rebound in hiring over the last several months, President Bush has been unable to translate the economic improvement into political benefit, leaving Republicans increasingly anxious that the White House might let slip away its best chance to counter the bad news from Iraq. [A1.]

HEADLINE: Bush Visits Louisiana, With Democrats Ready

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., May 21 

 BODY:
President Bush paid a visit Friday to Louisiana, which has been a political stronghold of his but where Democrats are moving aggressively to put him on the defensive with a torrent of campaign advertisements.
 Mr. Bush began his trip with a commencement speech before a cheering crowd of Louisiana State University graduates, telling them, even as new details surfaced about American soldiers' abuse of Iraqi prisoners, that he remained committed to bringing democracy to Iraq. The United States ''will complete the mission'' there, he said. 
 ''We have a historic opportunity: the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Iraq in the heart of the Middle East,'' the president said, ''which will remove a danger, strike a blow against terrorists and make America more secure.''
 Mr. Bush delivered his address, of roughly 17 minutes, in a packed arena before traveling to a suburb of New Orleans to speak to Republican donors at the home of a supporter, Edward Ludwig III, a builder. The donors paid $2,000 a person to attend a stand-up reception, or $25,000 a couple for a sit-down luncheon, at Mr. Ludwig's home, a stucco house in the style of a small French chateau. Bush aides said the events together brought in about $2 million.
 Until now, Mr. Bush and his advisers have not seemed very concerned about Louisiana, where he defeated Al Gore by 7.9 percentage points in the 2000 presidential election and where polls show him with a comfortable lead over Senator John Kerry.
 But in a measure of how tight and volatile the presidential election campaign has become, Democrats now believe they have a shot at winning the state, whose unemployment rate during the Bush administration they describe as dismal. Louisiana's jobless rate in April was 5.9 percent, higher than the national average, of 5.6, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 The Kerry campaign has made Louisiana one of 19 states that are the targets of a $25 million television advertising blitz. Phil Singer, a Kerry spokesman, said the advertisements had been running in major Louisiana markets since May 4. In addition, Mr. Kerry has visited the state three times since March.
 ''People in Louisiana have the same kitchen-table concern as people in other parts of the country,'' Mr. Singer said. ''And they know George Bush has not delivered.''
 Though voters here tend to lean conservative, for Democrats the state is not entirely enemy territory. The governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, and both the state's senators -- John B. Breaux and Mary L. Landrieu -- are Democratic.
 At Friday's commencement, Mr. Bush told some 3,200 graduating students and the rest of a huge crowd at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center that the United States would do ''whatever it takes'' to bring stability to Iraq.
 ''We will never abandon our belief that freedom is the gift of the Almighty to every man and woman,'' said Mr. Bush, who was given an honorary doctorate and praised by university officials for leading the nation at ''one of the most perilous times in its history.''
 The president and Laura Bush are not attending the commencements of their own daughters, Jenna and Barbara; the White House has said the couple do not want to subject other families to the disruption of a presidential visit. But the first family plans a small gathering in Austin on Saturday for Jenna, graduating from the University of Texas, and another in New Haven on Sunday for Barbara, graduating from Yale.

HEADLINE: Economic Signs Point Up; Bush's Ratings Do Not

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Despite a big rebound in hiring in the last few months, President Bush has been unable to translate the economic improvement into political benefit, leaving Republicans increasingly anxious that the White House might let slip away its best chance to counter the bad news from Iraq.
 The creation of nearly 900,000 new jobs in the last four months -- a development that might otherwise have redefined the race in Mr. Bush's favor -- has been largely crowded out of the electorate's psyche by images from Iraq of the abuse of prisoners and the deaths of American troops, said Republican elected officials, pollsters and strategists.
 ''The economy is firing on all cylinders, the growth is incredible, and it's completely overshadowed by Iraq,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. 
 The Labor Department released figures yesterday showing that the unemployment rate fell in April in 11 of the 18 states most hotly contested by Mr. Bush and his probable Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. The rate rose in 4 of the 18 states, including Ohio, perhaps the most pivotal of this year's swing states. 
 But even as the statistics give the administration more opportunities to assert that Mr. Bush's tax cuts have stimulated the economy, some Republicans said the White House's decision so far not to put forward any big new economic ideas had made it harder for the president and his party to capture public attention and convince voters that Mr. Bush is deeply engaged in the pocketbook issues of most concern to them.
 ''The reason the White House is on the defensive right now is that they haven't put forward an active agenda that's based on an overview of what the economy's status is and what needs to be done to take it to a higher level,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research organization.
 Some Republicans said they would like to see a greater emphasis on economic gains in the Bush campaign's advertising. But they said that although the big-picture statistics look good now, the potential political payoff could be blunted by several factors, including a probable rise in interest rates and the sharp increase in gasoline prices.
 Americans ''get impressions on Iraq, they're not sure the economy is doing as well as it should, yet,'' said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi. ''But they pull up to that pump every week, and it's not costing 20 bucks now to fill up, it's costing 40. And they don't like that. And I think the president, if I could talk to him, I'd say, 'Mr. President, address this issue. At least jawbone it, and do it in multiple ways.' ''
 Republicans also said they were concerned that the administration was not more assertive in addressing the issue that Democrats have put at the center of their arguments -- that many middle-class families have become worse off in recent years because of the rising costs of health care and health insurance.
 With employment beginning to rebound, Mr. Ryan said, the focus among voters in his Wisconsin district is shifting to the price of gas and health care, areas in which House Republicans have been waiting for a more aggressive message from the White House. 
 ''Until they take charge of packaging our agenda on health care and energy, it won't get out and it's not getting out,'' Mr. Ryan said. 
 Officials at the White House and in Mr. Bush's campaign said they were confident that the good economic news would eventually get through to voters. This week they sent cabinet secretaries around the country to talk up economic progress, and today Mr. Bush will address the issue in his weekly radio address.
 Some Republicans have expressed qualms that the White House is spending too much time and money attacking Mr. Kerry and not enough promoting Mr. Bush's success in nursing the economy back to health.
 The president does talk in nearly every campaign appearance about progress in the economy, but he also speaks about how more needs to be done to return to prosperity. His campaign has always said that the war on terrorism and the economy would be the two defining issues of the election.
 Although Mr. Bush's job-approval ratings are sinking and polls show that more people feel the nation is heading in the wrong direction, his advisers said the president was not worried because he was convinced that the good news would sink in over time.
 Moreover, they said, Mr. Bush's standing with the electorate regarding the economy remains fundamentally sound, especially in comparison with Mr. Kerry.
 ''As the situation improves in Iraq and as the public focuses on the economic situation, you're likely to see improved numbers from a polling perspective,'' said Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's campaign manager. ''Most Americans are unlikely to believe that John Kerry's proposals for new spending and billions in higher taxes will be good for the economy.''
 The latest numbers on job creation, Mr. Mehlman said, ''are evidence that the president's policies are working and that the country is on the right track.'' 
 Democrats said Mr. Bush is playing a far weaker hand on the economy than the job-growth figures would suggest. They said that stagnant wages for many workers, rising health care and college tuition costs, the loss of jobs to other countries and other factors have left many middle class families squeezed and concerned about the effect of the federal budget deficit on the economy and the government's ability to pay for domestic programs.
 ''As Bush tries to talk about things being O.K., people are going to think he's on his mission to Mars,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois.
 Many Republicans said Mr. Bush still has plenty of time to capitalize on the improving economy. But they expressed concern that it will get harder for Mr. Bush to reverse his slide in the polls if the White House does not stabilize Iraq or develop a more compelling message about the success of its economic policies.
 Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a Republican, said that in his state, which has been hit hard by foreign competition, the positive economic statistics did not mean much to voters and that the administration has little opportunity to make its case that Mr. Bush's tax cuts are paying off.
 ''If the six o'clock news is largely constructed around what's going on in Iraq or with the prison abuse or some other component of foreign policy, well, it's tough to get any political message across,'' Mr. Sanford said. ''Whether they can pivot from this issue remains to be seen.''
 Bruce Bartlett, a conservative commentator, said the administration's insistence on sticking with the same policy prescriptions it drew up for the campaign four years ago, often in the face of Congressional opposition and changing circumstances, has led voters to tune out the White House's message.
 ''They just come across as Pollyannas and cheerleaders,'' Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bush and his team. ''The economy is in good shape and will get better as time goes by. The problem is that the administration's message has been the same since Day 1. If they had been more open about the economy a year or two ago, when things clearly weren't as good, they'd have more credibility today.''
 Faced with the likelihood that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will raise rates starting next month, some Republicans said that it would help pound home the message that the economy is again roaring along at the growth rates it enjoyed during the boom of the 1990's.
 There are clearly risks to Mr. Bush from rising rates, both from households that have built up heavy levels of debt and from Wall Street. The markets appear to analysts to be well prepared for the Fed to begin pushing up rates, and stock prices have often risen after the initial stages of rising interest rate cycles.
 But if the Fed action further unsettles the already jittery stock and bond markets, as some analysts fear it could, Mr. Bush's standing could suffer among the large slice of the electorate that pours much of its savings into retirement investment accounts.
 The Fed's possible role in this election has echoes of 1992, when the administration of the Mr. Bush's father grew resentful of and eventually angry at Mr. Greenspan for not doing more to address the tepid recovery, which is widely considered to have opened the door to Bill Clinton's election.
 But unlike the first Bush administration, which cut off Mr. Greenspan's regular meetings with its Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, this one has avoided any overt clashes. On Monday, Mr. Bush made good on his promise to appoint Mr. Greenspan to a fifth four-year term as chairman despite waiting until nearly the last minute to do so.

HEADLINE: Europe Backs Russian Entry Into W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND; Elizabeth Becker in Washington and Andrew C. Revkin in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 21 

 BODY:
Russia, with the last big economy outside the World Trade Organization, won support for membership in the group from the European Union on Friday and subsequently said it would support the environmental treaty on emissions known as the Kyoto Protocol. 
 Russia signed a trade deal with officials representing the 25-nation European Union, Russia's biggest trading partner. The deal, after six years of negotiations, is a political victory for President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia's last remaining major hurdle to joining the 147-trade body is an agreement with the United States. 
 Membership in the trade organization has been part of Mr. Putin's plan to integrate Russia into the global economy and promote growth at home. He has promised to double Russia's economy within the decade, a pledge that helped him win a second term last March.
 ''Russia must be a member of the W.T.O. and we are striving toward that on conditions acceptable to us,'' Mr. Putin said on Friday. The reversal on Kyoto -- coming just six months after Moscow said it would reject the treaty -- was the key to striking Friday's deal, analysts said. 
 ''Russia clearly traded its support for Kyoto in exchange for some concessions on W.T.O. entry terms,'' said Christopher Weafer, chief equity strategist with Alfa Bank in Moscow.
 The Bush administration welcomed the news that Russia and the European Union had reached an agreement on Russia's entry into the W.T.O. but cautioned against concluding that Russia would sign the Kyoto Protocol as part of the bargain.
 ''We have not been informed of any such decision,'' said Sean McCormick, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
 The protocol, which was completed at a 1997 United Nations conference in Kyoto, Japan, would require the leading industrialized countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses. 
 Kyoto takes effect only when it has been ratified by enough nations to account for 55 percent of 1990 emissions. So far, countries that account for 44 percent of total emissions have ratified the treaty. 
 With the withdrawal of the United States in 2001, the pact has depended on support from Russia, which has a 17 percent share of total emissions. In December, however, Moscow declared that it would not ratify the treaty, saying it ran counter to Russia's national interests.
 On Friday, Mr. Putin said he now favored moving toward ratification of the Kyoto pact after years of delay and indecision.
 ''We are for the Kyoto process and we support it,'' Mr. Putin told a news conference after the signing the trade deal with the European Union. ''We will speed up the movement on Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.'' 
 The support was welcomed by environmental advocates. ''It's great that Russia is beginning to see that participation in W.T.O. and Kyoto Protocol markets can work synergistically to provide economic and environmental benefits,'' said Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.
 If the Russian Parliament, or Duma, were to take up the Kyoto Protocol and ratify it in the next few months, she said, ''it is possible that the Kyoto Protocol could enter into force in early 2005.''
 Moscow's support for Kyoto may have helped seal the agreement with the European Union, but such a position will not help Russia in trade talks with the United States. Washington wants Russia to open up its markets quickly and allow competition from American banking and insurance companies, which are largely barred from doing business here.
 The United States also wants agreements with Russia that will give American oil companies access to potential new energy sources in Russia's lightly explored East Siberia, Far East and Arctic regions.
 Last week, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, met with his Russian counterpart in Paris for three hours.
 A spokesman for Mr. Zoellick, Richard Mills, said that progress was being made but that the negotiations had been ''on again, off again from the Russian side.''
 ''Different countries have different priorities,'' said Mr. Mills, referring to Europe's request that Russia support the Kyoto Protocol. 
 Mr. Putin's ambition has been to gain W.T.O. membership by the end of the year, although it could be several years before Russia comes in line with all the regulations necessary for membership.
 Still, Friday's agreement shows how important Europe is to Russia's economy. The European Union added 10 new nations this month, and the share of Russia's trade with the bloc jumped as a result to more than 50 percent, up from 35 to 36 percent. Total trade in goods between the enlarged European Union and Russia amounted to about 92 billion euros, or $110 billion, last year, according to Bloomberg News. 
 For Europe, the most important element of the agreement was Russia's pledge to raise domestic energy prices slowly, more in line with energy prices Russia charges for export. Europe has long argued that Russia's cheap domestic fuel artificially buoys Russian industry and amounts to a hidden subsidy.
 But the deal does not require Russia to increase the domestic gas price as fast as Brussels had previously requested. Gazprom supplies a quarter of Europe's gas.
 Natural gas fees charged to Russian customers will be gradually increased to $37 to $42 by 2006, up from the current $27 to $28 per thousand cubic meters of natural gas.
 The agreement will also change the fees Russia charges to European Union airlines flying over Siberia, as well as setting limits on fishery products and farm goods tariffs.
 ''This is a definite victory for Russia, it's a big diplomatic and practical victory,'' said Stefan Vassilev, the United Nations resident coordinator in the Russian Federation. ''It's not only symbolic but a practical victory.''

HEADLINE: Rating on California Bonds Is Raised by One Agency

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 21 

 BODY:
A Wall Street rating company upgraded California's dismal credit rating for the first time in nearly four years Friday, reflecting a modest economic rebound and, under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the prospect of an end to years of political stagnation in Sacramento.
 The company, Moody's Investors Service, bumped the state's rating up one notch, to A3, still the lowest of any state's and one grade below New York's. Among the chief reasons for the move, the agency cited improved job creation and higher-than-expected receipts from the personal income tax .
 Tim Blake, chief California analyst for Moody's, also said that the state's political climate had improved markedly under Governor Schwarzenegger and that the worst of the state's fiscal crisis appeared to have passed, at least for now. 
 ''California is now back to the rating that it had when Schwarzenegger came into office,'' Mr. Blake said, noting that the agency downgraded the state's rating in December. ''The outlook is positive for the first time in several years.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, using his favorite adjective, proclaimed the Moody's announcement ''fantastic news.''
 ''Their financial analysts have had a chance to carefully review our revised budget and our economic outlook, and they've concluded that it warrants an improvement in California's standing in the nation's financial markets,'' the governor said in a statement. ''I appreciate their strong vote of confidence in the new direction that we're taking California.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger has made improving the state's business and investment climate his highest priority, and the rating change is a significant step toward that goal. He has used a potent combination of celebrity, cajolery and naked threats to intimidate lawmakers and interest groups into going along with his policies.
 He pushed through a ballot initiative in March that authorized borrowing $15 billion to address an acute cash crisis and to patch a longer-term hole in the state's $103 billion annual budget. Voters approved the measure overwhelmingly, along with a companion bill to outlaw such borrowing in the future.
 Over the last several weeks, the governor has also negotiated budget deals with crucial constituent groups -- K-12 schools, state colleges and universities, local governments -- that trade short-term spending cuts for longer-term increases.
 Further, he has prodded the Legislature to enact a revision to the state's costly and inefficient workers' compensation program and is demanding that lawmakers pass a budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 by the statutory deadline of June 15; the Legislature has missed the deadline in 17 of the last 25 years.
 The governor used the credit rating announcement on Friday to remind the Legislature of its duty to pass a budget by mid-June. Moody's is ''staking this vote of confidence on our ability to approve this budget,'' he said of his budget proposal, and added, ''We should now return the favor by doing the right thing, and that is for the Legislature to get this balanced and responsible budget passed on time.''
 The two other chief credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, have left California's bond ratings unchanged, at BBB, just two grades above junk status. Standard & Poor's said last week, however, that it was viewing economic and budgetary conditions in California favorably and would review the low rating after the state enacts its budget for the coming fiscal year.
 The Moody's announcement on Friday affects nearly $44 billion in outstanding debt issued by California and should over time lower the state's borrowing costs. It said that California had added an average of 100,000 jobs a month this year and that its personal income growth was outpacing the national average.
 The company said California still faced huge budgetary challenges, noting that even if Mr. Schwarzenegger's budget passed more or less unchanged, he would face a shortfall of $6 billion to $8 billion next year and for several years thereafter.
 ''The budget's structural imbalance situation represents a significant ongoing fiscal challenge for California, and is a primary reason for the still quite low bond rating relative to other states,'' Moody's said. However, it said, the new borrowing and the deals with schools and local governments have given the state financial breathing room for at least the next 18 months to address those long-range problems.
 Timothy A. Hodson, director of the Center for California Studies, at California State University, Sacramento, said that the upgrade was in part a reflection of national economic trends over which no governor has any control. But he also said the financial markets were beginning to reward Mr. Schwarzenegger's muscular brand of political leadership.
 ''You'd have to be the proverbial blind man,'' Dr. Hodson said, ''not to recognize that Arnold Schwarzenegger has brought an impressive level of enthusiasm and proactive governance to California, and that has resonated among Californians and obviously has resonated on Wall Street.''
 Dr. Hodson said Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared to be following a strategy of dealing with acute problems immediately and putting off addressing the state's longer-range budget problems until next year. That strategy works, he noted, when the economy is growing, but can create more severe problems if another recession hits.
 ''Of course he understands there's a bill coming due in two or three years because of these deals,'' Dr. Hodson said. ''But his view is, 'I'll take care of the alligators now and worry about draining the swamp next year.'''

HEADLINE: In India's Spotlight, He Was Both Director and Audience

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 21 

 BODY:
As members of his Hindu nationalist party mounted vehement attacks on Sonia Gandhi's Italian origins earlier this week, and as his cabinet pledged to boycott her expected inauguration as India's new leader, the departing prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said not a public word. 
 Did his silence signify disapproval of his party's flouting of democratic protocol? Or approval? It was unclear, but the result was that the campaign against Mrs. Gandhi proceeded unchecked. 
 On Tuesday, Mrs. Gandhi, whose Indian National Congress had dealt Mr. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party a surprise election defeat last week, said she would not take over as prime minister, in part because her foreign roots threatened to become so divisive. Instead, a former finance minister in her party, Manmohan Singh, will be sworn in this weekend. 
 That Mr. Vajpayee's final gesture in office should be one of convenient passivity speaks much to the legacy of his rule.
 In the six years that he led the country, some of the fundamental traits that had defined India for decades shifted. On some of those shifts, Mr. Vajpayee, a 79-year-old poet whose political career spans a half-century, clearly set the course. On others, he opted for an inaction that proved its own form of course-setting.
 That combination may put him in the history books as one of India's more formative leaders, but also one of its more inscrutable.
 During his administration, India became a declared nuclear power and emerged as an economic power as well, firmly embracing globalization and the market. Nonalignment gave way to a new closeness to the United States, and Mr. Vajpayee made fresh peace moves toward China and Pakistan.
 He pushed grand infrastructure projects, like a national highway system, but largely neglected social programs like education and health. His government demonstrated that a coalition government could be as stable as the Congress party monolith that governed India for most of its history.
 But his Hindu nationalist party also used the state machinery to undermine India's secular identity, which guarantees equal rights both to the country's Hindu majority and to Christians, Muslims and other minority groups. 
 The Congress party assuming power for the first time since 1996 will find ''the India that they left is not the India they have inherited,'' said Ashley J. Tellis, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''It is very different in many ways -- some for the better and some for the worse.''
 If, as some have argued, Mr. Vajpayee was a visionary, of what sort? Was he like Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister, who actively defined many of the ideas challenged in the past six years? Or more like Ronald Reagan, who set a broad ideological course but largely left the details to others? 
 Many of the initiatives Mr. Vajpayee is given credit for, whether in foreign or economic policy, began under previous Congress governments. But Mr. Vajpayee in some cases effectively used his party's orientation to advance those policies, and in others used his political talents to overcome the resistance of the Hindu nationalists in or allied to his party. 
 Within days after taking office in May 1998, he ordered a series of nuclear tests that changed India's relation to the world. 
 Matching tests soon followed from its neighbor and enemy Pakistan, causing some critics to say India had lost its conventional military advantage to nuclear parity.
 But C. Raja Mohan, a professor of South Asian studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, argued that the tests allowed India to shake off its ''inferiority complex'' and deal with China and the United States in a different way. 
 ''There was a sense of confidence with which he could engage the whole world,'' he said. 
 Last June, Mr. Vajpayee visited China and set in motion a new process to resolve the two countries' border dispute. This January, he did the same with Pakistan, in his third and most fruitful effort to make peace with India's neighbor. 
 Mr. Mohan said the party's worldview -- ''anti-Communist in a Western sense'' and unencumbered by the anti-imperialism that so shaped the Congress party -- made it easier for it to forge a new relationship with the West. 
 ''These guys were not burdened by the need to rhetorically argue with the United States,'' he said.
 And after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the two countries found more common ground in fighting Islamic extremism.
 As for the economy, Shekhar Gupta, editor in chief of The Indian Express, said Mr. Vajpayee was not enamored of socialism, as many of his predecessors had been. He brought ''less an intellectual understanding of economic reform than an instinctive appreciation for enterprise,'' Mr. Gupta said. 
 Mr. Gupta said he wished Mr. Vajpayee had sometimes pushed harder, both against his party's hard-liners and for economic reforms, some of which were delayed or halted because of political opposition. 
 Where Mr. Vajpayee went wrong, Mr. Gupta said, was in not standing his ground. Despite projecting himself as a moderate, he largely bowed to his party's Hindu nationalist agenda. 
 This was evident in his handling of the Gujarat riots in 2002, when rioters avenged the burning to death of 59 Hindus in a train carriage by killing at least 1,000 Muslims. While aides described Mr. Vajpayee as personally opposed to retaining the Gujarat chief minister who let the riots continue unchecked, he gave in to his party's pressures and allowed the chief minister to stay in office. When the Gujarat State government failed to prosecute Hindus for the riots, it was the Supreme Court -- not Mr. Vajpayee's government -- that intervened.
 Mr. Vajpayee also entrusted the education portfolio to a Hindu nationalist, Murli Manohar Joshi, who over six years set about rewriting textbooks and packing academic bodies with fellow ideologues whose aim was to uncritically glorify the ancient Hindus at the expense of other groups in India. 
 Yet on issues of more basic education, there is little to show. ''I think they did very little certainly for rural areas,'' Jean Dreze, an economist, said. ''Social sectors really weren't their focus.''
 One of Mr. Vajpayee's chief aides, Sudheendra Kulkarni, argued that it was unfair to expect the B.J.P. government to do in a half-dozen years what Congress could not do in almost a half-century. ''We really had a very short time,'' Mr. Kulkarni said. 
 But for Indian politics, new to coalitions, those six years were a long time, and may stand among Mr. Vajpayee's great achievements. ''He demonstrated you could have stable coalition governments that could complete full terms in office,'' Mr. Tellis said. ''This was very important for the maturation of India as a democracy.''

HEADLINE: Weakening the Rules for Judges

 BODY:
The special commission weighing revisions to the American Bar Association's code of judicial conduct seems to have missed the lesson of Justice Antonin Scalia's notorious duck-hunting trip with Vice President Dick Cheney: Americans don't appreciate it when judges behave in ways that undermine the judicial system's fairness and integrity.
 The bar panel's newly unveiled proposals for revamping the Model Code of Judicial Conduct would actually weaken the core provision that requires judges to avoid not just actual impropriety in all their activities, but also the appearance of impropriety. Although the new version retains the appearance standard, it waters it down by saying that violations will not ''ordinarily'' lead to professional discipline unless there are charges of other rule violations. Intentionally or not, as Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont aptly noted last week in a letter to the bar association's president, Dennis Archer, that transforms a crucial ethical mandate into ''an ancillary add-on'' and significantly diminishes its moral force and deterrence value. 
 The proposed change was apparently driven largely by an overblown concern about the ''vagueness'' of the appearance-of-impropriety standard. Judges interpret similar terms every day, and there now exists a substantial body of case law and ethics opinions construing the type of behavior that gives rise to an appearance of impropriety. The proper way to address any undue murkiness, in any event, is for the commission to provide further guidance, not to dilute expectations.
 In another disappointment, the commission's proposal failed to tighten the rules on disqualification to match the stronger and more clear-cut requirements for the federal judiciary. A federal judge is barred from sitting in a case involving a company in which the judge has any economic interest. A provision of the bar's current code, retained in the new proposal, requires disqualification only when a judge deems that the economic interest is more than ''de minimis,'' and ''could be substantially affected.'' 
 Even more baffling, the commission has deleted the current instruction to judges to resolve any ambiguity in the Code of Conduct in a way that advances public trust in the judiciary's ''integrity, independence and impartiality.'' Practically and symbolically, that deletion is a real mistake.
 Mark Harrison, the Arizona lawyer who leads the commission, stresses that the draft is tentative and partial. Plainly, other critical issues still loom -- not least of which is the festering scandal of the well-attended, expense-paid judicial seminars that are held at nice resorts and underwritten by private interests bent on influencing judicial decisions. The commission still has time to do the right thing, but its proposals so far are not very reassuring.

HEADLINE: The Bus Stops Here (and, Often, at the Pump)

BYLINE: By LEONARD M. APCAR

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE neighborhood association met recently to discuss the usual complexities of suburban life, like trash pickups and leaf collection, and inevitably the talk got around to dropoffs and pickups at the elementary school.
 The narrow old streets around the school have become crowded and potentially dangerous. It can be frightening to behold mothers one-handing their sport utilities while clutching their cellphones -- illegally, in New York State -- especially when you consider their less than ideal vision to the rear and sides of their rigs.
 This makes it all too easy to miss seeing a first-grader who has stepped off the curb, looking for a ride home. (Hardly any children walk to or from school these days, not when they can be chauffeured in fancy trucks with leather seats, DVD players and four-wheel drive.) 
 Big sport utilities have their place, but when a 2004 Nissan Armada test truck arrived in my narrow driveway, it seemed out of area. While the hulking Armada may be at home on lonely West Texas highways, it seems grossly oversized for car pooling in Westchester County.
 Derived from the Nissan Titan pickup, the Armada is longer than any sport utility save the Chevrolet Suburban (a foot longer) or the Ford Excursion (20 inches longer).
 That makes for a very big S.U.V., a first for Nissan. The Armada has more than 10 inches of ground clearance in four-wheel-drive trim, so a first-grader may have to pull himself up and over the running boards. And while a mom at the wheel has heaven-high visibility, there are still those blind spots. At least the Armada's more expensive relative, the Infiniti QX56, can be ordered with a video monitor that lets you know Johnny has dashed behind the truck.
 I took the Armada to a meeting at the high school, where I had to wrestle it into a parking space. (I succeeded on the third attempt). Around town, the truck's sheer scale and bulky design made me feel as if I were steering the Incredible Hulk.
 The Armada's Paul Bunyan looks, which are presumably a big part of the appeal of the $36,000-plus package, had me scratching my head. Nissan has, of late, had one of the hottest design studios in the business, with a fresh eye for making cars and crossover wagons look different and desirable. 
 A few Nissan family traits are stamped on the Armada: the swooping curve over the side windows; the large, intricate headlamps and taillights; and the thickly drawn sheet metal with pronounced curves and bulges. Like the Titan, the Armada has a bold front end that you won't soon forget. 
 Still, it gives you a jolt to see these strokes on a canvas so large. Had the artists behind the saucy Murano, the organic Altima or the fluid Maxima signed off on this? I never warmed to the Armada's styling, or that of the QX56 that I drove later around Southern California. [Review, Page 4.] 
 I much prefer the somewhat more compact -- though still large --Dodge Durango, which was restyled this year. But I encountered plenty of others who liked the Armada/Infiniti duo, especially the trucks' grandiose proportions and he-manliness.
 With record gasoline prices and sales of big S.U.V.'s declining, at least temporarily, this might not be the best time to introduce a pair of heavy, thirsty trucks that flaunt their bulk. Of course, development of the Armada and QX56 began several years ago, when the world was a different place and a lot of truck buyers were not at all concerned about an economy rating of 13 m.p.g. in town and 18 on the highway. (My actual mileage, in combined city-highway use, was 14.) Filling the 28-gallon tank -- regular grade will do -- can cost $60.
 So far, the Armada is not sailing out of showrooms, with dealer inventories at a 118-day supply, about twice the desirable level. Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, a consulting firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said that with Nissan's competitors, especially General Motors, offering huge sales incentives, it was difficult to squeeze into the market. ''I don't think the Armada brings all that much to the table that is all that unique,'' he said.
 Still, there is plenty to like. It seats seven or eight in three rows, depending on whether you get captain chairs or a bench in the middle row. The long wheelbase provides exceptional room, especially for legs in the second row. But it can be hard to reach into the waist-high cargo floor.
 On a wet dirt road in the Hamptons, the Armada easily rolled through sand, gravel and puddles without jostling the sightseers on board. On the highway, it was sure-footed and nicely composed even on long S-curves.
 Its 5.6-liter V-8 (305 horsepower) had plenty of power to haul its 5,300 pounds. Wide open on expressways, the Armada, whose five-speed automatic transmission is a rarity in this class, never showed a sign of strain. In a zero to 60 test, Car and Driver clocked the Armada at an impressive 7 seconds.
 Rear drive is standard, but Nissan offers four-wheel drive (albeit a system without the full-time, dry-pavement setting available on competitive Chevys, GMC's and Dodges). The braking and steering were sure and precise. 
 The Armada produced more wind noise than I expected. On stretches with roadway seams, vibration made its way through the suspension and into the passenger space.
 The Armada is not flashy inside, but plainly functional, though it has luxury touches like amber dash lighting, contrasting textures with minimalist lines and 10 cup holders (plus four bottle holders in the doors, including one that can handle a 64-ounce container). You can fold the front passenger seat to provide still more cup holders and a work surface. Storage spaces are plentiful and cleverly done.
 One miss: Three knobs adjust the cabin temperature, with red indicator lights for the setting. The tiny red slits are hard to see in daylight. 
 For rollover protection, Nissan says the long wheelbase -- seven inches longer than the Chevy Tahoe's -- enhances stability. All Armadas come with side curtain air bags that protect all three rows of seats; side bags in the front seats are optional. 
 Compared with the Durango and the Ford Expedition, the Armada is generally roomier and competitive even with the high-end optional engines of some other S.U.V.'s. Ford has greatly improved its Expedition and earned a top rating in safety crash tests. The more expensive Lincoln Navigator is more luxurious and more expensive. But I found the Durango easier to maneuver, quite comfortable and less imposing on city streets. The trade-off, of course, is that it is not as roomy.
 Would I take my kids to school in an Armada? Not a chance. Buses serve just fine, and at least their drivers aren't gabbing on cellphones.

THE LAST MEN OUT:
Life on the Edgeat Rescue 2 Firehouse
By Tom Downey
Henry Holt
($25, hardcover)
 There's no ''Welcome to New York City'' sign, but Bob realizes he's crossed the border when the buildings get bigger, the air dirtier, the drivers crazier. Passing Exit 24 on the Grand Central Parkway and crossing into Queens, he reaches for the power switch on his Radio Shack scanner. The Fire Department bandwidth will tell him what he's missing. He's buffing: listening to the department radio when he's not working, just for kicks. 
 Some civilian buffs spend their weekends speeding around the city, scanners in hand, trying to catch a glimpse of the firemen at work. Each borough has a frequency of its own, except for the eternally fireless Staten Island, which shares one with the Bronx. Bob tunes in to Brooklyn, and the first static crackle tells him that Rescue 2 is heading out:
 ''Three-ten to Brooklyn, let's give a 10-75 to start with.'' Engine 310 is calling Brooklyn with a job.
 Nice and casual, Bob thinks, 10-75 to start with. As if there might be something bigger to come.

THE ART OF THE STEAL:
Inside the Sotheby's-Christie's Auction House Scandal
By Christopher Mason
Putnam
($26.95, hardcover)
 The room was packed, partly due to feverish interest in the 16 Havemeyer pictures and in the other first-rate works of art in the sale by Monet, Klee, Picasso, Leger and Renoir. News of the magnificent lineup of museum-quality paintings had prompted 25,000 visitors to file through the company's York Avenue galleries the weekend before the sale -- the largest number in the firm's history.
 Nevertheless, many of Sotheby's staffers were feeling jittery. The art market was still in the grip of a recession that had dragged on for two years, and some executives feared that the company's ongoing bitter struggle with Swid and Cogan might cast a pall over the proceedings.
 John Marion was feeling confident. Earlier that day he had received a call from his senior colleagues in London, wishing him the very best of luck.
 ''I have a feeling I'm not just going to sell the pictures tonight,'' Marion replied. ''I'm going to sell the company.''
 The excitement of the crowd was palpable from the moment Marion rose to the podium to take up his gavel at 7 o'clock. ''There was an electricity about the room,'' he marveled. ''The bids were absolutely crackling, like rifle shots coming: Bam! Bam! Bam! People started applauding the first time we hit a million. And I said, 'We're going to go there a lot of times tonight.''' 
 The wildly successful sale also sent a powerful message to collectors and dealers that New York had replaced London as the international center of the art market.

SHUT UP HE EXPLAINED:
The Memoir of a Blacklisted Kid
By Kate Lardner
Ballantine
($23.95, hardcover)
 When my father said good-bye to prison he was given an overcoat at government expense -- a navy officer's black winter coat with a detachable lining and some slight imperfection, and whenever he wore it he remembered leaving the place.
 Granny and Albert were waiting at the gate. They drove my father to Uncle John's apartment in New York City and after a while Granny, visibly happy that my dad was over the whole ordeal, indicated she wanted to return to New Milford.
 What a relief for her not to have the strain of those visits anymore, thought my father. They said good-bye not knowing how long it would be before seeing each other again. From Uncle John's on West 12th Street my father went to East 10th, where Dalton and Cleo Trumbo were occupying half of the house belonging to the writers Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter. An old brownstone with large rooms, high ceilings, chandeliers and fireplaces, and a small garden out back, in the heart of Greenwich Village.
 Trumbo had been released from his institution the week before, and Cleo came from California to meet him. The three of them had midday drinks and talked about the uncertainties of the future. The whole situation had gotten much worse. Senator Joseph McCarthy had appeared on the scene.

WILLIAM SLOANE COFFIN JR.:
A Holy Impatience
By Warren Goldstein
Yale University Press
($30, hardcover)
 One day in early 1977 the phone rang in Strafford, Vt. From the New York City headquarters of the United Church of Christ, Valerie Russell was calling her old friend and mentor Bill Coffin. ''I've been asked by the Black Christian Caucus at Riverside Church to talk to you.'' 
 Coffin interrupted: ''So how many of you are there? All four of you talking in one voice?'' 
 Her reply -- ''No, we make up 39 percent of the congregation'' -- got him thinking. Unruffled, she continued: ''As you can imagine, our preference would have been for Andy Young, because he could have kept the whites. But seeing as Andy Young is at the U.N., we decided we'd like you to become minister, because you could keep the blacks.'' Suddenly Coffin had become a serious candidate for the pulpit of the flagship church of American mainline Protestantism.

CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU:
The Art of Making and Giving Money
By Lewis B. Cullman
John Wiley & Sons
($29.95, hardcover)
 The board was meeting in my office at 767 Third Avenue, discussing our new-found success when I made a radical proposal. The people I contacted hadn't bought the tables to support the American Chess Federation in general, I said. They'd bought the tables primarily to support the new chess program.
 The program had become our public face; it was what excited the outside world, especially those in a position to help fund us. Why didn't we put our name where our money was, and retitle the foundation Chess-in-the-Schools? (Maybe I was better at corporate branding than I realized.)
 ''Holy smoke! Oh, my heavens, no!'' came the response. By and large, the old guard was absolutely horrified. A few years later, though, I was elected chairman of the foundation, and in 1997 we officially changed the name. As I sit here, Chess-in-the-Schools is teaching the game and much more to some 38,000 elementary and junior-high students in all five boroughs of New York City.

HEADLINE: Tracking the Sale of a Kidney On a Path of Poverty and Hope

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RECIFE, Brazil 

 BODY:
When Alberty Jose da Silva heard he could make money, lots of money, by selling his kidney, it seemed to him the opportunity of a lifetime. For a desperately ill 48-year-old woman in Brooklyn whose doctors had told her to get a kidney any way she could, it was.
 At 38, Mr. da Silva, one of 23 children of a prostitute, lives in a slum near the airport here, in a flimsy two-room shack he shares with a sister and nine other people. 
 ''As a child, I can remember seven of us sharing a single egg, or living for day after day on just a bit of manioc meal with salt,'' Mr. da Silva said in an interview. 
 He recalled his mother as a woman who ''sold her flesh'' to survive. Last year he decided that he would, too. Now, a long scar across his side marks the place where a kidney and a rib were removed in exchange for $6,000, paid by middlemen in an international organ trafficking ring. 
 Among poor men like Mr. da Silva and others who have migrated to slums here from Brazil's parched northeastern backlands, word of the market to sell their organs spread quickly. 
 Some who had done so were already buying houses, businesses, cars and refrigerators. 
 The sums being offered seemed a fortune. The minimum wage here is barely $80 a month, and work is hard to find. Many men struggle to exist on odd jobs that pay barely a dollar a day. Initially, the organ brokers paid as much as $10,000 for a kidney -- more than a decade's wages.
 Donors and recipients were not related, in contrast to the usual preference for legal and medical reasons. In fact, they did not even know each other. But they were linked by a trafficking ring that the authorities now say exploited two very different sets of needs -- for money and for life itself -- at opposite ends of a tangled chain thousands of miles long.
 Tracing the journey of Mr. da Silva's kidney through that chain, which spanned four continents and ended in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, reveals the inner workings of a network that human rights groups say is by no means unique. Rather, they say, it is representative of a global black market for organs, including livers, kidneys and lungs, that touches dozens of countries and generates many millions of dollars a year. 
 In Alberty da Silva's case, the authorities here say, the organ's odyssey began with two middlemen based in this gritty port city of 1.5 million people: Gedalya Tauber, a former Israeli police officer, and his partner, Ivan Bonifacio da Silva, a retired Brazilian military police officer. 
 The pair, since jailed on organ trafficking charges, not only handed out cash payments, the authorities say, but also arranged for the medical exams to weed out unqualified donors. They then obtained passports and airline tickets for the donors to travel to South Africa, where the transplants took place. Both countries have laws against commercial trade in organs.
 ''Six grand is a lot of money, especially when you don't have any,'' Mr. da Silva said when asked why he had given up his kidney. ''No one here warned us that what we were doing was illegal.''

Get a Kidney, or Expect to Die
 The American woman who received Mr. da Silva's kidney initially worried that what she was doing might be illegal. She described herself as deeply religious and concerned with the ethics of transplants.
 But during an interview in April she also recalled the long years of suffering that made her take the risk of seeking an organ on the international market. The decision to go abroad for a kidney, she said at her third-floor walk-up apartment in Brooklyn, was not an easy one, but necessary nonetheless.
 ''I had been on dialysis for 15 years and on two transplant lists for 7,'' said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, for fear of losing support payments vital to maintaining the health of her transplanted organ. ''Nothing was happening, and my health was getting worse and worse.'' Finally, she said, ''my doctors told me to get a kidney any way I could,'' or expect to die.
 She took their warning seriously. The years of dialysis had left her with worsening heart and lung problems. She also suffered from severe osteoporosis. ''I had seen four other ladies that I knew pass away'' while they waited for kidney donors, she said.
 More than 3,300 Americans died last year awaiting kidney transplants, and the Brooklyn woman was among 85,000 people on waiting lists in the United States, 60,000 of them in need of kidneys. The average wait can be five years, says the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit transplant information clearinghouse in Richmond, Va.
 It is illegal in the United States to pay a donor for an organ. But Nancy Scheper-Hughes of Organs Watch, a human rights group in Berkeley, Calif., that has long tracked the illegal organ trade and denounced abuses, says irregularities still occur. 
 ''It is a common practice of many larger clinics to advertise on the Internet for transplant tourists, so we're up to our necks in it,'' Dr. Scheper-Hughes said. Transplant doctors, she says, have developed a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. 
 The World Health Organization issued guidelines in 1991 to avoid the coercion or exploitation of organ donors. They were endorsed by 192 countries, including the United States, Brazil and South Africa. But the guidelines are not binding, and the recommendations have been widely ignored. At least one country, Iran, has a legally regulated system to trade organs.
 As medical science advances and health care increasingly becomes a marketplace transaction, a fierce debate about commercializing transplants has emerged.
 On one side, said Alexander M. Capron, the director of the ethics department of the World Health Organization, are ''transplant surgeons who believe that a good way to remedy the shortage of organs would be to offer payments,'' and bioethicists and philosophers who see organ trade as an extension of the principle of autonomy.
 But an opposing group, Mr. Capron said, ''fears that the line between selling organs and actually selling people is a rather fine one'' and that, as in sex trafficking, the marketplace is one in which coercion and exploitation may be unavoidable. 
 In the case of the Brooklyn woman, her husband had relatives in Israel who had heard of a syndicate that brokered transplants, and reached out to them. The woman and her husband said that relatives and the brokers reassured them that an operation abroad would be perfectly legal.
 ''I felt helpless, because she was going to die,'' said the woman's husband, who is in such fragile health himself that he receives disability payments. ''Helping her get that kidney was the best thing that I have ever done for anyone in my entire life.''

'Mr. Big' or 'the Wrong Guy'?
 The syndicate that organized the American woman's transplant, the authorities say, also arranged kidney transfers for at least 100 Israelis. It was led, they say, by a 52-year-old organ broker in Israel, Ilan Peri.
 ''He's Mr. Big, the one who started the whole thing,'' Johan Wessels, a forensic investigator in South Africa who works for the Department of Health in KwaZulu-Natal Province and has had access to hospital records there, said in Durban.
 Mr. Peri works out of a Tel Aviv suburb through a company called TechCom. He faces charges of tax evasion in Israel, accused of improperly declaring nearly $4 million said to have been earned as an organ broker and is also under investigation in connection with inflating the invoices that he did submit to Israeli health care programs. 
 When reached by telephone in Tel Aviv and asked to comment on the charges, Mr. Peri said: ''I have never been involved in kidney transplants. You are talking to the wrong guy.'' He eventually hung up the telephone, but not before amending his statement. ''I'm not involved in that anymore, so I can't help you,'' he said.
 To those who monitor organ trafficking, it was no surprise that Israel should emerge as the focal point of a syndicate. Organ donation rates in Israel are among the lowest in the developed world, about one-third the rate in Western Europe, in large part because of what Health Ministry officials and doctors describe as a widespread impression that Jewish religious law prohibits transplants as a ''desecration of the body.''
 In reality, religious law is far more nuanced. But influential Orthodox rabbis have been reluctant to make public statements that would encourage either live donors or the harvesting of organs from the deceased.
 Israelis needing transplants have suffered as a result. More than 1,000 people in a nation of about 6 million are on Israel's waiting list for organs, more than half of them for kidneys. The list grows by more than 20 percent each year, health officials say. In an average year, more than 80 people die waiting, proportionally a slightly higher rate than in the United States. 
 To meet Israeli's growing demand for organs, middlemen calling themselves brokers, from prominent doctors to a former spokesman for a health maintenance organization, have rushed into the market to set prices for a scarce product that can reach $150,000 for a kidney. Some advertise openly in Israeli newspapers and on radio stations, soliciting recipients and donors.
 ''As of today, there is no law in Israel that forbids trafficking in human organs,'' Meir Broder, a legal adviser to the Health Ministry, explained in an interview in Jerusalem. ''There is no criminal aspect at all.''
 A bill drafted by the Health Ministry that would make trafficking illegal and forbid organ donations for money awaits action in the Parliament. But medical specialists say it faces strong opposition and may not pass.
 For now, allowing the brokers to operate with few restrictions in effect benefits the state by exporting Israel's organ shortage overseas. The patients who do go abroad ''save the country a lot of money,'' explained Dr. Michael Friedlaender, a kidney specialist at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, ''not only in terms of what doesn't have to be spent on dialysis, but also by opening places for other people who are on the list.''
 For operations in Israel, the Ministry of Health relies on elaborate procedures to ensure that donors and recipients act for ''altruistic'' motives and do not exchange money. But another ministry directive also allows Israelis who go abroad for transplants to be reimbursed as much as $80,000. 
 Much of the remaining costs can often be obtained from insurance plans, though Israeli health maintenance organizations are supposed to ask for proof when donors and recipients say they are related in ''voluntary'' operations. 
 Israeli doctors say those requirements are often ignored, and the government says it has no obligation to monitor operations done abroad. ''In the end, a country can only be responsible for what happens within its own borders,'' said Mr. Broder, the Ministry of Health lawyer.
 In the mid-1990's, many of the Israeli organ brokers took their patients to Turkey, flying in teams of Israeli surgeons and relying on donors from Moldova, Romania and Russia. But after some patients died and Dr. Scheper-Hughes of Organs Watch and the Turkish and European news media raised ethical questions, the brokers were forced to search for new locations.
 For both the medical expertise available and its low costs, South Africa emerged as a logical alternative.

The South African Connection
 It was there, in South Africa, the authorities say, that Mr. Peri's ring brought together Mr. da Silva and the woman who ultimately received his kidney.
 After long negotiations in Israel, which she said were conducted by relatives of her husband, the Brooklyn woman flew to South Africa for a transplant. Because of her unusual circumstances, it cost her just over $60,000, which other kidney recipients who dealt with Mr. Peri said was less than half the price the syndicate usually charged.
 Even so, that amount was 10 times the payment Mr. da Silva received, though organ recipients in Israel said Mr. Peri routinely told them that the Brazilian donors were being paid $25,000.
 While money initially motivated Mr. da Silva to sell his kidney, he said he also came to be moved by the chance to help a stranger. The change, he said, occurred after he, too, arrived in South Africa, his first trip out of Brazil, in what he saw as an adventure that would allow him to see lions, giraffes and elephants.
 Instead, after 10 hours of flying last August, Mr. da Silva found himself in Durban, a resort city of 1.4 million on the Indian Ocean, where he was shuttled to a safe house. Later, at St. Augustine's Hospital, he met the American woman and learned of her long ordeal.
 ''It's hard for me to imagine how a person might feel when a relative is about to die, so I don't blame anybody for trying anything to get a new kidney,'' Mr. da Silva said. 
 He said he also made friends with hospital orderlies and a nurse called Mama Tchuka. Mr. da Silva said hospital employees joked openly about the illegal nature of the transplants and the fact that he and the woman receiving his kidney were of different ethnic backgrounds and could not even speak each other's language. 
 ''It was only when I got to South Africa and was told to sign a document saying that the recipient of my kidney was my cousin that I realized that something was wrong,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''But by then it was too late to turn back.''
 In interviews, Mr. da Silva and several other of the Brazilian men who donated organs said they were treated well in South Africa. But investigators say the donors did not get the same quality of care as the Israelis who received their organs.
 The Israelis, for example, like the American woman, were lodged in beachfront hotels before the operation and, afterward, kept under intense observation and given detailed records to be handed over to their doctors back home. The donors, by contrast, were monitored ''for a maximum of three days,'' Mr. Wessels, the South African investigator, said. Some of that time, they were not even in the hospital, but at the safe house the syndicate rented.
 ''Then they were put on a plane without much further ado,'' he said. 
 Based on a detailed study of confiscated records, South African authorities say the kidney transfer between Mr. da Silva and the Brooklyn woman was one of more than 100 suspect transplants performed in less than two years at St. Augustine's.
 Today, the director of the kidney transplant unit there, Lindy Dickson, and another employee, Melanie Azor, are among seven people arrested and charged with acting on behalf of the illegal organ ring. Government officials say more indictments are on the way. ''Not all the invitation cards have been sent out yet,'' Barent Groen, the chief government prosecutor in the case, said in an interview in Durban.
 Also arrested was Shushan Meir, an Israeli-born South African who authorities said acted as a middleman for Mr. Peri, the Israeli broker.
 ''He visited transplant clinics in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town,'' Mr. Wessels said of Mr. Peri, ''and correspondence shows that he was in touch with the doctors and the transplant clinic staff here. The impression I get is that he was making sure his investment was running smoothly.''
 At a court hearing, Mr. Meir said that beyond the 100 or so transplants done in Durban, he had organized ''probably about 35'' more in Johannesburg. But South African investigators estimate that the actual number is probably closer to 200, divided among hospitals in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
 All the hospitals under investigation belong to the same private health care chain, Netcare, which on its Web site boasts of ''aiming to uphold South Africa's reputation as 'the transplant capital of the world.' '' Since the mid-1990's, the company has been buying up facilities like St. Augustine's, originally a Catholic missionary hospital, and demanding a strong bottom-line performance.
 Netcare's chief executive officer, Michael Sacks, declined a request for an interview. Through a press spokeswoman, Martina Nicholson, Netcare has denied conscious involvement in any wrongdoing.
 ''We do not know of anything untoward having taken place at all,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ''We still firmly believe that there has been no transgression at any of our hospitals or by any of our staff members.''
 With operatives of Mr. Peri's syndicate now jailed in Brazil and South Africa, and Mr. Peri under pressure in Israel, his ring has apparently been smashed. But the transplant waiting list in Israel continues to grow, and recent reports from kidney specialists say Israeli organ brokers have appeared in China, among other places.
 ''This is obviously a well-oiled syndicate that knows how to move from one country to another,' R. W. Green-Thompson, superintendent general of the KwaZulu-Natal provincial department of health, said in an interview in Durban. ''I'm sure that this problem will pop up again in another country soon. The only question is which one.''

Unexpected Consequences
 These days, Mr. da Silva works 44 hours a week as a security guard, but still earns less than $175 a month, money that is the sole support for the 10 other people he lives with. Even that income was jeopardized when he and other kidney donors were arrested and briefly jailed early this year on suspicion of violating Brazilian laws against trading in human organs. He and more than a score of other donors still faced criminal charges here.
 In the 18 months that ended last November, when the authorities shut down the ring, so many residents from the slums of Recife had volunteered that the middlemen had begun offering just $3,000 for a healthy kidney.
 All told, the police in Brazil estimate that about 100 men, nearly all poor or unemployed, ages 20 to 40, agreed to sell kidneys. Though some would eventually be rejected for having an unusual blood type, frail health or signs of drug use, more than 60 men are believed to have gone to South Africa.
 Recife and its slums had become so lucrative a source for organs, in fact, that Brazilian investigators believe that by late 2003, Israeli brokers, in an effort to swell their earnings further, were considering moving their operations to hospitals here and in other nearby cities.
 With poverty offering up an unquenchable pool of volunteers, the local authorities say the ring had also begun inquiring about buying other vital organs from poor residents, including lungs, livers and corneas.
 ''Even after all of this fuss, I'd do it again,'' said Orley de Santana, a 26-year-old laborer, who went to South Africa but was unable to sell his kidney for $6,000 before the police broke up the ring. ''In order not to have to steal or kill, I thought it better to sell my kidney.''
 Among the men who did give up a kidney, some say they have experienced health problems that no one warned them about. 
 ''For me, the complications began almost immediately,'' said Jose Carlos da Conceicao da Silva, 24, a day laborer who hauls produce. He said he required a second operation in South Africa on a lung three days after his kidney was removed. Since returning to Brazil his health has worsened, he said.
 ''I'm tired all the time and can't lift heavy weights, which I have to be able to do if people are going to hire me,'' he said. ''My blood pressure goes up and down, and I feel pain and numbness where the scar from the operation is.''
 Worse still, after his flight back to Brazil, Mr. da Silva, who is not related to Alberty da Silva, said he was robbed of nearly all of the $6,000 he was paid for his kidney when he went to Sao Paulo during a layover on his flight home. ''I begged and pleaded for them not to take the money, telling them that I had sold my kidney abroad and showing them the scar,'' he recalled, near tears.
 Another donor, Rogerio Bezerra da Silva, not related to the others, also lost his kidney and his cash, which South African authorities confiscated after the ring was exposed late last year, and is now the object of mockery in his slum neighborhood. 
 On occasion, Alberty da Silva says, he shows pictures of his trip to South Africa to the neighborhood children. During the interview, he showed them to a reporter, too, including some of him in Durban with the woman who received his kidney. He also displayed a letter she later wrote, thanking him for ''the gift of life.''
 The American woman continues to correspond with him and, though hardly wealthy herself, says she intends to send cash gifts each Christmas and on his birthday.
 ''They never want you to see the donor,'' she said of the traffickers. ''But I kept insisting that we meet because I know that he is now part of my being. I have a piece of him inside of me, so who wouldn't want that bond?''

HEADLINE: Give Her Your Tired CD's: Greta's Back in Business

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
For years, Greta Perr worked as a clerk in a used-CD store called Sounds on St. Marks Place. While she wasn't as widely known as the bands whose albums she bought and sold, in time she developed a cult following. In the slightly covert world that deals in used CD's, the clued-in knew to go see Greta. 
 On Thursdays through Saturdays, loyal sellers lined up while Ms. Perr performed the mysterious calculations of record store economics.
 ''Thirty-five dollars cash or $50 in store credit,'' she'd say. ''I'll take the cash,'' nearly everyone answered. 
 Last year, a group of three employees that included Ms. Perr, 39, who had spent more than a decade there, were laid off, and she disappeared into the cityscape. 
 So it is with great relief that people have begun spotting Ms. Perr on the West Side, smoking cigarettes outside a new and used CD shop on Ninth Avenue near 52nd Street in Hell's Kitchen called Future Legend. It turned out that not long after leaving Sounds, she opened the shoebox-shaped store in partnership with Paul Ruggiero, 36, whom she befriended while they were students at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan because they were both David Bowie fans. The store is named after a Bowie song.
 ''I'm working seven days a week,'' Ms. Perr said the other day, ''but it's for myself now. On the days I'm sick, I wonder what I'm missing. It's like an adventure.'' 
 Growing up, Ms. Perr was surrounded by music. Her father did publicity for Capitol Records and then Elektra Records, and she bounced between New York and California. She fondly recalls seeing the Stooges, the Flaming Groovies and Alice Cooper in concert when she was 6; Mr. Ruggiero says he is constantly amazed at her encyclopedic musical knowledge. 
 ''Sometimes I'll ask Greta questions I know the answer to, just to test her,'' he said. ''She always gets them.'' 
 Reflecting on her renown as a CD buyer, Ms. Perr attributes her popularity to the fact that she is, as she puts it, ''fast and fair.'' She said she didn't miss her East Village location, but she did miss some of the old customers. ''I never asked anyone who they were or what they did so I had no way of contacting them,'' Ms. Perr explained.
 Lately, though, people have begun to rediscover Ms. Perr, among them Clayton James, a physical trainer from the Upper West Side who searched up and down the West Side to find her.
 During his latest visit, they discussed the new Loretta Lynn album. ''Greta was hesitant to recommend that one,'' he said. ''She hadn't made up her mind yet.'' STEVEN KURUTZ

HEADLINE: Catholic Parishes in Jersey City Are Told to Consolidate, Again

BYLINE: By JASON GEORGE

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, May 21 

 BODY:
There was a time when a person could stand on Sixth Street and hear dueling organs swelling from back-to-back Catholic churches, and it all made sense.
 Faithful Italians would gather on one end of the block at Holy Rosary Church, which bills itself as New Jersey's first Italian parish. Devout Poles would fill the building abutting it, St. Anthony of Padua Church, which, as the oldest Polish Roman Catholic parish in the city, once boasted a congregation of more than 10,000.
 But now both churches stand on the hushed street like sentinels, quietly guarding a time that has long since left Jersey City. The buildings have remained there for more than a century, a steady and persistent presence, even as their congregants proved far less reliable, with many picking up their roots in the years soon after World War II and drifting away to the suburbs of Bergen County and beyond. 
 ''A lot of people simply moved away,'' said James Fisher, co-director of the Center for American Catholic Studies at Fordham University. ''An awful lot of people.''
 Because of that exodus, the demographic changes that followed, and other trends, the Archdiocese of Newark has proposed a plan that would have both churches meld into the nearby Parish of the Resurrection. But, reflecting just how severe the drain of Catholics has been from the city over all, Resurrection itself comprises five churches, merged in 1997 because of dwindling attendance and the meager contents of collection baskets. Where once more than half the city's population was reported to be Roman Catholic and seven parishes could thrive, the seven could become one, using just three houses of worship.
 Altogether, the archdiocese would like to realign or merge 48 churches in the 235-parish diocese, and more changes and closures could follow. The plan is a reflection of the dwindling forces of the Catholic Church in the region that includes Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Union Counties. But it is also a story that has played out in city after city, neighborhood after neighborhood, around the country as the church has tried to adjust to changing times.
 Last Tuesday, the Rev. Rino Lavaroni, pastor at Holy Rosary, spent the morning in the rain clearing brush from behind the church that had become his home only nine months earlier. When a small church was built here in 1885, Italians were still a small percentage of the immigrants who were arriving in waves to double Jersey City's population every decade from the 1830's. That would change, and by 1903 the little church was replaced by the imposing sandstone building that sits there today. 
 For Father Lavaroni there is little time to gaze in the rearview mirror, reflecting on a time when the pews were packed and the church's street fair was legendary in the neighborhood. ''The numbers are down,'' he admitted. ''They have gotten out of these neighborhoods.
 ''Thank God,'' he said, looking over the area that in recent years has been wounded by crime and too little reason to hope. Still, those same forces make his job tough. ''I'm trying to reach out to this area,'' he said.
 The area is called downtown Jersey City, although historians have argued that the city has not had a distinctive downtown since the Dutch rowed across the Hudson River to establish a colony here in 1630. Instead, Jersey City became a city of industry that defined its neighborhoods by railway yards, factories and shipping docks. 
 The immigrants who arrived at America's Golden Door, as the city was called, would shuffle off to tenements and work long hours at unskilled jobs. The first were the Irish. A survey in 1860 found 55 percent of Irish men worked unskilled jobs, while the Irish only accounted for 37 percent of the population then. But by 1917, when Frank Hague, an Irish Catholic mayor who would rule Jersey City with an iron fist and a greased palm for 30 years, took office, the Irish immigrants and their Catholic churches had emerged as the city's ruling class.
 ''The public employees would shovel the snow in front of the Catholic schools,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''All the aspirations of the Irish Catholics rose with Mayor Hague.''
 By the end of Mr. Hague's term, the Italians and Poles had replaced the Germans and Irish as the majority. In 1960, of the 610,000 people living in Jersey City, there were more than 83,000 people who considered themselves Italian, up from 187 a century before.
 Change would come again. Beginning in the late 1950's, the children and grandchildren of the immigrants who worked so hard to turn Jersey City into the second largest city in New Jersey began leaving, as the jobs did. 
 ''In the 50's and 60's, a tremendous number of the so-called white ethnics moved away to the neighboring counties,'' Mr. Fisher said. In their wake came African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, who together accounted for 25 percent of the city's population by 1970. 
 But during those years of disappearing jobs and limited opportunities came a new kind of poverty and street-level crime, and the first visible signs that the Catholic churches were falling on hard times, as well. 
 ''The falloff started in the 1950's and 60's, and the late 60's were probably the worst of times,'' said the Very Rev. Gregory Studerus, pastor of the Resurrection parish.
 The economic decay in the community was evident in the peeling paint of the area's Catholic churches. It continued until a public works project near the seven churches gutted, cleared and rebuilt more than 100 homes in the early 1980's, said Father Studerus. But the new houses were not filled by returning European families. Rather, the next wave was of immigrants from Southeast and South Asia. 
 The community soon came to consist of those new immigrants. Over all, there were far fewer Catholics than there had been before.
 Father Lavaroni said he was well aware that Italians no longer inhabited the apartments surrounding Holy Rosary in the numbers that they did before. But, he said, he still believes the church can turn the corner toward renewal. Attendance at Sunday Mass is about 300 now -- an increase, he said. And the church is adapting: besides English, Italian and Latin, one Mass is offered in Chinese. He has hopes that the church can survive and, while the archdiocese spends the next 18 months working out the ultimate fates of the churches on its list, he plans to push ahead with plans for Holy Rosary. 
 ''They are all CEO's,'' he said, referring to the task force of pastors, pastoral associates and parishioners that came up with the recommendations for the Archdiocese. ''I'm a sociologist, so I know you have to take a good picture of the situation, but they didn't look. These people never came to see the reality.''
 Next door, at St. Anthony's, the pastor, the Rev. Joseph Urban, has other plans on his mind. The church is trying to organize a celebration for its 120th anniversary next month. He, too, sees signs of hope. He said he has already seen attendance on Sunday grow to 300 people from about 40 in the last three years, though it is still nowhere near the 10,000 congregants of the past. Standing in the nave of his church last week he conceded that he should probably be doing more. ''We know we need to develop our activities and improve,'' he said. But, ''More people are coming.''
 The neighborhood has already tried to deal with its shrinking Catholic population by reorganizing some of its churches. In 1997, Resurrection parish was formed to consolidate parish activities, like social and educational services, and to save money for five churches within blocks of each other: St. Bridget's, St. Mary's, St. Michael's, St. Peter's and St. Boniface.
 St. Bridget's had dipped to a congregation of 650 just before the merger, down from 6,000 in 1910. St. Mary's, only seven blocks away, had slipped to 1,180 in 1997 from 7,500 members in 1910. Both churches offer religious services in up to four different languages, two for the growing Asian population in the area. Asians account for more than 17 percent of Jersey City's population, up from 4 percent in 1980, according to census data.
 The third church in the Resurrection parish, St. Michael's, has maintained attendance figures stronger than Holy Rosary's and St. Anthony's, largely because it has integrated these newer immigrants, said Father Studerus. Originally a church for Irish and German dockworkers, St. Michael's is now home to the Vietnamese Apostolate and offers Mass in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Tagalog, a language mostly spoken in the Philippines. Last Tuesday night, members of the Apostolate gathered and sang prayers in Vietnamese to St. Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes, which echoed off the gilded cathedral ceiling. Later, the Rev. Joseph Minh said Mass in English for 14 congregants, half of whom were Vietnamese.
 Iris Perez, who has attended St. Michael's for more than 15 years, said that when Vietnamese parishioners began appearing at the church in large numbers about three years ago, there was talk then, too, of how it would affect the church. But not anymore, she said. ''Honestly, they are the ones keeping the church alive.''
 Should the consolidation plan go through, Holy Rosary and St. Anthony's would be absorbed into St. Michael's, three blocks north. But the details of how this would occur -- and what might happen to the buildings -- is unclear.
 ''There is ambiguity in the recommendation they gave us,'' Father Studerus said. ''They're saying there must be a much closer relationship than there is now. It does not necessarily include simply closing the church sites, even though that seems to be a starting-point recommendation.''
 Even as the seven churches are scheduled to be merged into one parish, possibly under three roofs, another church in downtown Jersey City seems to have survived the first round of recommendations. And in that there is either a tale of urban luck or a lesson for the church at large.
 That church, Our Lady of Czestochowa, once served the city's large Polish population. It ceased Polish language Mass in 2001, a year after it adopted the slogan ''Our Lady's Church on the Waterfront,'' to reach out to the new, wealthier residents who were settling nearby in developments along the Jersey City waterfront.
 Polish congregants protested, calling the plan a form of ethnic cleansing and a tasteless ploy. But James Goodness, spokesman for the Newark Archdiocese, said no offense had been meant. 
 ''What they did, however, to kind of encourage people to come, is they did some smart marketing of the parish, saying it was Our Lady's on the Waterfront,'' he said. Attendance there has been climbing. ''Something is working here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Home Sales, Spring Fever

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI; Reporting for this article was contributed by Elsa Brenner in Westchester County, Eleanor Charles in Connecticut, Antoinette Martin in New Jersey and Carole Paquette on Long Island.

 BODY:
SOME home buyers are rushing into the market because mortgage rates have inched up by a percentage point since March, brokers throughout the New York region say. For precisely the same reason, they say, other buyers -- particularly skittish fledglings -- are cringing from taking the plunge.
 And at the same time, some sellers who had been holding onto their properties to maximize a seemingly inexorable rise in prices have now made that phone call to a listing agent, suddenly wary that the housing market -- a reliable piston of the nation's economy even during recent sluggish times -- might go into a grind should interest rates take too many more upward ticks. As a result, listings have lurched up a bit in the last two months.
 Or is it just spring? 
 ''People are affected by sunlight,'' said Sari Kingsley, president of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Listings have started to pour in. Then, maybe, it was just the lousy winter we had.''
 From the heights of Manhattan's towers to the capes of the New Jersey coast, the market remains on an inventory-squeezed, high- and higher-priced roll, a boon to sellers (at least until they have to find new digs) and a bane to buyers.
 One Brooklyn broker says buyers these days seem to move in flocks -- the same faces showing up at every open house; some people submitting defensive bids for a home not quite of their dreams, then slipping into buyer remorse and sometimes, just sometimes, backing out of the deal.
 The primary angst for buyers, of course, stems from still-rising prices.
 The average cost of a Manhattan apartment set a record during the first quarter of this year, coming in just short of $1 million at $998,905. Manhattan's median price of $625,000 also set a record during the first quarter, bounding up 21.4 percent from $515,000 in the first quarter of 2003. In the not-quite-as-rarefied environs along the southern tier of Brooklyn, the median home price during the first quarter of 2004 was $495,000, a 13 percent increase from the same period in 2003.
 Westchester's median price also hit an all-time high in the first quarter, $574,900, a 9 percent rise from a year ago. And in one of the hottest markets of northern New Jersey, Short Hills, the median was $1.35 million, a 28.5 percent escalation from $1.05 million a year ago.

'A Perverse Positive'
As Rates Rise, Market Heats Up
 To some degree the volatility in the market is, rationally or not, related to the first significant mortgage-rate rise in several years. ''I'm starting to feel rumblings,'' said Dawn Roman, owner of Century 21 Dawn's Gold in Yonkers. ''People are worried about how long rates will stay down. Buyers and sellers fear their window of opportunity is closing.''
 So throughout the region, in a perhaps counterintuitive effect on the long-term lack of inventory, previously-wait-and-see sellers are deciding it is now or never for that top dollar.
 ''A perverse positive,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, describing how, instead of inhibiting sales, higher rates are spurring the market. ''It's the fence-sitter phenomenon.''
 Worries about further rate increases have also generated some creative arrangements. ''One of my buyers wanted to protect himself from a June rate hike by closing and moving in right away,'' said Elayne Jassey, a broker for Coldwell Banker in Stamford, Conn., ''but the seller did not want to move out until Aug. 1.''
 ''They worked out a deal,'' Ms. Jassey continued, ''whereby the buyer paid $900,000 for the house, which the seller is leasing back from him for $4,000 a month. The seller has his money in hand and continues to pay about $1,000 a month in property taxes, and the buyer figures the amount he would be paying in higher interest for years to come will be his compensation.''
 While the run-up in mortgage rates has seized the attention of buyers as well as real estate specialists -- though its full impact is a matter of disagreement -- the higher rates have quickly generated one measurable effect: an increase in the popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages. 
 ''Across all markets in recent months there has been a continuing shift toward ARM's, which has accelerated in recent weeks,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Pompton Plains, N.J. With rare exceptions, adjustable mortgages offer interest below the current 30-year fixed rate for a specific period of time, but the rate may then increase or decrease according to market conditions. 
 ''One of the more favored products at the moment,'' Mr. Gumbinger said, ''is a 5/1 hybrid, whose rate is fixed for the first five years before adjusting'' yearly after that. As of May 14, according to the latest statistics available from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, 35.2 percent of all mortgage applications were for ARM's, up from 26.3 percent on Feb. 6, and from 13.1 percent a year ago.
 There are, to be sure, long-view real estate observers wondering whether all the interest-rate jitters are much ado about not all that much.
 ''Obviously, rates are increasing,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''But they are increasing from near-record lows in our lifetime. And even as they increase further, they probably will still not reach the level they were at in 2000, when the average rate on a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.14 percent. And housing was certainly red hot then.''
 Mr. Gumbinger at HSH Associates pointed out: ''We saw historic lows last June when 30-year fixed rates bottomed at 5.37 percent. Recent lows were 5.53 percent in March.'' 
 This past Wednesday, the rate was 6.39 percent.
 ''The rates have risen,'' Mr. Gumbinger said, ''but they remain favorable compared with almost any point over the last 20 years.'' Ten years ago, the average 30-year fixed rate was 8.9 percent; 15 years ago, it was 11.03 percent.
 ''Perspective has become distorted in recent years by the prevalence of cheap money,'' Mr. Gumbinger said. ''Remember, in September 1981, 30-year fixed rates peaked at 18.31 percent, making today's rates look minuscule, even with the recent increase.''
 And certainly the housing market, regionally and nationally, has remained strong. According to the National Association of Realtors, there were 6.1 million sales of existing homes in 2003, a record. ''However,'' Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said, ''January and February of this year actually surpassed January and February of 2003.''
 The seasonally adjusted rate for January and February of 2003 was 5.8 million sales, he pointed out, ''while in '04 we're ahead of that pace in the first two months with sales approaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.1 million.'' 
 For New York City, Long Island, northern New Jersey and western Connecticut, the realtors association data show, the median price climbed from $258,200 in 2001 to $309,800 in 2002 to $352,600 in 2003 -- a 36.5 percent increase in two years.
 And in the fourth quarter of last year alone, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (which does not provide dollar figures), prices rose 4.26 percent in Connecticut, and 5.51 percent in both New York and New Jersey. 
 ''These all represented a sharp acceleration over the third quarter,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''and this was during the winter, one of the slower selling periods in the year.''
 ''If prices continue to increase at that rate,'' he added, ''fears of a bubble would be justified. But with interest rates rising, we may actually see a stabilizing effect.''

Manhattan Trends
Prices Go Up, Volume Goes Down
 A bit of price stability would certainly be welcomed by Manhattan buyers.
 The record average of $998,905 in this year's first quarter, reported in the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, constitutes a 10.6 percent jump just since the end of 2003, when the average was $903,259. And the median of $625,000 in the first quarter, also a record, was 7.8 percent higher than the $580,000 median at the end of last year.
 Sales volume, indicative of the enduring Manhattan squeeze, dropped sharply during the first quarter. There were 1,825 closed deals by April 30, down 19.1 percent from 2,256 in the previous quarter.
 ''This was a result of the drop in inventory,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepares the Elliman report. Listings dropped by 11.2 percent to 4,299 from 4,843 at the end of 2003.
 ''However, during the last two months, we've seen inventory begin to rise,'' Mr. Miller said -- by 7.6 percent in March over February and by 20 percent to 5,159 in April. 
 ''That indicates the concerns over rising mortgage rates,'' Mr. Miller added.
 Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, believes Manhattan buyers and sellers have their ''eye on the wrong ball.''
 She told of a buyer who signed a contract to pay $260,000 for a studio in an Upper West Side condominium, then backed out of the deal because of the rise in interest rates. ''So one month later,'' she said, ''he's out there looking for something cheaper, and everything's gone up.''
 ''Mostly,'' Ms. Corcoran said, ''people are rushing in as though it's the last chance at a Macy's Day sale. But very few people are asking: what does the one point rise actually mean in dollars and cents? They're having a knee-jerk reaction to their fear of rising rates.''
 ''My advice,'' she said, ''it's ridiculous to overreact to a one point rise when Manhattan apartment prices are going up 2 percent each month.''
 Buyer haste, on the other hand, can lead to buyer remorse, said Christopher Thomas, vice president for Brooklyn for the William B. May Company.
 Despite the recent uptick in inventory, said Mr. Thomas, whose firm specializes in the high end of brownstone Brooklyn: ''There are still many more purchasers than product. Buyers' frustration has led to a situation where they tend to move in flocks. They accumulate for a type of property, particularly our middle market: $600,000 to $800,000 for a two-bedroom. Many have bid unsuccessfully several times and are primed to move immediately on a new listing. ''The day the property is seen, they come in at 9 in the morning,'' he said, ''and by the end of the day competitive bids often drive the ultimate price above the initial offering.''
 Some bids, however, are ''defensive.''
 ''The seller feels he's in the catbird seat with bids above asking price,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But sometimes he can wind up accepting an offer from a buyer who in his heart is only lukewarm about the property. And if the deal is not consummated quickly, buyer remorse sets in. That buyer is gone, and so are all the other bidders.''
 Still, by and very largely, prices keep climbing. Mr. Thomas cited, for example, the $1.5 million sale last July of a historic single-family home in need of work in the Fort Greene section. ''For personal reasons, the purchasers decided to sell,'' he said. ''They put it on the market in January. By February, a deal was struck for over $1.8 million, a 30 percent increase in six months. And that's not an isolated example.''
 Prices have also climbed, though not so precipitously, in other parts of Brooklyn. Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates and Properties in the southern part of the borough, said that during the year that ended on April 30, his company closed 671 deals, 9.6 percent more than the 612 sales during the previous year. ''And while the median between May 1, 2002, and April 30, 2003, was $438,000,'' he said, ''for the last 12 months it was $495,000,'' a 13 percent increase.
 Pointing to recent deals, he said that on May 7, a frame house in Bensonhurst with a three-bedroom apartment over a one-bedroom sold for $480,000. A semiattached three-bedroom in Bay Ridge sold for $547,500 on March 26. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an attached two-family limestone sold on March 5 for $450,000.
 ''Although rates have gone up,'' Mr. Longo said, ''it still makes sense for someone in Manhattan paying $3,000 rent to relocate to Brooklyn, purchase a $500,000 home, pay almost the same money and, on top of that, get the tax refund.''

Beyond Manhattan
'I Want to Buy Now, No Matter What'
 Though certainly not as fevered as in tonier sections of the city, the pattern of urgent demand, restricted listings and climbing prices was evident throughout the five boroughs and the suburban ring.
 In Queens, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes the borough, the median price between Jan. 1 and April 30 this year was $388,000, 10.8 percent higher than the $350,000 median during the first four months of 2003. And 1,797 homes were sold in the borough from January through April, 10.7 percent more than the 1,623 sold during the corresponding period last year.
 On Staten Island, Rich Schulhoff, a spokesman for the borough's board of realtors, said that between Jan. 1 and May 12 of this year, there were 1,344 homes sold at a median price of $339,900. Last year through the same period, there were 1,255 homes sold at a median of $299,000 -- a 13.3 percent price rise.
 In New Jersey, according to the state's association of realtors, the median for single-family homes was $334,300 during the first quarter of 2004, a 10.6 percent increase over $302,300 a year ago. The highest increase was seen in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, combined, where the median climbed 16.6 percent from $255,500 to $298,000.
 According to the Otteau Appraisal Group, which surveys 18 of the state's 21 counties, 21,387 homes went into contract during the first quarter of this year, 16 percent more than the 18,381 a year ago. ''The sales increase, coupled with a 5 percent reduction in inventory, just keeps pushing prices higher,'' said the company's president, Jeffrey Otteau.
 Supply is so tight, said Ronnie Laiken, president of Coldwell Banker's 60 offices in New Jersey, that ''if a home comes on the market in move-in condition, people are lined up for it.''
 ''And if a house comes on not in move-in condition, and the price reflects that, people are waiting for that, too,'' she added. ''This market has eliminated the hopes of some people to get into their dream house.''
 Karen Bigos, an agent in the Millburn-Short Hills office of Burgdorff ERA, said that after bidding wars, ''one in three deals falls apart after the contract is signed because buyers are unable to secure financing. In those cases, the other bidders are contacted and allowed to renew their offers before the house is placed back on the market.''
 In Westchester, P. Gilbert Mercurio, vice president of the county's board of realtors, said the median price of single-family homes reached an all-time high of $574,900 during the first quarter, a 9 percent rise from $527,000 a year ago.
 Ms. Roman, the owner of the Century 21 office in Yonkers, said: ''These days, even on co-ops, there's no negotiating. It's just the highest and best offer.''
 Pricing in Nassau and Suffolk had been fairly stable between October and January, said Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. But then . . .
 In January, the average price for a Nassau home was $481,300; in April, it was $537,500, an 11.6 percent jump. In Suffolk, the average price in April was $417,100, up 9.5 percent from $380,000 in January.
 ''This is because as interest rates go up, people are committing,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''They're saying, 'I want to buy now, no matter what.' So they're losing their negotiating strength.''
 Comprehensive statistics for western Connecticut were not available. But in Stamford, for example, the median price during the first quarter of this year was $606,000, 10.2 percent higher than $550,000 a year ago. And in Greenwich, the median price of $1.15 million during the first quarter of 2003 crept up to $1.675 million this year -- a mere 45.7 percent -- according to Jackie Hammock, a broker at Coldwell Banker in Greenwich. ''It's because we have had so many high-end sales this year,'' she said. ''The big boys are really out spending bonus money.''
 Is all the frenzy worth it?
 Over the long run, yes, insists Ms. Kingsley of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Homeownership lets you build wealth over the years,'' she said. ''It's mental security, it centers you, it keeps you stable.''
 Dr. Hughes at Rutgers backs that up with numbers. ''In the tristate region, home prices have tripled in a little more than two decades,'' he said. In New York State, since 1980, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, home values rose 393 percent; in New Jersey, 314 percent; in Connecticut, 271 percent.
 ''Even in inflation-adjusted terms, they more than doubled'' in the region over all, Dr. Hughes said -- in New York, by 134 percent; in New Jersey, by 96 percent and in Connecticut, by 76 percent. 
 ''Homeowners,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''were richly rewarded just for being alive.''

HEADLINE: Nicole Curvin, Dennis Wygmans

 BODY:
Nicole Patricia Curvin and Dennis Mark Wygmans were married yesterday at the Belvedere Mansion in Rhinebeck, N.Y. William Sanchez, the village justice of Rhinebeck, officiated.
 Ms. Curvin, 35, is keeping her name. She is an associate director of admissions at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University. She graduated from Wesleyan University and received a master's degree in higher education administration from Harvard. 
 The bride is the daughter of Patricia Curvin and Dr. Robert Curvin of Newark. Her father retired as the president of the Greentree Foundation, an organization in New York that works to improve international relations; he is now a visiting scholar at Rutgers University in Newark, where he teaches a course in economic development. Her mother, who retired as the chairwoman of the humanities department at the Arts High School in Newark, is now a training and sales consultant in Newark for Prentice Hall, the educational publisher. 
 Mr. Wygmans, 38, expects to receive a law degree from Seton Hall in Newark on Friday. Before attending law school he was an owner of Toast, a nightclub in Burlington, Vt. He graduated from the University of Vermont. He is a son of Margaret and James Wygmans of Essex Junction, Vt. His father retired as the chief data and information officer for the Vermont Agency of Human Services in Waterbury, Vt. His mother is a librarian at the Essex Free Library in Essex Center, Vt.
 Ms. Curvin was introduced to Mr. Wygmans at his nightclub in 1994. They became friendly, and Mr. Wygmans wondered whether there might be more to their relationship. 
 ''I had been thinking about inviting her on a date, but wasn't sure if she was interested,'' he recalled.
 So he invited her to dinner and a movie. His choice of film, ''Shallow Grave,'' a horror film about Scottish yuppies who evolve into killers, might have seemed a risky bet. But the evening played out just as Mr. Wygmans had hoped. 
 ''I wanted to make sure she'd have to sit close,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Calm Down. That Wolf at the Door Has Been Here Before.

BYLINE: By Ben Stein. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LATELY, even more than usual, the word of the day is fear.
 Fear of inflation and rising interest rates. Fear of oil shortages. Fear of rising energy prices, which is closely related. Fear of terrorism. Fear of rising -- and of falling -- commodity prices. Fear of a growth spurt in China -- and of a slowdown in China. Fear of an excessive trade deficit, and of too much debt at both the federal and household levels. Fear that the global climate is changing -- and, now, that the earth is growing darker year by year (although it is possible that the glass cases covering the measuring devices became dusty.) 
 Some of this is hitting the markets hard. Markets supposedly climb on a wall of worry when they're going up, but abhor uncertainty when they're going down. There is a bromide for every market situation. After all, there is always fear of something and always some market movement each day. And always someone trying to explain it. In particular, fears of escalating prices and rising interest rates are rattling the equities markets and laying waste the fixed-income markets.
 To be sure, there is always reason for fear. We are mortals. The markets rightly prefer lower interest rates for the discounting of earnings to the present, within our finite life span. When bond rates rise, older, low-interest-rate income securities fall in price, to raise their yields accordingly. This is real and sensible. But the degree of fear appears to be approaching hysteria in some quarters, and this may be overdone. After all, good decisions are rarely made in a state of hysteria.
 One of the best antidotes to fear is to consult with reality. Another is to consult with experience. On both counts, there is a certain amount of cause for optimism.
 For one thing, we are in the middle of a powerful recovery from the slowdown that began in 2000 or 2001. Corporate profits have reached historical highs. The stock market, as measured by the Dow Jones industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is at a more sensible level, compared with earnings, than it has been in more than five years, and possibly longer. In other words, stocks are priced more sensibly by historical measurements than at any levels since the bubble. The stock ''market'' is a market for buying future earnings, and, at least for the Dow, these are priced more reasonably than they have been since before Bill Clinton's second term.
 Housing is phenomenally strong. A record share -- more than two of three -- of Americans own their own homes. A high rate of home ownership is usually considered a sign of economic strength; it is also a prime cause of the increase in household indebtedness, as people acquire mortgages. Even with rising mortgage rates, there is little sign of a construction slowdown.
 The ''jobless recovery'' is over. New jobs are running at close to 300,000 a month, well above the average of 115,000 added each month in the era since World War II. There is even rapid growth in manufacturing employment.
 The economy now has a good kind of inertia on its side. Recoveries in the postwar era have tended to last about 50 months, on average, and they have generally grown longer as time has passed since V-J Day. If the current recovery started near the beginning of 2002, it still has at least two years to go -- and probably more, if it is in line with the average.
 What about the inflation and the oil and the commodities and the rising interest rates? Well, as Roseanne Roseannadanna used to say on ''Saturday Night Live,'' ''It's always something.'' But oil prices tend to fluctuate greatly when there is terrorism near oil-producing areas. So far -- and this is a fascinating fact in and of itself -- there has never been a long-lasting interruption in supply because of terrorism. Sharp price increases in oil tend to be followed by price declines. 
 (I hasten to add, however, that this is no excuse for not having a national program of conservation, turning coal into oil and doing anything else that will reasonably reduce our energy dependence on people who hate us. This kind of Project Independence, first proposed by my former boss, Richard M. Nixon, is long, long overdue.) 
 If oil reverts to historical patterns, this period of increases will be followed by a correction. Even if it is not, the economy has dealt with oil price gains before, and lived to tell the tale. And commodities are on a long-term downward, not upward, trend -- and upticks are often temporary. When they are not, many substitutions are possible.
 The economy can survive, and even prosper, amid far higher interest rates. The home builders say their studies tell them that buyers will keep coming out in droves, even if mortgage rates rise two or three percentage points. The housing market, after all, has boomed during times when rates were higher than they are now. So has the stock market, especially in the 1980's and 90's. And, during most of the last 40 years, higher rates have not stopped factories from being built or inventories from being financed. 
 Remember that the superlow rates of the last three years were put in place because of economic weakness. They were resuscitating measures. The patient is now on his way to robust good health. Life-support measures are not good for healthy patients.
 THE recent hammering of real estate investment trusts illustrates the spectrum of misconceptions. Yes, REIT's, especially highly leveraged ones, will not have the fillip of refinancing to drive up yields now that interest rates are rising. But they will have more tenants in commercial, hotel, warehouse and factory space, and the results will go largely to the bottom line.
 So it will be for the whole economy. Financing costs will be higher, but revenue will be sharply higher, and much of that goes to the bottom line.
 The federal deficit is a worry, but it is largely a function of economic activity, too. As the recovery continues, federal revenue will climb. (We also need a tax increase to fund fair pay for the military and a general rise in defense spending, but that is another subject.)
 To put it differently, as Adam Smith said, ''there is a lot of ruin in a nation.'' A tree as hardy as the American economy can take many blows but still keep growing and enriching us -- though, as my father used to say, it will never be rich enough to make each of us richer than our neighbors, which is what we really want. 
 We have problems, but the economy is amazingly supple and adaptive. The economy, as J.P. Morgan said of the stock market, will fluctuate. Right now, the economy is fluctuating sharply upward. Let's rejoice. 
 I am worried about the earth becoming dimmer, though. That might be a real problem. If it gets much dimmer, I won't be able to read all the bad news in the papers.

HEADLINE: Made in New York

BYLINE: By TOM VANDERBILT. 
Tom Vanderbilt is the author of ''Survival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America.''

 BODY:
NO. 70 Washington Street is one of those tired highway-facing Brooklyn facades with rows of irregularly lighted windows that the traffic-bound commuter, anxious for distraction, looks toward and idly wonders: What goes on in there?
 There are, in fact, a bewildering variety of enterprises contained within 70 Washington and its conjoined sister at 35 York Street, which occupy an entire block in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn and are typically thought of as one structure. 
 The names of these 50-odd enterprises are posted in the scuffed lobbies. But to appreciate their teeming diversity, one needs to enter the battered elevators and travel through the 12 stories of the off-white concrete structure, topped by a clock, that looms over the tangle where the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway meets the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge.
 By doing so, one enters a place that is becoming increasingly rare in New York. And come July, when all the tenants must be out so work can begin on the building's conversion to luxury condos, it will not exist at all in its current incarnation. 
 It is an environment at once cutting-edge and anachronistic, a place where one can find humming Apple G4's on one floor and hulking old Oswego Machine Works bookbinding contraptions on another. With its obscure businesses, the complex echoes the hazy half-remembered city filled with the forgotten '''beauty-supply districts'' and wholesale rock-candy salesmen that the cartoonist Ben Katchor conjures in his Julius Knipl strips.
 Like the rest of Dumbo, this structure has its artists and architects. One can find offices for cutting-edge lifestyle magazines like Surface and L, or for digital-age design firms like Domani Studios, much of whose work appears in pixels. But move to another floor and one finds a sprawling factory space with warrens of machines and supplies and dozens of immigrant workers, mostly women, cutting and stitching suede and velvet. 
 ''We manufacture displays for the jewelry industry,'' said Jerry Philip Silverstein, president of Style-Bilt Jewelry Case Company, from his office as traffic thundered by on the expressway. ''If you were to go into a jewelry store and saw displays in the windows for rings, earrings, pendants and neck busts, that's what we do.''
 Or go to another floor, and step out into a dim hallway where one sign says ''Friendly dog with loud bark on these premises,'' and another reminds ''pull out plugs, all machines off.'' In some 15,000 square feet of space, a company called FIST makes police training equipment like the ''Ultra Thin'' holster, which, as a brochure notes, ''makes the best gun-concealing setup possible.'' Jim Murnak, the company's founder, began his business after being mugged at gunpoint eight years ago near the York Street stop for the F train. ''I bought a gun,'' he explained, ''and didn't like the holsters.''
 Or ascend to yet another floor, and find yourself in a gloomy space filled with rows of gray metal shelving. Honk the bicycle horn attached to a metal gate, and if someone lets you in, you will be standing in what is said to be the largest distributor of magic tricks in North America: row after row of cardboard boxes from which rubber rats, ''vanishing crayons'' or some other obscure item one used to find advertised in the back of comic books spills out. Although the owner does not encourage inquiries from the public, this business, with its 35,000 square feet of joy buzzers, conjurers' handbooks and the like, is said to be the building's oldest tenant.
 Within a few weeks, these businesses and all the others under this roof will be packing up, if they haven't already, for the building's conversion.
 ''We had all the leases expire this year,'' said David Walentas, whose Two Trees Management firm controls most of the built space in Dumbo. ''This has been in the works for seven or eight years.'' 
 A good place to view the changes at the building is Front Street Pizza, a longtime lunch joint across the street that the current owners purchased in 1989, when its clientele was largely factory workers. ''We knew it was going to happen eventually,'' Larry Leonardi, the manager, said of the conversion. ''We've seen a lot of people come and go. But it'll be nice for our business.''
 By summer's end, the building will be empty. Like the ancient train tracks that still vein the pavement outside its doors, the industrial past of this neighborhood is slowly slipping from view. Soon the vast rooms will hold few clues as to who was there, and where they went. 

An Empire Built on Boxes
 ''Do you want to cut your rent to a prewar basis?'' an ad from 1928 cajoled. ''Do you want to get out of the traffic congestion area that so runs up costs and delays?'' And, lastly: ''Do you want live steam?'' A phone number, Lackawanna 1280, promised more information. 
 The real estate being pitched was ''Gairville,'' a collection of 10 buildings just a few steps from the Brooklyn Bridge in which the Scottish-born entrepreneur Robert S. Gair consolidated his hold on the cardboard box industry in America.
 Gair, described by his biographer, H. Allen Smith, as ''a grizzled giant of a man, as handsome as a portrait and as stubborn in his convictions as Toscanini,'' had established a beachhead across the river from Manhattan nearly half a century earlier. The first of many entrepreneurs to seek more space and lower rents in Brooklyn, he began building his factories in a dreary, slum-ridden district at the foot of Washington Street. 
 By World War I, Gairville, which included 70 Washington and 35 York, was complete, and at lunchtime, its guiding spirit would often, as his biographer noted, ''go into the street and stand near the factory entrance, beaming paternally as he watched the employees stream out.''
 ''In our metropolitan economy,'' Lewis Mumford wrote in looking back on the complex some years later, ''the fabrication of bags, cartons, boxes, is little short of a key industry, and the conspicuous bulk of the Gair factories on the East River is an emblem of the part that these paper containers play in our daily routine.''
 By 1919, however, Gair stockholders had decided that box factories should be closer to the mills where the raw materials came from, and as the Gair company began relocating upstate, emptying its buildings, the company went from selling boxes to selling real estate. The Gair Realty Corporation beckoned tenants to Gairville with brisk, common-sense come-ons: ''The supply of industrial workers is practically just around the corner.'' ''Watchman service.'' ''Good husky sized elevators in ample number.''
 The tenants who did come were largely from the garment industry, and would be for the next five decades. Antonio Garrido, who began shoving coal into boilers at the Gair buildings' steam complex in 1941, and eventually became property manager of the structures, recalls a number of other businesses that were located at 70 Washington and 35 York. ''They used to cook canned soups in there,'' said Mr. Garrido, now 83 and living on Staten Island. ''They used to do a lot of Army materials, too -- uniforms, and those big spotlights to light up planes.'' 
 Mr. Garrido worked under several different management regimes, including the Helmsley-Spear group, which owned the 10 Gair buildings until Mr. Walentas arrived on the scene in 1981, in search of the next SoHo. Of the building he is now converting, Mr. Walentas recalls: ''When we bought it, it was needle trade -- schmatte manufacturing.'' That was not all. ''The best one I remember was a whole floor that did mannequin manufacturing. He'd been there forever, and there were racks of body parts stacked to the ceiling. The place was abandoned, and it took six weeks and how many containers just to clean the place out; 30,000 square feet of body parts.'' 
 George Pastor, who succeeded Mr. Garrido as property manager, recalled that during the 1980's, efforts were made to pitch this and other Dumbo structures as a back-office redoubt for Wall Street investment firms. But with few local amenities, that effort failed, and at the building it was business as usual, its tenants mostly garment manufacturers paying $3 a square foot or less. 
 The building also had security issues. ''The factories produced things that kids could peddle on the streets,'' Mr. Pastor recalled. ''Jackets and sweaters were a commodity for them. It was an ongoing battle to keep them out of the businesses.''

Enter the Green Velvet
 In the mid-80's, another kind of tenant began appearing in buildings like this. Ivan Schwartz, who with his brother runs Studio EIS, an acclaimed sculptural fabrication studio, was lured to the building by a sculptor friend who had a top-floor studio. 
 ''At that time, there were printers, light manufacturing, a whole variety of the kinds of things that are gradually, simply disappearing from view -- they're either being manufactured in China, or they're being produced elsewhere,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''The kinds of things that one would look and say, 'I have no idea how these people make a living, doing what they're doing.''' 
 While most of the factory workers who were the building's prime occupants have slowly trickled away, Mr. Schwartz is still impressed when the elevator door opens on a business like Mr. Silverstein's, with its mass of velvet and machinery. ''When the elevator door opens, one jokingly refers to it as Calcutta,'' Mr. Schwartz said, ''not because of the people who work there, but just because the entryway is so astonishing, in its green color and all the stuff that is piled so high.'' 
 By the 1990's, tenants like Mr. Schwartz were no longer the exception. Each new lease seemed to augur broader economic change. Old-line businesses moved to the suburbs or were passed on, often to indifferent sons and daughters. One tenant, Dale Corvino, even made money by just renting empty space, as a venue for weddings and photo shoots; he left in part because of the building's frequent elevator problems: ''You can't have Lil' Kim climbing up 12 flights of stairs to get to a photo shoot,'' he said.
 Jonah Zuckerman, the founder of City Joinery, a high-end custom woodworking shop, moved into 70 Washington Street five years ago. 
 ''The guy I took over made foam shoulder pads for women,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. ''It was called Ideal Shoulder Pad. He was weeping the day I came in to pick up the keys. He was beside himself. It was his father-in-law's business that he had taken over and struggled to make it work, and it wasn't so much that they were raising the rent as that business had become so hard he couldn't justify signing a new lease. He said it was imports from Brazil.''
 Mr. Zuckerman wishes he could stop time for a spell, so as to appreciate what an amazing mix -- white collar, along with businesses that ''made stuff, made fumes, made noise'' -- the building is. But time is running out for such ruminations. Mr. Zuckerman plans to move by June into 20 Jay Street, a newly acquired Two Trees property. Others have already left.
 ''The sixth floor just vacated,'' he said a few weeks ago. ''It was a giant sweatshop of all Chinese labor. They left a sea of clothing and fabric and garbage. We took a bunch of their work tables. It's like they just took their sewing machines and whatever was valuable and left this unbelievable mess, this sea of garbage.''

The Fading Sound of an Era
 On the one hand, the closing of this building is another signal moment in the continuing diaspora of deindustrialization, as yet another neighborhood changes its character and businesses look for the next urban frontier. Mr. Silverstein, for example, the jewelry display manufacturer, says he was close to signing a lease on a space in Jamaica, Queens. 
 ''I have to find a space that's near a subway,'' he said. ''I've gone to see some spaces that, frankly, I wouldn't feel comfortable in. I happen to think this is a nice area. But if I wanted to stay in this area now, my rent would more than double. The kind of business I'm in, I don't want to pay double the rent.'' Were he to stay in Dumbo, he might have to; space that cost a dollar or so a square foot in the early 80's now commands up to $40 a square foot. On the other hand, many of the tenants, from the holster maker Jim Murnak to tenants like Coburn Architects, are simply relocating to other buildings owned by Mr. Walentas, particularly 55 Washington and 20 Jay, which for many years were used for purposes like storing the city's voting machines. To that end, Mr. Walentas has been ''cycling out'' businesses like a distributor of porn films from 20 Jay, and actively pursuing artists and craftsmen like City Joinery.
 Mr. Walentas extends little pity to the idea that former factory walls will no longer reverberate with the clatter of machinery. ''People used to say we were going to displace manufacturing,'' he said. ''Landlords didn't displace manufacturing; manufacturing changed. The city changed. I would say Jesus can't protect manufacturing. It's been going out of business for 50 years.''
 But some industrial tenants have suggested that if the city doesn't want to lose people like them, landlords who are given permission to convert their buildings should also be required to take care of the tenants being replaced and efforts should be made to help them relocate. In February, David Yassky, the councilman who represents Dumbo, introduced a bill that would tax the residential conversion of industrial space.Yet some, like Mr. Schwartz of Studio EIS, still see echoes of Robert Gair's entrepreneurial spirit at work, with or without help. ''You're still talking about people who risk it all by doing odd and idiosyncratic things, like manufacturing boxes,'' he said. ''Their attitude is that nobody owes me a thing, and I'll just go out and find another space.''
 At 70 Washington and 35 York, where Mr. Garrido used to move factory workers in freight elevators to handle the peak-hour demand, there are no more crowds of industrial employees. From the time Mr. Zuckerman of City Joinery arrived, he has seen the building go from two union-operated freight elevators per building to one. This particular day, the freight elevator at 35 York was out of service, and an obscenity had been scrawled on the sign announcing this fact. 
 ''The freight elevator on this building isn't running,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''It has to have some kind of inspection. It will never see the light of day again. There will never be a guy operating the freight on this building. That's kind of symbolic; it's the end of that age.''

HEADLINE: Colleges Struggle to Attract Job Recruiters to Campuses

BYLINE: By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
Four years ago, it did not take much to lure corporate recruiters from cities like New York and Boston to Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., to interview the latest crop of students at the graduate business school. Now it takes free rides on a corporate jet that is paid for by alumni. 
 ''When the job market isn't great, not all recruiters are willing to go out of their way to get to us,'' said Karin Ash, director of the Career Management Center at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell.
 Only one airline serves Ithaca, Ms. Ash said, and recruiters who come to the school must often spend the night, taking two days out of their schedules. 
 ''Not everyone's going to take the time, especially in a weaker job market,'' she said. 
 With a job market that has been tight for several years, many colleges and universities are going to great lengths to help their students catch the eyes of recruiters.Since the fall 2001 recruiting season, the number of visits to college campuses has declined as much as 50 percent, said Steven Rothberg, president and founder of CollegeRecruiter.com, a Web site for college students and recent graduates.
 Ms. Ash said that career development officers at 25 other top business schools had told her that recruiting visits were 25 to 40 percent below the 2000-1 level. 
 In addition, while recruiters are still visiting most of the nation's top schools, the second-tier universities and the schools that are far from urban centers ''have been largely ignored'' by some companies, Mr. Rothberg said. 
 This year's job prospects seem more promising for recent college and business school graduates. Employers plan to hire 11.2 percent more college graduates from the class of 2004 than from the class of 2003, according to an April report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. And business schools report moderate increases in the number of offers their students have received by this point in the year.
 Nonetheless, corporate recruiters are still being highly selective about the campuses they visit. 
 To combat that trend, some schools have set up Web conferencing rooms where potential employers can interview students without setting foot on campus; others have started busing students to major cities to meet recruiters. 
 At Cornell, a group of business school alumni is underwriting the airlifting of recruiters who have at least one job to fill. Since the program was started last year, it has attracted more than two dozen recruiters from companies including Bear, Stearns & Company and the Dreyfus Corporation.
 Last year, those recruiters made 24 job offers to Cornell's M.B.A. students. So far this year, five recruiters who have flown aboard the alumni-sponsored jets have made offers to the school's 117 first- and second-year students.
 ''In a dreary market, you've got to be creative,'' Ms. Ash said.
 Penn State University is also taking unusual steps to bring students and recruiters together. On April 21, the university bused more than 100 undergraduates from its College of Communications to New York City for a networking fair. 
 The college's career center organized the event because recruiters from advertising agencies and public relations firms were not coming to the campus to interview students, said Bob Martin, director of career placement and internships for the College of Communications. 
 Bringing the students to New York, Mr. Martin said, meant that recruiters based in Manhattan ''only needed to commit five hours'' to seeing the college's students. Traveling to the school, which is in State College, Pa., near the middle of the state, could be an eight-hour drive round trip, or 240 miles one way.
 Tracey Foster, director of West Coast operations for Development Counsellors International, a marketing firm based in New York, was one of 28 recruiters who attended the event. While her firm is not currently hiring, she said she left ''with a stack of resumes,'' including those of three students whom she was especially eager to pursue should an opening arise.
 Ms. Foster, a Penn State alumna, said she would not have been able to travel to the campus on a recruiting visit. ''It was a great opportunity for us to meet students we wouldn't have been able to meet otherwise,'' she said.
 At the University of Maryland in College Park, career development officers brought in expert assistance after only 73 percent of the second-year students at the Robert H. Smith School of Business had received offers by graduation in the spring of 2002. ''We realized we needed to be more aggressive in attracting prospective employers,'' said Janet Richert, managing director of the business school's office of career management. 
 In the spring of 2003, the business school hired an executive recruiting firm, Stanton Chase, to help M.B.A. students connect with potential employers. Students have been meeting weekly in teams with a Stanton Chase counselor where they trade job-hunting strategies, receive career advice and learn about openings in their fields.
 Working with the executive search firm helped Paul Zeckser, an M.B.A. student who will graduate this month, land an offer recently with a small technology company in Boston. Mr. Zeckser said his counselor at Stanton Chase urged him to be more aggressive in his search, telling him he would need to approach at least 125 companies with his resume. 
 Mr. Zeckser followed the counselor's advice and began calling at least 10 companies a week at the beginning of the year. By March, he had been on six informational interviews and two more formal interviews. He received the offer from the technology company at the end of April, and he says he plans to accept it.
 After using the search firm, Ms. Richert said, the business school's placement rate for the class of 2003 rose to 85 percent. 
 Working to woo recruiters to a college campus can be exhausting -- and costly. Ms. Ash of Cornell, for one, hopes the school will not have to fly recruiters to campus again next year.
 ''Our hope is that the economy is improving enough that we won't have to take such drastic measures,'' she said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Military Says Shiite Rebels Seem to Have Ceded Karbala

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: KARBALA, Iraq, Sunday, May 23 

 BODY:
American commanders said early Sunday that insurgents loyal to a rebel cleric appeared to have given up control of central Karbala, where they had been shielding themselves at two shrines.
 According to the commanders, there were several strong signs that the armed supporters of Moktada al-Sadr, the maverick Shiite cleric, have abandoned the area and ceded authority to the Americans and their allies after nearly three weeks of urban combat.
 A large overnight raid met no resistance coming from a group of buildings where insurgents had been firing at American tanks with rocket-propelled grenades. Civilians were seen returning to homes in central Karbala that they had abandoned during fierce fighting. And in the afternoon on Saturday, tribal sheiks approached American commanders offering to persuade the militia, the Mahdi Army, to lay down its arms and leave the city. 
 ''It looks like they just packed up and went home,'' Col. Peter Mansoor, commander of the First Brigade of the First Armored Division, said in an operations tent on the city outskirts where he monitored field reports. Referring to Mr. Sadr, Colonel Mansoor said, ''I think his days are numbered.''
 At around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, in the midst of the raid, three Iraqi civilians walked up to American soldiers and asked why they would attack the buildings. The civilians said the Mahdi Army had dropped their weapons on Friday night and left the area, according to a radio dispatch from an American field commander.Not a shot was fired Friday night at a large convoy of Bradley fighting vehicles driving through the city center -- something unheard of since the First Armored Division began its offensive nearly three weeks ago. 
 At 12:45 a.m. on Sunday, soldiers at the scene of the raid saw 10 Iraqi police cars and three police pickup trucks speeding up to the outskirts of the old city with their lights flashing. The police officers told the soldiers they were doing a patrol. The fact that the police could travel around the old city, if only on the outskirts, indicated that the insurgents were no longer in control, Colonel Mansoor said.
 During the raid early Sunday, Iraqis at a nearby teahouse told soldiers that busloads of fighters from Falluja who came to town last week had left Friday. The fighters fled after concluding that they could not stand up to American tanks, these Iraqis said.
 An Iraqi reporter for The New York Times in Karbala said he had seen militiamen putting their weapons in bags in recent days and trying to leave the city. Some residents of the city have distributed fliers denouncing Mr. Sadr and the presence of his fighters.
 American commanders said they would press the Iraqi police to do patrols in the old city in the next week. Whether and how the police get attacked will determine how much is left of the insurgency, the commanders said.
 If the insurgency in Karbala has truly dissipated, then Mr. Sadr's six-week insurrection has suffered badly. Though the Americans clamped down on the rebellion, Mr. Sadr had managed to maintain his grip on three towns: Karbala; the nearby holy city of Najaf, where he lives; and Kufa, a town adjacent to Najaf where Mr. Sadr preaches.
 He might be restricted to Najaf and Kufa, but the Americans are testing those cities, too, though with care.
 American officials say they have no intention of sending soldiers into the heart of Najaf, which is centered around the Shrine of Ali, dedicated to the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. They say they fear such an attack could provoke a backlash from Shiite Muslims around the world, and would prefer that senior clerics persuade Mr. Sadr to surrender.
 Early Sunday morning, Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network, reported that clashes had broken out in some areas of Najaf. Explosions could be heard in the background as a reporter spoke. The Americans sent a large patrol through adjoining Kufa, but no shots were fired, Colonel Mansoor said.
 The apparent withdrawal of Mahdi fighters from the central shrine area in Karbala came after nearly three weeks of intense combat in which American officers said more than 120 insurgents were killed. The Americans destroyed large parts of the city's downtown to flush out the insurgents. In the last week, the Americans had called in an AC-130 Specter gunship to strafe militiamen standing around the shrines with 40-millimeter cannon fire.
 Karbala has been the scene of the most intense urban warfare in Iraq since the siege of Falluja ended last month. The Americans failed to pacify Falluja through military force because the revolt there had broad support, and the city became a symbol of resistance to the occupation. By contrast, Mr. Sadr's militia here has lost much of its backing since it took over Karbala last month, largely because the violence it brought has driven away Shiite pilgrims and wrecked the local economy.
 Four American soldiers have been killed and at least 52 wounded in the nearly three-week offensive. It is the highest casualty rate suffered by the First Battalion, 37th Armor Regiment of the First Armored Division since it arrived in Iraq last May. 
 After being approached by the sheiks on Saturday afternoon, ''it was pretty clear to me that we were approaching endgame, and that's my fervent hope,'' Colonel Mansoor said. ''They were clearly looking for a way out.''
 At a briefing for unit commanders before the night raid, Lt. Col. Garry R. Bishop, the battalion commander, said: ''They're trying to convince us that the Mahdi Army will be out of the area today. We'll see. One way or another, they will be.''
 The Americans also sent a battalion to do a simultaneous raid on a farming compound in Husseiniya, a village nine miles northeast of Karbala. The soldiers found only women, children and some old men. 
 The raid in downtown Karbala took place at a school and surrounding buildings immediately northeast of the golden-domed Shrine of Hussein and Shrine of Abbas. Before the raid, military analysts said recent intelligence reports indicated that as many as 150 fighters were holed up in the school, many of them from outside Iraq. To the surprise of the soldiers, they found only civilians in the area, who told them the insurgents had left. The Americans ended up detaining 10 men for questioning. ''It's maybe an indication that Moktada's militia is on its last legs,'' Colonel Mansoor said. ''They don't want to come out and play.''
 Fighting over the last week had been edging closer to the shrines, dedicated to two of the most revered Shiite Muslim martyrs. But early Friday morning, American forces withdrew from the Mukhaiyam Mosque, a nearby building they had occupied on May 12 after a pitched battle with insurgents in the area.
 The mosque had become a foothold for the Americans in the dense urban landscape of downtown Karbala, and the Army had lost three men just trying to defend it from snipers and mortar teams.
 The retreat came at a time when the American military was being forced to defend itself in light of the prison scandal at Abu Ghraib and of an air attack on Wednesday near in the Syrian border in which 41 people were killed. On Friday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Beirut and Bahrain against the American presence in the Shiite holy areas. 
 Before withdrawing, the Americans attacked the school northeast of the Shrine of Abbas with tanks and called in an AC-130 to pound the area. The gunship also shot up a building immediately south of the shrine believed to be the headquarters of Hamza al-Tai, the local leader of the Mahdi Army. At least 21 people were killed in the attacks, helping to lay the foundation for the overture by the sheiks and the apparent withdrawal by the militia, officers said.
 ''The tribal leaders were going to make a public announcement in the media to tell the Mahdi Army to lay down their arms and leave the city,'' Colonel Bishop said after the meeting with the sheiks on Saturday.
 Hundreds of American soldiers with Task Force 1-37 moved into Camp Lima on the city outskirts on the weekend of May 1. Then in the early hours of May 5, the task force began its first big assault, going down Governor's Street in the Mukhaiyam neighborhood and opening fire on suspected insurgent strongholds. That signaled to the insurgents that the Americans had arrived.

ON PARADISE DRIVE
How We Live Now (and Always Have) in the Future Tense.
By David Brooks.
304 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $25.
 For several years, in the world of political journalism, David Brooks has been every liberal's favorite conservative. This is not just because he throws us a bone of agreement every now and then. Even the most poisonous propagandist (i.e., Bill O'Reilly) knows that trick. Brooks goes farther. In his writing and on television, he actually seems reasonable. More than that, he seems cuddly. He gives the impression of being open to persuasion. Like the elderly Jewish lady who thinks someone must be Jewish because ''he's so nice,'' liberals suspect that a writer as amiable as Brooks must be a liberal at heart. Some conservatives think so too. 
 There is a prize for being the liberals' favorite conservative, and Brooks has claimed it: a column in The New York Times. With Brooks, The Times continues its probably unintentional experiment in reinventing the political column. First came Frank Rich, who added culture, high and low, to the traditional tired stew of Washington concerns. Maureen Dowd added psychiatry -- trying to understand politicians as real people, usually not to their advantage. Thomas Friedman added parables, circling the globe in search of small but sturdy anecdotes to support huge structures of metaphor. 
 Brooks adds social anthropology. His distinctive combination of wisdom and wisecracks, now available to readers of this newspaper, was perfected in his previous book, ''Bobos in Paradise,'' a funny examination of the 1960's generation as it negotiates the twin perils of aging and prosperity. His new book, ''On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (and Always Have) in the Future Tense,'' applies the Brooks technique to the whole darn country. He starts by slicing and dicing the American population into categories and subcategories, each with its own values and habits and sartorial preferences. Then he turns around and puts us all back together again, reinterpreting his previous examples of our differences as evidence of our essential similarity. It's a bravura performance and always entertaining, if not always convincing. 
 The Brooks sociological method has four components: fearless generalizing, clever coinage, jokes and shopping lists. In the April issue of Philadelphia Magazine, the journalist Sasha Issenberg nailed Brooks, a local boy, pretty hard on some of his generalizations. Checking out the assertions in a couple of magazine articles that were partly incorporated into this book, Issenberg reported that, contrary to Brooks, people in blue states (those that went Democratic in 2000) don't read more books than people in red (Republican) states. Nor do reds buy more items on QVC. ''When it comes to yardwork,'' Brooks had written, ''they have rider mowers; we have illegal aliens.'' Part of Brooks's charm is that he often includes himself (disingenuously, but that makes the gesture even grander) in groups he is mocking. But Issenberg reports that red states tend to have more illegal aliens than blue ones. 
 Brooks defends his generalizations as poetic hyperbole and got disappointingly pompous with Issenberg, according to him, when confronted with their inaccuracy. But this won't do. When he says that a store in a suburban mall is ''barely visible because of the curvature of the earth,'' that is poetic hyperbole. When he claims that it is impossible to spend more than $20 for dinner in a Red Lobster, that is just wrong, and mystifyingly so. As Issenberg points out, these little factoids are credibility crutches. They are the difference between sociology and shtick. America's cities needn't actually be full of ''African bistros where El Salvadoran servers wearing Palestinian kaffiyehs serve Virginia Woolf wannabes Slovakian beer'' in order to justify this typical Brooks formulation. But there ought to be one Salvadoran server somewhere who routinely wears a kaffiyeh -- and I wonder if there is one. 
 At the very least, Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke. Among some of the formerly young, ''the energy that once went into sex and raving now goes into salads.'' O.K., that's funny. So is essentially the same joke a few pages later, when Brooks writes that ''bathroom tile is their cocaine.'' Except that now he's referring to a different one of his demographic slices, which undermines the claim to sociology. And when another joke surfaces three times, it undermines the shtick as well. The ''16-foot refrigerators with the through-the-door goat cheese and guacamole delivery systems''? Ha ha. A large Home Depot salesman ''looking like an S.U.V. in human form''? Ha ha ha. S.U.V.'s ''so big they look like the Louisiana Superdome on wheels''? Enough already. 
 ''In America, it is acceptable to cut off any driver in a vehicle that costs a third more than yours. That's called democracy.'' True? Funny? Wouldn't the joke work just as well the other way? ''. . . a third less than yours. That's called capitalism.'' And if it works both ways as a joke, it must not work at all as a sociological insight. 
 In his fondness for coining phrases and his show-off use of commercial brand names as shorthand for demographic nuances, Brooks clearly takes after the country's greatest living conservative social observer, Tom Wolfe. Like the factoid bubbles so skillfully burst in Philadelphia Magazine, the brand names are there as evidence that you're not talking through your hat. So the nuances had better be right. As far as I know, most of Brooks's are. As far as I know is not very far in some shopping areas. I must take his word about Corian countertops. But in the case of Trader Joe's, to which Brooks devotes a multipage riff, I feel more at home. And Brooks has failed to solve the mystery of this appealing but hard-to-define California-based food chain. 
 The term ''Bobos'' (short for ''bourgeois bohemians'') almost joined Tom Wolfe classics like ''the right stuff'' and ''radical chic'' in the Coinage Hall of Fame. The test of a successful coinage (I state with Brooksian bluff-authority) is whether many people use the term without knowing where it came from. If ''Bobos'' ultimately fell short, keep in mind that the challenge was daunting. It would have had to displace a beloved and long-established incumbent -- ''yuppies'' -- describing roughly the same phenomenon. The near miss must have hurt. In his new book, Brooks flings coinage after coinage up against the zeitgeist, hoping that one will stick. Among the more promising contenders are the ''crunchy zone'' (one of his suburban slices), the ''meatloaf line'' (between distant suburbs, where they allegedly don't eat meatloaf, and real rural America, where they do), ''Patio Man'' (from an already famous Brooksian epic about purchasing a barbecue at Home Depot) and ''conquest shopping'' (from the same saga). 
 When he turns from the task of subdividing Americans to the task of stitching us back together, Brooks becomes as incomprehensible as the subtitle of this book. (What does it mean to ''live in the future tense''?) Near as I can tell, Brooks's argument is a variation on the famous Turner thesis. The historian Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in 1893, just as America's western expansion was more or less complete, that the empty West had served as the country's defining fact and safety valve. The ever-present possibility of picking up and moving west had made Americans free and equal, and had spared us the conflicts of class and nation that infected the Old World of Europe. 
 Brooks's thesis -- to give it more clarity than he does, at the risk of getting it wrong -- seems to be that the suburbs and exurbs play a similar role in 21st-century America. Although sometimes he seems to be saying that the ''move on'' energy of Americans comes from technology like the Internet, or is more spiritual than geographical or material anyway. In any event, our defining -- and uniting -- characteristics as Americans, according to Brooks, are that we'd rather leave than fight, and we're always thinking about the future instead of dwelling on the past. That means the enormous gulfs in values, aspirations, understanding of the world and food preferences he outlines so wittily in the first part of ''On Paradise Drive'' don't turn Americans against one another (as they would the folks of some clotted and backward Old World nation). We all prosper in our various cultural cul-de-sacs (or as Brooks puts it, much better: ''Everybody can be an aristocrat within his own Olympus''), and we don't trouble ourselves about what the folks in the next cul-de-sac might be up to. No skin off our backs. 
 The Brooks thesis, if I've got it right, is a lovely, sweet thesis, as genial as the author himself. But a better answer to the question of why, if Americans are so diverse, we get along so much better than those foreigners, might be, ''What in the world are you talking about?'' It certainly is not obvious that the spirit of live-and-let-live is stronger in America than elsewhere. The citizens of other countries at our economic level, like those in the old nations of Europe, seem generally better than we are, not worse, at not rubbing one another raw. Maybe that is because they know they will be rubbing up against one another in any case. 
 Brooks almost makes this point himself a while later: ''America is not only the nation where you can get a supersize tub of French fries to go with our 32-ounce double cheeseburger, it is also just about the only nation where people blow up abortion clinics.'' But this comes while he is riffing about Americans' inclination toward excess, rather than our mystical ability to get along. So that's different. 
 Brooks has a wise and funny few pages turning the familiar golf concept of ''par'' into a universal suburban state of grace: 
 ''Your DVD collection is organized, and so is your walk-in closet. Your car is clean and vacuumed, your frequently dialed numbers are programmed into your cordless phone, your telephone plan is suited to your needs, and your various gizmos interact without conflict. Your spouse is athletic, your kids are bright, your job is rewarding, your promotions are inevitable, everywhere you need to be comes with its own accessible parking. You look great in casual slacks.'' 
 Unfortunately, he couldn't resist doing practically the same clever thing with a remark from the autobiography of Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, about the importance of French fries. Brooks conjures up a mystical concept called ''Fry!,'' defined roughly as monomania about some business goal, preferably one that seems shallow or pointless in the larger scheme of things. This he also presents as a spiritual state of grace, and he credits the business executives who religiously ''Follow Your Fry!'' with America's economic success. 
 These riffs will not win prizes for internal consistency. In the Fry! discussion, there are detours into the culture of frequent flier points and the obsession with upgrades, among other topics. These are hilarious, but Brooks seems to forget his premise that Fry! is about monomania. That hardly matters if he's not trying to be serious. But he is trying to be serious, at least sometimes. He says he wants to rescue American civilization from the charge that it is shallow, and his main argument against that charge is that seemingly shallow behavior like shopping for the perfect barbecue or marketing the perfect French fry is actually a deeply spiritual quest, on a continuum with those of the Pilgrims arriving from the east and the pioneers heading west. We're certainly not going to buy that notion if the author himself can be distracted from it whenever the possibility of a good joke floats by. 
 ''Is he serious?'' is an interesting question about David Brooks. But a more important question, for Brooks himself and for all of humanity (now that he is a Times columnist), is ''Is he conservative?'' Although Brooks's mockery is genial rather than sneery and distancing like Tom Wolfe's, there is no doubt that if a professed liberal New York Times columnist, say Paul Krugman, were to describe the products and culture of capitalism the way Brooks does, his lines would be cited and denounced on every right-wing radio talk show. 
 When he ridicules consumer appetites, Brooks is safely within the permissible, rueful conservative critique of capitalism's ''contradictions.'' When he writes of the ''tediousness of pod after pod of the highway-side office parks'' and the ''sheer existential nothingness of an office-park lobby,'' he sounds quaintly like the cultural critics of American capitalism in the 1950's and 60's. But when he declares that hard-working business executives are living their ''whole lives'' in a furrow -- ''in that furrow, your personality becomes a mere selling device. Friendships become contacts. The urge to improve deteriorates to mere acquisitiveness. Money becomes the measure of accomplishment'' -- well, frankly, that sounds more than a bit like Karl Marx, doesn't it? 
 And it gets even worse. In an uncharacteristically heavy-handed passage, Brooks imagines an effete French intellectual confronting a straightforward, honest, rough-hewn Nevada trucker. Boy, does that Frog learn a thing or two. Brooks's complaint is not that the French hate Americans, but that they love us for the wrong reasons:
 ''Our eager openness to everything, our capacity for mindless fun. . . . The convertible nation, ripping off our tube tops, yipping like banshees as we cruise down the freeway from cineplex to surf shop. How charming! How wild! How seductive the Americans are, with all their careless money and ingenuous vitality!'' 
 Brooks calls this a ''pro-American insult,'' but it is alarmingly close to his own pro-American critique. And when he goes on to imagine his French intellectual ''posing like a great Gallic hunter'' next to a ''bon mot he has bagged on the American desert,'' the appalling truth becomes unavoidable. 
 David Brooks is not merely a liberal. He's French. 
 J'accuse.

TRANSMISSION
By Hari Kunzru.
276 pp. New York:
Dutton. $24.95.
 The problem with tearing a novel from the headlines is that headlines don't last much longer than old newspapers. It's an impossible project anyway, right up there with perfecting perpetual motion. Even if it took no time at all to write a few hundred pages of polished prose, it would still require a score of news cycles to typeset, bind and distribute the physical books. And then folks still have to get around to reading them. There's no way to avoid it: unless they find a wormhole, novelists will stand in relation to the headlines as the French and the Germans do to rock 'n' roll: doomed to play a tin-eared game of catch-up whenever they try to play at all. 
 The fact that all contemporary fiction is now, by definition, historical fiction is hard to deny, but it's much, much harder to face, of course -- particularly for talented young novelists, like Britain's Hari Kunzru, who don't want to cede the present entirely to cable news personalities and Internet posters. Kunzru -- who turned down a prize for his first novel because he felt the London newspaper that sponsored it, The Mail on Sunday, had ''pursued an editorial policy of vilifying and demonizing refugees and asylum-seekers,'' and who went on to win a spot on Granta magazine's prestigious list of the best young British novelists -- is as up-to-date as writers come, with interests in technology, pop culture and the economics of globalization. If anyone deserves a shot at breaching the literary space-time continuum and doing what logic says can't be done, it's Kunzru.
 ''Transmission'' is his brave attempt. Making this exercise in timeliness even tougher than it has to be, the novel revolves around computers, which become obsolete even faster than morning papers. Even when they're hooked up to the Web and continually fed with software updates, computers now go to seed within a year, but put them into the pages of a novel, away from their modems, and the things are stillborn. A plot formed around their latest capabilities and influenced by their current limitations is irrelevant by the time the pages are spell-checked. It's science fiction in reverse.
 Which is why, now more than ever, novels need characters. ''Transmission'' has one very good one, Arjun Mehta, a shy young programmer who grows up in stultifying middle-class India and dreams of emigrating to racy America. Anyone who watched the news last night will instantly understand the humor here and feel for poor Arjun from the beginning. To leave a booming country of high-tech outsourcing for the shrunken horizons of Silicon Valley is to tilt against the megatrends. As Arjun flies west, new visa in his pocket and visions of third-rate TV stars in his head, the jobs he wants are flying east. Sadly, he doesn't see them as they wing past; he only discovers their absence after he lands.
 Arjun's fate plays out from there with a ticktock determinism that points back to Dreiser, Upton Sinclair and the French naturalists. It's a curious attitude to strike these days, when Americans feel that the color of their parachutes is up to them and not the demigods. Kunzru is writing from England, though, remember, where long-view intellectuals still brood over history's chain-link dialectics and humanity's puny impotence. Punch-the-air Tony Robbins-style optimism has never cut it along the Thames, not with the diploma holders, and deluded characters like Arjun who fall for the gospel of wealth and self-improvement are ground up by these dark thinkers to make their bread (which is eaten with jam at Harold Pinter's house). Once Kunzru sets Arjun down on the West Coast and surrounds him with conniving corporate double talkers, soulless strip malls and all the other bad things that orthodox air-conditioned-nightmare satirists have been kicking around for half a century now, the little fellow doesn't have a chance. As a fundamentalist Euro-pessimist, Kunzru simply can't allow him one, lest Arjun find happiness even for a moment (while drinking a Coke at a strip mall, heaven forbid) and call into question the faith's core teaching: the pursuit of the good life equals death, especially when it occurs in California.
 While Arjun suffers his pummeling, drifting in and out of crummy jobs, boning up on lame American slang and finally winding up outside Seattle testing antivirus software for a paranoid numbskull of a boss, there are funny moments of real pathos that make one wish his creator would loosen his handcuffs and let him find his own odd path. To reassure his parents back in India, who believe he's on track for early millionaire-hood, he lies about meeting the likes of David Hasselhoff. After somehow managing to meet a woman, he takes her to a corny Indian movie and misses the fact that his girlfriend is bored to tears. As it happens, the woman isn't even his girlfriend; Arjun, a naive virgin, just thinks she is. The agony of finding out otherwise, and of losing his new job, pushes his story into headline territory, whereupon it begins to break down like an old hard drive.
 Arjun unleashes a killer computer virus -- one that features his favorite Bollywood actress, the seductive Leela Zahir -- in order to try to prevent his being fired. (He hopes to save the day by ultimately stopping it.) Kunzru lucidly, systematically details the virus's progress through the global nervous system, even though nothing crucial would be lost if he merely wrote ''It spread and spread.'' Tom Clancy fans love and require tricky fact sheets because Clancy's plotlines hinge on technicalities that one must puzzle out as they emerge. From this sort of novel, though, readers expect new metaphors, not credible blueprints for world destruction. They want imagery that compresses and synthesizes the dizzy razzle-dazzle of events. Who cares how computer viruses proliferate or how exactly they disrupt the power grid, cause collisions at congested intersections and screw up airport arrival schedules? What do these darned computer viruses mean -- or what can they be made to mean? Besides, that is, that we're all interconnected, for good or for evil, for better or for worse. We already knew that from ''The Matrix.'' 
 This is probably the novel's big message, too, because, really, what else could it be? It's in the title. It's also meant to be in the novel's structure, which tells two other stories besides Arjun's that the virus eventually brings together in much the same fashion that hovering flying saucers used to function in B movies. (Cut from African chieftain gazing skyward to shot of wide-eyed Little League right fielder spotting the Martians and missing easy pop-up.) The more diverting story of the pair, because it's somewhat unfamiliar, tracks the shooting of Leela Zahir's new movie -- a sloppy gob of overemotional soap that's set in bonny Scotland, of all places -- and includes an arresting little digression into the life of its tortured leading man, whose messy sex life has landed him in the clutches of a sadistic, manipulative mob boss. 
 The other sub-story doesn't need to be here but it fits, more or less, because any story would fit as long as it featured a computer susceptible to attack by Arjun's rogue code. The virus device is nothing if not adaptable, and the choices it offers could drive a writer bats. This may be why Kunzru picks a proven scenario: the frantic, drug-fueled, greed-addled unraveling of a smarmy young white-boy capitalist who realizes he's in above his head but thinks that if he just runs a little faster he can redeem himself with one last deal, after which he'll finally marry his mistress and settle down in the country with a good book. His name in this case, Guy Swift, is so spot on that it's surprising it hasn't been used before, and his plunge from the cocaine high life to the gutter shares the same quality of deja vu. Yes, the tale is cleverly told, and yes, Kunzru's shots at the pseudoscience of ''branding'' are as stinging as Don DeLillo's recent slaps at the voodoo cult of currency trading, Tom Wolfe's blasts at the 1980's bond market, and so on and so on, but when will this rant stop? 
 Talk about falling victim to a virus. Those pesky bugs also dwell in novelists' brains.
 Like an unsaved file on a computer, ''Transmission'' dissolves back into random electrons the moment one turns it off. The reader may still be grinning over its good bits, may still feel impressed by Kunzru's verbal agility, but then he'll pick up his remote, switch on the news, and out will billow the great gray cloud of war footage, food safety warnings and terrorist threats. Novelists just can't compete.
 And can't not try.

HEADLINE: The Long Beach Rite of Spring

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

DATELINE: LONG BEACH 

 BODY:
IT'S countdown time to Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial beginning of summer, and Long Beach, a summer destination for thousands, is good to go -- well, almost.
 ''Just like any deadline, we are scrambling at the last minute,'' said John Skudin, newly appointed chief of Long Beach's 90 lifeguards, who will patrol the city's five-mile stretch of sand. Beginning Saturday, the beaches will be officially open, and lifeguards will be on duty each weekend; on June 26, they will be open daily. 
 The Long Beach oceanfront attracts more than a million people every summer, Mr. Skudin said, and ''on a busy summer weekend, we have about 50,000 people a day.'' 
 That crowd is roughly equal to the total number of summer residents of Long Beach, whose population the other nine months is about 35,000. 
 This swell in population requires serious preparation. 
 The advance work began in earnest in April, when many returning lifeguards and new candidates began training at the Long Beach High School pool. Returning lifeguards have to requalify every year, and rookies have to pass a more stringent test that was given May 15. 
 Last month, a 10-member maintenance crew started its preseason beach cleaning: scraping and painting lifeguard chairs; cleaning the beaches; grading the sand; getting the four-wheel-drive beach vehicles ready; and restocking first aid and medical equipment.
 ''I know summer is coming when I hear the trucks out cleaning the beaches at 6:30 every morning,'' said Glen Spiritis, the city manager, who spent 10 summers as a lifeguard in the 1960's and 70's. ''It tells me that we made it through the winter, and summer is finally here.''
 Then there is the problem of actually getting people onto the beaches. More than 200,000 daily and seasonal beach passes have been ordered, delivered, counted and taken to designated locations for sale. A daily is $6, most conveniently available at stands along the beach. The city's beach park manager, Joe Brand, reached an agreement with the Long Island Rail Road several weeks ago for a discounted $15 combination voucher, good for rail transportation from and to Manhattan and a beach pass. 
 ''It's the quickest, easiest and most economical way to get from the city to our beaches,'' Mr. Brand said.
 Once in Long Beach, if local officials and merchants have their way, visitors will be bombarded with opportunities to have fun and spend money. The calendar is already filled with concerts, volleyball and soccer tournaments on the beach, races along the 2.2-mile boardwalk, and several arts and crafts fairs. 
 The real estate market is booming with summer rentals. ''We start getting calls as early as January from people looking to rent something for the summer with an ocean view,'' said Marina Hirshhorn, an agent at Century 21 Kaye. ''Our customers come mostly from New York City because Long Beach is convenient, quiet, clean and more low-key than the East End.'' 
 Restaurateurs, too, are counting on crowds. For the holiday weekend, Sam Marelli, who leases the Turquoise Food Court on the boardwalk, has ordered 2,000 hot dogs, 1,000 hamburgers, 4,000 sodas and 300 pounds of calamari. A giant Post-it on the wall in Mr. Marelli's office reminds him of what he still has to buy: light bulbs for the bar, blades for a ceiling fan, cups for Italian ices.
 ''Our list goes on forever,'' he said. ''Because we're seasonal, it takes a lot to open this place every year. But this is my fifth year here, and it's my life. I love it.''
 Rob Richards, the owner and manager of Sutton Place, which opened a year and a half ago, shares those sentiments. ''I hate winter,'' said Mr. Richards, a lifelong Long Beach resident. ''I can't wait for summer, when our food business picks up by 20 percent, and we're always busy.''
 Of course, the success of the entire venture is predicated on the sun. Business people here remember only too well what happened last summer, when the sun went into hiding. 
 ''All I need is for the weather to cooperate,'' said Mr. Marelli, who owns five adjacent operations offering everything from clams, pizza and burritos to ice cream and frozen drinks. ''Last year, the weather was a disaster. Out of 13 weeks, we only had five good ones, and the blackout in August killed us because people lost two days and then had things to take care of over the weekend. It will take us two or three years to make up for last summer.''
 To handle the anticipated crowds, the city's 72 full-time police officers are being reinforced by 26 ''summer specials.'' Thomas Sofield, the Long Beach police commissioner, described them as ''college students who must be at least 20 years old and who are majoring in criminal justice.''
 ''They dress in uniform,'' he said, ''and are mostly responsible for beach and boardwalk patrol -- enforcing code violations like animals on the beach, alcohol use and beach pass infractions.''
 Then there are the traffic and criminal operations. ''We have several tag and tow officers who work on summer weekends to enforce traffic, 32 volunteers in our auxiliary police who help with traffic control, and a street criminal unit of two plainclothes officers with a supervisor to target problem areas,'' the commissioner said. ''There will also be extra beach patrol officers for every summer event. It's all in place, and we're ready.''
 Mr. Skudin, the lifeguards' chief, also expressed readiness -- though with a certain reserve. ''More and more, people are coming to our beaches from out of town, and they are not used to the ocean,'' he said. ''That presents more of a challenge to our lifeguards, and we try to put some of our most experienced guards at the most crowded beaches.
 ''At this time of year, I'm very excited -- but also nervous. I can train the lifeguards and get them all ready, but I can't be on every chair.''
 But if Mr. Skudin voiced a note of concern, James Hennessy, the president of the City Council, expressed nothing but anticipation. And he should know: he was a Long Beach lifeguard for 18 years. 
 ''Long Beach is summer,'' Mr. Hennessy said. ''Every year at this time, I miss being a lifeguard. When Memorial Day arrives, it's as if someone flicks a switch. Everyone comes outside, and summer is here.''

HEADLINE: 'Poor Man's Paradises': Not Just for Summer

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: OAKWOOD ON THE SOUND 

 BODY:
IT'S an eerily calm Saturday afternoon, so still that onshore breezes barely stir the parasols of oaks and maples towering above the bungalows. Around this onetime summer haunt, driveways are empty. Clapboard shacks remain shuttered. Lights are off.
 But there is one exception. In a rust-orange house at the base of a hill, Jerry and Diane Waters have jumped the gun on summer. Life here may still be bookended by Memorial Day and Labor Day, but the Waterses, who live in Levittown most of the year, said they couldn't resist returning to their summer home a little early, to open the windows and shake out the rugs.
 ''Come on up,'' Mr. Waters said one brisk mid-May afternoon. ''We're just cutting up a lot of wood for the fire.'' 
 On Long Island, the traditional summer spots are as tapped as a college keg. Fire Island? Montauk? The Hamptons? Been there, done that, spent four hours in traffic and paid $1,000 to share a bedroom.
 But in northeastern Suffolk County, snug against Long Island Sound, lie some of the last untrampled bastions of summer life -- tiny communities that were built for farmers and middle-class residents and still called ''poor man's paradises'' by locals. 
 They are Sound Beach, Rocky Point, Baiting Hollow, Wading River, Oakwood on the Sound, Herod Point and Fresh Pond Landing. These hamlets (and hamlets within hamlets) are nestled in obscurity behind steep hills and sod farms. They are separated by name and local history, but they still have a lot in common: pebbled beaches, breathtaking views of Long Island Sound and a palpable dread that development will trample the hamlets' languid summertime spirit.
 Season by season, life in this stretch of northern Suffolk County and in summer havens across the New York metropolitan region is changing from part time into full time. Property values are rising, subdivisions are sprouting on old potato farms and residents are grudgingly taking on longer and longer commutes. 
 Twenty years ago in northern Suffolk, residents say, it was news to see another car on Sound Avenue, the east-west main road that loosely connects these communities. Today weekend traffic can be fierce, and federal census data show that in 2000, only 11 percent of houses were seasonal or vacation homes. 
 Throughout Suffolk County, 8 percent of homes are used seasonally. Western towns like Brookhaven and Huntington have the slimmest proportions, with 1 percent to 3 percent of homes classified as seasonal.
 But in towns like East Hampton and Southampton, 40 percent to 55 percent of homes remain seasonal, the data show.
 On this northern ledge of the Island, residents exult as homes become more valuable and posh restaurants and golf courses move in down the way. They also complain about trash on the beach, traffic and the possibility their neighborhoods may be too quaint and alluring for their own good.
 ''This year was the first year that I felt like I had to share a snowstorm,'' said Valerie Goode, who owns a real-estate agency in the area. ''I was very upset about it.''

Seasonal or Permanent?
 As the old summer towns circling New York extend their year-round roots, more and more Americans are looking for seasonal idylls, according to the federal housing data. 
 The number of people who own seasonal recreational homes has grown by nearly 200,000 in the past 16 years, reaching 1,974,ooo in 2001, from an estimated 1,775,000 in 1985.
 In the New York metropolitan area, the limited housing supply and climbing prices have pushed many bargain-hunting buyers to act. Whether primary homes are in upper Manhattan, the outer boroughs or the remote exurbs, vacation homes must be sought even farther afield.
 So while some are scouring upstate Woodstock or the back roads of Putnam County for a vacation cottage, others with less disposable income are putting down permanent roots in towns like North Salem, or Milford, Conn., or Long Island's eastern North Shore hamlets. These former summer towns, one or two hours from the city, are littered with tiny, often flimsy homes, but they also offer comparatively cheap prices and nature at the back door.
 ''Land values in waterfront communities have escalated dramatically, particularly in the last couple of decades,'' said Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group. ''It just became economically reasonable to winterize those houses and live there year-round.''
 Real-estate agents from across the region say most of the new residents are young families buying their first homes or senior citizens buying their last. Thomas Cooke, an associate professor of geography at the University of Connecticut, says the pattern is for many part-timers to become full-timers as they age.
 ''Some of that is just people choosing to retire,'' Professor Cooke said. ''Housing prices are up and they're taking their equity, fixing their summer cottages and choosing to live there.''
 A handful of iconic getaways have resisted the trend. Fire Island, for instance, is rugged and inaccessible enough to have retained its summertime flavor, and though the Hamptons now hum all year, many of the millionaires' estates are still shuttered for the winter. 
 But Ms. Kamer said the solidly middle-class summer communities, like Wading River or Baiting Hollow, are now too expensive and too accessible to retain their May-to-September character.
 ''I think it's kind of sad,'' Ms. Kamer said. ''These part-time summertime locations will probably disappear in the next 5 to 10 years.''
 Oozing ever farther from New York, such communities are like rings on a pond, said Susan Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, remembering places like Coney Island, the Rockaways, Yonkers, Hoboken or Asbury Park as once-distant havens.
 ''It's a very old story in fact,'' she said. ''It's happening all over the country, actually.''

Snapshot of a Haven
 Today, the strip of hamlets along the North Shore is a picture of change. 
 In Rocky Point, modest one-story Cape Cods line the roads while contractors hammer away at more ambitious homes overlooking the Sound. In Oakwood on the Sound, after one thin-walled bungalow burned down, its owners replaced it with a grand faux-Victorian. In Wading River, McMansions sit across the street from sod farms.
 But for years after these acres were first parceled out into lots during the late 1600's, change happened at a much slower pace, according to local histories and longtime residents. Early residents here made their living shellfishing and shipping cordwood to Connecticut.
 The wide, rich fields were used to grow potatoes, and the waterfront evolved as a summer community for local farmers.
 ''The old way was, farm families would have a beach house and would move up to the water for the summer months,'' said Ms. Goode, the real-estate agent. ''The husband would continue farming and come home at the end of the day and take a swim.''
 Other communities grew less organically.
 In the 1920's, The New York Daily Mirror bought swaths of land in Rocky Point and sold cheap lots to its readers. Over the years, many of the homes closest to the water have stayed in the families of the original purchasers, passed down like heirlooms or rent-controlled apartments, real-estate agents said.
 At least three communities in the area, including Oakwood on the Sound, developed in the early 20th century as summer camping spots, said Jerry Waters, the resident who was airing out his home one May afternoon. 
 Mr. Waters, whose grandparents owned a home in Oakwood on the Sound, said the homes here evolved from camp tents to porous shacks to small bungalows. Irish, German and Italian immigrants living in Brooklyn would trek out to Suffolk for the summer, shelling out $20 or $30 to spend the season on the Sound.
 ''It was all O'Flaherty and Puccio,'' Mr. Waters said, describing people who lit their homes with kerosene lamps and walked into town to fetch blocks of ice for the iceboxes. 
 Each area boasts some small claim to fame, either historic or modern, according to Long Island histories. 
 Wading River residents talk about the night in 1756 that George Washington, then 24, was supposed to have bedded down at the Horn Tavern. Rocky Point was the site of the Radio Corporation of America station, which once broadcast a message delivered by President Warren G. Harding. Baiting Hollow was the setting of a short story by Theodore Dreiser.
 These days, though, longtime residents up and down the beaches divide their lives here into B.S. and A.S. -- before Shoreham and after Shoreham. It rankles many, but in recent years, the failed Shoreham nuclear plant has become the area's most prominent landmark.

Affordable Sound Views
 Good restaurants are scarce in Ashley McLean's new neighborhood. Winter winds off the Sound sting the skin. The roads can be treacherous and the winter months desolate. If the weather or traffic is bad, getting into Manhattan can take two hours or more.
 So why would Ms. McLean and her fiance move from their home in bustling Westhampton to the bottom of Edwards Avenue in Baiting Hollow?
 Simple, Ms. McLean said: a view of the Sound for $800 per month.
 Though northern Suffolk lacks the cachet and name recognition of the Hamptons, real-estate agents here say comparatively low prices are drawing residents eager to convert old summer havens into year-round houses. Lots facing the Sound sell for $300,000, and there are still houses with full water views going for less than $1 million, real-estate agents said.
 ''Property values are skyrocketing,'' said Roger Marks, a Wading River real-estate agent. ''People have discovered our town, and we have a tremendous influx of people coming out from the west.''
 Between 1990 and 2000, property values crept up in Rocky Point, Sound Beach and Wading River, rising by 3 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent respectively, according to census data. The average home value in the area in 2000 was $160,833 -- a modest sum by Long Island standards.
 Today, Mr. Marks said, nothing sells for less than $200,000. Recently, an old seasonal Cape Cod a block from the Sound sold for $269,000. Some summer bungalows and cottages sell for around $450,000.
 Mr. Marks said that in recent years, he could recall selling only one home whose new owner planned to live there part time.
 Most buyers today are retirees or young families looking for a bargain, who work in New York City, Nassau County, or closer towns like Hauppauge or Patchogue, real-estate agents said. 
 Drawn by the area's quaintness, good schools and proximity to Long Island Sound, they are persuaded to shoulder two-hour commutes.
 ''It's kind of evolved,'' Mr. Marks said of Wading River. ''It's not a summer town anymore. People are going into New York now every day. It's crazy, but they do it.''
 Growing up, Dan Holohan said, he spent his summers running up and down the pebbled beaches of Sound Beach and Wading River. Now a born-again pastor, Mr. Holohan sat on the beach one spring afternoon, staring into the Sound and recalling his boyhood.
 His extended family all came together during the summer, living in a small cottage in Sound Beach. Each morning they would run down the long stairways from the bluffs to the beaches and spend the day paddling around the Sound. 
 Since then, Mr. Holohan has lived in Bermuda, Alaska, Oklahoma and California. But when he was considering where to live permanently, he couldn't help returning to the beach communities of his childhood.
 ''I've been all over Long Island, and there's no other point like this,'' he said, feet kneading the sand. ''You want a quiet, simple life? This is the place.''

Still a Special Getaway
 Despite the growing number of year-rounders, life here still changes after Memorial Day. 
 Traffic thickens on Route 25A. Antique shops selling Jadeite tea saucers extend their hours. Retirees back from Florida pull the shutters off their houses. Produce stands open. The waterfront restaurant La Plage stays open on Mondays and Tuesdays -- its ''closed'' days during the off-season.
 In ways both intentional and haphazard, much of the area has retained the feel of a drowsy beach community. Outside people's homes, fishbowls are filled with smooth sea glass. Seahorse lawn ornaments abound. Rusting sailboats sit in front yards and driveways. And the gossip often revolves around which farm has the best strawberries or apricots, residents said.
 In Oakwood on the Sound and other small communities on the North Shore, summertime life is written into the bylaws, the Waterses said. Oakwood on the Sound and similar areas operate like New York City co-ops and are governed by boards of directors who lay out house rules.
 Such bylaws often prohibit families from using the area as a full-time home. And in Oakwood on the Sound, after a number of large new homes sprang up -- including one behemoth now called ''the church of disappointment'' -- the community passed a rule limiting home sizes, Ms. Waters said.
 ''This is our getaway,'' she said. ''We don't want it to be anything else.''
 Ms. Waters described summers that sound like being at a grown-up camp. Residents hold Christmas-in-July parties and offer arts and crafts classes. They go fishing for bluefish, set up umbrellas on the beach and have wine and cheese parties at dusk.
 But if the pastimes endure, some faces on the shores have changed.
 Mr. Holohan says he sees more and more Colombian and Mexican residents driving out to the beaches to swim and cast lines into the surf. Ms. Waters says Vietnamese and Asian residents camp at Wildwood State Park and spend the summers swimming and fishing.
 Renea Zeh, who lives in a beachfront house first owned by her grandfather, said crowds were becoming more of a problem each year. Teenagers celebrating the end of school have beach parties and leave behind trails of trash. Packs of Jet Skis roar across the water.
 Yet despite the growing crowds, Ms. Zeh says, the area is still tightknit. She can point at each house up and down her sandy street and say who lives there, who owned it years ago and whether the owners have other family in the area.
 ''When spring and summer come, I don't want to ever leave,'' Ms. Zeh said. ''People start taking the shutters down, cleaning up their little yards. By Fourth of July, everyone's having drinks. I am going to live there, and die in that house. I love it.''

HEADLINE: Refining the Plan for a Former Psychiatric Center

BYLINE: By CAROLE PAQUETTE

DATELINE: KINGS PARK 

 BODY:
AFTER a weeklong series of public meetings, a master plan for the 368-acre site of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center has been created that envisions the development of only 92 acres of a possible 200.
 The amount of land to be developed, significantly less than earlier proposals, was reduced in response to strong concerns expressed by residents over the possibility that a more sprawling development would result in a substantial loss of public land, cause traffic problems and diminish the community's small existing downtown.
 At the final meeting on May 11, attended by more than 1,000 residents, Andres Duany, a principal in the Miami-based planning firm of Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, which was hired by the site's developers to create the master plan, characterized the revised 92-acre approach as ''politic, and the only feasible one.''
 As revised, the multiuse project would consist of a variety of 2,053 residential units, retail and office buildings, parkland and many sidewalks, to encourage residents to travel on foot or on bicycles instead of in cars. Much of the remaining 276 acres would be left as woods or open for public use, including ball fields and other recreational areas. 
 Dense development at the property is needed to help to pay for the $40 million asbestos cleanup and demolition of more than 40 existing buildings at the 120-year-old hospital site, Mr. Duany said. The cleanup will also deal with the remainders of many buried buildings, which also had asbestos and lead, that were demolished years ago by being ''tumbled into their basements and grassed over.'' 
 If the plan is ultimately approved by the town of Smithtown, the project is expected to take many years to complete at a cost of more than $1 billion, according to James Buslik, an owner of LAMB Acquisitions, a consortium of primarily local real estate investors, which won the right to buy the property for $7.5 million from the state in an auction last May. The purchase came with the condition that LAMB would pay the remediation costs.
 Construction is to begin once the plan has been approved and the site has been entirely cleaned up. The owners hope to begin work on new buildings on the site in about five years and expect the whole project to take 10 to 20 years to build out. The owners said that they had no guarantee they would get grants toward the cleanup but that they were confident they could get financing. 
 The plan estimates that the development will ultimately add $12.5 million annually to the local tax base, with $9 million going directly to the school district. Estimates are that it would bring in 4,416 new residents and 381 students. 
 Among the residential units would be 84 ''affordable'' starter condominium apartments, averaging 700 square feet each and projected to sell for about $200,000, and 1,596 market-rate units averaging 1,200 square feet for ''empty nesters'' and people 55 and over. The apartments would be in 16 buildings, one a tower of 11 stories and the others two to five stories tall. 
 There would be a two-story 23,800-square-foot building holding small shops and four 72,000-square-foot office buildings.
 The Kings Park Psychiatric Center officially closed in 1996 after the state began phasing out large psychiatric complexes. The property originally consisted of 562 acres; 158 have been dedicated to the Nissequogue River State Park and another 36 acres have been retained by the state, where some of the health facilities are still in use.
 On the 368 acres that are being purchased, there are numerous brick buildings, with a total of 2.5 million square feet of space, including the main 11-story, 350,000-square-foot Building 93 that has served as a landmark for the site. It is possible that three buildings may be saved.
 The Long Island principals of LAMB, whose initials form the acronym, are Charles Lefkowitz of Port Jefferson, Charles Alter of Lido Beach, Todd Mendik of Locust Valley and James Buslik of East Hills, who is also a principal in Adams & Company, a Manhattan real estate firm. Another partner is the Manhattan-based Durst Organization. 
 THE public planning forums, called a ''charrette,'' were held on eight consecutive days from May 4 to May 11, and individual afternoon workshops featuring specific subjects like transportation and housing drew up to 200 residents.
 The sessions were run by Duany Plater-Zyberk, which set up a studio at a former elementary school where the workshop meetings were held. 
 Throughout the week the planners, who Mr. Duany said ''came in with an empty slate,'' brainstormed with residents as they continuously revised designs for project options based on the public input.
 In the end residents' concerns helped to mold the final plan, reducing the development size and eliminating plans for a supermarket. Suggestions that have now been incorporated into the plan include public recreational areas, a public swimming pool and an amphitheater.
 As a result of worries that the development would take business away from the hamlet's downtown, the proposed new retail and office area and the entrance to the development were shifted to a spot along Route 25A, near where it intersects with Kings Park's main street. In effect, that makes the stores at the project an extension of the existing downtown; if the businesses had been placed deeper inside the development, they might have been seen as an alternative to the downtown. Space has been set aside for 32 live-work units in addition to the shops. 
 In addressing concerns about retaining a sense of the history of the hospital, where many Kings Park residents once worked, the planners designed the 11-story apartment building with 264 units for those 55 and over. It would be similar in size and style to the widely recognized Building 93, which has been deemed structurally unsound and will most likely be demolished.
 Although Mr. Duany said connector roads within the development would lead to other existing roads that would do a lot to bypass Route 25A, concern over the impact of traffic on the heavily traveled two-lane state road continues to worry Long Island's major planners like Lee Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board since 1965, and a former Suffolk County planning director.
 ''My first concern is that access is limited,'' Dr. Koppelman said. ''There is only one way into the site, which is off Route 25A, and any increase in traffic generated is uncomfortable for residents of the area.''
 Frank DeRubeis, the Smithtown planning commissioner, said he was also concerned about traffic and the ''sheer size of the development.'' There are already 7,500 homes in Kings Park and the project would increase that total by 30 percent, he said. ''In a small area, that is a substantial increase,'' he added. ''The increased density would be the economic way to justify the remediation costs. It raises the question though, should the town through zoning bear the cost of remediation?''
 The guiding principle of the Kings Park planners is ''smart growth,'' a community-planning movement that seeks to design development in such a way that sprawl is minimized and open space is retained. The result is a multiuse village with residential, commercial and open spaces within walking distance.
 An important element in achieving smart growth in Long Island is the use of a ''charrette,'' a sort of brainstorming public forum that brings together many groups, including residents, politicians, merchants, environmentalists and developers, in a collaborative effort.
 The Kings Park charrette was coordinated by the Northport-based Vision Long Island, a nonprofit regional proponent of smart growth. ''This was the biggest charrette ever held on Long Island,'' said Eric Alexander, the director. ''The owners are searching for a big idea; this builds a consensus from the community.''
 Previous Long Island charrettes had been held in commercial corridors in the communities of Mastic-Shirley, Middle Island-Coram, Yaphank and Huntington.

HEADLINE: What Goes Up and Pulls Down the Dow?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
HOW is it that the third-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average is also one of the main reasons the Dow is down 4.7 percent for the year -- almost three times the decline of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index?
 The stock is American International Group, the world's largest insurance company. A.I.G. is up 5.8 percent for the year and has bolstered the performance of the S.&P. 500. But it has been a drag on the Dow because of the timing of its entry into that index. A.I.G. joined the Dow on April 8. Since then, the stock is down 8 percent, almost double the fall in the Dow. 
 Some of the decline in A.I.G. is attributable to the overreaction of investors to the announcement on April 1 that it would become a Dow member, along with Verizon and Pfizer. Investors, evidently expecting that inclusion in the Dow would help these companies' stocks, promptly bid up their prices. From April 1 to April 7, A.I.G. jumped 6.9 percent, while Pfizer rose 1.8 percent and Verizon climbed 2.1 percent. A.I.G.'s price peaked on April 12 and has since fallen, along with other insurers', in part because premium growth is slowing and interest rates are rising.
 The A.I.G. decline accounts for 43.3 of the 487.18 points, or 8.9 percent, of the Dow's drop for the year through Friday, according to Bloomberg. Four other stocks -- United Technologies, Caterpillar, General Motors and Alcoa -- each contributed more points to the Dow's decline. But because A.I.G. had been in the Dow for just 44 days, it was the biggest negative influence on a per-day basis, dragging down the index by an average of almost one point a day. (The closest competitor was United Technologies, which dragged down the average by 0.67 points each day this year.) 
 A.I.G.'s effect on the S.&P. 500 is another matter. Because of the stock's rise since Jan. 1, it was the fifth-biggest positive influence on that index through Friday.

THRESHOLDS -- By some measures, inflation this year is already at levels that, in the past, would have prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
 Through the first four months of 2004, the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy prices, has risen 1 percent -- compared with a 1.1 percent increase for all of 2003.
 If the consumer index rises 0.2 percent for May, the same as it did last month, the index will be up 1.2 percent in the first five months this year, more than in all of 2003.
 The current annual rate of core price increases through April is even higher, at 3 percent. 
 The annual rate of core inflation over four months has not been higher than 3 percent since the period ended June 1995, when it reached 3.2 percent.
 When the Fed began raising its benchmark interest rate in February 1994, the four-month rate was 2.8 percent. And when policy makers began their last tightening, in June 1999, core consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent over the previous four months.

NEW NUMBERS -- Among the economic data due this week are durable-goods orders for April, a revision of the first-quarter gross domestic product data -- which include an important inflation barometer -- and two measures of consumer confidence. Analysts expect the G.D.P. inflation measure to rise 2.5 percent, confirming the figure initially reported in April, according to Bloomberg.

HEADLINE: Where the Dust Motes Glow

BYLINE: By Jonathan Miles. 
Jonathan Miles is a writer who lives in New York.

 BODY:

EVENTIDE
By Kent Haruf.
300 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.
 I can't support this with demographic particulars, but here goes: many of the same readers who were drawn to Kent Haruf's best-selling novel, ''Plainsong,'' are equally drawn to Pottery Barn furniture. 
 What endeared them to Haruf's plainspoken, muslin-textured novel, a 1999 National Book Award finalist that chronicled a year in the life of a small Colorado town, was its ''rustic lines,'' its ''traditional sensibility'' and ''enduring style,'' its ''aged patina'' and ''sense of being at the center of family life,'' not to mention its quiet resemblance ''to authentic Shaker furniture.'' Save for that last line (which came from a USA Today review), I'm not quoting from ''Plainsong'' raves; these come from descriptions in Pottery Barn's early summer 2004 catalog. Both Haruf and the items in that catalog draw inspiration from visions of a more durable, hand-hewn past, and both willfully emit the horsey, old-leather scent of an America that may or may not be apocryphal. If readers found the novel's moral clarity refreshing, they warmed even more to its aesthetic clarity. Like antique reproductions, ''alternative'' country music and the Slow Food movement, ''Plainsong'' was a life raft for people who felt they were drowning in the sour froth of pop cynicism.
 Haruf's new novel, ''Eventide,'' is a sequel to ''Plainsong,'' and it will come as a familiar gift to those legions of readers -- maybe an overly familiar gift. I'm reminded of a friend who was once so smitten with a three-course restaurant dinner that after dessert he ordered all three courses again. ''Eventide'' is that kind of multi-course repeat performance. Here again are the convergent narratives, the seasons-come, seasons-go pacing and the same wide-angle, windswept ending. 
 The crotchety but lovable McPheron brothers take another star turn here, and Maggie Jones, the saintly schoolteacher and emotional-repair person of tiny Holt, Colo., makes a cameo appearance to pop the hood on people's lives and take a wrench to what's broken. The role of the Guthrie boys, the innocent and poorly mothered children of ''Plainsong,'' is played here by a motherless boy named DJ Kephart, an 11-year-old with ''brown hair that hung over his forehead'' that's not so unlike the dark hair of the Guthrie boys that fell ''identically over their unmarked foreheads.'' Russell Beckman, the bully of ''Plainsong,'' has been replaced by Hoyt Raines; Hoyt, like Russell, abuses children and is dealt no authorial justice for that abuse. ''Mama, do you have to smoke in here now?'' asked a daughter in ''Plainsong''; ''Mom, do you have to smoke?'' a different daughter asks a different mother in ''Eventide.'' In ''Plainsong,'' the reader saw ''dust motes swimming in the dimly lighted air like tiny creatures underwater,'' while in ''Eventide,'' the ''dust motes danced in the air like tiny creatures in dim water.'' Haruf has not, as a publicist might say, outdone himself. He's just done himself.
 There's no crime in this, of course. As Alfred Hitchcock once put it, ''Self-plagiarism is style.'' It should follow, nonetheless, that what was good about ''Plainsong'' should be equally good about its chip-off-the-block sequel, and for the most part this is true. As a stylist, Haruf melds the hoof-clop cadences of Cormac McCarthy (''They came down the plank steps out of the trailer into the bright sun in the middle of morning and rounded the corner in the packed dirt and arrived at the rusted shopping cart that waited like something patient and abiding among the dry cheatgrass and pigweed'') with the pinched economy of Hemingway. He is sensitive, as V. S. Pritchett wrote of Chekhov, ''to the musicality of simple language,'' and is rarely victim to the purple fevers that can infect describers of the Western landscape. His prose has the balming effect of a grandfather clock ticking in a quiet, pine-floored house, and, like that clock, seems to exist solely to record the passing of time. 
 For all their mirrored affinities, however, there are real differences between the two novels. Despite its didactic undertones -- its esteem for an honest day's work, its tenderhearted adherence to innocence as a virtue (as seen in the bachelor McPherons, aghast at the townsfolk murmuring about them living with a pregnant high schooler) -- ''Plainsong'' was pitted with dark crevices. Witness the short fuse of the hero, Tom Guthrie, or Haruf's dead-on rendering of the bumper-car carnality of small towns, or the epidemic disintegration of traditional families in Holt County. If Haruf took Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg, Ohio'' as his inspiration for a cross-sectional depiction of small-town life, then he was intermittently true, with ''Plainsong,'' to the skewed vision that prompted Anderson to title his manuscript, originally, ''The Book of the Grotesque.'' ''Eventide,'' alas, is almost devoid of shadowed crannies; dark meets light, and light meets dark, but little gray sits between them.
 An accidental death gives the novel one of its primary plot hinges, but accidental deaths are neither dark nor light; they just are. Haruf peeks into the trailer parks of Holt to introduce us to Luther and Betty June Wallace, but as even their names attest, these are archetypes of poor white poverty, exhumed from the archives of socialist fiction, and Haruf loses his balance when he tries to pump life into them, resulting in such moments as when Betty, ''her eyes rolling unfocused,'' wails ''into the rank and odiferous air'' of her trailer. Haruf also flirts with the archetypal in his portrayal of Hoyt, a hard-drinking, womanizing, child-abusing lout, ''smelling of . . . cheap bar whiskey,'' who seems unfairly deprived of a puppy to kick as he wreaks predictable havoc. 
 The sometimes twisted sexuality of ''Plainsong'' -- the multipartner couplings in abandoned houses and Denver bathrooms, the frenzy of back-seat sex with the night wind drifting into open car windows ''smelling of sage and summer grass'' -- is absent in ''Eventide,'' tokenly represented by a scene in which one of the McPherons finally loses his virginity to a woman whose naked body is ''so smooth and warm and full-fleshed, and she herself so goodhearted.''
 For all its admirable craftsmanship, ''Eventide'' is too goodhearted. Pottery Barn's success lies in its ability to convince consumers that it's possible to market authenticity in a shopping mall, and that its furnishings recreate a bygone warmth and simplicity, not cynically invent it. Kent Haruf's achievement lies in his ability to depict the frangible values of rural communities, not advocate them. Dusting the West with sugar isn't necessary; what dust there is is sweet enough.

HEADLINE: Where the Twain Meet

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: Long Beach Island 

 BODY:
FROM behind the counter of his custard stand, Jim Brennan can practically smell the summer hordes approaching.
 Most won't arrive in full force until Memorial Day, he knows. But already, a few are crossing the bay and broaching the shores of Long Beach Island like reconnaissance soldiers before battle. They come to clean up the cottage, greet old friends and reacquaint themselves with the salt air -- their numbers a meager hint of what's to come.
 The year-round population of this skinny, sandy summertime destination is a mere 8,000 people, but by midsummer, that number will have swelled to 100,000, perhaps 150,000, say Mr. Brennan and others who work on the island. Roads clog. Beaches overflow. And money flows. 
 ''It's getting better now,'' said Mr. Brennan, 22, as he served up mango custard shakes and wiped down the counters one afternoon. ''By the Fourth of July, it's just packed all the time. It's just mobbed.''
 Long Beach Island is one of the few communities nearby that live a grasshopper's life. Bit by bit, more people have retired here or are settling on the island and commuting to Philadelphia. But for the most part, life still begins in late spring and ends in September. 
 Other old summer towns like Asbury Park, Spring Lake and Hoboken long ago put down their roots and developed into year-round habitats, said Susan Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. Old lakefront getaways in Westchester County and Connecticut are now bedroom communities for New York City, and even the East End of Long Island is becoming full-time residential.
 Rising home prices and property taxes, a dwindling housing supply and a growing willingness to take on mammoth commutes have all transformed those areas from part-time towns into full-time ones.
 But on the 18-mile thread of land known as Long Beach Island, federal data show, there's a trend in the opposite direction: the portion of seasonal or vacation homes climbed to 65 percent in 2000, compared with 62 percent 10 years earlier.
 Though property values in the region have shot up over the past five years, residents and real estate agents here say the island is too cold and windy in the winter and too remote from New York City (two hours, if you're lucky) to become a bedroom community.
 It's true that the houses here are getting bigger, and that vacationers' hometowns and ethnicities are constantly changing. But there are still sailboats carved onto navy shutters, sand on the main roads and 25-mile-per-hour speed limit signs that urge, ''For Pete's sake, slow down!''
 ''It's still a summer, family island,'' said Joanne Quinlan, who owns the Bywater Shop, a knickknack trove on Long Beach Boulevard. ''Always has been, always will be.''
 One of the reasons Long Beach Island has become so hot in recent years is that communities like it are disappearing.
 As the old summer towns circling New York extend their year-round roots, more and more Americans are looking for seasonal idylls, according to federal housing data. The number of people who own a seasonal recreational home has grown by nearly 200,000 in the past 16 years, reaching 1,974,000 in 2001, from an estimated 1,775,000 in 1985.
 In the New York metropolitan area, the limited housing supply and climbing prices have already pushed many bargain-hunting buyers to act. Whether primary homes are in upper Manhattan, the outer boroughs or the remote exurbs, vacation homes must be sought even farther afield.
 So while some are scouring Woodstock, N.Y., and the back roads of Putnam County for a vacation cottage, others with less disposable income are putting down permanent roots in towns like North Salem, or Milford, Conn., or in Long Island's eastern North Shore hamlets. These former summer towns, one or two hours from the city, are littered with tiny, often flimsy homes, but they also offer comparatively cheap prices and nature at the back door.
 ''Land values in waterfront communities have escalated dramatically, particularly in the last couple of decades,'' said Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association. ''It just became economically reasonable to winterize those houses and live there year-round.''
 Real estate agents from across the region say most of the new residents are young families buying their first homes or older people buying their last. Thomas Cooke, an associate professor of geography at the University of Connecticut, says the pattern is for many part-timers to become full-timers as they age.

Retirees and Summer Sojourners
 On Long Beach Island, the growing ranks of retirees are split evenly between year-round residents and summer sojourners who keep a condo in Florida, real estate agents said. 
 ''Some of that is just people choosing to retire,'' Professor Cooke said. ''Housing prices are up and they're taking their equity, fixing their summer cottages and choosing to live there.''
 A handful of iconic getaways besides Long Beach Island have resisted the trend. Fire Island, for instance, is rugged and inaccessible enough to have retained its summertime flavor, and though the Hamptons now hum all year, many of the millionaires' estates are still shuttered for the winter. 
 But Ms. Kamer said the solidly middle-class summer communities are now too expensive and too accessible to retain their May-to-September character.
 ''I think it's kind of sad,'' Ms. Kamer said. ''These part-time summertime locations will probably disappear in the next 5 to 10 years.''
 Oozing ever farther from New York, such communities are like rings on a pond, Dr. Fainstein said, remembering places like Coney Island, the Rockaways, Yonkers, Hoboken or Asbury Park as once-distant havens.
 ''It's a very old story in fact,'' she said. ''It's happening all over the country, actually.''

Evolution of a Haven
 Long Beach Island floats like a twig in the ocean on the eastern ridge of New Jersey, 20 miles from Atlantic City. It is so skinny -- about a quarter-mile wide -- that you can stand just off its west coast, feet in Manahawkin Bay, and still have a great view of the Atlantic on the other side of the island.
 In less than five minutes, a visitor can walk from the commercial streets in the middle of the island to the shoreline and glimpse the endless white beaches that caught the eye of the earliest Colonial settlers. 
 Sighted in 1614 by a Dutch captain, Cornelius Jacobsen May, the island first served as an outpost for whalers and fishermen, and later as a hunting ground for affluent Philadelphians, who reached it by train and ferry and whiled away the summer among the beach plums and bayberry.
 ''I think they got to like the island,'' said Mary Gruber, who volunteers with the local Historical Society. ''They got their friends to come down, and it just blossomed.''
 The island communities of Beach Haven, to the south, and Barnegat Light, to the north, were developed as elegant resort destinations. Other parts of the island got built up with creaky hotels and rows of wooden bungalows, many of which had the unfortunate habit of blowing over whenever major Nor'easters rolled in.
 As the fledgling tourist economy grew, full-time residents improvised. Steven Parker's Norwegian ancestors, for instance, settled on the island to fish and scallop, but after the stock began to vanish, Mr. Parker said, his father's family earned their living bootlegging liquor
 Transportation soon started to define the character and residents of the island, and what divided them. After the Garden State Parkway and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in the 1950's and 60's, more and more New Yorkers and North Jerseyans began settling on the island. This change brought more money to the island but did not win the newcomers good relations with the other inhabitants. 
 Historians and authors tell stories going as far back as the 1920's, when two families, the Engles and the Baldwins, built competing hotels catering to region-specific crowds. The Engleside became the destination for the more Victorian crowds from Philadelphia, while New Yorkers flocked to the New Baldwin Hotel, to drink German beer and shoot at porpoises from the beach.
 These tales are hardly West Side Story, and though Philadelphians, New Jerseyans and New Yorkers have coexisted on the island for decades, locals seem to have made a pastime of A) insisting that more New Yorkers are arriving on the island and B) describing how to tell the different groups apart.
 Some point to the expensive restaurants with prix-fixe menus; others say the Empire State license plates are multiplying with each season. Real estate agents say more of their clients list primary addresses in New York City, and bar patrons say they see clear evidence of the rift: When the Yankees or the Mets are playing at the same time as the Phillies, you don't want to be the bartender who has to choose the channel.

The New Allure of Buying
 Here's a sign of the times. Or perhaps a dozen of them.
 Drive down Long Beach Boulevard, the island's main north-south drag, and you'll spot more real estate offices than traffic lights. The market for summer homes and rentals is, well, rabid these days, residents and realtors say, and there are few signs it is abating.
 Average home values rose by 23 percent in a decade, to $298,016 in 2000 from $242,233 in 1990, according to federal census data. In one of the island's six boroughs, Harvey Cedars, prices shot up by 44 percent. Rentals range from $1,500 per week, for a shack in modest south island, to $9,500 per week for a beachfront mansion in tony north island, said Paul Gow, a local real estate agent. 
 ''This would have been unheard of a couple of years ago,'' Mr. Gow said.
 The soaring prices have transformed the market, experts say, making rentals less attractive. ''There's actually a surplus of rentals out there,'' Mr. Gow said, as he tapped at the computer in his office, and pulled up a list of still-vacant summer rentals.
 While some of the new flock of buyers are year-round residents, most are part-timers who spend their summers on Long Beach Island, or live on the island for part of the summer and rent out the house for the remainder, to make enough to pay the property taxes or mortgage.
 Ann and Anthony Merlino had been renting and staying with family in Beach Haven for years until three years ago, when they decided to buy a two-bedroom condo overlooking the bay. They bought their second-floor unit for $270,000, and today, similar places are selling for $490,000, according to the Jersey Shore Multiple Listing Service.
 ''We bought at the right time,'' said Ms. Merlino, 57, who is retired and splits her time between the Jersey Shore and Titusville. ''Oh God, I love it.''
 It was quiet up and down the residential streets one recent weekday afternoon, except for the constant clatter of construction work. Contractors were adding porches and second floors, pounding banana-cream vinyl siding onto homes and tar-papering anything that didn't move. The construction workers outnumbered the residents.
 As property values rise here, people seeking to resell their houses or convert them to luxury rentals are tearing down the old bungalows and Cape Cods and erecting boxy mansions with porticos, rooftop decks and pebbled yards raked as smooth as Zen gardens.
 At the same time, more and more residents are inverting the layouts of their homes, putting living rooms and kitchens on second floors for the best possible light and views. 
 From 1990 to 2000, the number of homes with nine or more rooms doubled in three of the island's boroughs, according to census data. ''No part of the island is escaping it,'' Mr. Gow said.
 As the pace of change quickens, residents like Mr. Parker, of the bootlegging lineage, have watched with a mixture of awe and befuddlement.
 ''Everything's being knocked down,'' he said over happy hour drinks at Nardi's, a bar on Long Beach Boulevard. ''We just sit there and say, 'I would've bought that house just the way it was.'''

A PG-Rated Summer
 As the sun slipped behind the piers, Ali Chance parked her BMW with the ''I'd Rather Be Deer Hunting'' sticker on the back and walked into Nardi's. She has been coming here for years. So have most of her friends. And to them, even in the midst of this rapid-fire development, the island's scrappy summertime identity seems unshakable.
 While other summer haunts have lost their iconic shops and attractions to time or urban redevelopment, businesses like the Fantasy Island Amusement Park chug along, and chain stores have been kept at bay. Even surfers who come to the island each summer say they are charmed by the PG-rated quality of the island, where drunken shuffleboard games make for a wild evening.
 ''It's a different kind of world out here,'' Ms. Chance said. ''We don't have fast food. We don't have drive-throughs.''
 When the summer sun is out here, thousands make the trek to the beaches and complain about the mandatory beach passes. They take day cruises, go fishing in the bay and buy trinkets. They go to the bars in Beach Haven and knock back $2.50 glasses of wine. 
 Though Long Beach Island's full-time population has held almost flat over the past decade and remains 98 percent white, Hispanic workers drawn by construction work and seasonal jobs have become more and more of a presence, Ms. Chance said.
 And every season brings new nationalities of seasonal help, from the Australians who come to work as lifeguards, to the Russians and the Czech and Irish students who get jobs at convenience stores and restaurants.
 As the summer wears on, Ms. Chance added, the full-time residents' ambivalence toward the summer masses begins to show through. But while the visitors cause traffic jams and bump elbows with year-rounders at the bars, they spend enough in three or four months to sustain many here through the winter.
 These days, as increasing numbers of people buy homes, full-time part-timers like Ms. Merlino have announced that they, too, find it necessary to dodge the tourists.
 ''Summer is so different -- too crowded,'' she said. ''It just becomes much more fun to stay in your own backyard.''

HEADLINE: Farmers Reaping New Buyers

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: Riverton 

 BODY:
IN early May, signs began appearing in shop windows and on telephone poles throughout town that a farmers' market was coming soon. For this small Victorian village on the banks of the Delaware River, this was welcome news -- far more welcome than earlier reports of the new high-speed rail line, or the bike trail, both also being routed through town. 
 After all, who doesn't like farmers?
 In the last few years, a growing number of towns and cities throughout New Jersey have opened their arms to farmers interested in peddling fresh produce on a given Saturdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays throughout the summer. Originally created to give the state's struggling farmers access to new sources of income, community farmers' markets have become economic engines for some of their host municipalities, bringing life back to declining downtowns and giving people a reason to linger in neighborhoods they might not otherwise visit. 
 Standing in the shadow of the overhead train trestle, Stephanie Viereck unloaded more boxes of produce off of her green pick-up truck last Saturday morning. By 9:30, she had sold out all 30 flats of strawberries she brought to the market here and was down to her last tender shoots of fresh asparagus. At the next stand, farmers from Buena offered $1 heads of fresh lettuce and newly plucked herbs, while across the way, customers sniffed the aromatic Sungate Soaps. 
 Every Saturday from May through November, downtown Collingswood begins a mini-festival as thousands of shoppers fill the two-block stretch adjacent to the high-speed line. Many people credit the farmers' market with playing a major role in the renaissance in Collingswood, an inner-ring suburb of Camden. Now in its fifth season, the farmers' market has gotten bigger and more popular every summer, bringing more shoppers not only to the market, but also to nearby shops and restaurants. .
 This season, the market manager, Pam Ciervo, has arranged for about 20 vendors to sell their wares there. In addition to the dozen or so farmers, who come from counties in South Jersey, the market has four bakers, a Bridgeton woman who makes jams from berries she grows, a creperie, and two registered nurses who sell herbal soaps. Vendors pay a registration fee of $50 for the season, and a weekly lease of $35 to $50. 
 ''We want food and produce either sold by the grower or the person who cooked it,'' Ms. Ciervo said. ''If it's food related, it's great.''
 Colin Egan is a bit more of a purist when it comes to running the Journal Square Farmers' Market in Jersey City, which opens on July 7. In the decade the market has been operating, he has limited it to a few farmers and one baker. ''I don't want it to become like a flea market,'' he said.
 In addition to tapping into the thousands of commuters who pass through the square on their way to catch a PATH train or bus, Mr. Egan said the market had become a destination for many city residents who normally don't venture downtown.
 ''I had a senior citizen tell me 'I haven't come to the square for years, and now I'm coming for this,''' said Mr. Egan, who the rest of the week runs the landmark Loews Jersey Theater in Journal Square. ''It's something people really look forward to, the sense and smell of fresh produce, and getting to know the farmers from year to year.''
 Limited to selling only produce grown in New Jersey, most of the markets run from mid-June or early July into October, when the finest blueberries, tomatoes and corn are in season. Each market sets its own rules, some of which can be fairly stringent. At the Friday afternoon market in Forked River, for example, farmers can only sell produce that was picked that morning, which must be aesthetically displayed, in baskets and on tablecloth-covered surfaces. 
 The concept of farmers selling their goods in the middle of town can be traced back to Europe in the 1600's. The practice fell out of favor in modern times, however, with the advent of the supermarket. The current interest in freshly grown and organic foods has spurred a revival of community farm markets. A United States Department of Agriculture survey found close to 3,200 such markets around the country in 2003. With 8 to 10 new markets expected to open this summer, New Jersey will be home to about 75 community farmers' markets, according to Ronald Good, markets bureau chief in the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.
 Through the 1980's and early 1990's, Mr. Good said, New Jersey had a steady count of 10 or 15 community farmers' markets, but in the last four years he has gotten applications for 5 to 10 markets each year. The problem now has become finding enough farmers to fill the demand. 
 ''Farmers can get help picking in the field and in the packing house, but to deal face to face with the public, that takes a special personality,'' said Mr. Good, who tries to persuade farmers to at least try a market for one season.
 Last summer, the owners of William Schober Sons Orchards in Monroeville decided to sell produce at a farmers' market for the first time, after being invited to take part in the Woodbury market. While doing research at the Collingswood market on how to set up their stand and what to bring, the farmers were asked by Ms. Ciervo, the manager, to join her market also. This summer they plan to add three more farmers' markets to their roster. 
 Darlene Hurff of Schober Orchards said the markets were a whole new business opportunity for the farm, which was started by her grandfather in the early 1900's.
 ''It was more profitable than our wholesale business, because we were able to market things in smaller quantities, and we became very friendly with the customers,'' Ms. Hurff said. ''It almost became like family with some of the purchasers.''
 Bringing communities together has turned out to be another byproduct of the farmers' markets. While Riverton residents were divided over the arrival of the new RiverLine high-speed line, one resident, Eric Goldstein, saw its recent opening as an opportunity to bring a farmers' market to the borough. Mr. Goldstein said he met with nothing but positive reactions from town officials and business owners when he proposed a Saturday farmers' market. 
 Still, starting a market is not always smooth sailing. The organizers of both the Forked River and Collingswood markets said it took them a full year of planning before they were up and running. After running into some insurance problems, Mr. Goldstein had to race around town the night before the market was to open last weekend, replacing promotional flyers with new ones that announced the new June 5 start date. Still, he said he was determined to open the market this summer.
 ''My concern is with helping out the businesses in town,'' said Mr. Goldstein, who runs a nonprofit business improvement program in Philadelphia. ''Our businesses are struggling, and if we don't come up with something to bring more pedestrian traffic into downtown, those businesses are going to fail. The farmers' market is a vehicle to do that.''

HEADLINE: Cure for Sticker Shock at the Pump: The Shore

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices have been going up so quickly that the signs at the local service station seem to change like slot machine readouts, surging ever higher. Terrorism -- now touching such tourist destinations as Madrid -- does not seem to be abating. And as the value of the dollar continues on its own trip south, it is prohibitively expensive for many to travel abroad. 
 ''While it does seem that Americans will tolerate the increase in gas prices, they may well be re-thinking long car trips this summer,'' said Pam Maiolo, the manager for public affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic in Hamilton. ''If that's so, the Shore, with its traditional base so close, might be primed for a boom.'' 
 For the first time ever, the price of gasoline soared to more than $2 a gallon this month, a rise of more than 20 percent in one year, or about six times the rate of inflation. 
 Still, New Jersey is a bargain. In fact, it is second only to South Carolina in having the lowest average gasoline price, mostly because of its low gasoline taxes and proximity to refineries. California has the highest average price ($2.24), with neighboring states like New York and Connecticut far higher.
 ''It doesn't seem like it is going to change soon,'' Ms. Maiolo said. ''In fact, it seems like it will go high as the summer comes. Demand is high. Supply is not.''
 That suggests that for now, people have not cut down significantly on their driving. Ms. Maiolo said that AAA had found that air travel was up slightly this year, though not at the levels it was in 2000. But travel to Europe might be down slightly because of the weakness of the dollar. All of that, she said, bodes well for business at the Shore this summer.
 ''It's a good destination,'' she said. ''It is popular from Canada to Pittsburgh to Washington. Unemployment is down. Wages are up. It should be a good time for the Shore.''
 While housing prices at the Shore have continued to rise, rental prices have apparently stabilized. The Monmouth-Ocean County metropolitan area, for instance, is sixth in the nation in housing appreciation over the last five years, up 77.6 percent; the Atlantic-Cape May metro area is 15th, up 66.9 percent.
 ''And it would be much more if you just take the beachfront areas of those counties,'' said Mark Grimes of Ocean City Realty in Ocean City in Cape May County. ''The sales market is incredible. That said, there seems to be an oversupply of rentals right now. The beach block, for a standard three- or four-bedroom place would be $3,000 to $4,000 a week, which is what it has been for a couple of years. Back four blocks, you can get it for $1,500 to $1,700, even though sales prices are way up.''
 Atlantic City expects such a good summer that its Convention and Visitors Authority has already turned its attention to fall.
 ''We have to be careful running any promotions of things like golf in the area, because rooms are already taken for the summer,'' said Jeff Vasser, the executive director of the authority. ''Our mission is to make sure Atlantic City hotel rooms are booked, so we are already out looking for conventions for later in the year and next year.''
 Mr. Vasser said that new, non-casino attractions are helping draw tourists in the summer. Bally's Hotel-Casino is opening up a bar on the beach in front of its hotel, joining three others (Caesars, Hilton and Trump Plaza) that opened last summer. The new Borgata Hotel and Casino is opening an outdoor amphitheater, which will have events like shows and beach volleyball, on the bay side of its property. The Walk, a multi-level upscale shopping center adjacent to the Tropicana near the Boardwalk. is mostly completed. 
 Mr. Vasser said, too, that the beach replenishment program, which will be completed by the start of the summer season, should help make beaches in Atlantic City and nearby Ventnor more attractive.
 ''We've always said that casino visitors want to be near the beach. Now that will be even more so,'' Mr. Vasser said.
 Farther along the Shore, especially from Bay Head and north, where the commuter trains start, the boom is being fueled by a growing number of year-round residents.
 ''People in their 50's, the leading edge of the Baby Boom, now have kids out of the house and are cashing in their big houses in Short Hills and Westfield and moving to the beach, especially in places where they can commute to Newark or New York,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
 And with them, he said, more year-round businesses are coming to the beach areas in Monmouth County especially. That, in turn, makes it more attractive to summer visitors. It's a win-win for the Shore, he said. 
 The typical summer Shore amusement areas are also looking for a good season. Even in the more middle-class towns, there is a move to refurbish. In Ocean City, the old Moorlyn Theater has been gutted and restored to its 20th century days of glory, its mock-Moorish architecture complementing that of the Music Pier nearby on the Boardwalk.
 The Morey Organization, which operates the three amusement piers in the Wildwoods, is replacing an old ride, the Dark River, with Pirates of the Wildwoods, a take-off on the movie, ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' with live actors. Instead of the ubiquitous T-shirt and cheap memorabilia shops, the Moreys are putting two new stores underneath the Sea Serpent roller coaster. One is a Create-a-Bear teddy-bear-making center. The other is the Doo-Wop Boardwalk Museum Shop, with items remembering the resort's previous heyday in the 1950's and 1960's -- everything from stylized pink flamingos to full-scale $1000 jukeboxes. The store will be operated by Cape May's Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts.
 ''Who would have thought we'd see the day when Victorian Cape May and Doo-Wop Wildwood would get together?'' said Joanna Galloway of the Morey Organization. ''But this is the new Shore. The visitors everywhere are just more sophisticated, and we have to keep up.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Rejects a Saudi Proposal to Increase Production Quotas

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, May 22 

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will make no immediate adjustments to its current production levels, despite Saudi Arabia's offer on Friday to increase the amount of oil it pumps to ease high prices. 
 Members of OPEC, the oil cartel that controls over a third of the world's production, met Saturday in Amsterdam to discuss various proposals, but no changes will be made until a June 3 meeting in Beirut, the organization's president, Purnomo Yusgiantoro of Indonesia, told reporters. ''We are deeply concerned'' about high prices, he said, but OPEC's production levels are not the main cause. 
 OPEC's position contrasts with that of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer. On Friday, its oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told other energy ministers gathered at a conference here that he was willing to increase Saudi production by half a million barrels a day in June. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries that is not already pumping oil as quickly as it can. 
 On Friday, Mr. Naimi also said recent revisions in demand and supply projections indicated that OPEC should increase production by more than 2 million barrels a day. OPEC nations are already producing more than 2 million barrels a day over their 23.5 million quota.
 Oil prices fell on Thursday and Friday in hopes that OPEC would agree to one of the Saudi proposals on Saturday as an emergency relief measure. Oil prices rose above $40 a barrel on May 11 for the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and stayed above $40 until Friday. 
 Saturday's meeting was not a place to set policy, but ''was an opportunity to meet and formally exchange views,'' Mr. Purnomo said. Many factors are contributing to the climb, including varying specifications for emissions in the United States that prevent states from sharing gas supplies, speculation in the futures markets and tension in some oil-producing regions. OPEC is ''deliberating on the proposition to increase production'' in line with the cartel's commitment to stabilize oil prices, Mr. Purnomo said. 
 OPEC is under pressure to increase production as nations feel the pinch from rising energy prices. The price of oil has become an important issue for the Bush administration, and officials on Saturday called for changes from OPEC. ''We need strong action now in the immediate period ahead to address today's challenge, these high prices,'' the United States secretary of energy, Spencer Abraham, said during a news conference in Amsterdam, Bloomberg News reported.
 Any changes in OPEC production levels must be made by unanimous decision. The numbers that it sets in some instances have more effect on oil trading, though, then on the actual amount its members produce. Saudi Arabia pumped 8.3 million barrels a day in April, above its OPEC quota of 7.64 million, for example. 
 Dr. Ibraham Bahr Al-Uloum, the oil minister of Iraq, backed OPEC's official line in a statement on Saturday, saying that high prices were caused by many factors besides production levels, including accelerated economic growth and speculation in the trading markets. Iraq plans to revive its national oil company, Mr. Uloum said. In recent months, Iraq has pumped 2.5 million barrels a day, and hopes to reach 3 million by the end of the year, he said. 
 OPEC members met during the International Energy Forum, which brings together oil ministers and company representatives from around the world.

TRUE NORTH
By Jim Harrison.
388 pp. New York:
Grove Press. $24.
 EARLY on in Jim Harrison's new novel, ''True North,'' the narrator, David Burkett, reflects that ''lovemaking and fishing don't manage to dominate your life like you wished they could,'' though on most people's reckoning he gets to do his fair share of both. Particularly the lovemaking. From the moment he loses his virginity as a neurotic teenager in the 1960's to the more mature and considered years of his mid-30's, David never seems to be short of a woman eager to console his yearning loins. That he remains nonetheless cagey on the matter is due to his troubled relationship with his father, an egregious drunkard and ne'er-do-well whose sexual incontinence leads to the ''grotesque and unprosecuted crime'' that lies at the dark heart of the novel.
 David's life has been haunted not just by the sins of his father but by those of his forefathers. The scion of a wealthy logging dynasty, he has become obsessed with finding out ''what went wrong'' with his family, or ''if it was ever right in the first place beginning with those big-eyed, jut-jawed portraits in my father's den.'' He begins to research the history of the Burketts and how they despoiled the virgin forests of Michigan's Upper Peninsula during the late 19th century, a project that will, over the following decades, topple him into a morass of anxiety, guilt and self-loathing. In a word: timber! What his ancestors did to the landscape is still a sore spot for David: his very surname has become a byword for economic rapacity.
 Divided into three parts -- the 60's, the 70's, the 80's -- the novel is rather elusive in its tenor. It is hard to decide whether Harrison is offering us a coming-of-age story, a familial saga of estrangement or a slow-burning revenge tragedy; the knottier it becomes, the more likely it seems that we are actually reading all three. David, when first we meet him, is 16, lonely, slightly priggish and susceptible to influence. Having defected from his parents' Episcopal Church to the Baptists, he eventually feels the countervailing tug of young women and blues records, and broods guiltily about it. He has a will to self-improvement, reading widely, looking after his alcoholic uncle Fred and teaching underprivileged kids in the hope that he will, like his feisty younger sister, Cynthia, shake off the ghost of his DNA.
 Unlike Cynthia, he hasn't been able to make a clean break from his father, whose rape of a friend's 12-year-old daughter reverberates mightily to the very end of the novel. His father, it transpires, is a ''nympholeptic'' -- ''which at least seemed a step up from a pedophile.'' Cold comfort indeed. He is also a crook, selling property he doesn't own and bilking the trust money that their mother, a long-suffering woman pickled in booze, had set aside for David and Cynthia. The book becomes a tragicomic struggle between David's better self and an Oedipal fantasy of killing his father, a mortifying compulsion that prompts his girlfriend to set him straight: ''You can't spend your life writing a family history when there's no one who will want to read it. You can't spend your life in reaction to your family, mostly your father, because that means you're still his wounded little boy.'' Unfortunately for him, David can spend his life this way, and his marriage collapses while he persists with his history of the Upper Peninsula, compiling material as doggedly as Casaubon with his ''Key to All Mythologies'' in ''Middlemarch.''
 There is no denying the urgency of Harrison's storytelling, or his passionate involvement in the fate of his embattled hero. One comes to like David's slightly wistful tone and ''that curiously destructive bravery of the Midwesterner who never quite knows when to cut and run.'' But the novel is not without its problems. For one thing, there is something slovenly about the prose, be it Harrison's unreliable punctuation (he has an aversion to the comma), his insistence on the pronoun ''I'' instead of ''me'' (as in a lecture that ''left Fred and I in tears'') or his simple misuse of a word. For example, he seems to think ''enervated'' means ''unnerved,'' as in ''she was enervated by the feral cat.'' These solecisms are obviously not fatal, but they do throw off the reader's concentration.
 ONE can't help noticing, also, a tendency to jump the narrative gun. Both the 1970's and 1980's sections of the novel begin with the report of a significant character's death, before the story switches back to a time when that person was still alive. It is hard to know why Harrison is so offhand with his timing; the deaths of those characters, which affect the narrator deeply, are less moving for us because they are prematurely revealed. There must be a rationale here, because the novel's prologue also opens with a death that is answered by an echo at the conclusion.
 ''True North'' finishes strongly, as David tries to effect a reconciliation with his father; dried out at last, the old man admits that he too had a hateful father whom he wanted to kill: ''The ultimate bully. . . . After being raised by him World War II was a relief.'' In this disclosure resides the book's mournful take on patrimony, and one is irresistibly reminded of Philip Larkin's lines: ''Man hands on misery to man. / It deepens like a coastal shelf. / Get out as early as you can, / And don't have any kids yourself.'' This sprawling, rackety novel will not do a great deal for Jim Harrison's reputation as a stylist, but in his portrait of a father and a son he has made an indelible addition to the gallery of literature's ''bad dads.''

HEADLINE: In Step With Marching Bands

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER REARDON. 
Christopher Reardon, an Ohio native, is an arts writer who lives in New York.

 BODY:
NOTHING draws a crowd in Columbus, Ohio, like college football, a civic ritual that combines choreographed steps with seat-of-the-pants improvisation. Concert dance is a much harder sell, but faced with a tight economy, BalletMet, the local ballet company, is rewriting its playbook in a bid to win bigger, younger audiences.
 Last year this 28-member troupe performed onstage with Ohio State University's marching band. This spring it began dancing to music by Moby, whose pulsating beats are more commonly heard at nightclubs and frat parties than at the ballet. 
 Gerard Charles, BalletMet's artistic director, agreed that such moves might have raised a few eyebrows back at the Royal Ballet School in London, where he trained as a dancer in the 1970's. But he insisted that the company, which will make its Manhattan debut on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, was not selling its soul. 
 ''Our constant source of frustration is the inertia of getting people out of their homes and into the theater,'' Mr. Charles, 48, said in a recent telephone interview. ''Once they're in their seats they can't understand why they haven't been before.''
 New Yorkers might also find something to like. This week's program at the Joyce features commissioned works by two highly regarded choreographers, James Kudelka and Stanton Welch, and one emerging talent, Deanna Carter.
 ''BalletMet is a very strong regional ballet company with a unique voice,'' said Mr. Welch, 34, an Australian dynamo who is artistic director at the Houston Ballet and moonlights as artistic associate at BalletMet. ''I've been impressed by its dramatic flair as well as its dancing ability.''
 Columbus, after all, is not exactly a cultural backwater. This rapidly growing city is home to the Wexner Center for the Arts, a lively playground for experimental artists who come -- often from New York -- for more creative time and space.
 BalletMet, with an annual budget of $5.2 million, ranks among the country's 15 largest professional dance companies. Its affiliated school is also one of the nation's biggest, with about 1,000 students each week. 
 Now in its 26th season, the troupe has never run a deficit, said Cheri Mitchell, its executive director. But in recent years it has seen a decline in corporate and government support. Ticket sales also slumped before rebounding in January. Luckily, individual donors have picked up much of the slack. But even so, Ms. Mitchell said, BalletMet must raise an additional $100,000 by June 30 to stay in the black this fiscal year.
 At home the company performs large-scale story ballets at the 2,800-seat Ohio Theater; it presents mixed bills of shorter dances at the 800-seat Capitol Theater. Still, BalletMet sells fewer tickets each year (about 75,000) than the university's football team does for a single home game (more than 100,000). 
 One way to bring in more money down the road might be to focus on story ballets, which cost more to produce but fill more seats. But Mr. Charles cautioned that there are only so many worth staging. ''We don't want to end up doing 'The Three Musketeers' and 'Peter Pan,' '' he said. ''That could kill you artistically.''
 Instead he reaffirmed his intention to commission shorter works and to reach out to new audiences. In a novel endeavor, the troupe performed on campus last year with the marching band in ''Ballet in Scarlet and Gray,'' whose title refers to the school colors. The piece coincided with BalletMet's 25th anniversary, as well as the school's recent national championship in football, but it was no mere pat on the back. 
 With the United States then on the brink of war with Iraq, the choreographer Susan Hadley, a veteran of the Mark Morris Dance Group, was wary of striking a righteous or triumphal tone. 
 ''The question was: how could I make a work that I could stand behind artistically?'' said Ms. Hadley, a Columbus native who now teaches in the university's dance department. ''Ultimately, I chose to celebrate qualities I admire in my community and in my country. We are a culture that is still trying to be religiously tolerant, for example, and we are still working on our experiment in pluralism.'' 
 To convey such values onstage, she enlisted a cantor from a local synagogue and a pair of dancers familiar with Islamic and Christian prayer. Together they performed a trio that suggested, through stylized movements, these different spiritual traditions. In another section, as the musicians marched in formation to spell the name Ohio, she brought on a diverse group of local residents to dot the ''i'', a role usually reserved for a sousaphone player.
 Mr. Kudelka, the artistic director at the National Ballet of Canada, also created a piece for the program, which was presented at the Wexner Center. Called ''Gazebo Dances,'' it was set to music written by John Corigliano, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, and performed by the university's acclaimed Wind Symphony. (BalletMet will reprise it, with recorded music, during its run at the Joyce.) 
 The program drew 5,500 people over two nights. ''They came for the marching band,'' Mr. Charles said. ''But they ended up seeing a world premiere by Kudelka and hearing a live rendition of Corigliano.'' 
 Since then, he said, more students are buying tickets to see BalletMet perform downtown. The company is also making plans to return to campus next year. 
 Also on the bill this week is an excerpt from Mr. Welch's newest dance, ''Evolution,'' which had its premiere a few weeks ago at the Capitol Theater. In New York the troupe will perform the first section, ''Play,'' a flurry of pedestrian movement that evokes contemporary urban life. The dancing is accompanied by songs from Moby's album of the same name, which was released in 1999 and went double platinum.
 The third piece on the program, ''Colores de Alma,'' was first staged in Columbus in February. Choreographed by Ms. Carter, a Seattle native who works chiefly in Germany, it casts Spanish flamenco dancing in a modern light.
 Mr. Charles hoped that, both in New York and back home, such dances might spark new interest in his chosen field. ''There will always be some people who don't like ballet,'' he said. ''I don't get that. But then I don't attend a lot of football games either.''

HEADLINE: Four Designs Compete For Les Halles Makeover

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
TEARS were shed when the 19th-century iron-and-glass market known as Les Halles was torn down in the early 1970's, and before long weeping resumed, first over the giant hole that scarred the heart of Paris for a decade, then over the grim multifloor shopping mall and transportation hub that eventually filled it. In this city, at least, the ugliness of Les Halles today is matched only by that of the Tour Montparnasse, the single skyscraper in central Paris. Many here would love to see both demolished.
 Not much can be done about the Tour Montparnasse, but Bertrand Delanoe, the first Socialist mayor of Paris, has now pledged to transform the district of Les Halles. And he has invited Parisians to study and debate four competing designs, all immensely ambitious, all calling for a radical reorganization of the area's buildings and gardens. No price tag has been set, but the city government has said it will make its choice this summer, perhaps combining elements from different proposals, with the first phase of work due for completion in 2007. 
 Major building projects are no novelty for Paris. In the 1980's, the courtyard of the Louvre was excavated to make room for I.M. Pei's glass pyramid, while the Place de la Bastille was disrupted to accommodate the Bastille Opera. Then, in the early 1990's, President Francois Mitterrand ordered up a new National Library of France on the Left Bank of the Seine. Today, things are quieter, with only President Jacques Chirac's pet project, the Musee du Quai Branly for primitive art, rising beside the Eiffel Tower. It is expected to open in 2006. 
 So Mr. Delanoe has decided the time is ripe to polish Paris anew. And he has found a good excuse for doing so. Along with London, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and a half-dozen other cities, Paris is bidding to play host to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Many experts consider Paris a favorite because it already boasts good sports facilities. Wherever they are held, however, Olympic games always offer the occasion for urban renewal. And, in Mr. Delanoe's view, Les Halles is a prime candidate for a makeover.
 The main reason is that today, Les Halles is frankly sleazy. Although barely 300 yards west of the Georges Pompidou Center, its fast-food cafes and tourist shops draw not only young people but also drug traffickers and petty criminals. Its Forum, the main glass and aluminum building, which includes shops, movie theaters and even a museum, looks run-down and uninviting. Below the Forum, some 800,000 commuters crowd through its Metro and suburban R.E.R. stations daily. It has become, the mayor concluded, ''a soulless architecturally bombastic concrete jungle.''
 Last month, he unveiled designs by two French and two Dutch firms. Jean Nouvel, the French architect who designed the Musee du Quai Branly, proposes a vast roof garden over the commercial area as well as a wooden music conservatory in adjacent gardens. Rem Koolhaas, the renowned Dutch architect, is more radical, filling the area with multicolored glass structures resembling perfume bottles. The Dutch M.V.R.D.V. firm headed by Winy Maas suggests covering most of the area with glass, transparent in places, with vegetation in others. Finally, David Mangin, another French architect, opts for a minimalist approach, placing a copper and glass roof over the Forum, with an avenue like the Ramblas in Barcelona cutting through the gardens.
 But what happens if Parisians, notably the vocal 7,000 residents of the quarter, dislike all four proposals? Photographs and models of the designs are on display in the Forum, while the local daily, Le Parisien, has invited visitors to its Web site, www.leparisien.fr, to study computer images and express their preference (Mr. Nouvel's design is the most popular to date among these voters). At the same time, older residents, who bitterly recall the endless squabbling and delays of the 1970's, are already alarmed at the prospect of a new upheaval.
 ''This is such a symbol of the heart of Paris that we cannot afford to make a mistake,'' Mr. Delanoe has conceded. ''We should never forget that Les Halles forms part of our history.'' Yet, he added, in reorganizing a neighborhood that was already populated in the 12th century, the city will have to take risks. 
 Mr. Delanoe too will be taking risks. Today, he enjoys considerable popularity -- his gamble in 2002 and 2003 to turn the banks of the Seine into a city beach paid off handsomely -- but he also aspires to higher office. Like Mr. Chirac before him, he would like to go from City Hall to the Elysee Palace. With presidential elections due in 2007, what happens to Les Halles may well determine if he has a chance.

HEADLINE: Mix of Idealism and Resume-Building Motivates Americans Seeking Jobs in Iraq

BYLINE: By GLEN JUSTICE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
Ty Cobb Jr. was fresh from law school and eager to add to a resume that already included answering mail in the Virginia governor's office when he heard through contacts that the Bush administration was looking to fill civilian jobs in Iraq.
 So despite having little foreign experience beyond touring Europe and studying there for a summer, Mr. Cobb headed to Baghdad. He has since traveled the country -- often packing a 9-millimeter pistol or an AK-47 -- to help educate Iraqis about democracy. He says he is committed to the United States' mission there, but he is not shy about saying that there are career calculations behind his adventure: he hopes it will lead to a government job.
 ''If they look at a resume and see that someone picked up and moved to Iraq for seven months, they will put their faith in you to handle the rigors of any position,'' Mr. Cobb said. 
 Hundreds of Americans have converged on Iraq for all kinds of reasons. Some consider it rewarding to try to bring democracy to the Iraqis. Some are in it for the adventure. For some, it is a combination of the experience, the fervor for supporting the administration's goals and the sense that it is more exciting than work back home.
 Many of these recruits have top-notch skills. But the downside, foreign policy experts say, is that some lack the proper experience for such difficult and often unsafe assignments.
 ''A vast number of people are being recruited who have no qualifications, no background, and who have never done anything serious in the U.S.,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 Daniel Benjamin, who is also at the center working on the postconflict reconstruction project, said some who go to Iraq were altruistic, some were opportunistic and others were just doing a job.
 ''For better or worse, this is the biggest show in town and it's a place to get your ticket punched,'' Mr. Benjamin said.
 The jobs are filled by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the United States civilian administration that is running Iraq. Created just over a year ago, the authority has about 1,160 employees, including more than 325 members of the military and about 150 workers from other countries, according to authority officials. Some are on loan from government agencies in Washington, while others have been hired from the outside. Most recruiting is done through a Defense Department Web page called Sofia (Support Our Friends in Iraq and Afghanistan), which seeks people interested in ''assisting the fledgling governments in their quest to become full-fledged democracies.''
 ''People who submit a resume need to understand that conditions may be harsh, primitive and hazardous,'' the Web page says. ''Conversely, there may be few opportunities in life to make such a lasting contribution to world peace.''
 The authority has received more than 11,000 resumes, and though officials say political affiliation carries no standing, Republican connections seem to help some of them stand out. 
 Mike Hardiman, 43, a former aide to a Republican congressman, was self-employed as a Washington lobbyist and public relations specialist when a Pentagon official he would not identify asked him to go to Iraq. As a lobbyist Mr. Hardiman has handled clients like the American Land Rights Association, which represents property owners opposed to government land regulation. 
 In Iraq, he is a spokesman for the occupation authority, working with a portion of the Iraqi government that, among other things, works on land and infrastructure issues. ''Things like traffic circles, sewers and zoning codes are interesting to me,'' Mr. Hardiman said.
 Mr. Hardiman tells of having to explain to Iraqi reporters that a $10 million beautification effort will not be used to erect statues of President Bush. The truth in Iraq, he says, is sometimes stranger than fiction. But he says he believes in what the United States is doing.
 ''Free speech, an open economy and democracy are the genies that have been let out of the bottle, and they will not be put back in,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''There will be successes and setbacks, but freedom will win, I see it firsthand every day.''
 Rich Galen, 57, is a former press aide to Dan Quayle and Newt Gingrich with extensive international experience who runs an online Republican newsletter called Mullings. He worked in the authority's press office, helping broadcast reporters from smaller markets. 
 Mr. Galen, who is now back in the United States, said he got his invitation from the White House, but he too declined to say who called. ''When they ask you to go, the only answer is 'When can I leave?' '' he said.
 Job descriptions originate on the ground in Iraq, and candidates are found through the database of applicants that Sofia provides. Occupation officials say that all candidates are selected to fill specific jobs according to their credentials, and that many have specific skills that are in demand, like fluency in Arabic or a deep knowledge of health care, financial markets and other policy areas.
 ''Those who are here believe in the mission,'' said Dan Senor, a spokesman for the occupation authority. ''They want a hand in building democracy in Iraq.''
 Most stay from six months to a year, sometimes less, working six-day weeks and often living in the secure part of Baghdad known as the green zone. Those who work outside the zone, where many of the ministries are based, travel heavily guarded. Body armor is common, and many also carry guns. 
 Mr. Cobb, 28, was searching for a job in Washington last year when he heard about the positions in Iraq while at a meeting at the Pentagon to get job advice. His father had served on the National Security Council staff in the Reagan White House, which helped open doors like this.
 The idea immediately appealed to Mr. Cobb, who became interested in a career in counterterrorism or national security after losing a friend in the Sept. 11 attacks. Like many who now serve in Iraq, he said he believed strongly in the war and the efforts that followed. Those who support the war, he said, have a duty to do what they can.
 ''The whole reason I'm here is that I believe it is part of an effort to make America a more secure place,'' Mr. Cobb said. ''That seems to be the general feeling people have.''
 Though conditions in the green zone may be safer than those outside it, many of those interviewed said their routine in Iraq was a radical departure from the lives they had left back home as students, political consultants or employees of government agencies.
 Many spend their days in or around Saddam Hussein's massive palace, which now serves as headquarters for the occupation authority. Meals are eaten in a cafeteria there. Quarters for those who arrive are often large, communal rooms packed with dozens of workers .
 On their first night in Baghdad many have bunked in what is known as the chapel, which several workers described as a religious chamber known for its mural of missiles being launched. Later, they move to four-person trailers that are placed all over the green zone, each surrounded by a wall of sandbags. 
 War stories are common. Many workers interviewed told of being awakened by explosions, and of rocket and mortar attacks that missed them by only a few hundred feet. Even when there is a break in the violence, workers think about the friends who have been killed or wounded. Though only two Americans on the occupation staff have been killed, according to the Pentagon, many workers in Iraq know contractors, locals and workers from other countries who have been victims of the violence. Then there are stories like the decapitation of Nicholas Berg, a contractor, which present the danger in the starkest terms.
 ''Sometimes I feel like this is an evil place, because people are doing terrible things to each other,'' said Elizabeth Cote, 27, a medical student on leave from Harvard University to work on health care policy and volunteer in a combat hospital. ''But it may be the most positive experience in my life. There are examples of kindness and people putting their life on the line to do things.''
 Still, tough conditions have not stopped people from taking these jobs. Iraq offers opportunities to some that they cannot get elsewhere. 
 Jacques Myers, 48, was a civilian firefighter at a military base in Wisconsin who came to train Iraqis. Two weeks after his arrival, his boss left and Mr. Myers was placed in charge of advising the country's 8,400 firefighters, a force comparable to the fire department of a major American city.
 ''It's something I'd never be able to do stateside,'' he said. ''I control $200 million worth of equipment.''
 Van Smith, 23, was at lunch one day when he ran into a college friend and the friend's father, Steve Casteel, a senior American adviser to Iraq's Interior Ministry. They started talking about Iraq.
 Mr. Smith was working at his first job after college, as director of public outreach at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, his alma mater. He happened to be reading a biography of Winston Churchill at the time.
 ''I was at the chapter where we were the same age and he was having life adventure after life adventure,'' he said. ''I was saying I wish I had a chance to be involved in something international and in war, I wish I had a chance to make a difference in a foreign place.''
 He had a resume to Mr. Casteel before the day ended.

HEADLINE: Four 30's Apartment Buildings on 4 Chelsea Corners

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE freshly pointed brick, crisp new windows and construction scaffolding at 201 West 16th Street reflect only repair work, but they make the orange brick apartment house look as if it is just nearing completion.
 The early 1930's building is one of four similar structures on 15th and 16th Streets along Seventh Avenue that were the opening wedge in Henry Mandel's unfinished campaign to rebuild Seventh Avenue below 23rd Street with a group of tall apartment buildings. What he called Chelsea Corners was a visionary plan -- it's a pity Mandel began the project just before the Depression.
 In 1927, Chelsea property owners noticed that an unknown buyer was accumulating big corners on Seventh Avenue north of 14th Street. Although the IRT subway expansion had come down that route in the 1910's, this section of Seventh was still just a stretch of miscellaneous old structures. It soon came out that the buyer was Mandel, 43, who had begun his real estate career building tenements and other modest buildings with his father, Samuel, who brought the family to the United States from the Ukraine in the late 1880's. 
 Mandel predicted that the 17 buildings he envisioned would cost $50 million. He filed plans for the first one, 200 West 16th Street, in July 1929, three months before the stock market crash. Plans for three other buildings -- 200 West 15th, 161 West 16th and 201 West 16th -- followed quickly, and the buildings were completed in 1930 and 1931. Another, at 200 West 22nd, was never built. 
 Mandel was part of a new housing movement in New York City that built smaller, efficient dwellings in large complexes for white-collar employees who wanted to live close to work and would trade a prestige neighborhood for transit convenience. He also sought to remake the neighborhood by dominating one stretch of real estate with complementary structures, and he planned a separate building with meeting rooms and sports facilities. 
 The first element of Chelsea Corners was completed in late 1930, the 18-story-high 200 West 16th. With nine apartments per floor, it was heavily marketed to singles and working couples. Early ads listed prices for one-room apartments as $76 to $145 per month, and four-room apartments as $160 to $270 per month. 
 Like other such buildings, 200 West 16th had space-saving Murphy beds, but with a twist: instead of folding down from a false doorway, they pivoted around on a track from an oversized clothes closet and then unfolded to the floor. 
 A 1931 article in the magazine Buildings and Building Management said that the steel casement windows used in all four buildings of Chelsea Corners were ''given prominent attention in renting and advertising,'' suggesting that such windows were considered a modern improvement over the old wooden double-hung installations.
 Almost simultaneously, Mandel had other projects under way or just finished: his giant London Terrace development, with 1,761 apartments, on the full block of 23rd to 24th Street and Ninth to Tenth Avenue, and his more expensive Parc Vendome, with 600 apartments, just east of Ninth Avenue on a through-block site from 56th to 57th Street. He also built other more conventional buildings, like the Lombardy apartment hotel at 111 East 56th Street, where he lived, and the Pershing Square Building, at 42nd and Park Avenue. 
 Mandel set up an ''Apartment Shop'' at 36th and Fifth Avenue, where he presented five full-size apartments, completely furnished. The two-level store even had sections of the exterior walls laid up so that ''Mrs. Prospect Can Select Her Apartment Just as She Would Select Her Car,'' as a 1931 article in Buildings and Building Management put it.
 In 1930 and 1931 Mandel gamely continued with Chelsea Corners in the face of the Depression. In a 1931 article, ''Build During a Depression? There Are Advantages,'' in the magazine Building Investment and Maintenance, he predicted that economic troubles in the United States would be over in a relatively short period. ''In the broad scheme of things, even six years is not a vast amount of time,'' he said. 
 But Mandel was never able to continue with the rest of his project, and in 1932 he filed for bankruptcy, listing assets of $380,000 and liabilities of $14 million. The four completed apartment houses of Chelsea Corners went into separate ownership.
 The developer went to jail for two months in 1933 because he owed $19,000 in alimony to his former wife, Bertha. One of his final projects was a two-story theater and nightclub at 79th and Madison; he died in 1942. 
 No successor took on Mandel's expansive vision for Seventh Avenue, but construction did continue on the street, which has buildings from the 40's, 50's and 60's occupying some of Mandel's potential corners, and even a few built in the last couple of years. 
 SO the ordered symmetry conceived as Chelsea Corners has emerged with a ragged aspect, and the four corners where Mandel actually did build do offer a spot of harmony. All were designed by Farrar & Watmough; the Chelsea Corners buildings share with London Terrace -- also by Farrar & Watmough -- a variegated orange brick. 
 The building at 200 West 15th Street has some chunky, Assyrian-style ornament with Romanesque-style details. But the buildings at 161 West 16th and 201 West 16th are really the gatekeepers of Chelsea Corners. They have the pointed arches, label moldings, crockets and other details characteristic of the Gothic style, but in the varied brickwork there is also something of the Romanesque.
 The Chelsea Corners lobbies make an interesting study. Those at 200 West 15th and 200 West 16th have nice vaulted ceilings and polychromed tile decoration, but the one at 161 West 16th got what was probably thought to be an ''Art Deco'' makeover perhaps 15 years ago. 
 Three of the four buildings have replaced their steel casement windows with common one-over-one aluminum windows, which serve to deaden the liveliness that Farrar & Watmough sought to impart. But the co-op at 201 West 16th has bucked the trend of the lowest common denominator and has just finished installing near-replicas of the original steel casement windows. 
 ''This co-op is very, very much into the architecture of the building -- from day one they were going to do it this way, and they're really happy with it,'' says Mary Frances Shaughnessy, an owner of Tudor Realty Services, the managing agent. The co-op is also midway through a program of facade repairs. (The building at 161 West 16th is also a co-op; the other two are rentals.)
 The replicas are not perfect -- the frames are thicker than the original steel, and the co-op has specified a black finish -- while the original windows were more likely buff, orange or some color complementary to the masonry. But the obvious desire to do something more appropriate -- as well as the design itself -- gives the building life, while the standard replacement windows in the other buildings are just black eyes.
 In the unlikely event that some future owner wants to find the exact profiles of Mandel's original casement windows, there are a few dozen left. In the 1980's, the clothing store Barney's took over the first four floors on the Seventh Avenue side of 161 West 16th; the space is now occupied by Loehmann's. Barney's blocked up the window openings, but left the original steel casement windows in place.

HEADLINE: Different Fight, Same Battleground

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND SOUND has become a repository for all the dregs and dredgings of humankind. People sweep the leaves from their yards into a wormy pile, and the rain washes the piles of leaves, along with pesticides and dirt and dust from construction sites and the oily grime of highways, into drains and rivers, which carry the muck south.
 When the rivers empty into the Sound, civilization's waste builds in channels, which are squeezed so narrow that boaters maneuvering through the channels are caught in traffic jams on busy Sundays in summer or even get stuck. Last summer a sailboat ran aground in the channel in Milford and the owner broke his leg. Commercial boats have less and less room to move. At low tide, some sailboats can't leave or return to their harbors. 
 No one likes the muck and everyone seems to agree that it needs to be scooped out and hauled away. But where to put it? That question has caused the latest rift between Connecticut and Long Island. After a five-year process to figure out how to dispose of the mud in Connecticut's harbors, the federal government picked two spots, both in the Sound. One is two nautical miles north of Lloyd Point on Long Island and 2.5 miles south of Long Neck Point in Noroton. The other is more than 10 nautical miles north of Shoreham, N.Y., and 5.6 miles south of South End Point in East Haven.
 Long Island and Connecticut have argued relentlessly over the last few years about numerous issues involving the Sound, including the placement and use of an underwater natural gas line and the Cross Sound Cable connecting New England's power grid to Long Island. ''The Cross Sound Cable, the natural gas pipeline -- the timing of this sort of feud on these couple of issues certainly is unfortunate,'' said Mel Cote, the manager of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's water quality unit in New England. ''There just seems to be some bad blood.''
 Although the dredging issue would appear to be a largely political battle, with high-level officials on both sides laying claim to the waterway, residents have gotten involved. Meetings about the proposal to dump 20 million cubic yards of dredged material primarily from Connecticut harbors and marinas over the next 20 years have attracted dozens of people. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has created a massive appendix to an environmental impact statement about the dredging full of comments from the public and answers to these comments. The public has until June 1 to respond to the impact statement. If the process moves forward as planned, dumping wouldn't likely begin until early fall.
 At a recent meeting in Stamford, Long Islanders and other opponents of the plan questioned and sometimes berated scientists working for Connecticut and the federal government. An environmental group opposing the plan had gathered more than 4,000 signatures from residents in both New York and Connecticut who oppose the plan.
 Dumping dredged material in the Sound is nothing new: It has been going on for more than 100 years, according to Mr. Cote of the E.P.A. The two proposed dumping spots have already been used to dump dredged material for at least 20 years without significant impact, he added.
 Material has been dumped ''in the Long Island Sound for a really long time,'' he said.
 The material is tested extensively before any of it is dumped, Mr. Cote said. The Sound is the only inland waterway protected by the federal Ocean Dumping Act, which has high standards for disposing dredged material, he said. Material deemed ''unsuitable'' is removed from the rest of the muck and treated or buried deep underground.
 So why all the fuss?
 For many Long Island residents, the prospect of billions of pounds of dredged material being dumped nearby for the next 20 years is frightening. People who stood up at the meeting in Stamford expressed their fears of the unknown: will children become sick; will the shellfish begin to die off again, will beaches be closed because the dirty sediment has drifted?
 Suzanne Keefe of Stony Point, N.Y., with relatives in Long Island, attended the meeting after reading a flier about the issue. She goes to reunions every year near Merrick in Long Island and watches her young cousins swim and catch fish in the Sound. The prospect of mud from Connecticut's harbors floating into their swimming areas inspired her to speak out.
 ''I've seen a harbor. I've seen a marina,'' she said. ''I know what that water looks like and I don't like the idea of my family members swimming in it.''
 Although scientists with state and federal agencies have said the material that will be dumped is tested thoroughly and no ''unsuitable'' material will be dumped, many Long Islanders were doubtful. Previous federal policies that were supposed to be safe have proven disastrous, said Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive. Dredged material from places like Bridgeport will inevitably be contaminated, he said.
 ''This isn't just some benign sandy beach they're dredging,'' Mr. Levy said.
 The state has invested millions in cleaning up the Sound, which is just recovering from years of pollution, he said.
 ''Why spend millions on one hand to clean up the Sound and then allow for an ill-advised decision to dump these spoils in the same venue you're trying to improve,'' Mr. Levy said.
 After the E.P.A. published its draft Environmental Impact Statement in September 2003, the agency received more than 400 letters, e-mail messages and faxes and listened to 47 people speak at public hearings.
 Among those comments were suggestions for alternative ways to dispose of dredged materials, including depositing the material farther into the ocean or finding an inland use for it.
 Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, an environmental organization based in White Plains, N.Y., said other states have found beneficial ways to reuse dredged spoils. In Elizabeth, N.J., for instance, the city capped a landfill with dredged material and has now placed a mall on the site of the former dump, she said.
 Those alternative methods, state and federal officials said, would cost much more than dumping the material in the two designated areas. The Army Corps of Engineers is required to use the least expensive way to dispose of the material, as long as it's safe for the environment.
 ''If we have a range of alternatives that are environmentally acceptable we have to pick the least costly,'' said Mark L. Habel, the project manager for the corps.
 Dumping the material in the two sites will generally cost around $10 or less per cubic yard, while dumping it on land would cost closer to $35 to more than $100 a yard, Mr. Habel said. The material will be dredged from harbors in New York and Connecticut west of Guilford, with a small percentage of the material likely coming from Long Island harbors.
 The plan's opponents argued that choosing a more expensive option now could save the government money in the long-term.
 ''What will cost more will be to pollute the Sound and spend 10 times that amount to clean it up,'' Mr. Levy said.
 Cost isn't only an issue for the government. Cities and private marinas use the same dump sites. In Milford, one of the smaller harbors in Connecticut, the city has to pay to dredge its marina every few years. The last time the city dredged, it cost about $60,000, said Richard S. Hosking, the operations director for Milford's Harbor Management Commission. Without a long-term cost-effective dumping site, the silt and sediment will overrun the city's harbor and channel, Mr. Hosking said, as he accompanied visitors on a tour of the harbor earlier this month.
 Three buoys that had been placed in a line had begun to shift as they were pushed by sediment from a nearby stream. The depth of water in the channel leading boaters out of the harbor has fallen from 10 to six-and-a-half feet at low tide, Mr. Hosking said. The dredging proposal wouldn't necessarily alleviate the short-term concerns of harbor owners, but it will give them a long-term dumping spot so problems like this won't persist.
 ''I'm sorry to say we have mud and we've got to put it somewhere,'' he said. ''We're not asking to expand anything. We just want to maintain what we have. It would be a financial disaster if Milford or all the Milfords in Long Island Sound would be unable to maintain what they have at a cost that's affordable.''
 Marina operators have been vocal at meetings, arguing that the plan needs to be passed soon to secure their economic interests and the safety of boaters. The mud is safer if it's out in deep water rather than collecting in a marina where people work and play every day, they argued.
 Operators of lobster boats are split on the effects of dredging on their business. At public meetings in Long Island, some argued that their business, which they said has just begun to rejuvenate after a prolonged decrease in the lobster population, could suffer setbacks because of increased dumping at the sites.
 But others disagree about the long-term effects.
 ''Any effect would be short-lived,'' said Bill Damicis, who caught lobsters for 23 years before going to work for Milford Boat Works. ''I don't believe it would be long-lasting.''
 Mr. Damicis said he has set traps around an active disposal site in New Haven Harbor and said the dredging did not create long-term problems with his catch.
 Caught up in the arguments about dredging is the feud between Connecticut and Long Island over the use of the Sound. The Cross-Sound Cable, a 330-megawatt electric line that stretches from New Haven to Shoreham, N.Y., was switched off earlier this month on orders from Spencer Abraham, the federal energy secretary. The line had been operating on emergency orders since the August 2003 blackout. Connecticut officials argued it was environmentally unsound because it was not buried deep enough under the water. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal had even filed a lawsuit to turn the power line off. Now that the line is off, Long Island officials have threatened legal action to get it turned back on. A Congressional subcommittee heard testimony from both sides last week on the issue.
 Connecticut's position on the cable is hypocritical given the state's position on dredging, Mr. Levy said. If the state is so concerned about the environmental impacts of the cable, officials should also be opposing the dumping.
 ''It's just a lot of contradictions here,'' he said.
 In a letter obtained by Mr. Levy's office, the commissioner of the Connecticut D.E.P., Arthur J. Rocque Jr., wrote in June 2002 that he was ''disappointed'' with Mr. Blumenthal's characterization of the cable's negative impact on the environment.
 ''From an environmental perspective, this cable project pales in comparison to even maintenance dredging of the federal navigational channel in New Haven Harbor,'' he wrote. Mr. Rocque added later in the letter that he wasn't trying to ''express concern'' over the dredging, but wanted to put the cable project in perspective.
 Mr. Rocque said in a recent interview that he was simply reacting to Mr. Blumenthal's ''overheated rhetoric'' on the cable, adding that he supports the E.P.A.'s proposal on dredging.
 George Wisker, senior environmental analyst for the D.E.P, said the agency has studied the effects of dumping and is confident that it can be done safely.
 ''We've gone on record as saying that dredging is absolutely necessary to maintain the safety and the ability to use our ports on both the Connecticut and Long Island sides,'' he said. ''This proposal to designate the sites is not a new issue. Disposal has been going on for many, many years. It has not caused environmental problems.''
 But Long Islanders and other opponents aren't taking his word and the turf war continues.
 ''People who live near the water come to think of it as their own,'' Ms. Keefe said. ''That's my Sound.''

HEADLINE: Stadium Opponents Criticize City for Adopting Jets' Economic Study

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
When Bank of America asked the city last year for more than $1 billion in tax-free bonds and other incentives to build a skyscraper on 42nd Street, the city took nothing for granted and had its own economists analyze the potential economic impact of the project. 
 When the Yankees and Mets revived discussions last year about each of them building an $800 million stadium, the city hired a consultant to assess the value of the professional sports teams to the city's economy and a possible municipal investment.
 Yet, when it came to the New York Jets' proposal to build a $1.4 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, the city simply reviewed and adopted an economic impact study commissioned by the football team. An independent analysis either by economists at the city's Economic Development Corporation, or by a consultant, might have produced the same results. But the unusual break with a routine practice has made some officials at City Hall nervous and outraged opponents of the Jets stadium. 
 The Jets contend that the proposed 75,000-seat stadium, which requires $600 million in cash from the city and the state, would generate $27.5 million more in annual tax revenue than it would cost government in bond payments. 
 ''This is the problem we've had with them from the beginning: there's no independent analysis,'' said Walter Mankoff, chairman of Community Board 4 on the West Side and an opponent of the stadium. ''City money is at risk here. They're blind to all the alternatives.''
 The stadium, which would be built over the railyards bounded by 30th and 34th Streets, between 11th and 12th Avenues, would also serve as an Olympic stadium if the city is successful in its bid for the 2012 Summer Games. On Tuesday, the International Olympic Committee selected New York as one of five finalists for the games.
 ''The city is relying on the Jets for these revenue estimates,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, which is doing its own economic impact analysis of the stadium. ''It suggests how badly they want the project to proceed.''
 The Jets say they will put up $800 million for the stadium, more than any professional sports team has ever invested in a new facility. The state and the city are providing $600 million for a retractable roof and the platform over the railyards on which the stadium would be built.
 According to a study done by Ernst & Young for the Jets, the stadium would generate $72.5 million a year in new tax revenues for the city and the state from football and other sporting events, trade shows and circuses. City and state officials estimate that annual debt service payments would cost them about $45 million, leaving a surplus of $27.5 million.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said the city was ''comfortable'' with the results of the Jets' Ernst & Young study.
 ''The key conclusion is that there's a substantial net gain for the city and the state,'' said Mr. Doctoroff, who founded the city's NYC2012 Olympic bid committee before joining the Bloomberg administration.
 He said that the city had not yet found the need to do an independent analysis, ''given the fact that a reputable firm did a thorough analysis, and we had an opportunity to review it in great detail. That's not to say we won't eventually do our own.''
 According to current and former city officials, the city generally does its own economic analysis of so-called retention deals, in which a corporation threatens to leave the city unless it gets tax breaks and other incentives for a new building. Last year, Bank of America and the developer Douglas Durst asked for $1 billion in tax-free bonds and $80 million in sales tax breaks to build a 51-story tower at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, according to one person involved in the negotiations.
 Economists at the Economic Development Corporation did an analysis and pared the numbers sharply, with the city ultimately agreeing to provide $650 million in bonds and about $50 million in tax breaks, although critics thought even that was too much.
 For larger deals involving cash investments, the city frequently hires a consultant, as it did last year when it asked the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche to do an analysis of revised stadium proposals from the Yankees and the Mets. Neither team was happy with the results and they have since hired their own consultants, according to a team official.
 There is no guarantee, however, that a consultant will come up with a different or more accurate result.
 ''There's a fair amount of uncertainty in any of these studies,'' said Robert Berne, a senior vice president at New York University and an expert in municipal finance. ''It's very hard to parse out the economic impact of any subject. The developer will always have one set of assumptions, and the city would probably cut it down using a different set of assumptions.''
 The Jets have gotten plenty of service from the Ernst & Young report. On March 15, Councilman David I. Weprin became one of the first members of the City Council to endorse the stadium, citing the economic benefits. Mr. Weprin, chairman of the Council's finance committee, acknowledged that he had based his evaluation on the Ernst & Young report.
 Mr. Weprin was back on the steps of City Hall with the Jets and members of Mr. Doctoroff's staff last Sunday when he promoted a report by Tishman Construction indicating that the Manhattan site was better than an alternative in Queens favored by many critics. Tishman, which may bid to be the construction manager for the project, said it had used the Ernst & Young report.
 ''This is not an ordinary, arms-length transaction,'' said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat. ''This is driven by Deputy Mayor Doctoroff's personal vision of bringing the Olympics to New York. He married his idea to the Jets, a ready partner. I don't think the evidence, or the merits, play much of a role here.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the proposed Jets stadium in Manhattan misstated the number of City Hall staff members at a May 16 news conference in support of a West Side location for it. There was just one -- Jennifer Falk, the City Hall spokeswoman on duty that weekend, who also serves as spokeswoman to Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, a supporter of the stadium. It was not several members of his staff.

HEADLINE: Easy-Going, but Hands-On, at Trinity

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
JIMMY JONES, aka Dr. James F. Jones, the new president of Trinity College, was telling one of his newest stories: an employee of Trinity College attended a reception in early April for scholarship recipients and their donors. She surveyed the scene, then said to the stranger standing next to her, ''You must have to give a lot of money to get invited to this.'' 
 ''Never enough,'' the stranger said to the woman. ''Never enough.'' 
 The stranger was Dr. Jones.
 He laughed as he told the story, partly because the woman was horrified when she discovered whom her aside was directed to, partly because the brief discourse was as telling of Dr. Jones's past as it may be of his future. Building endowments is one of Dr. Jones's strengths, a skill he has mastered. He has an intellect and savvy at enticing alumni, parents, friends and employees given to musing aloud at receptions to part with their dollars for the good of the school.
 Dr. Jones will be stepping into an academic leadership arena that has had its share of controversy in the last few years, from the recent retirement of Richard Judd from Central Connecticut State University after he was accused of plagiarism, to the resignation in 2003 of John Shumaker, a former president of Central Connecticut State, from the University of Tennessee after questions arose about his spending. University of Massachusetts President William M. Bulger also gave in to pressure to resign last year after news reports surfaced about his brother, a fugitive who was indicted for racketeering and 21 murders. Presidential hopscotch has been played often lately at private schools, too, particularly at Trinity, where four presidents, including the popular Evan Dobelle, have left office within the last five years. That beats the national average (5.3 years) for the length of time a private school president typically serves.
 One student leader said the constant changes had not helped the campus.
 ''Needless to say, it's been an erratic three-year stay at Trinity with a changeover between four different presidents and acting presidents,'' said Patricia Allen, a junior at Trinity. ''Students could have established a strong rapport and contributed enormously to improve existing programs. Instead, the administration was too wrapped up in resolving its own internal instability problems.''
 While at Trinity, the charismatic Mr. Dobelle pushed the State Legislature for $175 million and the state's power brokers for several million to create Hartford's Learning Corridor, grand new buildings that include an elementary, middle and high school, a job-training center, a Boys and Girls club and a social service agency. On campus, he rehabilitated dormitories and expanded and renovated the library and the performing arts center. He also pushed for increased student involvement; by the time he left Trinity, more than half its students were performing volunteer work in the community.
 Dr. Jones is known for taking a gentle approach, unlike his predecessor, Richard Hersh, an outspoken reformer who Trinity hired to fix its perceived reputation as a party school and who was pressured to leave after one year.
 The new president is a connoisseur of 18th-century culture who speaks French, Italian and Latin and who holds degrees from Columbia, the Sorbonne, Emory and the University of Virginia. He is an affable professor of humanities who said he would as much spend his days dissecting Rousseau as he would leading an academic institution. Dr. Jones has, in fact, spent many days dissecting Rousseau, writing numerous published articles and papers bearing such ominous titles as ''On Names as Masks: Rousseau as Renou,'' and ''Rousseau and the Failure of Autobiography.'' But he is not without his fun, as evidenced by a lecture he gave at a teachers' conference, ''Bending Ears and Changing Horses: Cliches We Do Not Need in Class.''
 Even though Connecticut has been straggling behind some states in its economic recovery, Dr. Jones said he is optimistic about increasing Trinity's $340 million endowment. By comparison, Yale University's endowment is $11 billion.
 ''We need to raise a lot of endowment money,'' Dr. Jones said. ''I would never have thought it possible to double the endowment at Kalamazoo, but we did. It occurred within three years of the country being in a deep recession. People were not very fortunate in their campaigns. We were.''
 At Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo in Michigan, where Dr. Jones was president from 1996 until his official departure this summer, he used the money to champion building initiatives and support faculty causes.
 ''He tends to go above and beyond the minimum necessary and he does it with great style and ease,'' said Barry Ross, a professor of music at Kalamazoo who is familiar with Trinity from time spent in Connecticut earning degrees from Yale University and the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford. ''I'm very proud of him for moving to a larger school where his career will take leaps above what it was here.''
 Talk to Dr. Jones, though, and leaps and bounds are far from his mind. If Trinity is happy with him, he said, he will stay put.
 ''I don't play the hopscotch game,'' he said. ''They've had a rough go of it here. I'm trying to learn the poetry of Trinity and I'll just keep doing it until I succeed.''
 For Trinity, Dr. Jones is an unknown quantity. For one longtime mentor, though, he is anything but. Dr. John Wesley Chandler, a former president of Williams College, discovered Dr. Jones when he was chairman of the department of Romance Languages at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Chandler recommended that Dr. Jones take a vice provost position at Southern Methodist University, then the president's job at Kalamazoo College.
 ''The people at Trinity knew me,'' Dr. Chandler said. ''Jimmy's record at Kalamazoo was crucial. The fund-raising that he did there, the way he related to students; he knows a huge number of them, and the respect accorded him by students and by other constituencies as well.''
 Dr. Chandler paused a moment, then chuckled.
 ''After people hear his name, they have often asked me if he's a football coach or a southern evangelist,'' he said. ''Yes, I call him Jimmy. And I think he has the qualities one looks for in chief academic officers and presidents.''
 Trinity is anticipating his arrival, Ms. Allen said.
 ''I'm hoping that Jones will continue a more Dobell-ian reign.''
 Kalamazoo is lamenting his departure.
 ''He's a real hands-on person,'' Professor Ross said. ''He really took charge of everything, from the food service to the fund-raising. He will be very missed here.''

HEADLINE: The View From the End of Life's Assembly Line

BYLINE: By MAREK FUCHS

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
IT was no journey of personal discovery that brought any of the three men to where they are in the here and now: living out their lives amid 2,000 coffins. Victor Ruggieri's job as a coffin salesman was going to be a quick stopover.
 That was nearly 50 years ago. 
 He started as a salesman, driving from funeral home to funeral home with brochures of boxes in his hand and a smile always on his face, even when he had to pitch his wares to a funeral director who was busily embalming a body. 
 ''I was going to do it until something better came along,'' said Mr. Ruggieri, 76, ''but I guess nothing did.'' 
 Twenty years into his career, he was working in a coffin distribution center when he got company, in the form of Theodore Anderson. Like Mr. Ruggieri, Mr. Anderson, now 45, was not overfearful about working in an industry suffused with death, but then again he wasn't so keen. The plan was to make a little money and then flee. But the paychecks, which he needed, kept coming, so he stayed on -- a young black man with a middle-aged white man -- as his relationship with Mr. Ruggieri ripened into one that both men describe as father-son. 
 The two men were recently joined by another in their office at the Brooklyn-based Milos Industries, which has the names of two long-ago coffin companies on the front of its 45 Morris Street location: South Brooklyn Casket and R. Conte Casket. 
 John Gonzalez, 23, recently took a job managing the coffin inventory because it paid well. Looking forward, he is not sure how long he is going to stay.
 Death may have its vagaries, but the sales of coffins are tangible and, in the end, quite reliable. The Casket and Funeral Supply Association of America in Lake Bluff, Ill., said that out of 2.4 million deaths in America in 2003, 1.8 million were considered ''casketed deaths.'' That number includes as many as 75,000 cremation containers, for a grand total of $1.4 billion. 
 From its Yonkers distribution center, Milos Industries sends coffins out to funeral homes as close as Westchester and as far away as West Africa. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Ruggieri, who lives in Bayside, Queens, was poring over an order form for four coffins, soon to be sent by cargo ship, to a doctor in West Africa who also sells coffins. 
 In its cavernous warehouse, the company stores coffins of every quality, from basic to plush. There is the entire range, from what Mr. Anderson, who lives in Teaneck, N.J., refers to as the ''Jewish'' line of plain wooden coffins (observant Jews are buried in either that or a shroud), to low-end coffins made of stiffened cloth, to coffins with a minimal amount of metal, to the S.U.V.'s of coffins, complete with water resistance, some with solid bronze or copper casings. (The company refused to give a price range.) 
 The economy, Mr. Anderson noted, has little impact on which coffins sell. ''Sometimes expensive white ones will be selling,'' he said, ''and then all of a sudden for a week, we'll get orders for five pinks. Maybe it's the moon.'' 
 The need to get so many coffins out to so many different places does not leave much time for reflection or repose. And though that has meant that Mr. Ruggieri has not done much in the way of long-term thinking about death, Mr. Anderson says he has.
 Not that he has come up with any answers about the great beyond. No. There, he has come up decidedly short. 
 ''Most people can keep the inevitable removed from their every-day and every-moment thoughts,'' he said, waving a hand at the stacks of coffins to explain why he cannot. ''It's not that they are comforted, but they sort of have an invincible feeling until a loved one passes away, and then they are hit with a dose of reality.''
 But even though living with 2,000 doses of reality staring him in the face, Mr. Anderson says, he is no more insightful than those who work in plastics factories or those, like Mr. Ruggieri, who can keep their minds solely on their work, as if they were shipping widgets. 
 Mr. Anderson said: ''There is no figuring death out, and there's no such thing as a preparation book. When a person has been sick and passes away, it's a bad thing. And when a person dies suddenly, it's a bad thing.''
 After two decades of thinking about it, Mr. Anderson throws up his hands. ''I just don't know,'' he said. ''After all of it, I just have more insight and knowledge about caskets than the common person.'' 
 That is not to say, he quickly adds, that his life's work does not give him a greater foreshadowing of his ultimate fate. 
 ''I did get life insurance,'' he said. ''And when my daughter was born, I added to it.'' 
 For Mr. Ruggieri, avoidance is accomplished naturally -- because he and his co-workers do not directly deal with the dead; only the products that the dead will be placed in.
 The two worlds -- that of the dead and that of the products the dead will be placed in -- only collide the day before Halloween, when live people enter the warehouse asking to rent coffins for the night. They are accommodated, and appear satisfied, with damaged coffins that cannot be sold.
 Mr. Ruggieri plans to retire some year soon, and Mr. Anderson cannot fathom work without him. He learned from Mr. Ruggieri, he said, everything he knows about the business -- repeating the word ''everything'' twice for emphasis. Mr. Ruggieri taught him a knowledge of each coffin's particulars, the importance of learning the idiosyncrasies of every funeral director's tastes and a fealty to the ideal of getting the coffins out on time. 
 Mr. Gonzalez, who started in the business just this year, is learning, too. For the time being, he refuses to tell women what he does for a living. 
 ''I can't use it as a line,'' he said. ''It might scare them away.'' 
 Asked where he wants to be 5, 10 or 20 years from now, Mr. Gonzalez says, his ambitions are fixed low (or maybe not so low).
 ''Just happy and alive,'' he said.
 Two decades into the business, Mr. Anderson still has a trouble explaining his occupation, at least to his daughter. ''I just always tell her the same thing,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''Daddy sells furniture.''

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Is Another Threat to Jobs

 BODY:
To The Editor:
 Continued funding of major military programs isn't the only fear of thousands of residents employed in the aerospace industry (''Defending Connecticut's Defense Industry,'' April 25). The other fear is outsourcing. As defense contractors push for greater efficiencies, many believe it's only a matter of time before their job is moved to low-cost labor markets overseas. 
 It doesn't have to be that way. Connecticut already has implemented a program that's helping dozens of small aerospace manufacturing companies compete internationally.
 Aerospace Components Manufacturers (A.C.M.), an association of 43 smaller companies with combined employment of about 3,500, recently was awarded $212,500 in grants to help members transition to 'lean' manufacturing, the new international standard for efficiency and employee empowerment. Half of the money comes from the United States Department of Commerce and the other half from the state through the Governor's Council on Economic Competitiveness and Technology, under a program administered by the Department of Economic and Community Development and the Connecticut Economic Resource Center. Grants are matched by A.C.M. participants.
 Under these grants, companies can streamline internal procedures and help aerospace purchasing managers create greater savings by looking beyond a simple comparison of labor costs.
 Clearly, if labor pricing were the only factor determining where to purchase goods, Connecticut companies couldn't be as competitive. However, by including consideration of quality, reliability, turn-around time, the vagaries of long distance shipping, and the cost of dispatching agents across the globe to oversee production, the equation changes.
 Overseas competition is a fact of life. Connecticut's programs can help purchasing managers shift from a simple comparison of manufactured costs to a new realization of true total procurement costs. Continued state and federal support for programs like those run by A.C.M. is one way keep Connecticut's competitive edge and its jobs.

HEADLINE: Mohegan Tribe Seeking To Expand Reservation

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
Montville officials received notification last week from the Bureau of Indian Affairs that the Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut had applied to expand its reservation in the town by about 49 acres.
 The mayor of Montville, Joseph W. Jaskiewicz, said the expansion called for the tribe to put an additional 18 of its properties into trust, which mostly include private homes, a church and a cemetery.
 Mark Brown, the tribe's chairman, said the expansion was part of the 700 uncontested acres the tribe was allotted in the compact with the state that established the reservation in 1994. Mr. Brown said the expansion would bring the size of the reservation to about 350 acres. 
 He said any additional land would not be used for casino purposes.
 ''Every year and a half we go back and assess the properties we've acquired and determine whether or not we want to put those lands into trust,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We can't understand why this has even become a topic. This is something we agreed to in 1994, and we're just doing due diligence to make sure we meet all of the requirements of that standard.''
 Mr. Jaskiewicz said the loss of the land would cost the town $268,000 a year in taxes. He said he would look to increase economic development in the town to make up the revenue, but hoped the tribe could help. Mr. Brown said he would be willing to talk with the town.
 Both Mr. Jaskiewicz and Mr. Brown said the town and the tribe have an excellent working relationship.
 Mr. Jaskiewicz said the town receives $500,000 each year from the tribe under the compact. He said the tribe has also donated a new bus to the town and paid for an upgrade to the sewer system. JEFF HOLTZ

HEADLINE: The Bounce Is Back For Sneaker Makers

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
THE Nocturnal Skateboard Shop, half a block from the buzz of South Street in Philadelphia, sold few Nikes until recently. Many skateboarders found the company's shoes uncomfortable and, what's worse, considered them uncool.
 Then Nike rolled out a reworked line of skateboarding shoes, with special insoles and thickly padded tongues, and added plenty of extreme-sports flash to their curb-grinding functionality. Now the shoes are prized at skateboard shops around the country.
 Especially popular at Nocturnal is a light-green-and-black suede version of the Dunk high-top basketball sneaker, modified for skateboarding. ''We've got nonskaters coming in to buy them,'' said Tim Quinn, one of the shop's owners. ''Some just get them to collect and put up on the shelf.'' 
 Skate shops, of course, are not the only places where Nikes -- and sneakers in general -- are hopping off the shelves. Nationwide, teenagers, the main buyers of sneakers, are again scooping up high-priced shoes. As a result, the stocks of the biggest makers of athletic footwear -- Nike, Reebok International, Adidas-Salomon and Puma A.G. Rudolf Dassler Sport -- have risen by double-digit percentages over the last year, and many analysts expect them to continue to climb. The gains have come after several years when the industry looked more like a mall walker than like the sprinter Marion Jones.
 What's changed? An improving economy puts more money in teenagers' pockets, turning them away from the cheaper retro styles and back to costly, showy shoes. ''We're at the cusp of an up cycle,'' said Zu Y. Cowperthwaite, senior analyst at Evergreen Investments. ''You're seeing a surge in consumer spending, and what's driving that is fashion and pent-up demand for high-end products.''
 Shoe retailers are expanding their stores and their marketing expenditures. And the Olympics this summer should give sneaker sales -- and shoemakers' stocks -- another nudge. All that leads Ms. Cowperthwaite to say the four stocks, especially Nike's, should keep rising over the next 9 to 12 months. 
 Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., has dominated the industry. In 2002, the latest year for which figures are available, it had a 39 percent share of the domestic athletic footwear market, more than three times as large as its closest rivals, Reebok, at 11.9 percent, and New Balance Athletic Shoe, a private company based in Boston, at 11.6 percent, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter. Adidas is No.4, at 9.7 percent. 
 Internationally, the competition is closer, though Nike, in 2002, still had more than twice the market share of Adidas, the second-place company, 34.1 percent to 16.5 percent. 
 Analysts trace the strength of Nike's stock to smart marketing, frequent shoe updates and, lately, prudent financial management. 
 ''They've made great strides in terms of gross-margin management,'' Ms. Cowperthwaite said. ''They're purchasing better, communicating better with retailers so the retailers don't discount as heavily, and they've made a huge investment in inventory-control systems.'' In fiscal 2003, Nike's gross margin hit 41 percent, the highest number in a decade. 
 Nike's price-to-earnings multiple isn't close to the level it reached during the mid-1990's, when it was about 26, said John J. Shanley of Wells Fargo Securities. ''Our estimate is about 22 times this year's earnings,'' he said. ''It's been as high as 26.''
 Its stock rose 31.6 percent in the 12 months ended on Friday. 
 Despite that formidable position, Nike faces challenges. Its marketing depends on endorsements from athletes, including Michael Jordan, who has retired from professional basketball -- apparently for good this time. The company needs to find someone to replace him as its marquee marketer. 
 None of the active National Basketball Association players who endorse Nike products have Mr. Jordan's combination of on-court excellence and off-court magnetism. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers has talent and championships, but his arrest on a charge of sexual assault in Colorado has dulled his marketing appeal. Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors has been hampered by injuries. Two of Nike's newest endorsers, the rookies LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, have shown on-court poise and off-court charisma but are years away from approaching Mr. Jordan's level of stardom. 
 One sport that Nike is emphasizing is soccer, which is now dominated by Adidas, based in Germany. In 2002, Nike became the exclusive apparel provider for Manchester United in England, one of the world's best-known soccer teams, and the company counts Mia Hamm, the American women's soccer star, among its endorsers.
 Adidas says it will hold its ground. ''We have a 60 percent share of soccer boots in America,'' said an Adidas spokesman, Jan Runau. ''Adidas always was and always will be the No.1 soccer brand.'' 
 In other American sports, Adidas lags. ''North America is a market where we need to get better,'' Mr. Runau said. Over the next two years, Adidas will add 15 company-owned stores to the five it has in the United States. Its stock has climbed 23.3 percent in the last 12 months.
 The company will also need to update the styling of its shoes, said Mr. Shanley of Wells Fargo. Adidas ''hasn't grasped the true driver of success here -- styling content,'' he said. Consider its ClimaCool running shoes, with vented soles. ''The majority of American running shoes are bought to hang around in, not run in,'' Mr. Shanley said. ''The problem with ClimaCool is that if you step in a puddle, your feet get wet.'' 
 WHERE Nike and Adidas emphasize the athletic uses of their wares, Reebok, based in Canton, Mass., has branched out, recruiting hip-hop musicians like 50 Cent and Jay Z as endorsers. Reebok is also the exclusive provider of shoes and apparel for the National Football League. An exclusive deal with the N.B.A. will begin next season. In April, Reebok announced that it was buying the Hockey Company Holdings, a Canadian supplier of jerseys to the National Hockey League. 
 Reebok, once the United States' biggest producer of athletic footwear, stumbled in the 1990's. But in 1999, a former chief executive, Paul Fireman, returned to day-to-day management and increased profits. In the last year, its stock has risen 16.4 percent. 
 Robert S. Drbul, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, says Reebok's stock, now at $34.69, about 11 times his estimate of 2005 earnings, is undervalued. Mr. Drbul's 12-month target for the stock price is $45, or a multiple of 15. Reebok executives declined to be interviewed. 
 Unlike its competitors, Puma, also based in Germany, has all but abandoned the idea that many of its shoes are used for anything more strenuous than playing video games, though it does highlight offerings for yoga and racecar driving. 
 Ms. Cowperthwaite, at Evergreen Investments, says Puma's fashion focus makes it more vulnerable to competition and stock-price sags. ''If you look at what drives the bulk of the demand, it's performance shoes,'' she said. ''Fashion is easier to copy than performance.'' 
 Jochen Zeitz, Puma's chief executive, disagreed. ''The majority of sneakers get sold to the casual consumer, so you can't just appeal from a performance point of view,'' he said. ''You have to appeal to coolness as well.'' Being cool has paid off. Over the last year, Puma's shares have more than doubled. And Puma has carved out an identity in an industry where, in terms of utility, the products are arguably interchangeable. 
 ''At the end of the day, it's a brand battle,'' said Paul M. Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Program at the University of Oregon. ''People can get a very good shoe from any of these companies. What motivates them to buy is brand affinity.''

HEADLINE: Biotech Firms Provide Hope in Anemic Office Sector

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
EXPANSION of biotechnology and life-science-related companies, seen by some real estate executives as perhaps the strongest hope in the commercial office market in New Jersey, suffered a blow when Gov. James E. McGreevey's ''one university'' plan fell apart last year.
 The proposed consolidation of Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to create a single scientific research powerhouse provoked many objections and scant support from the academic world; it was officially dropped late last summer.
 And yet, according to knowledgeable brokers, state officials and leading academic scientists, although the plan went nowhere, the mere fact that it was proposed seems to have played a part in spurring more public and private research.
 ''Biotech firms -- those smaller pharmaceutical companies with limited products on the market and/or initial products in the early stages of research and development -- represent, arguably, the hottest future business in the United States and globally,'' according to Thomas V. Giannone, who directs the Technology Enterprise Group at Cushman & Wakefield, the large commercial real estate firm whose New Jersey operations are based in East Rutherford. 
 There are currently 124 biotech firms in New Jersey, making it the fourth-ranked state in the country, according to the Biotechnology Council of New Jersey, a trade group. A spate of new state initiatives to attract are forthcoming, said Debbie Hart, the president of the organization.
 Not only has the McGreevey administration tailored new business incentive programs to smaller biotech companies, she said, but state officials have placed new emphasis on public-private cooperation to help them thrive.
 ''The discussion over the higher education reorganization plan really created a lot of new connections,'' observed Sherrie Preische, an astrophysicist who serves as executive director for the state's Commission on Science and Technology. ''People who didn't even know about each other previously started talking, and the positive results of that are clearly evident.''
 A new collaborative effort by Princeton University, Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry's Cancer Institute and several large pharmaceutical companies is under way to create a center for ''bio-informatics'' -- a field combining computer science and life science that seeks to interpret and use information recently discovered about the human genetic code -- Dr. Preische noted. ''Obviously, this will attract more businesses involved in this new field,'' she added. 
 IN addition, she and others enthusiastically praised Governor McGreevey's move this month to create the nation's first state-sponsored stem cell research institute in New Brunswick. The idea was born during conversations over the higher education reorganization plan, according to Dr. Preische. 
 The new state-financed research center is to be operated jointly by Rutgers University and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
 A site near the main Rutgers campus has been selected, and there is a proposed $6.5 million allocation for construction of a building in the governor's budget for 2005, now being considered by the State Legislature.
 Dr. Preische said that a nearby site in downtown New Brunswick is being considered for construction of a related office building that could house start-up businesses and incubator labs engaged in stem cell research.
 Cushman & Wakefield formed its technology group specifically to help lure such projects to New Jersey, according to Christopher E. Kinum, a Cushman senior managing director, whose domain includes the Technology Enterprise Group. ''From the beginning, our idea has been to coordinate with academic institutions and development authorities to help attract R.&D. facilities, high-tech operations, incubator labs and other life science business to New Jersey,'' he said. 
 Now, Mr. Kinum said: ''The progress of these industries should foster recovery in key markets, like the Route 78 corridor, which has experienced significant vacancies during the past several years. As the state's pharmaceutical corridor, this region is well positioned to take advantage of the upturn.''
 New Jersey, sometimes promoted as ''the medicine chest of the world,'' is the home of more than a 100 pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies in addition to biotechnology companies like Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Celgene, Pharmacopeia and Medarex, which develop and test new medical products. Interstate 78, where many medical-related companies of all types are located, has been dubbed the ''Cure Corridor,'' 
 Mr. Kinum said he was optimistic about a cure for the ailing office real estate market -- first-quarter reports show the overall office vacancy rate holding steady at 19 percent -- because of signs that life science businesses will take up a considerable part of the slack.
 PHARMACY-RELATED businesses spent $1.2 billion on capital projects last year, according to a survey done for the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a trade organization.
 Mr. Kinum cited the recruitment of the Public Health Research Institute to New Jersey from Manhattan two years ago as an example of how biotech companies can help to revitalize a market. The institute was wooed to the University Science Park in Newark, between the Rutgers campus in the city and the University of Medicine and Dentistry, by the lure of state business incentive programs and the promise of first-rate facilities.
 ''We're thrilled,'' said Lewis M. Weinstein, the president of the independent research institute. ''We were in existence in Manhattan since 1941, but we are thrilled with the move. The building is great, and the relationships are great.'' The institute occupies a little more than half of the 190,000-square-foot science park building at 225 Warren Street, with the medical school using the rest of the space.
 The research institute employs 125 researchers in its labs in Newark, Mr. Weinstein said, and is supported by 25 different grants from the National Institutes for Health. ''We now have a pretty significant concentration of activity and resources related to disease research in Newark,'' he said.
 Mr. Weinstein said that after the national anthrax scare in 2001, the institute sought and gained two large grants to study bioterrorism, and his scientists have begun to focus on ''bio-defense.'' Other scientists from a tristate regional consortium of 30 public and private research groups working on defending against bioterrorism will soon be joining them to work in Newark, he said. The consortium was awarded $60 million over five years; the institute's share is $2 million, according to Mr. Weinstein. 
 The other grant for $21 million, awarded to the institute in partnership with University of Medicine and Dentistry, is for research into pathogens, which requires use of special containment labs. The grant will finance the construction of a new 30,000-square-foot building equipped with such labs, to go up near the science park structure.
 Mr. Weinstein said that his institute was asking the state Economic Development Authority to consider constructing another building nearby to house biotech companies that want to locate near its ''world-class academic scientists'' and the containment labs, of which very few exist in this country.
 A Cushman & Wakefield market analysis indicated it was ''highly likely'' many biotech companies would be interested in becoming tenants, according to Mr. Weinstein.
 The director of the state Economic Development Authority, Caren Franzini, said the state was hoping to create special neighborhoods around university campuses in Newark, Camden and New Brunswick that are geared to people working in high-tech industries. She cited the governor's plan to create ''innovation zones'' that include office parks, start-up labs and housing.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Franzini observed, medical-related companies continue to relocate to New Jersey, one by one, simply because so many are already here. And existing firms regularly grow and expand, she said.
 A couple of recent examples include last month's lease of 10,720 square feet at Mack-Cali Realty's 6 Campus Drive in Parsippany by the biotechnology firm Alteon Inc., which relocated from smaller offices in Ramsey. Alteon is developing several new classes of drugs that reverse or slow diseases of aging, including cardiovascular diseases and complications of diabetes.
 In addition, Reliant Pharmaceuticals expanded its headquarters space by 20,000 square feet at the interchange of Interstates 287 and 78 in Bernards Township. Reliant develops and markets treatments to manage cholesterol levels, hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.

HEADLINE: North Korea and Japan Sign a Deal on Abductions

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 22 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi flew to North Korea on Saturday to meet with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader. After promising to give North Korea millions of dollars of medical aid and thousands of tons of rice, Mr. Koizumi flew home with five children of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea almost a quarter century ago.
 But Mr. Koizumi's bold trip ended in hostile criticism back home, with some Japanese suggesting that he had been treated shabbily by Mr. Kim and expressing anger that the American husband and two daughters of a kidnapped Japanese woman remained in North Korea.
 ''The prime minister made an easy compromise,'' Takeo Hiranuma, a leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said after Mr. Koizumi announced that Japan would give North Korea $10 million and 250,000 tons in food aid. ''Even if it was for the normalization of the diplomatic relationship, he has used the card to say that Japan will not impose the economic sanctions.'' 
 In a region where saving face is paramount, the 10-hour stay in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, was riddled with slights to the Japanese leader. When Mr. Koizumi, leader of the second largest economy in the world, arrived in Pyongyang, only a midlevel Foreign Ministry official was at the airport to greet him. There was no banquet. Mr. Koizumi ate a box lunch of rice balls an aide brought from Tokyo.
 Although visits by heads of government to North Korea are rarities, Mr. Kim spared only 90 minutes to meet with Mr. Koizumi, and then canceled a planned afternoon session. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Kim, who runs a largely bankrupt state, was filmed by television cameras, waggling a forefinger in a jocular, but condescending fashion, in the nose of the Japanese leader, who stood stoically. Mr. Koizumi, who faces upper house elections in July, had hoped to win a diplomatic success in North Korea to divert attention from a serious scandal in Japan over nonpayment of social security taxes by the prime minister and many governing party politicians. 
 Mr. Koizumi later told reporters that the North Korean leader promised to continue regional talks about dismantling his nuclear program, to start talks about normalizing relations with Japan, and to allow the American, a United States Army defector, to travel to Beijing to meet his Japanese wife. But no deadlines were set for any of these promises. 
 ''I emphasized strongly to Kim Jong Il that there is very little to gain in terms of energy aid or food aid by possessing nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Koizumi told reporters in Pyongyang. ''But if you abandon nuclear weapons, you can gain the international community's cooperation.''
 He also said: ''We must normalize our abnormal ties. It is in the interests of both countries to change our hostile relation into a friendly one, our confrontational ties into cooperative ties. That is why I went to North Korea a second time.''
 But it is unclear if Mr. Koizumi asked about the fates of dozens of other Japanese who were kidnapped by North Korea to train spies.
 ''We must say it was the worst outcome,'' said Shigeru Yokota, a leader of a group of the families of the kidnapped Japanese, said at a somber news conference here this evening. ''We're so angry, and don't know how we will act when we meet Prime Minister Koizumi.''
 Shigeo Iizuka, 65, whose sister Yaeko Taguchi went missing in 1978, said, ''The premier betrayed our expectations.''
 Some critics said Japan was paying ransom for the freedom of five children who had been separated from their parents since October 2002, after Mr. Koizumi's first visit to North Korea. 
 South Koreans learned long ago that money talks in North Korea. The inter-Korean summit meeting of 2000, which led to Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president at the time, being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was facilitated by the transfer of about $500 million to North Korea. South Korea has since routinely delivered large amounts of food aid or fertilizer to guarantee meetings with North Korean officials.
 In his defense, Mr. Koizumi told reporters in Pyongyang on Saturday: ''Of course there will always be criticism, but it's not collateral for the relatives, it's the responsibility of the international community to aid North Korea.''
 In the case of the American, Charles Robert Jenkins, Mr. Koizumi said he met for one hour with Mr. Jenkins and his two college-age daughters, Mika, 20, and Belinda, 18, both students at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. Mr. Jenkins, now 64, has lived in North Korea since 1965, when he apparently defected by leaving his patrol on the demilitarized zone and walking into North Korea. 
 ''Jenkins was very concerned that if he went to Japan he would be handed over to America,'' Mr. Koizumi told reporters after meeting the family. ''I said I would make the best efforts for them to live as a family in Japan. But Jenkins wasn't persuaded.'' 
 He said Mr. Jenkins agreed to travel to Beijing with his two daughters to meet his Japanese wife, Hitomi Soga. Mr. Koizumi added, ''I would like to create the opportunity for the reunion of Ms. Soga and her family as soon as possible.'' 
 Back in Tokyo, Ms. Soga, who has become a national icon, fought back tears at a news conference, saying: ''It isn't that we won't meet again for the rest of our lives. So, thinking that I can surely meet them soon, I want to persevere for that day.''
 American officials have turned down Japanese requests that Mr. Jenkins be pardoned.
 ''I'm sympathetic from a human point of view,'' Ambassador Howard H. Baker Jr. told reporters on Thursday. ''But he's classified as a deserter.''
 According to Taro Isshiki, a Tokyo lawyer who recently helped a client successfully beat back an American extradition request, it would by no means be automatic for Mr. Jenkins to be handed over to American military police on arrival in Japan. An American request would have be to reviewed by the Tokyo High Court, a process without a preordained outcome that could take months, he said.
 From a strategic point of view, North Korea's leader, knowing that the Japanese public follows the Jenkins saga closely, may want to keep the issue as an irritant between Japan and the United States, close military and economic allies.
 In addition, Mr. Kim is careful to avoid showing any weakness before Japan, the colonial power in Korea from 1910 to 1945. In 2002, he apologized to Mr. Koizumi for the kidnappings of the Japanese, crimes that were largely committed in the 1970's, when his father, Kim Il Sung, ran North Korea.
 ''On the abductees, he has been criticized internally for this unforgivable apology, for this view of North Korea bowing down to Japan,'' Selig S. Harrison, Asia program director of the Center for International Policy in Washington, said after meeting with North Korean civilian and military official in Pyongyang last month. ''The idea of Koizumi flying to Pyongyang is important to him politically. It avoids North Korea looking like it is the supplicant.''
 On Saturday, North Korea's news media did not mention the issue of the kidnappings. Instead, it dwelled on the fact that the leader of Japan traveled to North Korea bearing gifts. In the past, defectors have said, foreign food aid is portrayed by North Korean officials as ''tribute'' to their militarily powerful nation.

HEADLINE: The Oil Question: To Fret or Not to Fret

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE United States has managed to thrive despite high budget deficits and a staggering level of international indebtedness. Can it also thrive if oil prices remain above $40 a barrel and gasoline costs more than $2 a gallon at the pump?
 The standard answer is yes, and the argument goes like this: First, oil prices are still lower, after adjusting for inflation, than they were in the 1970's. Second, the United States is much less ''energy intensive'' than it was 30 years ago, using about half as much oil to produce each dollar's worth of output. Third, even a big jump in oil prices is typically a one-time hit on consumer prices and not a prelude to sustained inflation. 
 Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, has argued that the biggest change since 30 years ago is the stunning decline of inflation.
 When inflation and inflation fears were high in the 70's and 80's, Mr. Bernanke has argued, the Fed felt compelled to react to higher oil prices by raising interest rates and slowing the economy. Fed policy, or fear of Fed policy, was the real reason that recession followed the oil shocks of 1974, 1980, 1990 and 2000.
 Today, Fed officials believe that inflation is so low that they have no need to react in the same way. Indeed, if higher oil prices were to cause a dip in economic growth, the Fed might view them as a reason to keep interest rates low.
 All that may well be true, but there are reasons to be concerned. The United States has become habituated to low oil prices. The American love affair with heavy S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks has driven the average fuel economy of new cars to its lowest level in more than 20 years.
 And while it is true that the American economy has grown much faster than its consumption of oil, it is also true that American oil imports have skyrocketed while American oil production has declined.
 Crude-oil imports have jumped to about 9.6 million barrels a day in 2003, from about 5.8 million barrels a day in 1990. Add imports of other petroleum products, from natural gas to gasoline, and the United States is now importing about 12 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of its consumption.
 It is true that energy accounts for a smaller share of the total economy than it did 30 years ago, but the difference is not as profound as it first appears.
 The Energy Information Administration, a statistical arm of the Energy Department, estimates that energy expenditures are now about 6.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. By contrast, the energy share soared from 8 percent to 14 percent of gross domestic product immediately after the oil embargo of 1973.
 It is soothing to think that the United States' energy intensity has declined because businesses and consumers have become more efficient and more focused on knowledge-based industries like finance, software and technology. But while that is true in part, energy intensity fluctuates with energy prices. Energy prices have been low or declining for two decades, so energy spending has played a smaller role in the total economy. But with oil and natural gas prices both near record levels, the United States is likely to look a lot more energy intensive this year.
 Few experts, if any, believe that oil prices are about to tip the United States back into a recession, as happened after four of the five last oil-price shocks. But Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said optimists might be overlooking several worrisome details.
 Even though oil consumption has declined as a share of the total economy, Mr. Hatzius notes that oil imports are just as big a share as ever of the gross domestic product. Because oil imports have climbed so sharply, higher oil prices mean that more money leaves the United States and less is simply recirculated from oil consumers to oil producers.
 There are other jolts as well. American car companies, for example, have become dependent on the sale of bigger, heavier sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Leave aside last year's frenzy over the Hummer H2 S.U.V., which gets about 11 miles to the gallon but has already seen its popularity plunge.
 Consider what happened to Detroit's Big Three car companies in the 1970's, when they found themselves blindsided by demand for small cars. In their panic to change course, they introduced several of the worst new cars of all time: the Chevy Vega, the Ford Pinto and the A.M.C. Gremlin.
 ''The auto industry has a huge problem,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an independent oil analyst based in Newport Beach, Calif. ''Detroit is once again going to have to retool with hybrid cars of whatever the market demands.''
 Not surprisingly, the Bush administration has used high oil prices to argue that Congress should pass energy legislation that would hand out $18 billion in tax breaks to oil and gas companies, renewable-energy producers and others.
 But none of that will do much to curb soaring demand for oil anytime soon. At the moment, the only real impulse for energy conservation is the one that comes from higher oil prices.

HEADLINE: The Tony Effect (or Lack Thereof)

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
DO the Tony Awards matter?
 Sure, winning has its pleasures: prestige, a chance to thank Uncle Larry on national television, a shiny trophy. But of the many odd aspects of the Tony Awards, one of the oddest is that the prizes rarely have any effect on a show's box office. Of course, this is related to another Tony quirk: many of the nominated shows have closed by the time the awards come around (this year, two of the four nominees for best play are already gone). But even winners that are still being performed may not benefit much from their prizes. 
 The Tony's influence looks especially weak when compared to that of its award-show siblings. Musicians like Diana Krall, Norah Jones and Bonnie Raitt received major boosts in record sales after winning Grammy Awards. Before Charlize Theron was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress for her performance in ''Monster,'' the low-budget film had brought in only $6 million in ticket sales; she won, and it has now grossed more than $34 million. And winning best picture can turn a hit like ''Chicago,'' the winner last year, into a blockbuster. 
 By contrast, ''Take Me Out,'' which won last year's Tony for best play, enjoyed only a modest bump in ticket sales that disappeared by the end of the summer; the show closed in January before recouping its investment. ''In the long run, the Tony doesn't make a difference,'' said Thomas Schumacher, president of Disney Theatrical Productions. ''Look at 'Beauty and the Beast.' It's running 10 years and it never won a Tony. 'Aida' didn't even get nominated for best musical, and it's finishing a four-and-a-half-year run.''
 Of course, that's easy to say when you have the marketing muscle of the Walt Disney Company behind you, but still, Mr. Schumacher has a point. ''Mamma Mia!'' never won a Tony, and it has grossed more than $150 million after running for three years in New York. ''Nine'' beat out ''Gypsy'' for best musical revival last year, but it closed in December when its grosses plummeted after Antonio Banderas left the show. And ''Private Lives,'' named best revival of a play in 2002, made more in ticket sales in the month before the awards than in the month after.
 This lack of box-office impact doesn't seem to have quelled Broadway's Tony lust. Over the last few years, the ratings for the CBS broadcast of the ceremony, this year on June 6 from Radio City Music Hall, have declined, but the hoopla surrounding the Tonys has not. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on print ads, parties for voters as well as gifts sent to the 735 voters. This year, the loot has included a splashy souvenir book from ''Bombay Dreams'' and a CD from ''Avenue Q'' with a new song, ''Rod's Dilemma,'' which encourages the listener to ''vote your heart'' and includes the refrain ''They're all counting on you . . . 'Avenue Q.' ''
 ''The shame of the Tonys is the money spent trying to win one,'' said Robyn Goodman, who helped produce ''Avenue Q.''
 Most of the lobbying is usually for the category of best new musical. The winner is often already a hit (see ''Hairspray'' and ''The Producers,'' as well as this year's favorite, ''Wicked''), but the Tony helps lead to profits down -- and on -- the road. Just as an Oscar helps a film's future DVD sales, the impact of a Tony for best musical is often greatest in the show's second and third lives, in touring companies around the country and abroad. These audiences may not know or care whether a show has recouped its investment or even what its reviews were, but if it's a Tony winner, then it sounds like a success. This is especially true in smaller markets. ''In Chicago and L.A., the Tonys don't matter,'' said Hal Luftig, a producer of ''Thoroughly Modern Millie.'' ''They have their own awards and their own reviews. In places like Fort Lauderdale, the Tonys are important.''
 Some producers will keep a money-losing show onstage in the hope that a Tony victory will turn its fortunes around. ''Titanic'' (1997) and ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' (2002) opened in the spring to mixed reviews and unenthusiastic word of mouth. Grosses rose after each won a Tony, but neither show became a hit: ''Titanic'' lasted about two years and didn't earn back its $9 million investment. ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' is closing on June 20. Despite its two-year run, the producers expect to return only 80 percent of the original capitalization of $9.5 million.
 Veteran Broadway producers claim there was never a golden age for the Tony effect. Bernard Gersten, the producer of Lincoln Center Theater, said he didn't remember the Tonys having much impact three decades ago, when he helped produce the musical ''A Chorus Line,'' which won nine awards in 1976. ''It won only a few less Tonys than 'The Producers' did and the effect was nothing compared to the effect of the success of the show,'' he said.
 The last major change in the impact of the Tony Awards, the producer Emanuel Azenberg said, was when the ceremony was first televised, in 1967. In fact, the real economic impact of the Tonys may have less to do with who wins the prizes. What may be more important is how a show looks on television: the best-musical nominees are each allowed to stage one production number during the broadcast. Every show wants the opening spot, considered a priceless (and free) bit of advertising.
 Last year, ''Movin' Out'' lost the best new musical award; nevertheless, it probably benefited more from the awards than any other show. The ceremony opened with Billy Joel, the show's songwriter, playing ''New York State of Mind'' live from a rooftop on Broadway. ''We didn't win, but business went crazy,'' said Mr. Azenberg, one of the show's producers.
 There have been tabloid reports that Hugh Jackman, in his second year as host of the broadcast, will open by performing a song from ''The Boy From Oz,'' in which he stars. This caused some grumbling around Broadway, because ''Oz'' would then have two songs on the show. Keith Sherman, a spokesman for the Tony Awards, said Tuesday that no decision had been made about the opening number.
 For plays, which campaign much less than musicals, the potential impact can depend on when in a drama's life cycle the award is won. ''The earlier a play opens'' in the season, ''the less chance it has to improve because people have already made up their mind if they want to see it or not,'' said Jeffrey Richards, who produced ''Enchanted April'' last season.
 For ''Frozen,'' which recently transferred to Broadway from Off Broadway, a Tony victory could mean a healthy boost in sales. ''I Am My Own Wife'' may have less to gain because, before opening on Broadway in December, it had a run Off Broadway that began last summer. ''I Am My Own Wife,'' of course, has already won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, which pumped up its sales around $50,000 the following week but had no lasting effect on the box office.
 At least Tonys for plays and musicals show some results. The second-tier awards, including those for best actor and actress in a play or a musical, usually mean little in relation to ticket sales. ''They don't affect the show one way or the other,'' said Adrian Bryan-Brown, a veteran press agent. ''Did it matter that Nathan Lane won best actor'' for ''The Producers''? ''Probably not.'' The acting Tonys matter even less to a struggling show. ''Sweet Smell of Success,'' which received scathing reviews, closed two weeks after John Lithgow, its star, won the 2002 award for best actor in a musical.
 So why are producers so obsessed with the Tonys? For most, the allure of the box-office boost is secondary to that of the prestige.
 ''The impact of the Tony is really more about ego than economics,'' said Roger Berlind, a producer of ''Anna in the Tropics'' and many other shows.
 Also, to be blunt, producers are often desperate. It's not easy to make money on Broadway, and the Tony Awards are often something of a last resort. Mark Medoff's play ''Prymate'' was hurried into town so it could open on the day of the Tony eligibility deadline, even though it had about as much commercial potential as a high school spelling bee. Word quickly spread concerning the play's bizarre plot about an AIDS-infected ape, played by Andre De Shields, who masturbates onstage with the help of a female character. Ticket sales were anemic, filling 15 percent of the house in the play's best week. The dreadful reviews didn't help. But what ultimately killed the production were the Tony nominations, announced on May 10. ''Prymate'' did not receive a single one, and the producers closed it a few hours later.
 It was an all-too-typical instance of producers futilely holding out hope that a Tony award would save a show. ''We think if we only win the Tony, then all our troubles will be over,'' Mr. Gersten said. ''We'll sell out, make a profit and run forever. That's the Tony dream.''

HEADLINE: The Vet Wars 

BYLINE: By Jason Zengerle. 
Jason Zengerle is an associate editor at The New Republic.

 BODY:
Two months ago, on the eve of the Georgia presidential primary, John Hurley was crisscrossing the state in a Ford Econoline van, looking for votes -- and for veterans. Hurley, a silver-haired 61-year-old Boston lawyer, is the veterans' coordinator for John Kerry's presidential campaign and like the candidate is a Vietnam vet. Together with five other veterans of that war -- including Max Cleland, the triple amputee and former Georgia senator, and two men who served on a Swift boat that Kerry commanded on the Mekong Delta 35 years ago -- Hurley formed what he called a Veterans Brigade for Kerry, which traveled to nine Georgia cities in four days. Along the way, at small rallies in restaurants and union halls, the brigade championed Kerry as a military hero and a steadfast leader. ''John Kerry saved our lives in Vietnam, and we saved his life,'' Del Sandusky, one of Kerry's former crewmates, told a crowd of about 20 people outside Macon's City Hall on a Sunday afternoon. ''We have a special bond, and we call ourselves the Band of Brothers.'' 
 Veterans emerged as something of a political force at the beginning of the year, in Iowa, when Kerry was down in the polls and looking like an afterthought in the presidential race. As Hurley, Cleland, Sandusky and other veterans trooped through Iowa's snows to visit American Legion halls and to work phone banks, they breathed new life into the campaign. Soon Kerry was surging in the polls. Two days before the caucuses, a former Special Forces officer named Jim Rassmann showed up at a rally in Des Moines to embrace Kerry, who in 1969 saved Rassmann's life in Vietnam, and the stage was set for Kerry's victory in Iowa. A week later, when Kerry won the New Hampshire primary, he dedicated his victory in large part ''to the veterans who marched with us.'' Now, in March, Hurley and a few other vets were barnstorming across Georgia, one of the 10 Super Tuesday states, trying to put the finishing touches on Kerry's remarkable comeback.
 On the final day of the Georgia tour, as the brigade traveled to Augusta for a rally at a union hall, Hurley received a call on his cellphone with bad news from the advance man: only 13 veterans had shown up for the event. He placed an urgent phone call back to the campaign's state headquarters. ''We need to get some more veterans,'' he said. By the time the brigade rolled into Augusta, the campaign had managed to round up about a dozen more vets.
 After the rally in Augusta, Hurley and the freshly augmented group of 25 or so veterans piled onto a bus for the two-and-a-half-hour drive to Atlanta for another rally, where Kerry himself would be present. Hurley passed out index cards on which he asked each veteran to write his name, his branch of service, the era in which he served and the medals he had earned. I took the opportunity to ask some of the vets why they were supporting Kerry. Most said it was because of Kerry's positions on veterans' issues like pensions and disability benefits, but several veterans confessed that they weren't actually Kerry supporters. Randy Potter, who served in the first gulf war, said he was on the bus because one of his friends had called him that afternoon to ask if he wanted to go to Atlanta to see Kerry speak and, if he did, to bring along his desert-camouflage hat. ''I didn't have any plans for tonight other than watching 'Antiques Roadshow,''' Potter told me, ''so I said sure.''
 When the veterans arrived at the downtown concert hall where the rally was being held, they were taken backstage. Just before the candidate arrived, the rally's two masters of ceremonies introduced the veterans as a sort of opening act to hype the crowd. ''On Friday,'' one M.C. said, Senator Max Cleland, Kerry's crewmates ''and other American heroes began a journey across Georgia reaching out to other veterans about John Kerry.'' The other M.C. continued: ''They have just arrived here tonight after logging 1,114 miles on the Band of Brothers tour of Georgia. Here they are, led by Senator Max Cleland. Let's welcome the John Kerry Veterans Brigade!'' 
 Martial music blared over the P.A. system, and Hurley pushed Cleland, in his wheelchair, onto the stage. Parading behind them, wearing their camouflage hats and fatigues, were the two dozen veterans from Augusta who, of course, had joined the Band of Brothers tour just a few hours and 150 miles earlier. Some of them looked a bit startled to be facing more than 1,000 people, but as an announcer listed their medals and the music swelled, Potter and the other veterans got caught up in the excitement, pumping their fists and saluting the crowd, which had risen to its feet and was yelling Kerry's name.
 After the rally, I found Potter in the parking lot. What had he thought of the event? ''He's got my vote,'' Potter said, flashing a thumbs up before he disappeared onto the bus for the ride back to Augusta.
Presidential candidates who served in the military have been making political capital out of their wartime experiences since at least 1868, when campaign rallies for Ulysses S. Grant featured speeches and marches by his fellow Union Army veterans. But John Kerry has gone further in this vein than perhaps any presidential candidate in American history, and the prominence of vets in his campaign has become one of its most recognizable tropes. For Kerry, his experience in Vietnam is a political talisman, a ready answer to any and all criticisms leveled against him. Attack him as a wealthy patrician, and he will respond that unlike many of his economic class, he volunteered to go to Vietnam; deride him as aloof, and he will trot out his former crewmates, who offer glowing testimonials about his human touch; paint him as a weak liberal, and he -- or his campaign -- will remind you of his Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Indeed, in a presidential contest being waged while the nation is at war, Kerry likes to point out that he is the only candidate in the race who has the experience of physically leading men into battle.
 To Kerry's detractors, though, his Vietnam experience -- specifically his postwar activism as spokesman for Vietnam Veterans Against the War (V.V.A.W.) -- is as much a political vulnerability as an advantage, and the Bush campaign and its allies have repeatedly tried to make an issue of it in this election. ''I remember watching Senator Kerry, back when he was against the war . . . and I was very troubled by the kind of allegations that he hurled against his fellow veterans, saying that they were guilty of all kinds of atrocities,'' Karen Hughes, one of Bush's closest aides, recently said on CNN.
 In the battle over the question of Kerry's wartime legacy, the answers that carry the most weight, both sides seem to acknowledge, are those that come from the nation's 26 million military veterans. Earlier this month, a newly formed group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth held a news conference in Washington to condemn Kerry's antiwar statements and, even more provocatively, to question whether his three combat wounds were worthy of Purple Hearts. The Kerry campaign immediately responded that Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, despite its grass-roots appearance, was ''the ugly face of the Bush attack machine.'' 
 It's true that the group's founder is John O'Neill, a former Swift boat commander who three decades ago was drafted by the Nixon administration to debate Kerry about the war, and it is also true that its publicist is Merrie Spaeth, who worked in the Reagan White House, has ties to Bush and has contributed to the Bush campaign. At the same time, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth consists of about 200 members, many of whom have no connections to the upper echelons of the G.O.P., like a Vietnam vet named Richard O'Mara, who traveled across the country to Washington on his own dime to attend the group's news conference after finding out about it on a veteran-related listserv. 
 I met O'Mara in March at his home near Monterey, Calif. He is stout and barrel-chested, with a gray beard and a quick laugh, and when I visited him we sat and talked in his living room, where he had a fire going in the fireplace and a scented candle burning on the coffee table. I'd come over to watch archival footage of John Kerry's 1971 testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which C-Span was broadcasting that evening. We turned on the TV and saw Kerry, the V.V.A.W. leader, then 27, pose his famous question: ''How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?'' It wasn't long before O'Mara had put down his tea and was gesturing at the giant image of a shaggy-haired Kerry on the screen.
 ''Lies!'' he practically shouted when Kerry recited a list of atrocities he said American soldiers had confessed to committing in Vietnam. ''Those are lies what he said!'' As Kerry's decades-old testimony was replayed over the next hour, O'Mara grew only angrier. ''Lies, lies, lies,'' he muttered. When Kerry's testimony ended, the C-Span anchor invited viewers to call three 800 numbers -- one for Democrats, one for Republicans and one for veterans. O'Mara grabbed the phone and repeatedly punched in the number for veterans, but he couldn't get through. 
 O'Mara isn't the only veteran who is angry about the Kerry campaign. Kerry's antiwar activism may have jump-started his political career -- it was only a few weeks after his Senate testimony that Morley Safer asked him on ''60 Minutes,'' ''Do you want to be president?'' -- but it also made Kerry a target for some of the many Vietnam vets who were hurt by the chilly reception they received when they came home from the war. Another Vietnam veteran opposing Kerry is a former Green Beret named Ted Sampley, who was a leading P.O.W.-M.I.A. advocate in the 80's and 90's and was furious with Kerry when a Senate committee headed by Kerry concluded that there were probably no living P.O.W.'s or M.I.A.'s in Vietnam. Sampley now runs a Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry Web site that accuses Kerry of a litany of sins that go well beyond his antiwar activities, from the debatable to the ludicrous -- from claims that Kerry engineered an early transfer out of Vietnam by putting in for three Purple Hearts he didn't deserve to charges that he committed war crimes. As soon as Sampley put up the Web site in late January, those charges spread like wildfire on veteran listservs and other veteran-related Web sites.
 O'Mara, when we first met, wanted to talk about Kerry's three Purple Hearts, which, per Navy policy, allowed Kerry to cut short his Swift boat tour by eight months. He led me into a small study, where perched on an antique wood table he keeps a plastic model of a Swift boat. Like Kerry, O'Mara served on a Swift boat in Vietnam, so he knows better than most the dangers Kerry faced. (The admiral in charge of the Swift boats once calculated that ''Swifties,'' as the sailors on these boats were called, had a 75 percent chance of being killed or wounded.) But O'Mara wasn't inclined to give Kerry any credit. ''He was only on the boat for four months,'' he said. Using the model as a visual aid, he explained how he believed the wound to Kerry's arm, which earned him his first Purple Heart, came from brass casings discharged from the boat's two 50-caliber machine guns. ''That was a very common thing on the boats,'' he said. ''Brass burns were just part of the norm.'' He theorized that the second Purple Heart -- which Kerry received for a wound to his leg -- resulted from Kerry's banging his thigh on a door. And the third Purple Heart? ''That's anybody's guess,'' he said. (Even after Kerry, a month later, released military and medical records showing that his wounds were more severe than brass burns or a bruised leg, O'Mara refused to relent. ''I'm convinced his first Purple Heart came from a self-inflicted wound,'' he said.) 
 When I first asked O'Mara why he was so opposed to Kerry, he told me that it was because of how Kerry had made him and other veterans feel after the war. ''There were a number of years where I didn't tell many people I was a Vietnam veteran,'' he said. ''I was worried they'd think I was a monster.'' O'Mara doesn't have those fears anymore. His pickup truck is decorated with Vietnam veteran bumper stickers, and he carries in his wallet a shrunk-down copy of his DD-214 form, the standard military discharge document, just in case anyone ever challenges him on his status.
 Later, when I asked O'Mara if he thought being a Vietnam veteran still carried a stigma, he conceded that it didn't. Indeed, it was an identity he wore with pride. But the more he talked about Kerry, the more it became clear that he viewed Kerry as a threat to that identity. If Kerry becomes the first Vietnam veteran elected to the White House, he said, Kerry will come to symbolize all Vietnam veterans. ''I didn't come back from Vietnam and join the antiwar movement,'' O'Mara told me. ''I didn't come back and denounce my country in the harshest terms.'' It went without saying, but then O'Mara said it anyway: ''I don't think Kerry is a typical Vietnam vet.''
 After the news conference for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, O'Mara told me that it was only the beginning of his activism: he planned to go back to Washington later this month for an anti-Kerry veterans' rally at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. ''This is one of the most important things I've ever been involved in,'' he said.
The anti-Kerry movement among veterans is a relatively recent development, but mobilizing vet support for Kerry dates back to 1984 and his first Senate campaign. That year, Kerry's opponent in the Democratic primary was James M. Shannon, a congressman from the working-class city of Lawrence, Mass. It was a hard-fought primary, and things got particularly nasty at a debate late in the campaign when Shannon, who did not serve in Vietnam, criticized Kerry for fighting in a war he didn't believe in. In their final debate, Kerry demanded that Shannon apologize for the remark. Shannon refused, telling Kerry, ''That dog won't hunt.'' 
 Thus were born the Doghunters, a group of about a dozen Vietnam veterans, including John Hurley, who rallied to Kerry's side. Hurley first met Kerry in 1970, after both men had returned from Vietnam and Hurley was attending Boston College Law School; the two veterans bonded and became friends. By helping to create the Doghunters, Hurley made himself an indispensable part of the Kerry political machine. ''We were enraged that Shannon thought that going to Vietnam was optional,'' Hurley recalled recently, ''as if all those guys who had their names on the Wall had a choice.'' The Doghunters stalked Shannon across the state and disrupted his events. When Kerry narrowly beat Shannon, many on Kerry's staff credited the Doghunters. 
 Hurley and the Doghunters were fixtures in Kerry's Senate campaigns. In 1990, after Kerry's Republican opponent, Jim Rappaport, criticized the senator for an insufficiently hawkish response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Doghunters heckled Rappaport at news conferences. During the 1996 campaign, The Boston Globe ran a column questioning Kerry's actions in the battle for which he won a Silver Star. Hurley was part of an effort, involving thousands of phone calls, to track down some of Kerry's crewmates, most of whom Kerry hadn't spoken to since 1969, and invite them to Boston for a reunion -- and a news conference to offer their eyewitness accounts of Kerry's valor in the battle in question.
 It was only natural, then, that in late 2002 Kerry asked Hurley to head up a Veterans for Kerry effort in the presidential campaign. The idea of a Democratic presidential candidate reaching out to veterans in this day and age was unorthodox: Bill Clinton, who dodged the draft, did not actively court veterans in either of his campaigns; even Al Gore, who did serve in Vietnam, didn't have a veterans' desk on his campaign until a few months before the November election, and then it consisted of just one paid staff member, a Vietnam veteran named Tom Keefe, who claims that he was mostly ignored. But Hurley was undaunted by this recent history. ''There's a sense that the veterans' community is so big that it's unorganizable,'' he says. ''But no one's ever tried on this scale before.'' His efforts to date have paid off: nearly 17,000 veterans have signed up as potential volunteers on a special Kerry Web site for vets, and the campaign plans to have Veterans for Kerry operations in all 50 states.
One of the most ardent veterans for Kerry is Bobby Hanafin, whom I visited not long ago at his home in the shadow of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. A military man through and through, Hanafin enlisted in the Army when he was just 17 and later spent 17 years as a military intelligence officer in the Air Force, finishing his career with a stint in the Pentagon. 
 Since 1980, Hanafin had been voting for Republican presidential candidates, but a few days before the Iowa caucuses he traveled to that state to man phone banks the Kerry campaign had set up for its war veteran supporters to call Iowa vets. (''A supporter calling a supporter is like a telemarketing call, but a vet calling a vet is like a friend-to-friend call,'' Hurley says.) It was only a six-hour drive from Dayton to Davenport, where the campaign had arranged for Hanafin to stay with a college professor, but for Hanafin the journey was epic. He suffers from a disability -- ''I'd rather not go into the details,'' he said, ''but suffice it to say it's service-related'' -- that requires him to take 10 medications a day, some of which prevent him from driving. To get to Iowa, he had to have his wife accompany him -- and even then it was a struggle. But for Hanafin, Kerry's surprise victory made the trip well worth the effort. ''When we pulled out of the driveway to go to Iowa, I had a premonition that a miracle was going to happen,'' Hanafin said. ''And I saw one.'' 
 After Iowa, Hanafin decided that he didn't have it in him to make many more campaign trips, so these days he volunteers for Kerry from the comfort of his home. There, using a D.S.L. line the campaign pays for, he moderates the veterans' section of Kerry's Internet forum and ''infiltrates'' other veterans' sites to post pro-Kerry messages. ''You could say I'm John Kerry's secret weapon,'' Hanafin said. 
 A large man with a jowly face and an eager demeanor, Hanafin proudly showed me his copy of Douglas Brinkley's book about Kerry's Vietnam experience, ''Tour of Duty,'' which Brinkley, Kerry and one of Kerry's crewmates had signed for him in Iowa. But as Hanafin explained his passion for Kerry, he didn't dwell on Vietnam or Kerry's service there. Instead, he talked mostly about Kerry's positions on veterans' issues and how he believed the Massachusetts senator would treat vets better than the Bush administration has. Most important to Hanafin was the issue of concurrent receipt, or what he called the ''disabled-veterans tax'' -- a provision that prohibits disabled vets like Hanafin from collecting a full military pension on top of their V.A. disability benefits. Kerry has pledged to grant disabled veterans ''full concurrent receipt'' -- in other words, he would allow them to collect full disability and full retirement -- which for Hanafin would mean an additional $1,500 a month. ''Veterans just want the things the government promised them when they went into the military,'' he said.
 Indeed, in its efforts to court veterans, the Kerry campaign is offering them things much more tangible than the candidate's biography. In the past three years, many veterans have grown increasingly frustrated with the Bush administration's approach to veterans' issues; in February, Edward S. Banas Sr., the commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, went so far as to label Bush's proposed V.A. budget for 2005 a ''disgrace and a sham.'' The Kerry campaign has sought to capitalize on this discontent. Kerry has denounced the Bush administration's attempts to rein in spending by increasing user fees and prescription-drug co-payments for some veterans in the V.A. health care system. Kerry has also pledged to remove veterans' health care from the discretionary budget process entirely and turn it into a mandatory federal entitlement like Social Security and Medicare -- a move that the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cost $211 billion over a nine-year period. ''As much as the vet-to-vet, you-served-I-served kind of thing is important,'' one Kerry aide says, ''the thing that matters most to veterans is Kerry's track record and his position on veterans' issues.''
 I saw this firsthand at a veterans' town hall meeting in Columbia, S.C., just before that state's primary, where I watched the assembled veterans politely applaud when Kerry spoke about the bonds he forged with his crewmates in Vietnam. But when Kerry attacked President Bush for the ''41,000 veterans waiting some several months to see a doctor for the first time to get their prescription drugs signed off on'' and the ''90,000 veterans waiting to get into the V.A.'' and the ''400,000 veterans'' who ''have been denied access to the V.A.,'' the veterans let out raucous cheers.
Will Kerry's support from veterans be significant enough to matter in November? In terms of pure numbers, probably not. Although the nation's 26.4 million veterans do constitute a sizable voting bloc -- making up about 12 percent of the adult population and accounting for an even greater share of the electorate in crucial states like New Hampshire and Washington -- most of that voting bloc is likely to belong to President Bush. ''Veterans tend to be conservative, they tend to be Republicans,'' says Peter Feaver, a professor at Duke University who studies the political culture of the military. ''Kerry will probably be able to make some inroads because of his own service and because of the anger some veterans have at the Bush administration. I expect that he will do better among veterans than Gore-Lieberman or Clinton-Gore. But I still don't think he will get more veteran votes than Bush.'' Indeed, in a national survey that Feaver and his colleague Christopher Gelpi conducted in April, veterans favored Bush over Kerry 57 to 36 percent. (In the same poll, Kerry and Bush were tied among nonveterans, with 46 percent each.)
 But Kerry doesn't necessarily have to win a majority of the veterans' vote for veterans to help him in November. That's because the veterans who do support Kerry offer more than just their votes; they offer Kerry their symbolic power. Just as the Bush campaign often surrounds the president with blacks and Hispanics -- not because it thinks this will get Bush many black or Hispanic votes but because it hopes that this inclusive gesture will make the president more appealing to moderate whites -- the Kerry campaign recognizes that the veterans who visibly and vocally support Kerry, even those who do so for the most prosaic reasons, send a powerful message to nonveterans about Kerry's military experience. Which is why the campaign goes to great lengths to surround Kerry with his veteran supporters at every opportunity, having groups of them greet the candidate on the tarmac when his plane touches down for a campaign stop and inviting them onstage at rallies and speeches. ''Veterans are not only voters, they're centers of influence,'' says Rick O'Dell, a Vietnam veteran and Democratic activist who is organizing veterans for the Kerry campaign. ''When you get veterans on the side of a candidate, they're going to influence a lot of other voters.''
 And yet in a presidential campaign that has made a fetish out of veterans, some vets feel they are being overlooked. The pro-Kerry hagiographers and the anti-Kerry demonizers have left little room for those Vietnam veterans who, like Kerry, protested the war with radical words and actions but who, unlike Kerry, never returned from the ideological extreme to which the war had driven them. Affected by their military experiences in ways that don't just influence but in fact dominate their lives today, these veterans, in the context of this presidential campaign, are simply too small in number to be courted for their votes and too radical in their views to be courted for their symbolism. 
 One weekend not long ago, I went to see a Vietnam vet named Brian Willson in Humboldt County, Calif. It was a warm Saturday afternoon, and Willson, who is an active member of the local chapter of Veterans for Peace, was leading a march to protest the war in Iraq. Willson has long, white hair and pale, waxy skin, and though with two prosthetic legs he is fully ambulatory, he prefers to travel on his three-wheeled, hand-powered bike. As he slowly rode through the streets of downtown Eureka, the county seat, more than 3,000 protesters, including about two dozen of his fellow veterans, marched behind him. 
 Willson first encountered Kerry in 1971 at a V.V.A.W. protest in Washington. When Kerry gave his testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Willson watched from the hearing-room doorway and wept. ''My whole experience as a Vietnam veteran was validated in that speech,'' he told me. Years later, when Willson was living in Massachusetts and Kerry ran for the Senate, Willson became a Doghunter. 
 But as Kerry moved away from his antiwar radicalism, Willson did not. Indeed, Willson's disability was caused not by a wound suffered in Vietnam but by an incident in 1987, when, protesting American policy in Nicaragua, he tried to stop a train at a naval weapons station in California. The train ran him over, mangling both of his legs below the knee. Kerry, by contrast, voted to authorize humanitarian aid to the contras. 
 After Kerry voted to grant President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq in October 2002, Willson wrote him an open letter in which he stated that ''veterans have reorganized throughout the nation'' as part of a re-energized peace movement and warned, ''Know that we shall work hard for your defeat.''
 When the march arrived at the town square in Eureka, Willson addressed the crowd. ''The power of the people is the antidote to the power elite,'' he said. ''But we have to recognize that we have the power and exercise it every day, every day, every day from now on!'' 
 Earlier, Willson told me that his marginal role in this election ''was kind of depressing to me,'' but after his speech he was fired up. As we were driving back from the march in his electric-powered pickup truck, Willson delivered another peroration, only this one was not his own. Speaking from memory, he recited the last lines of Kerry's Senate testimony from 1971: ''So, when 30 years from now our brothers go down the street without a leg, without an arm, or a face, and small boys ask why, we will be able to say 'Vietnam' and not mean a desert, not a filthy obscene memory, but mean instead the place where America finally turned and where soldiers like us helped it in the turning.'' Willson paused and looked out the window. ''I'm still working for the turning of America,'' he said. ''I'm still living by John Kerry's words.''

HEADLINE: Talking Deficits

 BODY:
A few weeks before the fall election, President Bush is likely to claim a victory, of sorts, over the budget deficit. The good news will be based on October data from the Office of Management and Budget in the executive branch, which, according to widespread estimates, will show red ink of $420 billion to $450 billion at the end of the 2004 fiscal year. When the year started, the budget office had conveniently projected a deficit of $521 billion. Hence, a bookkeeping triumph. 
 The administration would like to turn the budget deficit into a nonissue in the presidential campaign. But it deserves to be one of the central talking points, even more than it was in 1992, when Ross Perot rightly convinced the nation that deficits were threatening American prosperity. 
 The Bush deficit is worse than the administration says. And it appears that coming deficits will be worse than previous ones in terms of the impact on Americans' financial security and on national security, for these reasons:
 * Size. Though the Bush deficit of 2003 was already a record in pure numbers, the administration's defenders often point out that it amounted to only 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. That doesn't sound too bad compared with the modern record of 6 percent set by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. But the size of the deficit now is masked by the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. If you believe that the Social Security surplus would be put to better use by being preserved for future retirees, the Bush deficit should really amount to 5 percent of G.D.P.
 And it shows no signs of abating. It took 15 years of hard work and good luck before the Reagan deficits were vanquished. Even Mr. Reagan himself, after initially cutting taxes, raised them repeatedly. Mr. Bush shows no such intention, and that is the reason the current red ink he has unleashed will not stop flowing.
 According to former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Vice President Dick Cheney swatted back questions about the tax cuts by saying, ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter.'' Mr. Reagan's own actions, and the political careers of many politicians since then, prove otherwise. 
 * Cause. The current deficits are unique in the degree to which they appear to be driven by tax cuts. That is terribly important because it shows that they are in large part a result of deliberate policy decisions, not unforeseen events. Last year, after two rounds of Bush tax cuts, taxes fell to a percentage of the economy not seen, even in the deepest recessions, since 1955. In 2004, they are estimated to come in at just over 16 percent of G.D.P., a level last seen in 1951. Even if the economy recovers fully, the country would have to revert to a 1957-era government to break even. In 1957, the Interstate System was just getting under way, and Medicare did not exist, much less a war on terrorism.
 * Timing. President Reagan's deficit binge occurred decades before the baby boomers' retirement. This one is taking place on the eve. To use an analogy, President Bush's deficits are putting the nation in the position of a couple who take out a long-term mortgage just before retirement. 
 That's a travesty, because reducing the buildup of government debt is the key to strengthening Social Security. Social Security payments currently soak up about 4 percent of G.D.P. They are projected to rise to a bit more than 6 percent by the mid-2030's. Long before that, however, the Bush tax cuts will crimp incoming revenues by over 2 percent of G.D.P. 
 In other words, if the tax cuts are not made permanent, as Mr. Bush intends, the revenue from those taxes would cover the increased cost of Social Security, without reducing benefits. (Even in fantasy, no one has yet come up with a way to pay for Medicare.) Clearly, we could not have picked a worse demographic moment to be borrowing money on the next generation's credit. 
 * Foreign Dependence. Over the last few years, an unprecedented 80 percent of the deficit has been financed by foreign governments, institutions and individuals, mainly in the Far East. Over all, 37 percent of United States public debt is in foreign hands, up from 14 percent at the peak of the Reagan deficits in 1983.
 A greater reliance on foreign creditors creates further economic instability, as nations like Argentina have found out the hard way. Debt is debt, to be sure, leading ultimately to a smaller economy than would otherwise be the case.
 But debt owed to foreigners is more likely to affect the value of the dollar, and foreign capital is more nomadic, leaving the United States vulnerable to the whims of central bankers in Beijing and Tokyo. 
 But even if a sudden catastrophe never materializes, a slower one is already in the making. It is important that voters talk seriously about deficits in this political season.

SECTION: Section 3; Column 1; SundayBusiness; SUNDAY INTERVIEW -- WITH DAVID J. LESAR; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 901 words

HEADLINE: On the Job in Iraq, And in the Glare

BYLINE: By LAURA RICH

 BODY:
DAVID J. LESAR was promoted to chief executive of Halliburton from chief operating officer after Dick Cheney, chosen as George W. Bush's running mate, left in 2000. Since then, Halliburton has come under intense scrutiny because of more than $250 million in disputed bills for its work in Iraq, where it is helping to rebuild Iraq's oil business and where its construction arm, Kellogg Brown & Root, provides services for the military. Mr. Lesar, 50, did not discuss the disputed charges in detail, but he recently spoke about Iraq, global oil reserves, his predecessor and all the attention on his company. Following are excerpts from the conversations:

Q. What are the biggest challenges to doing business in Iraq?
 Dealing in that environment is really staying up with the challenges the military and the C.P.A. [Coalition Provisional Authority] people have and executing their business on a day-to-day basis.

Q. But this is something that you anticipate at any time -- you provide these services all the time, right?

A. It is, but, typically, after a period of time, things return a little bit more to a normal routine. In this case, because of the size of the endeavor, there has been a surge in activity that has certainly been atypical of other missions we've had in this particular area. That has added a dimension to it that is unique to this particular activity for us.

Q. Did K.B.R. overcharge the Army Corps of Engineers or the C.P.A. in any situation?

A. No. We work hard to deliver services at the best prices, value and terms.

Q. Have you been to Iraq in the last year?

A. I was there in the fall.

Q. Where did you go? Did you go to Baghdad?

A. I went to Baghdad; I went to Basra; I went to a number of places.

Q. What was your impression?

A. You come away with a sadness to see how rundown the country is, except for Saddam's palaces and the places that the people in power lived.
 From a personal standpoint -- for a C.E.O. of a company that's heavily involved in it -- I came away with a very great sense of pride in the job that the K.B.R. folks are doing there in very harsh and dangerous conditions there, but with a very real focus on serving their customer there.

Q. Is there any point at which it becomes too dangerous, where you're actually losing too many employees?

A. We're committed to staying the course and serving the military. We are upfront with our employees when we send them there, about the living conditions and the dangers they're going to face. It's our job to provide them with the security that's necessary in that place. But it's a war zone and people do get hurt. We've had a number of people killed and a number of people injured, and that's an unfortunate aspect of just where the situation is there, but that's part of what we agreed when we signed on.

Q. How does OPEC's cutting of oil production affect your business and how you expect the oil business to evolve in the next 5 to 10 years?

A. In the next 5 to 10 years, I don't see anything on the horizon that would replace hydrocarbons, either oil or gas, as the main generator of energy to drive the worldwide economy. I mean, eventually, of course, the world will run out of oil. But that is certainly not a 5- to 10-year look. That's a hundred-years-out view of things.
 OPEC cutting output is something that, in the short run, may impact the demand for our services. We are in the oil services business, so the more oil that's being produced and the more oil that's being explored for, the better our business is and the better our business opportunities.

Q. What was Dick Cheney's biggest contribution or lasting legacy at Halliburton?

A. Dick brought a lot -- the vice president brought a lot to the organization. The most lasting legacy or biggest contribution was his focus on moving us from a traditional oil services company and getting us more focused on the higher-technology end of the business. We made a number of strategic acquisitions, like Landmark Graphics, like Numar, like Sperry-Sun Drilling. In the long run, that has much better positioned us to thrive in this industry.

Q. How much of your stock price is tied to the actions of the White House and Dick Cheney, and how much do you think it affects Halliburton to have one of its former executives in the White House?

A. In terms of its impact on our stock price, I think it's none. But the primary reason for a lot of the gratuitous attacks on the company is the fact that the vice president used to sit at my desk. I mean, this is certainly uncharted territory as far as a U.S. company goes. But our shareholders and our potential investors and our customers look past the criticism because they believe that it is politically motivated and it's coming at a time of very intense partisan politics in the U.S.

Q. Are you in touch with the vice president?

A. No.

A longer version of the Sunday Interview is at nytimes.com/yourmoney.


A. The challenge is doing business in that environment that, especially right now, is under serious stress, with the effect of the attacks that are going on. It is also the constantly changing form of the mission. I think it's important that people remember that our people are not in the rear echelon. They are living with the troops, every day doing the support services for them. So as the troops move around, or the troops come under fire, then the Halliburton and K.B.R. people have to move around and also come under fire.

PAUL VOLCKER
The Making of a Financial Legend.
By Joseph B. Treaster.
Wiley, $27.95.
 It may be hard to remember that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board can be reviled as well as revered. But witness the tenure of Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan's predecessor, whose tough economic policies halted the runaway inflation that staggered the American economy in the late 1970's and early 80's. Even so, Volcker's engineering of ever higher interest rates cost millions of Americans their jobs. (Embittered Democrats would include President Jimmy Carter among the victims.) In ''Paul Volcker: The Making of a Financial Legend,'' Joseph B. Treaster, a financial reporter for The New York Times, has written something of a mash note to the retired Fed chairman, a slim biography that lauds Volcker's steadfastness in applying the economic shock therapy that laid the groundwork for the boom years in the 1990's. Treaster offers little in the way of new policy history; William Greider's ''Secrets of the Temple'' (1988) provides a much more comprehensive and skeptical account of Volcker's tenure at the Fed. Where Treaster does break ground is in his personal portrait. Volcker could appear insensitive in public, but Treaster enters into his family life as well; particularly touching is Volcker's relationship with his son, who has cerebral palsy.Treaster's depiction of Volcker's honesty and resilience highlights some attributes that American policy makers should keep in mind as the Greenspan era draws to a close.

HEADLINE: Yes, Democrats Can Win (Some) White Male Voters

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

 BODY:
POOR John Kerry. Despite President Bush's dip in popularity, Mr. Kerry hasn't made any real headway, according to the polls.
 Part of the problem is his lack of support among white men. Mr. Kerry has the support of only 36 percent of white male voters, compared with 55 for the president, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken last month. 
 To win the presidency, Mr. Kerry won't need a majority of white male votes. No Democratic presidential candidate has managed to do that since Jimmy Carter in 1976, because of the party's perceived weak-kneed stance on military matters. But Mr. Kerry will almost certainly need to do better among white men than Al Gore did in 2000, when 36 percent voted for the Democratic nominee compared with 60 percent for Mr. Bush. 
 Yet if Mr. Kerry tries to woo the testosterone crowd, he risks losing support from the party's base, including women and minorities, said John B. Judis, co-author of ''The Emerging Democratic Majority'' and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
 Dick Morris, the political strategist who advised President Bill Clinton and now works for Republicans, said if Mr. Kerry makes a serious play for this white male demographic, he could push his party's more liberal base into Ralph Nader's arms.
 ''This is like a first baseman who fields a throw from the third baseman, but in the course is pulled off the bag,'' Mr. Morris said.
 So what's a candidate to do? 
 Up to now, Mr. Kerry has relied on cosmetic changes. When Republicans accused him of being aloof, liberal and, worst of all, looking French, he conspicuously peppered his speeches with terms like ''fight'' and ''strength'' and, of course, ''bring it on.'' 
 Almost all of his television ads have emphasized his Vietnam War record. Veterans greet him at every campaign stop. He rode a motorcycle onto ''The Tonight Show,'' and made sure to be photographed hunting.
 ''The only thing he hasn't done is sit down with a six-pack and chew tobacco with them,'' said Donna Brazile, a veteran Democratic strategist and Mr. Gore's campaign manager in 2000.
 Still, campaign strategists from both parties agreed that there are other, better ways of appealing to white men, without turning off everyone else. And they offered plenty of advice -- some serious, some not -- on what he could do to rev up those white male votes.
 Be very, very careful about Iraq. 
 Recent poll numbers show that Americans -- including white men -- are losing faith in the president's handling of the conflict. But white men, more than other demographic groups, tend to rally around a sitting president at a time of war, said Jeffrey Bell, a longtime Republican strategist.
 ''The indications are from history that when Americans are in the middle of a war, domestic considerations don't play that much of a role in elections,'' Mr. Bell said.
 Recently, Mr. Kerry has played to his base. He has been more outspoken about the Iraq war, and he met last week with Ralph Nader. 
 Predictably, the Bush campaign has pounced, announcing that it will soon unveil television ads taking Mr. Kerry to task for ''politicizing'' the war by criticizing the president's handling of it.
 Divide and conquer. 
 Iraq may be issue No. 1, but white men are susceptible to a populist message. 
 ''White males, especially working class males, care about their jobs, and they care about things like health care,'' Ms. Brazile said. By stressing those issues, she said, Mr. Kerry might lure away those white male voters who feel badly treated by the Bush economic plan. 
 Take President Bush's tax cuts. ''Rescinding tax cuts for people making more than $200,000 is very popular in this white male demographic,'' said Ruy Teixeira, co-author of ''America's Forgotten Majority: Why the White Working Class Still Matters'' and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. 
 ''Health care costs are a huge issue for these people,'' he said. ''Kerry needs to emphasize toughness and talk about strengthening the military, but also stress these other, Democratic issues.''
 Don't miss ''SportsCenter.'' 
 It was no coincidence that the Bush campaign's first advertising blitz was on male-oriented television channels like ESPN, said Ms. Brazile. ''Republicans consider white males to be their stronghold, so they pay very close attention to this base,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''They fertilize it, they season it, they do everything they can to make sure their base doesn't move.''
 To be competitive, she said, the Kerry campaign must aggressively court this sports channel audience. ''I wouldn't say park your campaign bus at Nascar events,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''But don't drive past those events, either.''
 Don't overplay your war hero resume. 
 ''The war hero thing is always there, but if you keep talking about it people begin to get the idea that you don't have anything else to offer,'' said Lyn Nofziger, who was an aide to President Ronald Reagan.
 The best idea, he said, is to let the manly symbols speak for themselves. ''What he's really trying to do is what Naomi Wolf tried with Al Gore in 2000, convince us all that he's an alpha male,'' Mr. Nofziger said, speaking of the feminist writer who advised the candidate. ''It's better just to be yourself, otherwise you come across as a phony.''
 Stop flip-flopping.
 The Bush campaign slogan is ''Steady Leadership in Times of Change.'' And Republicans have seized every opportunity to portray Mr. Kerry as a typical, blow-with-the-wind politician, the stock gag for editorial cartoonists.
 Traditionally, this approach plays well, particularly, though not solely, with white men, Mr. Nofziger said. 
 ''I would advise Kerry to find a principle and stick to it,'' he said. ''Don't try to make everybody happy. He doesn't need everybody. He doesn't need all the white males. He just needs enough so he ends up with one more electoral vote than George Bush.''
 Take every opportunity to make President Bush seem less manly.
 If Republicans can make insinuations about Mr. Kerry's manliness, and go so far as to call him French, then turnabout is fair play, said Mark Katz, a humorist who served as a speechwriter for President Clinton. Remember, he said, when President Bush showed up with a bandage on his head after he collapsed while watching television and eating pretzels? 
 ''My proposal is that the Kerry campaign run a 30-second ad which is nothing but John Kerry sitting on a couch and eating pretzels without involving paramedics at all,'' Mr. Katz said. ''Guys can't help but be impressed by that, if he can get to the bottom of a bag of pretzels without someone having to call an ambulance.''

HEADLINE: The fall TV season's new offerings tend toward escapist brain candy. And some candy is not dandy.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE six big broadcast television networks will emulate Houdini for the 2004-5 prime-time season, promising viewers and advertisers plenty of escapist entertainment.
 It was fitting that the networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and WB -- chose to introduce their schedules last week in theatrical settings like Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden, agency executives say, because many programs, particularly among the 35 new fall series, tilt heavily toward brain candy. The fluffier fare ranges from unrealistic reality shows (''Wife Swap'') and animated sitcoms (''Father of the Pride'') to light dramas in idyllic settings like Hawaii (''Hawaii''), Las Vegas (''Dr. Vegas'') and a mountain resort (''The Mountain'').
 Even the titles require little heavy lifting. 
 ''Television has always been an escapist medium, but perhaps reflecting the complexity of our times, it's at a high,'' said John Rash, senior vice president and director for broadcast negotiations at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 The trend toward the TV equivalent of comfort food began in the 2002-3 season, after 9/11, and continues as Americans grapple with war, a sluggish economy and uncertainty before the presidential election.
 Whether the shows are ''tropical or sinful, in Hawaii or Las Vegas, it's risk management,'' said Karen McCallum, media supervisor at McKee Wallwork Henderson in Albuquerque, adding that ''the networks are under pressure'' as never before, especially from cable competitors, to deliver compelling programs.
 Escapism also dovetails with a fact of Madison Avenue life: Many advertisers prefer to buy commercial time in shows that accentuate the positive, to help put viewers in an upbeat, consuming mood.
 ''Viewership is taking off for fun, escapist programming like 'The Apprentice,''' said Kristi Argyilan, executive vice president and media director in Boston of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, also part of Interpublic. ''Everybody loves the opportunity to try to hide from it all for a while.'' 
 ''The Apprentice'' is returning for a second season at 9 p.m. Eastern time Thursday on NBC, which is owned by General Electric. It is being joined by two new reality series about zillionaires enriching regular folks: ''The Benefactor,'' at 8 p.m. Monday on ABC, a division of Walt Disney, with Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, and ''The Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best,'' at 8 p.m. Tuesday on Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, with Sir Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin corporate empire. 
 ''Nonscripted series occupy an annoyingly prominent place in the prime-time landscape,'' said Shari Ann Brill, vice president and director of programming at Carat USA in New York, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group, a self-described foe of reality series like ''The Simple Life'' on Fox -- ''or 'Simple Minds,' as I like to call it,'' Ms. Brill said.
 ''As in fashion, where they say brown is the new black,'' she added, ''on TV reality is the new comedy, intended or otherwise.'' Ms. Brill alluded to the paucity of sitcoms, once a prime-time staple; in the 2004-5 lineups, only 13 of the 35 new series are situation comedies.
 ''In 1997, NBC alone had 18 sitcoms,'' said Brad Adgate, senior vice president and research director at Horizon Media in New York. ''This year, NBC, CBS and ABC combined have 18.''
 By contrast, ''there's a reality show every night of the week,'' he said. ''Maybe that's because to younger viewers who grew up watching 'The Real World' on MTV, who have Webcams and camera phones, the idea of watching other people instead of sitcoms seems very appealing.''
 Another element of the trend toward escapism is the addition of series that younger and older viewers can watch together. ''It helps you get both ends of the 18-to-49-year-old spectrum,'' Ms. Brill said, referring to the age group advertisers most desire.
 The scripts of such series -- like ''Joan of Arcadia'' on CBS, part of Viacom; ''The O.C.'' on Fox; and ''Everwood'' and ''One Tree Hill'' on WB, owned by Time Warner and the Tribune Company -- interweave plot lines involving characters of different ages, typically children and their parents.
 ''Even though the average household has three TV sets, in an average minute of prime time, 80 percent of households have only one set on,'' said Steve Sternberg, executive vice president and director of audience analysis at Magna Global USA in New York, part of Interpublic. ''That means there's multigenerational viewing going on.''
 Among the newcomers to the genre are ''Clubhouse,'' at 9 p.m. Tuesday on CBS, about a batboy for a baseball team very much like the New York Yankees; ''Jack and Bobby,'' at 9 p.m. Sunday on WB, about a pair of brothers growing up with a strong-willed mother; and ''The Mountain,'' at 8 p.m. Thursday on WB, a ''Dynasty''-like nighttime soap opera set at a luxury ski resort.
 Asked to identify the potential hits and flops of the 2004-5 season, the agency executives offered a variety of choices. Their early assessments were based on excerpts shown last week at the presentations; the only full-length pilot episode they watched was ''Joey,'' the ''Friends'' spinoff at 8 p.m. Thursday on NBC.
 The one series the executives all agreed would be a hit is ''C.S.I.: New York,'' at 10 p.m. Wednesday on CBS, which will face off in a major showdown against the original ''Law & Order'' on NBC. A preview last Monday of ''C.S.I.: New York,'' the second spinoff of the successful ''C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation'' franchise, attracted 23.1 million viewers.
 ''That, we know is going to work,'' said Stacey Lynn Koerner, executive vice president and director of global research integration at Initiative in New York, a division of Interpublic.
 Mr. Rash of Campbell Mithun said the arrival of a third ''C.S.I.,'' along with a fourth ''Law & Order,'' due in January on NBC, underlined the strength of ''cop culture as pop culture,'' because those series offer a special form of escapism: ''control, a clean resolution in an untidy world, from crime to incarceration in 60 minutes.''
 Among other series the agency executives said they believed would do well are: ''American Dad,'' an animated sitcom from Seth MacFarlane, the creator of ''Family Guy,'' at 9:30 p.m. Sunday on Fox, beginning in January; ''Clubhouse''; ''Desperate Housewives,'' a ''Sex and the City''-style look at the lives of wives, at 9 p.m. Sunday on ABC; ''Dr. Vegas,'' with Rob Lowe as, well, a doctor in Las Vegas, at 10 p.m. Friday on CBS; ''Jack and Bobby''; ''Kevin Hill,'' a law drama with Taye Diggs, at 9 p.m. Wednesday on UPN, owned by Viacom; ''Life As We Know It,'' a coming-of-age tale about three teenage boys, at 9 p.m. Thursday on ABC; and ''Wife Swap,'' a humorous reality series at 10 p.m. Wednesday on ABC.
 The new series that turned up most often on both the hit and flop lists is ''Joey,'' which gives Matt LeBlanc of ''Friends'' his own sitcom.
 ''He is endearing and known, but the rest of the show needs to find a heart,'' Ms. Koerner of Initiative said. Mr. Sternberg said, ''It's certainly not going to be 'Friends,' but it could still work.'' Ms. Argyilan of Hill, Holliday, said that Joey represented ''the more stupid humor'' on ''Friends'' and that ''it will be interesting to see if people will hang on.'' Another question mark is ''Blue Collar TV,'' featuring the down-home comedian Jeff Foxworthy, at 9 p.m. Wednesday on WB. Some executives questioned its appeal to the younger, substantially female WB audience, but some said it might draw older, male viewers to the network.
 The one newcomer most likely to fail, according to the agency executives, is ''Father of the Pride,'' at 9 p.m. Tuesday on NBC, an animated sitcom about lions in the animal act of the Las Vegas performers Siegfried and Roy.
 ''It's a disappointment,'' Ms. Brill said. ''It just doesn't look good, and I so wanted it to.'' Ms. Argyilan said it ''didn't strike me as well written'' and the fact that the real-life Roy was mauled in an accident ''is kind of creepy.''
 Another weak entry, the executives said, is ''LAX,'' a drama about Los Angeles International Airport, at 10 p.m. Monday on NBC.
 ''A scene we saw had a suitcase that almost blows up,'' Ms. Koerner said, ''as if people don't have enough anxiety about flying.'' Mr. Rash of Campbell Mithun laughed as he recalled watching a scene with one star of ''LAX,'' Heather Locklear, ''on a runway, without a headset, wearing a white pantsuit.''

Connecticut Joins States Investigating Insurers
Connecticut has quietly broadened the investigation into potential conflicts of interest by commercial insurance brokers, pursuing the same issue that has drawn the attention of officials in New York and California.
 A team of several lawyers and investigators in Connecticut first began working on the question in late April, about the same time that the investigations in New York and California became public, according to the attorney general of Connecticut. [Page C5.]

Escapist Television on the Rise
The six big broadcast television networks are promising plenty of escapist entertainment for the new season, from reality television to animated comedy to light drama. Offerings include ''Clubhouse'' on CBS, about a batboy for a baseball team very much like the New York Yankees. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C8.]

Amid the hoopla of last week's presentations of the networks' prime-time lineups for the fall, it became strikingly clear that the network situation comedy was in as bad a state as it has been in more than 20 years. [B1.]

Report Cites Wal-Mart Subsidies
Wal-Mart Stores collected more than $1 billion in state and local government subsidies during its expansion over decades from a regional discount chain to the world's largest retailer, according to a report scheduled to be released today by a group that monitors job-subsidy programs. [C7.]

Buying a Stake in Nanotechnology
Any suggestion of profitless, no-product companies with ambitious dreams might sound like ''Son of Dot-com'' to investors who were burned when the Internet bubble burst. Yet a few companies in nanotechnology are confident they can offer big promises and no proof of earnings to investors. [C4.]

Round Two of the Cellphone Switch
Starting today, cellphone users in rural America will be able to switch carriers and take their numbers with them. Mobile-phone companies expect smoother times in Round Two of the rollout, after taking their knocks in November for botching the introduction of cellphone portability. [C4.]

The British Broadcasting Corporation announced that it had appointed Mark Thompson, the chief executive of Channel 4, a rival commercial television station, to the job of BBC director general. [C6.]

Players must reach certain goals to advance to the next level. [C4.]

Games of Skill Yield Internet Cash
For United States companies locked out of Internet gambling, there is still money to be made -- as long as they don't call it gambling.

HEADLINE: Finance Ministers Seek a Cut in Oil Prices and a Rise in Output

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the United States and other major industrialized countries, hoping to affect the outcome of a battle within the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries, formally demanded yesterday that oil-exporting nations raise production and lower prices to a level ''that is consistent with lasting economic prosperity.''
 The unusually blunt demand, issued at the close of a meeting in New York held by John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, came after several oil-exporting countries sharply criticized Saudi Arabia's unilateral decision to increase its production and its proposal that OPEC increase its overall output by two million barrels a day.
 In their statement, the United States and other members of the Group of 7 industrialized countries said they welcomed the decision by ''some oil producers'' to raise their production -- an indirect reference to Saudi Arabia. But they cautioned that high oil prices, which reached $41 a barrel last week before receding to $39.93 after Saudi Arabia's announcement on Friday, were a risk to an otherwise robust global economy. 
 ''We call on all oil producers to take action to ensure that world oil prices return to a level that is consistent with lasting economic prosperity and stability, particularly for developing countries,'' the Group of 7 declaration said.
 ''It is a strong statement,'' said Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, adding that the seven industrialized countries were in broad agreement about the message they wanted to send.
 The last time the Group of 7 tried to pressure oil-exporting countries was in 2000, when oil prices were climbing above $30 a barrel and gasoline prices in the United States were approaching $2 a gallon in some states. But that effort, led by the United States, was only partially successful and provoked considerable resentment among some nations.
 OPEC ministers, attending an energy conference during the weekend in Amsterdam, decided to put off any decision on overall production levels until its meeting in Beirut, Lebanon, on June 3. But Saudi Arabia is the only member of the group that has substantial excess capacity, and its decision to raise output on its own angered some of the group's other members.
 Speaking to reporters after the finance ministers' meeting, Mr. Snow said it would be ''appropriate'' to have oil prices of $22 to $28 a barrel, OPEC's existing official price band. 
 A senior Treasury Department official said: ''Clearly the ministers from all the countries are anxious to see some action to bring oil prices down. This isn't helpful to the global economy.''
 In the last year, the United States has insisted that market forces be allowed to set currency levels. But administration officials view the oil market as a different kind of issue. ''There is no cartel that sets prices in the currency market,'' one official said.
 The finance ministers met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel this weekend in preparation for next month's meeting at Sea Island, Ga., between leaders from the Group of 7 nations. The group consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Russian officials, considered part of a looser Group of 8, were also on hand.
 Aside from expressing concern about oil prices, the finance ministers were optimistic about the global economy and noted that many forecasters expect worldwide economic growth to reach about 4.25 percent this year.
 American officials are still unhappy that growth in much of Europe, especially Germany, remains anemic. But they are optimistic about Japan and Asia. In contrast to the last Group of 7 finance ministers' meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., in February, neither the United States nor European leaders raised the subject of foreign exchange rates.

HEADLINE: Let the Little Guy in the Boardroom

BYLINE: By Arthur Levitt. 
Arthur Levitt was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1993 to 2001.

 BODY:
In corporate boardrooms across America, they're warning that the sky is falling -- again. Shareholders have heard this before, and it has usually been about money: companies resisted new rules to change how they account for stock options, for example, or how they value certain complex investments in corporate financial reports. And when the Securities and Exchange Commission wanted to restrict the types of consulting work an accounting firm could perform for an audit client, the cry was familiar.
 Now, we are told, the sky is truly going to fall -- and this time it's about control. If the S.E.C. adopts a rule to give qualified shareholders the limited ability to place a director's name on a ballot for a company's board, many executives say, they will have less control of their companies. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of some of America's largest corporations, argues that a small number of shareholders would pursue narrow agendas at the expense of most other investors. 
 They needn't worry. The proposal, which is expected to be voted on by the full commission soon, is not exactly a revolutionary idea. Why shouldn't the true owners of a corporation -- the shareholders -- have the right to nominate a board member?
 While concerns about unnecessary disruption and special interests are reasonable, the business community and investors, particularly pension and mutual funds, should work with the commission in fashioning a final rule that fulfills a basic principle: investors deserve the right to place a potential board member up for a vote in the face of widespread disaffection with the board's governance or performance. This is a modest and well overdue step that will increase transparency and accountability in the boardroom.
 Shareholders now have no realistic options if they want to replace directors: they can really vote only on those candidates nominated by the company, and even if they withhold their votes from these nominees, the directors are always elected. Of course, if shareholders are dissatisfied with how a corporation is being run, they can always undertake a proxy contest. But they bear all the costs to put a nominee up for a vote. Management, in contrast, can spend as much of the corporation's money as it wants to get a director re-elected.
 It's not surprising, then, that contests over board nominees are rare. According to one study, absent special circumstances, there have been 10 such instances since 1996. I think we can safely rule out universal shareholder satisfaction as the primary reason for the lack of contested elections.
 Still, the commission's proposal hardly conjures up images of thousands of shareholders running unrestrained through the boardroom. To succeed in getting a nominee on the board, shareholders who meet a certain ownership threshold would still face significant hurdles.
 First they would have to attract a substantial amount of support from other shareholders, either through a shareholder resolution or by asking them to withhold votes for a current director. Then they would have to wait a year to get their nominee on the ballot. Then they would have to assume the costs of a campaign to convince other shareholders to vote for their nominee. Finally, they would have to win majority support for their candidate.
 Some investors feel the S.E.C.'s plan does not go far enough in putting pressure on management. It would allow only large shareholders to nominate and elect a limited number of board members -- and only then if at least 35 percent of shareholders withhold votes against a director. While almost everyone agrees that greater shareholder democracy is a good thing, there is widespread disagreement on how to achieve it. This is precisely why the commission's initial proposal is so worthwhile: above all else, it is pragmatic. It is written in such a way that it would be hard for shareholders to abuse the voting process, but it would still allow large groups of shareholders to not only reject management's candidate, but also to nominate their own.
 It may well be true that some corporate boards would find themselves subject to the narrow agendas of certain shareholders. But this pressure is mitigated by the fundamental principle of incentive. Investors bear the ultimate cost. They put up the capital and, after everyone else is paid, they get what's left. Their economic incentive is profitability and efficiency. How many times has management asked shareholders to trust them? Isn't it time we trusted shareholders to do what's in their interest?
 The post-Enron period has seen the empowerment of America's institutional shareholders. Mutual funds, as well as state and local pension plans, have aggressively pursued pro-investor initiatives. It is essential that such activism take aim at the kinds of excess and self-dealing that erode public trust. Institutions must steer clear of ill-considered political attacks on highly regarded managements of successful, well-performing enterprises. Trying to ''send a message'' or seeking to advance a specific political or policy agenda will not garner the support of other shareholders. Indeed, this new rule will not only impose greater oversight on management, but also put appropriate restraint on the institutional shareholders who will have a greater responsibility in the governance of their companies.
 No matter how active investors are, however, there will always be companies that are insulated, stuck or unresponsive. There will always be companies whose management ignores a dissatisfied majority of shareholders. There will always be companies whose chief executives' compensation bears no resemblance to any objective view of performance, year after year. And there will always be companies whose boards are obsequious rather than assertive, undemanding rather than challenging.
 If shareholders don't have the leverage to put a voice in those boardrooms that will confront such situations, the likelihood of any near-term change is remote -- and that has its own economic consequences. Shareholders deserve this right. The sky won't fall.

HEADLINE: Going Public Without Profits Or a Product? Yes, in 2004

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Any suggestion of profitless, no-product companies with ambitious dreams might sound like ''Son of Dot-com'' to investors who were burned when the Internet bubble burst. Yet a few companies in nanotechnology are confident they can offer just that -- big promises and no proof of earnings -- to investors hungry for a stake in a hot new sector. 
 Last month, Nanosys Inc., a company in Palo Alto, Calif., filed a public offering statement hoping to raise up to $115 million. Unlike Google Inc., its Silicon Valley neighbor that is also going public, Nanosys has no profits and no products to sell, and its filing statement said it would not market any products before 2006. 
 Some industry analysts predict that the Nanosys filing could spur several other companies to go public this year. While the excitement surrounding nanotechnology -- a broad term for technical advances in handling materials at the molecular level -- may be reminiscent of the dot-com era, there are significant differences.
 Nanotechnology, like biotechnology, requires a much greater initial investment in research and more highly trained personnel than most Internet-based ventures. And the field, projected by the government to become a $1 trillion sector by 2015, has garnered billions of dollars of federal research support. 
 Nanosys, for example, has more than 200 patents and patent applications as well as product development ventures with big companies like Intel and DuPont. The company, founded in 2001, has ties to some of the world's leading nanotech researchers, and promotes its technology as a building block for products as diverse as solar energy panels, electronic displays and memory chips. 
 Josh Wolfe, a partner in Lux Capital, an early investor in Nanosys, told nanotechnology executives and investors at a trade show in New York last week that he expected at least four other nanotechnology companies to go public this year.
 He also said they might soon see ''a Netscape-like I.P.O.,'' referring to the popular initial public offering in 1995 that ignited interest in Internet stocks. Mr. Wolfe, being mindful that federal regulations strictly limit what Nanosys and its investors can say before selling its stock, did not say Nanosys would be that offering. Neither the date of stock sale for Nanosys nor the share price has been set. 
 Chief executives of other nanotechnology companies, including ones that do not have products, said there had been a sharp increase in the number of investment bankers and financial advisers calling them since Nanosys filed to go public.
 While there are publicly traded companies that do substantial work in nanotechnology -- Merrill Lynch recently created an index of more than 20 such companies as a sales tool for brokers -- those older companies were not billed as nanotech ventures when they went public.
 Among the companies now watching Wall Street's reaction to the Nanosys offering is Nanofilm, an already profitable manufacturer of coatings for glass and plastic using nanotechnology. Dr. Scott E. Rickert, a Nanofilm founder and its president, denied rumors at the trade show that his company, based outside Cleveland, would be filing to go public soon. Still, he did not rule out taking such a step later this year. 
 ''There appears to be a greater demand for good companies than the supply,'' said Donn A. Tice, chief executive of Nanotex, a subsidiary of the privately held International Textile Group, which uses nanotechnology to make fabrics that resist stains and wrinkling. 
 Many industry experts say that there will probably be fewer nanotech start-ups than there were Internet ventures during the dot-com boom. They also say that most start-ups with good products will be acquired by larger companies before they go public because the technology could be valuable in so many products and manufacturing processes.
 ''People talk about Nanosys opening the I.P.O. floodgates,'' said Steve Crosby, president and publisher of Small Times Media, a trade publication that tracks nanotechnology. But he noted that industry experts believe ''mergers and acquisitions are the more likely'' result. 
 Still, a hot reception for the Nanosys public offering is likely to lift all companies in nanotechnology. Companies selling themselves could probably seek a higher price and those raising money from venture capitalists may be able to command better terms. And if the dot-com era is any guide, success of Nanosys will accelerate the trend of companies sticking the ''nano'' prefix in their names or associating themselves with the field in advertising. 
 Of course, a slump in Nanosys shares once trading begins could reduce the market for public offerings in other companies and drive down values in the sector. Even now, some experts like Vinod Khosla, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, have been arguing that such a correction is overdue because too many venture capitalists have been piling into the field.

HEADLINE: Permit or Not, Protesters Prepare For Republicans in New York

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
He relishes the idea, and it is just an idea, he says, of linking arms on streets around Madison Square Garden to block delegates and bring the Republican convention to a halt. Getting arrested for civil disobedience, if it comes to that, does not faze him.
 ''I am not going to have a work schedule for two weeks after, just in case,'' says Jim Straub, 23, who is a part-time dishwasher and bookstore clerk and full-time radical in Richmond, Va.
 For Jen Lawhorne, 24, who also plans to attend the convention from Richmond: ''This is going to be one of the finer moments of the American left. The sheer numbers excite me.'' 
 They are a band of like-minded activists, many in their 20's, leading a charge to direct protesters from Richmond to New York for the convention, Aug. 30 to Sept. 2.
 Linked by indignation over the war and economic and social issues, protesters from Chicago, Santa Barbara, Calif., Cleveland and scores of other places across the country are developing their plans to descend on New York City for the convention.
 The protesters are not deterred by the barriers they face. New York City has yet to issue any protest permits. Housing is in short supply and prohibitively expensive. And just the logistics of getting to vehicle-unfriendly New York can be daunting. But convention protesters like the group in Richmond are pressing forward with plans, and developing ways around the hurdles.
 An organizer on the West Coast is suggesting using airline discounts to New York. Another is arranging backpacking trips to raise money for airfare, while some groups in Los Angeles and San Francisco have discussed a car caravan. And in Richmond, organizers plan to pass the hat at parties and hold other fund-raisers for the $1,000 or so needed to charter a bus.
 The fact that the New York police have not issued permits for any of the 15 groups that have applied for marches and rallies near the Garden matters little, especially to the more rebellious sorts.
 The RNC Not Welcome Collective, an affiliation of radicals in New York, is encouraging prospective demonstrators to focus on other sites besides the Garden, like parties and other gatherings of delegates.
 ''If we are diffused throughout the city, we will have a much better advantage,'' read a recent handout at a strategy meeting. ''After all, the real target is not Madison Square Garden, the stage of the spectacle, but the various events where deals are made -- where the lobbyists wine, dine, and bribe Bush & Co.''
 ''If we are truly everywhere in this very big city,'' it goes on, ''the police cannot be concentrated in one area, their communications will be hampered by their hierarchical processes, their steps will be slowed by their pounds of body armor and fatigue from forced overtime.''
 Whether for organized demonstrations or not, people eager to protest the convention are strategizing.
 A ''consulta'' was held recently in Chicago among various groups to discuss plans to take at least 1,000 people to New York, said Jose Martin, an organizer in Chicago.
 M.J. Musler, an antiwar activist in Cleveland, said groups across Ohio hoped to muster 15,000 people in New York, ''little church ladies to the more radical end of the spectrum.'' Most, she said, plan to go for at least Aug. 29, when United for Peace and Justice has applied for a permit for an antiwar demonstration past the Garden for 250,000 people or more.
 West Coast demonstrators may find it more difficult to get to New York, but they seem undeterred, with groups sprouting in Santa Barbara, the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles, Fresno and other places promising to bring carloads.
 Tanya Mayo, an organizer with a national group called Not In Our Name who is in Oakland, Calif., said she had even advised prospective demonstrators who want to fly to take advantage of a Continental Airlines discount on air travel to New York during the convention period.
 ''It's a beautiful location for mobilizing people,'' she said of New York. ''Three international airports, big bus terminals.''
 While established antiwar groups and labor unions are actively organizing, many grass-roots organizers, young, self-described radicals like Mr. Straub and his Richmond companions, are playing a role , too.
 Nicholas DeGraff, a 23-year-old antiwar activist in Fresno, helped coordinate a group called Rancor (a play on the initials for the Republican National Convention), that is raising money through guided backpacking trips and other events to send at least a couple of dozen demonstrators to New York.
 ''A lot of people going are professionals, social workers, people who have the ability to save up and pay for a ticket and a place to stay,'' Mr. DeGraff said last week. ''We are having fund-raisers for people who can't afford to fly out, like students and individuals whose voices are not heard.''
 Mr. DeGraff himself does not have a place to stay yet, counting on the beneficence of churches or other organizations that may offer housing. But he said that would not hold him back and that he planned to take part in acts of civil disobedience, if it comes to that.
 ''Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. taught that civil disobedience is your duty if that's what it takes,'' Mr. DeGraff said. ''The thinking is: Are we going to have to shut down your convention before you listen to average people?''
 Organizers are discussing with several churches in New York the possibility of housing demonstrators, and people across the country are calling in favors with friends who live in the city. An anticonvention Web site includes a bulletin board for housing and transportation assistance.
 Many activists are deciding to skip the Democratic convention in Boston July 26-29 -- and other events like the Group of 8 summit meeting of presidents and prime ministers in Savannah, Ga., June 8-10 -- to reserve resources for the Republicans. While many object to Senator John F. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee whose support of the Iraq war is anathema to the left, ''he is the lesser of two evils,'' said June Grossholtz, a retired college professor organizing convention protesters in western Massachusetts.
 The will may not be a problem but the means can be, especially in places like Richmond, which does not have a deep history of leftist mobilization.
 ''I am less concerned about getting people interested than where we are going to get the money for the buses,'' Mr. Straub said, adding that they rent for $1,000 per bus.
 Muna Hijazi, another organizer, retorted, ''People always find a way to pay for them.''
 The organizers plan to pass the hat at parties and meetings. They will pass out leaflets at a planned July 3 antiwar demonstration in Richmond, and they are collaborating with organizers in Washington for at least the Aug. 29 demonstration.
 The uncertainty over what permitted marches will materialize has caused some confusion and delays in planning.
 ''What are we going to, if there have been no permits issued?'' one woman asked at a meeting in Richmond the other night to plan the July 3 march, which Mr. Straub and his companions see as a way to fire people up for a descent on New York.
 ''You don't need a permit to go to New York and express free speech,'' replied Emily Harry, an anticonvention organizer.
 This Richmond group began organizing eight months ago, after regular Sunday gatherings in a city park of the local chapter of an antipoverty group, Food not Bombs. Not all are agitated 20-somethings; Connie Moss, 45, who has a son in the Air Force stationed in Europe, said she wanted to show that not all military families support the war.
 ''The reason I am going to New York is I want the numbers there,'' she said.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Visa Quagmire'' (editorial, May 17):
 Our research universities continue to be the best anywhere. Unless we develop a better process for reviewing visas, we are about to conduct a grand experiment on the causal relationship between scientific leadership and the long-term health of our economy.
 We cannot solve this problem simply by weaning ourselves from dependence on foreign scientists and engineers. 
 For the United States to remain the world's leader in science, we must compete successfully for the best scientific talent around the world and get more of the best American students to become scientists and engineers.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart's Expansion Aided By Many Taxpayer Subsidies

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores collected well over $1 billion in state and local government subsidies during its decades-long expansion from a regional discount chain to the world's largest retailer, according to a report scheduled to be released today by a group that monitors job-subsidy programs. 
 ''We're not accusing them of doing anything illegal or unusual in the corporate world,'' said Philip Mattera, research director of Good Jobs First, a group based in Washington that compiled the report with financing from the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. 
 But, Mr. Mattera said, the report argues that the low wages paid by Wal-Mart and the downward effect that has on wages at other retail operations, its negative effect on small businesses in the communities where it locates and its contribution to urban sprawl and traffic raise serious questions about the value of giving it sizable financial incentives to expand. 
 Similar complaints have been leveled against other ''big box'' retailers like Target and Kmart. But Wal-Mart's size, profitability and capacity to force other retailers to react to its practices make subsidizing its growth especially questionable, Mr. Mattera said.
 Greg LeRoy, founder of Good Jobs, said the report bolstered the group's argument that taxpayer-financed subsidies to giant retailers should be restricted to those expanding into poor neighborhoods where shoppers are underserved. 
 Good Jobs also lobbies states and communities to require companies to pay what it calls a ''living wage'' to all workers as a condition for getting subsidies and urges that subsidy agreements include strong ''clawback'' provisions. Such restrictions require companies to repay subsidies if they fail to deliver on jobs or other benefits they project in their applications.
 A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Mona Williams, said the retailer, which was not provided with a copy of the report, did not know the correct subsidy total.
 But, she said, if $1 billion is correct, Wal-Mart could make good use of the figure in its advertising. In the last 10 years, she said, Wal-Mart has collected more than $52 billion in sales taxes, paid $4 billion in local property taxes, and paid $192 million in income and unemployment taxes to local governments. 
 ''It looks like offering tax incentives to Wal-Mart is a jackpot investment for local governments,'' she said. 
 Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has more than 2,900 Wal-Mart stores and 91 distribution centers in the United States. It also has more than 530 Sam's Club stores and nearly 70 Neighborhood Markets, which were not covered in the report issued today. The company had net income of nearly $9.1 billion on revenues of $256.3 billion last year. 
 Good Jobs said it found published reports of 91 Wal-Mart stores having received tax refunds or credits, job training funds, community investment in roads and other subsidies ranging from $1 million to $12 million. The total was $245 million.
 In interviews with Good Jobs, local officials provided data indicating that 84 of Wal-Mart's distribution centers received subsidies averaging $7.4 million, for a total of $624 million. And searches of databases for tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local authorities to provide low-interest financing found that such benefits to Wal-Mart cut $138 million off the cost of developing 69 stores.
 ''The actual total is certainly far higher but the records are scattered in thousands of places and many subsidies are undisclosed,'' the report said. 
 The report focused strictly on development subsidies. Critics of Wal-Mart say that wages in its stores are so low that many employees are eligible for food stamps and that lack of medical benefits leaves them dependent on taxpayer-financed medical services, which amounts to a large hidden subsidy. In an e-mailed statement, Wal-Mart said its wages were ''usually greater than those paid to other nonunion retail workers and virtually identical to those of unionized grocery workers.'' It said it also offered a range of fringe benefits.

HEADLINE: The North Korean Uranium Challenge

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
The discovery that North Korea may have supplied uranium to Libya poses an immediate challenge to the White House: while President Bush is preoccupied on the other side of the world, an economically desperate nation may be engaging in exactly the kind of nuclear proliferation that the president says he went to war in Iraq to halt.
 Yet to listen to many in the White House, concern about North Korea's nuclear program brings little of the urgency that surrounded the decision 14 months ago to oust Saddam Hussein. When Mr. Bush has been asked about North Korea in recent months, he has emphasized his patience. He does not refer to the intelligence estimates that North Korea has at least two nuclear weapons, or to the debate within the American intelligence community about whether North Korea has spent the past 18 months building more. 
 Instead, he lauds the progress he says the United States has made in organizing China, Russia, Japan and South Korea to negotiate as one with the North Koreans -- though those talks have resulted in no progress so far in ending either of North Korea's two major nuclear programs. 
 Just last week, the Pentagon even announced it was removing a brigade of troops that had been securing South Korea's border with the North, and sending it to provide additional forces for the Iraqi occupation. 
 With international inspectors recently reporting that North Korea may have shipped uranium, already processed into a gas that can be fed into centrifuges for enrichment into bomb fuel, the White House has been silent. On Sunday, a White House spokesman declined to talk about the reports, other than to issue a statement at the president's ranch in Texas that the news proves the need for ''the United States policy for North Korea to disarm in a complete, verifiable and irreversible fashion.'' 
 ''I admit there appears to be more than a little irony here,'' said one senior administration official, when asked how what he thought Mr. Bush might have said in public if Saddam Hussein -- instead of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader -- had been suspected of shipping raw material for nuclear weapons to a country like Libya. ''But Iraq was a different problem, in a different place, and we had viable military options,'' he continued. In North Korea, he said, Mr. Bush has virtually none. Indeed, the problems and the threats are different, even though Mr. Hussein's Iraq was lumped with North Korea as part of the ''axis of evil'' that President Bush cited in 2002. 
 Even hawks within the administration -- a group led by Vice President Dick Cheney, who said on a trip to Asia last month that ''time is not necessarily on our side'' -- see no major risk that North Korea will lash out at its neighbors or the United States.
 The country is broke; American military officials say it can barely afford the jet fuel to give its fighter pilots time to train. Iraq, too, was in desperate economic straits, but it at least had oil revenue, skimmed from the United Nations oil-for-food program, and active trade. North Korea is literally starving; millions have died of malnutrition.
 But the same poverty that makes North Korea less of a military threat makes it a potent proliferation threat. For years, the North's main export has been missiles. It has sold them to Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Libya and others, often sending its engineers abroad to fabricate custom designs. The reports of likely uranium sales to Libya have created the chilling possibility that the North has now found a new and profitable product -- and that Libya may not have been the only customer. ''Many predicted that sooner or later we would have to worry about the North Koreans not only as users but as exporters of nuclear technology,'' said Daniel Poneman, a former national security official and co-author of ''Going Critical'' (Brookings Institution Press, 2004), a new book about the first North Korean nuclear crisis in the mid-1990's. It was this fear that Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage expressed to Congress last year, when he warned that North Korea would not have to develop complete nuclear arms to become a serious threat; it could sell ingredients.
 In short, if the North's sales to Libya are confirmed, the nightmare that Mr. Bush discussed so often last year -- the sale of ''the world's worst weapons to the world's most dangerous dictators'' -- may be happening at the other end of the axis. Iraq, it turns out, had little or nothing to sell. 
 Mr. Bush has addressed the issue chiefly through an agreement among a growing number of nations to intercept suspected shipments of illegal weapons, nuclear parts or chemical precursors. The United States, Germany and Italy stopped a shipment of nuclear equipment to Libya last year, apparently convincing Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to give up his nuclear program.
 Beyond the interception strategy, there is a widespread sense in Washington that neither the Bush administration nor North Korea has much incentive to confront the nuclear issue this year. Mr. Bush, notes Don Oberdorfer, the author of ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'' (Basic Books, 2002), is not ''prepared to do anything about North Korea because he is overcommitted in Iraq and has a great loathing of dealing with the North Koreans directly.'' 
 The result, Mr. Oberdorfer argues, is that the United States is not ''making the kind of preliminary compromises that would be necessary to get a negotiation going.''
 Administration officials disagree, saying that North Korea should not be rewarded for cheating on its past nuclear agreements and must begin dismantling weapons before it sees any economic benefits.
 So far this has been a prescription for stalemate. But many in the administration agree that Mr. Kim has his own reasons for not seeking a deal this year: the North Korean leader is presumed to be rooting for Mr. Bush's defeat in November, in hopes he will face a more willing negotiating partner in John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee. 
 The risk is that by the time the two countries re-engage, North Korea could have six or eight more weapons, according to the most dire estimates in the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, a view that more cautious intelligence analysts say is based more on conjecture about the North's engineering skills than any real intelligence. Such a number could let the North keep one or two for its own use, and have more to sell, in whole or parts, which is a very different position.

HEADLINE: Seeking Momentum, Canadian Leader Calls for June Election

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 23 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Paul Martin announced Sunday that an election would be held June 28 to choose a new Parliament and give him a mandate to shore up the financially ailing health care system.
 There was no need for Mr. Martin to call an election for another year, but by leading the Liberal Party to victory he hopes to differentiate himself from the scandal-ridden administration of his predecessor, Jean Chretien, a fellow Liberal whom he served as finance minister.
 The Liberal Party has held a virtual monopoly on political power for the last 11 years, but its fortunes have declined because of financial scandals and a nasty internal struggle that forced Mr. Chretien to step down in December in favor of Mr. Martin. 
 Mr. Martin has failed to heal his party's deep wounds, while two rival conservative parties have succeeded in recent months to unite and choose Stephen Harper, an Alberta social conservative, as their leader.
 Mr. Martin has projected an unfocused image of himself as a sometimes conservative, sometimes liberal, leader who believes simultaneously in lower taxes, balanced budgets and more federal support for health care, the cities and the military. For his part, Mr. Harper, who has in the past argued for a far closer military and economic alignment with the United States and has opposed same-sex marriage, has been shifting his positions to the political center to attract broader support.
 The Liberals are pinning their hopes on projects in parts of the country that will be hotly contested in the election. These include a major cleanup of a toxic waste site in Nova Scotia, a marine biotechnology research center in Quebec, improvements to the Toronto waterfront with parks and other recreational facilities, and special assistance to British Columbia communities that have suffered from high American tariffs on softwood lumber.
 The Liberals are preparing a sharply negative advertising campaign to define Mr. Harper as a right-wing extremist who would have sent Canadian troops to Iraq last year and undercut the publicly financed national health care system with tax cuts.
 ''The election is about the kind of Canada we want,'' Mr. Martin said after he formally asked Governor General Adrienne Clarkson in Ottawa for royal assent to dissolve Parliament so an election could be held. 
 ''You cannot have a health care system like Canada's, you cannot have social programs like Canada's, with taxation levels like those of the United States,'' he said.
 The Conservative Party's prospects of taking power remain slim, but they have improved in recent weeks because of broad disgust over disclosures that in the late 1990's the Liberals gave advertising firms aligned with the party about $75 million for little or no work as part of a program to counter separatists in Quebec.
 ''I believe the time for accountability has arrived,'' Mr. Harper told reporters on Sunday. ''Billions have been wasted and hundreds of millions have disappeared. The Liberals have no program they can defend.''
 He added that his government would be ''moderate and mainstream.''
 A national Ipsos-Reid poll published Saturday in The Globe and Mail showed the Liberals leading with 35 percent of the vote followed by the Conservatives with 26 percent and the social democratic New Democratic Party with 18 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
 Perhaps most worrying for the Liberals is the showing of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which the Ipsos-Reid poll shows as having 50 percent support in Quebec, Canada's second largest province. With a lead of 22 percentage points over the Liberals in Quebec, the Bloc appears poised to deny the Liberals dozens of seats in the House of Commons.
 ''The Liberals could lose the election if Harper was to exploit Martin's indecision and ineffectiveness,'' said Desmond Morton, a McGill University historian, ''and simultaneously managed to look less terrifying to a lot of average Canadians.''
 Many political scientists and newspaper columnists say the election may produce a minority Liberal government that will be forced to depend on the New Democratic Party for support in the House of Commons to pass legislation. The New Democratic Party is led by Jack Layton, a former Toronto city councilman who is a critic of free trade and opposes closer military relations with the United States.

HEADLINE: Reassurance for the Florida Voters Made Wary by the Electoral Chaos of 2000

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: SAWDUST, Fla., May 20 

 BODY:
The party had barely begun when Shirley Green Knight arrived with her optical-scan voting machine, lugging it out of a pickup truck and stationing it between the D.J. and the food tent. The sight was no longer strange to the people of Gadsden County, where Ms. Knight, the elections supervisor since 2001, attends most communal gatherings with the machine and a gently pleading message: Your vote will count this time, so please, please come out. 
 Gadsden County, a quiet stretch of tomato fields and piney woodlands hard against the Georgia border, had the highest rate of disqualified ballots in Florida in 2000: 12 percent of those cast in the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Almost 2,000 county residents voted in vain that year, and cynicism still courses through the heavily Democratic county of 45,000, as regular as summer rain.
 ''All my life I have never seen the TV stations declare a winner, then change their minds,'' said Greg Johnson, a fourth grade teacher in Quincy who still wonders if his ballot landed in the scrap heap. ''The Supreme Court decided that election, not us. I like politics, but people in power can get away with stuff and I'm just not sure this time.'' 
 As Election Day 2004 draws near in a battleground state whose 27 electoral votes could prove crucial to the victor once again, a movement is rising in poor black communities to register and to educate, reassure and entreat. A top goal is to change the mindset of people like Mr. Johnson, who still harbor deep suspicions about everything from the accuracy of voting equipment to how polling places are chosen and what role Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother, will play in Florida's outcome. 
 ''It's no longer as simple as saying, 'You're of age, you're a citizen, you're duly eligible to vote,' '' said Andrew D. Gillum, an organizer with the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way in Tallahassee, where he is a city commissioner. ''Instead we're having to convince a lot of people who are thinking, 'Why bother, it won't matter anyway.' '' 
 People for the American Way is training volunteers to fan across the state's northern swath, registering and reinvigorating black voters from Jacksonville to Pensacola. Its African American Ministers Leadership Council is recruiting church members for ''Jericho walks,'' nonpartisan door-to-door efforts not only to register black voters, but also to quell their fears of disenfranchisement and to dispel myths that have circulated since 2000.
 The Southern Florida A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor unions are also concentrating on black neighborhoods with mailings and registration drives, pushing the concept of early voting for people who work long hours and might otherwise skip it. And black politicians are working to build excitement about the election in their communities, with many tapping into many black Floridians' dislike of Governor Bush. 
 Despite the lingering suspicion among blacks, intentional disenfranchisement was never proved, and blatant voter intimidation now seems to have been far more limited than first reported. In Gadsden County, as in Palm Beach and Duval, the root problem was a confusing, badly designed ballot -- not a butterfly, as Palm Beach's winged disaster was called, but a ''caterpillar ballot'' that spread the presidential candidates among two columns, so that many voters mistakenly marked two names. 
 Gadsden is the only majority-black county in Florida and one of the poorest, with high unemployment and illiteracy rates and, in 2000, an outmoded voting system that had been in place for decades. Its demographics are similar to parts of Duval, Palm Beach, Miami-Dade and other counties that had high rates of ballot spoilage: an investigation by The Miami Herald and USA Today found that 83 of the 100 precincts with the largest numbers of discarded ballots were majority black.
 Anger, shame and fear roiled those precincts afterward, fueled by reports of police roadblocks near black polling places, poll workers turning black voters away and the mysterious disappearance of registered black voters from the rolls. As the extent of Gadsden's problem was discovered, television cameras descended, conspiracy theories brewed, and Gadsden County became an object of national ridicule that haunts it still.
 ''My friends out of town say, 'You all are the reason we have Bush in office,' '' said Rutha Black of Quincy, who attended the party where Ms. Knight, the elections supervisor, set up shop on Thursday, celebrating the day the Emancipation Proclamation was formally read in Florida in 1865.
 Blacks in Gadsden said their electoral distrust was compounded by a sense that whites, who have dominated local politics for most of the last century despite being the minority, do not make decisions in their best interest. Ms. Knight lobbied the mostly white county commission to add more polling places when she took office, since some residents had to drive 20 miles to reach theirs. But the commission resisted until a black candidate unseated a white member and swung the vote. 
 Representative Kendrick B. Meek, a Miami Democrat who is chairman of Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign in Florida, said that reassuring black voters was also a top priority for the campaign, as is educating them about how to use the new voting equipment. Most counties now use either touch-screen or optical-scan voting with precinct-level tallying, which they say leaves far less room for error. 
 Statewide turnout among registered blacks soared to 72 percent in November 2000, by some estimates an increase of nearly 50 percent over 1996. An intensive field operation by labor, advocacy groups and black lawmakers like Mr. Meek helped, as did the fact that Jeb Bush had just ended affirmative action in state education. But in 2002, when Governor Bush faced re-election, black turnout plummeted to 43 percent. He defeated the Democratic candidate, Bill McBride, in a landslide, after the Democratic Party wrongly assumed residual anger from 2000 would mobilize the faithful by itself.
 Republicans, who are also courting black voters in some parts of Florida, say the Democrats and their supporters are recklessly rekindling bad feelings that were based on mostly false allegations. They say rumors of black voter intimidation in 2000 remain grossly exaggerated: a Florida Highway Patrol investigation of an unauthorized police checkpoint near a precinct in a black neighborhood outside Tallahassee, for example, found no evidence that it delayed or prevented blacks from voting. 
 ''There is a tendency to exploit our community on the assumption that they won't go find out the facts for themselves,'' said Andre Cadogan, chairman of the newly formed Black Republican Caucus of Palm Beach County. ''One would have to wonder, is it just to inflame a community and distract them from going out there and voting on the issues?''
 The real problems in 2000, people like Mr. Cadogan say -- and several investigations have echoed -- were faulty equipment and voter error, issues that elected officials and advocacy groups have been addressing, with varying energy and success, ever since. In the 2002 primary, Miami-Dade and Broward counties experienced widespread problems with new touch-screen voting machines, partly because of poorly trained poll workers. 
 On the other hand, only a few glitches marred this year's Democratic presidential primary in most Florida counties, an improvement due largely to diligent elections supervisors like Ms. Knight, who replaced someone who had held the office for 20 years. Retraining poll workers, sending out sample ballots and toting her demonstration voting machine to church fellowship halls, town carnivals, high school classrooms and anywhere she can appeal to large groups has paid off: Gadsden had a 40 percent turnout in its municipal elections last year -- the highest in its history -- and 58 percent in the 2002 general election, much higher than the state average.
 Ms. Knight, Gadsden's first black elections supervisor, counted only 14 ''overvotes,'' in which more than one candidate was marked for the same office, in 2002, and only 2 in the March primary. She is aiming for a 70 percent turnout and a zero error rate in November.
 ''Every population has gotten the feel of that machine,'' said Ed Dixon, a Gadsden County commissioner. ''Sometimes it's awkward when Shirley shows up at these events, but people say, 'If she's taking it way out here then there must not be anything to hide.' ''
 Yet suspicion about the new machinery is one problem groups like Mr. Gillum's People for the American Way are encountering as they canvass black neighborhoods, especially in rural North Florida counties where black voter outreach has often been nonexistent. Many, he said, also deeply distrust Florida's process of removing felons, who lose their voting rights when convicted, from the rolls. Each county gets lists of potential felons from a central database, and is supposed to determine whether the information is accurate. 
 But in 2000, the counties mistakenly purged an unknown number of legitimate voters from the rolls because of faulty data.
 Ms. Knight said she would go out of her way to check the list of over 200 potential felons her office received from the state, even if it meant knocking on doors herself. But toward dark on Thursday, as the D.J. reminded partyers to register between dance hits, she finally put her clipboard down, smoothed her red, white and blue scarf and found a plate of food. 
 ''What a day,'' she sighed, and eased herself off duty for a while.

Articles in this series will examine electoral issues raised by Florida's role in the 2000 presidential stalemate and the way the political parties are focusing on the state as they approach the 2004 election. This article was prepared in conjunction with CBS News, which showed its version last night.

HEADLINE: Did Somebody Say War?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
President Bush fell off his bike and hurt himself during a 17-mile excursion at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on Saturday. Nothing serious. A few cuts and bruises. He was wearing a bike helmet and a mouth guard, and he was able to climb back on his bike and finish his ride.
 A little later he left the ranch and went to Austin for a graduation party for his daughter Jenna. And then it was on to New Haven, where daughter Barbara will graduate today from Yale. Except for the bicycle mishap, it sounded like a very pleasant weekend. 
 Meanwhile, there's a war on. Yet another U.S. soldier was killed near Falluja yesterday. You remember Falluja. That's the rebellious city that the Marines gave up on and turned over to the control of officers from the very same Baathist army that we invaded Iraq to defeat.
 It's impossible to think about Iraq without stumbling over these kinds of absurdities. How do you get a logical foothold on a war that was nurtured from the beginning on absurd premises? You can't. Iraq had nothing to do with Sept. 11. The invasion of Iraq was not part of the war on terror. We had no business launching this war. Now we're left with the tragic absurdity of a clueless president riding his bicycle in Texas while Americans in Iraq are going up in flames.
 How bad is the current situation? Gen. Anthony Zinni, the retired Marine Corps general who headed the U.S. Central Command (which covers much of the Middle East and Central Asia) from 1997 to 2000, was utterly dismissive about the administration's ''stay the course'' strategy in Iraq. ''The course is headed over Niagara Falls,'' he said in an interview with ''60 Minutes,'' adding, ''It should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up.''
 When the weapons of mass destruction rationale went by the boards, the administration and its apologists tried to justify the war by asserting that the U.S. could use bullets and bombs to seed Iraq with an American-style democracy that would then spread like the flowers of spring throughout the Middle East.
 Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, addressed that point last week in a report titled, ''The 'Post Conflict' Lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 ''At this point,'' the report said, ''the U.S. lacks good options in Iraq -- although it probably never really had them in the sense the Bush administration sought. The option of quickly turning Iraq into a successful, free-market democracy was never practical, and was as absurd a neoconservative fantasy as the idea that success in this objective would magically make Iraq an example that would transform the Middle East.''
 The president's reservoir of credibility on Iraq is bone dry. His approval ratings are going down. Conservative voices in opposition to his policies are growing louder. And the troops themselves are becoming increasingly disenchanted with their mission. Yet no one knows quite what to do. Americans are torn between a desire to stop the madness by pulling the plug on this tragic and hopeless adventure and the realization that the U.S., for the time being, may be the only safeguard against a catastrophic civil war.
 The president is scheduled to give a speech tonight to lay out his ''clear strategy'' for the future of Iraq. Don't hold your breath. This is the same president who deliberately exploited his nation's fear of terrorism in the aftermath of Sept. 11 to lead it into the long dark starless night of Iraq.
 As for the Iraqis, they've been had. We're not going to foot the bill in any real sense for the reconstruction of Iraq, any more than we've been willing to foot the bill for a reconstruction of the public school system here at home. There's a reason why Ahmad Chalabi and the Bush crowd were so simpatico for so long. They all considered themselves masters of the con. They all thought that they could fool all of the people all of the time.
 There's a terrible sense of dread filtering across America at the moment and it's not simply because of the continuing fear of terrorism and the fact that the nation is at war. It's more frightening than that. It grows out of the suspicion that we all may be passengers in a vehicle that has made a radically wrong turn and is barreling along a dark road, with its headlights off and with someone behind the wheel who may not know how to drive.

HEADLINE: Koizumi's Trip Gets Lukewarm Reviews

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 23 

 BODY:
From television talk programs to mass circulation newspapers, Japanese reacted skeptically on Sunday to their prime minister's trip to North Korea.
 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's summit meeting with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, on Saturday ''made no headway in resolving the abduction, nuclear, missile or any other issues related to Northeast Asia's peace and security,'' the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun said in its editorial. ''Japan must be ready to put punitive measures into action at any moment'' to win compromises from North Korea. In his 10-hour visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, Mr. Koizumi promised large amounts of food and medical aid. He was allowed to fly home with five children of two Japanese couples who returned to Japan in October 2002, almost a quarter century after they were kidnapped by North Korea from Japan. 
 Despite the criticism, more than 60 percent of people polled by three newspapers gave him high marks for bringing home the family members, ending 18 months of separation for the families.
 Critics said, though, that he paid too high a price. Many news organizations complained that Mr. Koizumi had promised not to use sanctions against North Korea and had settled for vague promises from its mercurial leader about his nuclear bomb program as well as the investigation into dozens of other Japanese kidnapping cases.
 ''He was unable to get a clear pledge from General Secretary Kim to dismantle his nuclear program,'' the mainstream newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said. ''Our trump card -- another visit by the prime minister -- was played and this is all we got.''
 While Americans debate whether North Korea's missiles can hit Guam or Hawaii, Japanese know that North Korea's missiles can hit Japan, only a few hundred miles to the east. 
 While Mainichi delicately called the promise of aid ''recompense,'' the conservative Sankei Shimbun called it ''ransom.''
 After a summit meeting replete with subtle snubs, with Mr. Koizumi treated with the protocol due a midlevel envoy, he defended his trip even before leaving North Korea.
 ''Chairman Kim Jong Il said he aimed to de-nuclearize the Korean peninsula,'' Mr. Koizumi said. Referring to the almost year-old regional talks on the North's bomb program, Japan's leader added, ''He said he wanted to make efforts towards a peaceful solution by utilizing the six-way talks.''
 ''The most beneficial thing for both countries would be to change from hostile relations to friendly relations,'' he said of the nations, which do not have diplomatic relations.
 But on the Sunday talk programs, the reviews were poor.
 ''Japan was being ridiculed,'' Shigemura Tomomitsu, North Korean affairs professor at Waseda University, said on Asahi Television. The visit, he added was ''a diplomatic defeat'' for Tokyo.
 Criticism also came from the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, and members of the governing party, the Liberal Democratic Party. Both parties face upper house parliamentary elections in two months.
 Parliament should move quickly to pass a bill that would restrict port visits by North Korean ships, said Shinzo Abe, the party's secretary general, seemingly ignoring Mr. Koizumi's pledge to not apply economic sanctions on North Korea.
 ''On the nuclear issue, it has broken its promise,'' Mr. Abe said on the Nippon Television Network. ''I believe we are in a situation where economic sanctions can be imposed.''

HEADLINE: Qwest, the Runt of the Bells, Tries to Stand Its Ground

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
When Richard C. Notebaert took over two years ago as chief executive of Qwest Communications International, the smallest of the Baby Bell phone companies, he assumed the helm of an enterprise saddled with debt, facing myriad lawsuits and investigations and crippled by financial plans that left it near bankruptcy. 
 But what also troubled Mr. Notebaert was something more palpable.
 ''No one wanted to admit they worked here,'' he said in a recent interview at the company's headquarters in Denver. He saw that some employees would remove their uniforms immediately at quitting time lest people identify them with a local phone company known for terrible customer service. 
 Mr. Notebaert, 56, a former union man with the demeanor of a high school coach, has by many accounts lifted the morale of Qwest's 46,000 workers. But as the company heads into its annual shareholder meeting in Denver tomorrow, he will have to convince the rest of the world -- notably Wall Street -- that Qwest, the runt among the Bells, can survive in an industry that is shaking up its bigger, more financially stable Bell brethren.
 Industry analysts say the question for Qwest is not whether it can stave off collapse in the near term, but whether it will build a profitable business or limp along, eventually to be subsumed in the continuing consolidation of the telecommunications industry. In other words, will Qwest be the next Bell to go silent?
 Qwest has far fewer customers than the other three Bells -- Verizon Communications, SBC Communications and BellSouth -- and it is the only one that does not own a wireless subsidiary, which is a prime growth sector in telecommunications. It is also behind in the scramble to sell high-speed Internet access. 
 More significantly, Qwest remains burdened by debt and losses from its fiber network business, by shareholder lawsuits and by investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Last October, it had to restate earnings for 2000 and 2001, admitting it understated losses during that period by $2.54 billion. 
 The company posted a first-quarter loss of $310 million this year. Shares of Qwest closed on Friday at $3.82 after rising a nickel, or 1.3 percent.
 Nonetheless, Qwest is still in the very lucrative position of being the dominant local phone provider in its 14-state region, a business that generates $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year in cash after expenses, analysts said. 
 Now as it labors to solve its legal and financial problems, its main business in local phone service is shrinking fast, having lost more than one million fixed-line subscribers in the last two years -- a trend happening at other Bell companies as well. 
 Kevin M. Calabrese, an analyst with Argus Research, said that Mr. Notebaert had done a solid job at adding new streams of revenue, like expanding its high-speed Internet access, or D.S.L., service. But for the company to thrive, Mr. Calabrese said, Mr. Notebaert would have to drive up revenues at a time when all forms of telecommunication -- from local and long-distance phone service to data transmission -- are becoming cheaper with deregulation and increased competition from upstarts selling Internet-based phone services. 
 ''I'd hate to be Dick Notebaert because I don't know how to do that,'' Mr. Calabrese said. ''How do you grow revenues in this environment?''
 The bigger Bells are in turmoil for the same reasons, but they do not have the same troubled history to overcome. In the late 1990's, Qwest was primarily in the business of building and operating long-haul fiber networks to carry data traffic. The creation of the networks was enormously expensive, but the company believed that demand for network capacity would soar. 
 Demand fell far short of expectations, setting the stage for Qwest's legal troubles. Federal prosecutors charged that company executives inflated revenues and took steps to book fraudulent sales as the business faltered. 
 In a trial that ended in April, a jury found two Qwest executives not guilty and was deadlocked on the charges against two other executives. The government said earlier this month that it would retry one executive and had reached a plea agreement with the other. 
 As the network business was falling apart, Qwest, under the leadership of Joseph P. Nacchio, merged in 2000 with US West, one of the original Baby Bells created in the breakup of AT&T. That move, criticized at the time, is considered by some analysts to be the reason Qwest survived. 
 Even so, in merging with US West, Qwest acquired a phone company with severe customer service problems, and one that had essentially given up on growing its high-speed Internet access business.
 Since his arrival in 2002, Mr. Notebaert, the former chief executive of Ameritech, one of the original Bells that was acquired by SBC, has tried to follow a strategy embraced by the bigger Bells: offering its subscribers bundled plans with local and long-distance calling, cellular and Internet services. 
 He is also pushing broadband access, even introducing ''naked D.S.L.,'' an innovative option that allows customers to get a high-speed Internet line without having to buy phone service.
 To compensate for the fact that Qwest does not own a wireless business, Mr. Notebaert has joined with Sprint to resell mobile service. Some analysts are skeptical that Qwest can compete on cellular service as a reseller because it cannot control the costs.
 ''It's an O.K. business that's probably making some money,'' said Anthony F. Ferrugia, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons. But, he said, ''they can't be the low-cost provider'' since they do not own the network.
 Mr. Notebaert counters that Qwest has never sought to be ''the low-price provider,'' but instead wants to win customers through better service. He argues that as competition makes telephone and data services ever cheaper, survival means offering the best service as well as the best price. 
 Under his direction, Qwest has also worked to restructure the troubled long-haul business. Patrick Comack, an analyst at Guzman and Company, said Qwest loses about $2.5 billion a year from its national long-haul business, about the same amount as it takes in from its regional telephone business. 
 ''If you could put out that fire,'' Mr. Comack said of the long-haul business, ''the company would be worth a lot more.'' 
 The company is trying to find more customers for the long-haul network. But that business is competitive and any victories over rivals like AT&T, Sprint and MCI will be hard fought, Mr. Ferrugia said.
 ''Even if the economy gets better, there's too much competition,'' he said.
 In the last two years, the company has cut its debt to about $17.5 billion from $26 billion in 2002, though Mr. Calabrese, the analyst at Argus, said other Bells have done a better job dealing with debt and in other measures, too. 
 ''Verizon has done a great job building their network out,'' he said, ''and SBC has done a good job at cost management.'' Qwest ''has done both,'' he noted, but not as well as the other companies.
 ''I look at Qwest,'' he said, ''and say that they've managed it so far, and it looks like they'll pull it off.'' 
 But he added, ''It's going to be a long road.''

HEADLINE: Violent Crime Dropped by 3 Percent in 2003

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
Violent crime in the United States dropped 3.2 percent last year, despite a 1.3 percent increase in murder, according to the F.B.I.'s preliminary annual crime report, which was released Monday.
 Property crime remained almost exactly the same in 2003 as in 2002, declining 0.1 percent, the report found.
 The figures indicate that crime has remained ''impressively flat'' over the past four years, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University. 
 The one crime that has gone up in each of the past four years is murder, the report said, though in none of these years has the increase exceeded 2.5 percent.
 The most striking finding in the report is that murder jumped 15.7 percent in the smallest American cities, those with populations under 10,000. Cities with more than one million residents had a rise of only 0.2 percent in murders.
 Professor Blumstein said the big gain in murders in small cities could be a result of illegal drug activity moving out of large cities and into smaller communities where there are fewer law enforcement officials and declining economic conditions. 
 In suburban counties, the number of violent crimes remained virtually unchanged in 2003 from the previous year, the report said.
 The report is known as the Uniform Crime Report and measures arrests reported by the police. It includes the violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, and the property crimes of burglary, larceny (most commonly shoplifting) and motor vehicle theft.
 Drug crimes are not included because they are considered victimless crimes and are difficult to count accurately.
 Geographically, the Midwest had the largest drop in overall violent crime, down by 7 percent compared with 2002. Violent crime was down 3.2 percent in the Northeast, 2.7 percent in the South and 1.2 percent in the West, the report said.
 The continued flat trend in crime follows a period in the 1980's and early 1990's when crime was sharply up, year after year, and then a period from 1993 to 2000 when crime fell each year. 
 But Professor Blumstein said there were forces in place that could lead to a future increase in crime, including a reduction in the number of police officers because of budget cutbacks, the shift of law enforcement resources to counterterrorism operations and sluggish employment numbers.

HEADLINE: Century-Old Death Records Provide a Glimpse Into Medicine's History

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
Death may be dark and spiteful, a real impediment to one's career development and personal safety. Yet in dying, it seems, each of us has a lesson for the living that may well outlast our bones, those unfortunate family videos and the entire oeuvre of Mitch Albom. No, not the parable of a life well lived, but of a death well logged. 
 Researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Massachusetts are combing, with unnerving liveliness and care, through the death records of some 50,000 people in two Massachusetts communities, Holyoke and Northampton, from the medically revolutionary years of 1850 through 1912. That was when doctors were learning how the body really worked, why traditional ''heroic interventions,'' like bloodletting and emesis, forced vomiting, generally didn't, what microbes were, and how it didn't matter if you were of bilious, phlegmatic, or other Galenic humor -- a sufficiently virulent smallpox infection would have the last laugh. 
 The basic contours of the great Victorian transition in medicine are known, from vapors and leeches to Pasteur and public plumbing, but by examining the death records of two representative cities more exhaustively than has been done for any comparable population, the researchers hope to determine just what killed people when doctors were finally getting the hang of not doing the job themselves. They also seek to identify which of the era's many advances in medical care and public health deserve credit for nearly doubling the average American lifespan between the start of the study's time frame and its conclusion. 
 Dr. Susan Hautaniemi Leonard and Dr. Myron Gutmann in Ann Arbor and Dr. Douglas Anderton in Amherst chose to focus on communities in Massachusetts because at that point it was the only state to record deaths systematically. 
 ''They have access to a wonderful and fairly unusual source for examining changing causes of death,'' said Dr. Graham Mooney, an assistant professor of history of public health at Johns Hopkins University, who has conducted similar studies of Victorian health care in Britain. ''In Britain, you can't see individual death certificates unless you're willing to pay for them.''
 Beyond sifting through death certificates, hospital ledgers and other official inventories of exit stories, the researchers are studying newspaper accounts of the racier fatalities, diaries, personal letters, any source they can disinter short of hauling out a shovel. 
 The three-year project, supported by a $900,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health, unusually large for a work of sociology and history, bears the irresistible title ''Grammars of Death.'' The name underscores the most challenging aspect of the research: deciphering causes of mortality from sources that, however bureaucratic their origin, read like Emily Bronte. Infants died of ''convulsions,'' ''fits'' or ''failure to thrive.'' Seniors dropped dead of ''dropsy'' or ''senility'' or simple ''old age.'' People got tired of ploughing fields, or working in sooty factories, or spending their rare free moments in a drafty church with a bad toothache, and died of '' exhaustion.'' Any number of pulmonary disorders were listed as ''tuberculosis'' or ''consumption'' or the dangerously over-consonanted ''phthisis'' (TIE-sis). 
 A report on the preliminary results of the study appears in the current issue of the journal Social Science History.
 ''The recorded causes of death were often narratives, stories of symptoms,'' Dr. Anderton said. ''Standard nomenclature for diseases did not yet exist.''
 On occasion, the narrative was a cautionary tale for patients disinclined to follow a doctor's advice. When Sylvester Graham, a noted health advocate of the day who promoted a diet rich in vegetables and similar regimens, died in 1851 at the not-quite-ripe age of 57, the presiding doctor, a partisan of cold baths and plain water as the true route to vigor, attributed Graham's death to ''warm baths'' and the consumption of the dread ''Congress water,'' or mineral water. 
 The researchers are trying to standardize the idiosyncratic by identifying individual practitioners, their medical training, their philosophies of ''physick'' and their preferred literary tropes and euphemisms. They are examining patterns of epidemics, reassigning causes of death on the basis of the symptoms described, and translating archaic nomenclature into the contemporary categories and codes outlined in the World Health Organization's ''International Classification of Diseases.'' In that way, the historical patterns can be calibrated by the misery metrics of today.
 As distant as the days of death by Congress water may seem, Dr. Leonard subscribes to William Faulkner's belief that not only isn't the past dead, it isn't even past. ''There are many lessons still to be learned from the 19th century,'' she said in an interview. ''With SARS, West Nile, hemorrhagic fevers and other emergent and re-emergent infectious diseases, we obviously still have a lot to learn about this thing called infection.'' 
 Moreover, she added, the 19th and 21st centuries share a taste for bedside moralizing and blaming the sick for their troubles. In the 19th century, posters were put up during cholera epidemics blaming sloth, vice and bad habits for the disease. There was growing awareness among officials that a lack of public sanitation and appropriate sewage treatment might have something to do with the periodic outbreaks of diseases like cholera and typhus, yet piousness was often cheaper and easier than constructing sewage pipelines. 
 Today, posters attribute the so-called obesity epidemic to laziness, vice and bad habits, rather than, say, the ubiquitousness of cheap junk food, particularly in poorer communities, or the mounting pressure on employees to sit at desks for ever longer workdays, or the slapdash construction of car-based communities without so much as a Potemkin sidewalk on which to take a salubrious stroll. 
 ''Another big lesson from the 19th century is that we have to continue to be vigilant about the role of social and economic inequality, not so much in who gets sick, but in who gets really sick, and dies,'' Dr. Leonard said.
 A century ago, she said, wealth made the biggest difference in health prospects among children, very likely the result of their comparatively surer access to clean water and better nutrition.
 Yet prosperity didn't necessarily help their parents persist. Not only were the wealthy more likely than the poor to die of heart disease as a result of too much sherry and stuffed pheasant, but they could also afford a steady supply of then legal anodynes like opium, morphine and cocaine. Although socially frowned on, drug addiction among the upper classes was not uncommon, with predictably wretched outcomes and a need for doctorly discretion. 
 Dr. Anderton cited an 1859 article from The Daily Hampshire Gazette, reporting on the attempted cover-up for the recent death of a ''Dr. Hall'' as a result of opium, alcohol and other ''distasteful causes.'' The writer explained that '''disease of the heart' is the mantle of charity, which the politic coroner and the sympathetic physician throw over the graves of genteel people.''
 The researchers have found other discrepancies in official death reports that seem to correlate with social rather than medical factors. Official narratives tend to be longer and more elaborate for men than for women, for example, even when the cause of death was similar. A woman dies of tuberculosis. A man dies of tuberculosis in both lungs and after three weeks of a fulminant cough. A woman dies ''in an accident''; a man dies when he is struck by a carriage, which breaks his neck and crushes his left leg. Dr. Leonard suggests that doctors paid more attention to the deaths of men than of women, either because men were more substantive figures in society, or because, being men themselves, they couldn't help but feel a more urgent need to understand the particulars of a departure from their ranks.
 Many of the medical practices through the early Victorian era were holdovers from ancient authorities like Aristotle, Galen and Empedocles, whose philosophies gave rise to notions of body humors and the belief that disease was a result of an excess of bile, blood or phlegm. The doctor's task was to get rid of the offending surplus fluid through the use of bloodletting, purgatives and mercury. George Washington is thought to have died, in part, from profound anemia brought on by chronic bloodletting, while the use of purgatives to treat intestinal infections in infants and children almost certainly hastened their deaths. 
 Before the 19th century, laypeople had begun to catch on that such drastic interventions ''didn't help you and in fact could be harmful,'' Dr. Leonard said. ''They felt empowered to take care of their own health.''
 Alternative therapies like hydrotherapy and homeopathy became powerful, as did an obsession with cleanliness, personal and communal. A popular idea among doctors and the public was the association between illness and ''miasma,'' bad smells and bad vapors. Demands swelled for cleaner streets, sweeter air. 
 ''Even before anybody knew about germs, they were sanitizing some buildings, requiring that night soil be removed from public proximity and having swamps drained to get rid of the bad smells,'' Dr. Anderton said. With better sanitation and fewer breeding grounds for mosquitoes, public health began to improve. Still, the miasmic approach to better living was imperfect. ''It only worked if something smelled bad,'' he said. ''So in the winter, forget about sanitation.''
 Miasmic reasoning prevented many doctors from adopting new practices like washing their hands between patients. Lethal agents traveled by air, they thought, not lodged beneath a doctor's fingernail. 
 A growing awareness of the contagiousness of disease was similarly spotty. People began recognizing that smallpox was highly infectious, giving rise to smallpox wards and isolation houses that helped reduce the severity of epidemics. Yet tuberculosis, a far greater thresher of the day, was seen as a private affair, and people hacked their way through town, aboard trolleys, with nobody screaming for quarantine. Young women were expected to care for family members with tuberculosis, which may explain why the classic pre-Raphaelite beauty sports a distinctly consumptive complexion.
 By the early 1900's, the ''germ theory'' of disease at last had taken hold, and tests for the presence of the tuberculosis bacillus and other bacteria made the diagnosis of disease and the cause of death far more precise and reliable than ever before. Doctors and surgeons became zealous about antisepsis, and deaths from infections like childbed fever plummeted. The quaint cemeteries of pre-modern America are freckled with the small, sad headstones of infants and children, sometimes many from a single household; today in the United States, most parents cannot conjure such a tragedy. According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading causes of death are heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's. 
 Whether our longer lives are more lovable is open to question. On the 11th slot of the C.D.C.'s mortal tally is a means of adieu quite rare among our forebears: suicide.

HEADLINE: South Korea Stakes Its Future on Keeping Peace With North

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 24 

 BODY:
News that North Korea may have joined an international nuclear black market, selling uranium hexafluoride to Libya, was a Page2 article on Monday for South Korea's five most influential newspapers.
 Instead, journalistic excitement here is vibrating around a meeting on Wednesday between a North Korean general and a South Korean general, the first such meeting since the Korean War, half a century ago.
 Once again, Seoul and Washington are separated by a deep panic gap.
 While the United States struggles to ascertain whether North Korea is crossing an invisible line concerning its nuclear activities, South Korea struggles to keep the peace on the peninsula. 
 With half of South Korea's 47 million people living within 70 miles of the Demilitarized Zone and 70 percent of South Korea's economy dependent in some way on foreign trade, the government policy toward North Korea is officially called ''Peace and Prosperity.''
 ''Our economic and security circumstances offer us no other choice but to pursue a dual policy of peace-keeping and peace building,'' Jeong Se Hyun, South Korea's unification minister, said at a recent conference for foreign investors sponsored here by The Asia Society.
 That means subsidizing trade and investment in the North, still South Korea's enemy according to national security laws. 
 Critics of North Korea have an increasingly hard time finding a live microphone in South Korea. Death threats are forcing Free NK, a new Internet radio station run by defectors, to move to a secret studio.
 ''There is practically no media criticizing North Korea in South Korea these days,'' Kim Sung Min, 42, the station director and a former army propaganda officer in North Korea, said Monday. ''South Koreans are being manipulated by North Korea's 'One People' slogan, mobilizing sentiments to help people of the same race.''
 North Korea's news agency demanded last week that South Korea end tours of tunnels that North Korea built, largely in the 1970's, under the Demilitarized Zone. North Korea called the tours ''an unpardonable grave political provocation.''
 But with millions of dollars in tourism revenue at stake, South Korea has ignored the demand. 
 With few voices critical of North Korea heard on television, radio or in schools in recent years, young South Koreans increasingly tell pollsters that they do not see North Korea and its nuclear arms program as threats.
 In a sign of the changes, Seoul District Court acquitted three conscientious objectors on Friday of charges of not performing military service. Facing North Korea's 1.1 million-member military, South Korea relies on a universal male draft to maintain its 600,000-member military.
 With the liberal Uri Party of President Roh Moo Hyun set to take over next week as the majority of the new National Assembly, some critics see South Korea slowly moving to a neutralist policy toward North Korea.
 Two weeks ago, after the midlevel regional talks on North Korea's nuclear bomb program, the Kyodo News Agency of Japan sent a long dispatch from Beijing under the headline, ''S. Korea's Softer Stance on N. Korea Worries Japan, U.S.''
 Kyodo accused Japanese and American negotiators of not sharing with their South Korean counterparts intelligence information that had been gleaned from interviews with members of the nuclear supply network set up by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the former leader of Pakistan's main nuclear laboratory.
 Kyodo also contended on May 15 that when South Korea joined talks with Japan and the United States, ''the topic of Khan-related intelligence was not put on the table, apparently due to fears it could end up in Pyongyang through Seoul.''
 On Monday, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official involved in the nuclear talks dismissed Kyodo's accusation, saying that cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the United States ''is very solid, and we are all in a position to persuade North Korea not to enrich uranium.''

HEADLINE: Justices Step Into Interstate Wine Rift

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed Monday to resolve an intensifying debate over whether states can prohibit out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers. The eventual decision could have implications beyond wine sales for Internet commerce in general.
 The appeals the justices accepted, from New York and Michigan, are among some two dozen cases now in courts around the country challenging laws that states defend as part of their authority to regulate the liquor industry but that small wineries and consumers have attacked as impermissibly protectionist.
 The constitutional doctrines that undergird these positions are complex and contradictory. The 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition, gives states broad authority to regulate the sale and use of alcoholic beverages within their borders. But the Commerce Clause, as long interpreted by the Supreme Court, sharply limits the ability of individual states to erect economic barriers at their borders. 
 Not surprisingly, different courts have reconciled these competing doctrines in different ways, a circumstance that made the Supreme Court's intervention all but inevitable. The justices consolidated the cases for a single argument, to be heard late next fall.
 In the Michigan case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, struck down the state's interstate-shipment ban last August on the ground that it amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. Both the state government and the state's beer and wine wholesalers appealed to the Supreme Court; the cases are Granholm v. Heald, No. 03-1116, and Michigan Beer and Wine Wholesalers Association v. Heald, No. 03-1120.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, upheld New York's law in a ruling three months ago. That court placed more emphasis on the state's 21st Amendment powers and found that the law was valid ''within the ambit of that authority.'' The court said New York's law did not discriminate on its face because it permitted any winery with a ''physical presence'' in the state, such as an office, to ship directly to consumers.
 Clint Bolick, strategic litigation counsel of the Institute for Justice, the libertarian public-interest law firm that brought the challenge to the New York law, said in an interview Monday that it was ''ludicrous'' to suppose that his client, Juanita Swedenburg, proprietor of a small Virginia vineyard, could open an office in New York or any other state.
 ''If you call her winery, she answers her own phone,'' Mr. Bolick said. 
 The appeal, filed on behalf of Ms. Swedenburg as well as a California winemaker named David Lucas and three New York wine consumers, is Swedenburg v. Kelly, No. 03-1274. 
 Mr. Bolick said a decision upholding the state laws could permit states to erect ''serious barriers to e-commerce in general.''
 Viet D. Dinh, a law professor at Georgetown University who is representing the wholesale wine and liquor industry in defense of the state laws in these cases, said the Second Circuit's analysis in relying on the states' 21st Amendment authority was clearly correct. In an interview, Mr. Dinh, a former assistant attorney general, said that because alcohol was ''unlike any other product,'' a decision upholding the state laws would not have implications for other types of commerce, on the Internet or elsewhere.
 While direct sales from wineries to consumers are growing quickly as states relax their prohibitions or lose court cases, as Texas did last year, they are still a small portion of all wine sales, $200 million out of $18 billion last year. The stakes are obviously high, however, both to the wineries, which are motivated to avoid sharing their profits with wholesalers, and to the states. The National Conference of State Liquor Administrators estimated in 2000 that states were losing tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue from interstate wine sales to consumers. Thirty-six states have joined a brief filed by Ohio in support of Michigan's appeal.
 New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, filed a Supreme Court brief agreeing with Ms. Swedenburg that the court should hear the challenge to the New York law in order to clarify the national situation. He urged the court to uphold the law, however.
 These were among other developments at the court on Monday:

Lethal Injection
 The justices ruled unanimously that an inmate on Alabama's death row whose collapsed veins are not suitable for a lethal injection was entitled to bring a civil rights suit challenging, as cruel and unusual punishment, the state's plan to open a vein surgically in order to execute him.
 As suggested by the unanimous vote on a court that is usually divided on criminal justice issues, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion in favor of the inmate, David L. Nelson, was a narrow one, confined to procedural issues and leaving the merits of the inmate's claim to be addressed by the lower federal courts.
 State inmates are typically allowed only one petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. One petition by Mr. Nelson, convicted of a 1977 murder, had already been rejected by the time he went to court to challenge the state's imminent plan to carry out his death sentence with a so-called ''cut-down procedure,'' opening a two-inch cut in his arm to bypass veins that had collapsed from long-term drug use.
 His new case was brought not as a habeas corpus petition but as a suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, a post-Civil War statute that permits suits for violations of constitutional rights. But the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, said the suit was functionally the same as a second habeas corpus petition and dismissed it.
 Overturning that decision today, Justice O'Connor's opinion noted that Alabama had conceded that a prisoner who was not facing execution, but who needed medical treatment that required access to a vein, could sue to challenge the ''cut-down procedure'' as inadequate medical care.
 ''We see no reason on the face of the complaint to treat petitioner's claim differently solely because he has been condemned to die,'' Justice O'Connor said.
 The case is Nelson v. Campbell, No. 03-6821.

Car Search
 By a vote of 7 to 2, the court expanded the ability of the police to search the passenger compartment of a car in conjunction with the arrest of the driver or other occupant.
 Previous decisions permitted officers, out of concern for their own safety, to conduct such searches if the occupant was inside the car when first stopped or contacted by the police. The question in the new case, Thornton v. United States, No. 03-5165, was whether the same rule applied if the occupant was outside the car at the time of the initial contact with the police.
 The court's answer was yes, in an opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. 
 ''The arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer safety and the destruction of evidence as the arrest of one who is inside the vehicle,'' the chief justice said, describing both settings as ''highly volatile.''
 In this case, a man stopped by a Norfolk police officer for driving with a license tag that belonged to another car was found to have a handgun under the driver's seat. The man, Marcus Thornton, had parked his car and left it before the officer could pull him over.
 While seven justices supported the result, Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected to the analysis and did not sign the majority opinion. They said the search could be seen as reasonable but could not be justified as a safety measure. Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter dissented.

HEADLINE: Preservationists Call Vermont Endangered, by Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: WILLISTON, Vt., May 24 

 BODY:
The Wal-Mart here, like thousands of others across the country, sells everything at a steal: jeans for $10.77, gold earrings for $9.97, a three-piece set of luggage for $29.64.
 But to some Vermonters, the cavernous store in this Burlington suburb symbolizes something else: the big-box-ification of a largely unspoiled part of the country.
 With that in mind, a national historic preservation group said Monday that it was placing on its annual list of endangered sites an unusual entry: the state of Vermont.
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation said it was calling Vermont endangered because of the threat of ''behemoth stores,'' specifically Wal-Mart's. The trust believes Wal-Mart, the nation's largest company, plans a big expansion in the state with Williston-size stores. Trust officials contend that big-box stores threaten Vermont's picturesque villages, lush countryside and closeknit communities. 
 ''We know the effects that these superstores have,'' said Richard Moe, president of the trust. ''They tend to suck the economic and social life out of these downtowns, many of which wither and die as a result. I think it will drastically affect the character of Vermont, which I think is unique.''
 Vermont is the only state to have ever made the endangered list; indeed, the trust is invoking a strategy it believes worked before. Vermont was also listed in 1993, when it was the only state without a Wal-Mart.
 Mr. Moe and other preservationists believe that the 1993 listing helped persuade communities in Vermont and elsewhere to take a tougher stance in negotiating with Wal-Mart and other big chains. After that listing, Vermont communities rejected at least one proposed Wal-Mart and steered three others -- in Bennington, Berlin and Rutland -- toward the kinds of sites preservationists like: moderate-sized existing buildings of 75,000 to 80,000 square feet in the heart of a downtown.
 Williston broke that pattern, following the model of most Wal-Marts, with an outsized building of 150,000 square feet. Soon, other box stores, including Home Depot, Toys ''R'' Us and Bed Bath and Beyond, opened in the suburb.
 ''Vermont could be a poster child for how to do it right,'' with the three smaller stores, said Peter Brink, a senior vice president at the trust. But, Mr. Brink added, the Williston store, twice the size of the others, is ''an example of how to do it wrong.'' 
 Mr. Moe said, ''Wal-Mart should change to accommodate Vermont, not the other way around,'' and he added that he hoped to stimulate awareness of the issue across the country.
 Mia Masten, community affairs manager for Wal-Mart's eastern region, said the company would take the trust's listing ''into consideration, but this is only one side of the story.''
 Wal-Mart, with more than 2,900 stores and 91 distribution centers, tries to work with communities, Ms. Masten said, and is not ''just coming in and bulldozing our way in.''
 Vermont's four outlets are the fewest that Wal-Mart Stores, based in Bentonville, Ark., has in any state, she said. Trust officials say Wal-Mart is looking in seven Vermont towns for more locations, but Ms. Masten said only one formal proposal had been made, in St. Albans.
 But, she said, ''we are always looking for opportunities to expand in existing markets,'' and most new stores are 150,000 square feet or bigger.
 ''We've also heard from a lot of Vermonters who want a Wal-Mart closer to their communities,'' Ms. Masten said. ''And customers have told us they like a larger store. It enhances their shopping experience that there's a wider selection and the aisles are larger.''
 The trust's listing comes as Wal-Mart has become an increasingly polarizing symbol. Some economists and shoppers embrace it for its low prices and efficiencies, and some religious-right groups cheers its refusal to carry music and magazines they find morally offensive.
 But the company has also been criticized by union leaders, who believe Wal-Mart pushes down wages, and by academics, town planners and others who worry that Wal-Mart fosters suburban sprawl. Wal-Mart is even an issue on the national political scene this year, with Senator John Kerry calling the company's health care benefits ''disgraceful,'' and Vice President Dick Cheney praising Wal-Mart at a visit to its headquarters this month.
 James Hoopes, a professor of business and ethics at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., called the trust's listing ''one more statement that Wal-Mart is perceived as not only a very well-performing business, but also as a threat to a sort of quintessential Americana.''
 The split is clear as St. Albans considers a proposal by Wal-Mart to build a 146,000-square-foot store two miles north of town. The project was announced in December by Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican, who said then that he had urged Wal-Mart to come.
 The St. Albans city manager, Brian Searles, said, ''We'd like to have a store that serves the needs of our community and doesn't have a negative impact on our downtown businesses.'' He added that the entire county only had 47,000 people, and that a 146,000-square-foot store was ''really big for that demographic.''
 Paul Bruhn, executive director of the Preservation Trust of Vermont, said his group was seeking a site in downtown St. Albans to offer as an alternative. ''We're not against Wal-Mart,'' Mr. Bruhn said. ''We feel we've been very reasonable in trying to find compromises.'' 
 Some in St. Albans consider the Williston Wal-Mart a lesson. It drew most retail business away from downtown Burlington, said Mayor Peter Clavelle, who said his city was able to compensate with restaurants, cultural activities and boutiques.
 ''I appreciate that people want a place to shop,'' said Mr. Clavelle, a Democrat challenging Mr. Douglas for governor. ''But I also think that Wal-Mart would not be the big bogeyman if they were a bit more sensitive to issues of scale and location.''
 In Williston, shoppers also split.
 ''Some people that move to Vermont, they just want to leave it just the way it is,'' said Irene Johnson, who with her husband, Jere, travels 30 miles once a week from St. Albans to buy a large variety of items. ''I hate to be the one to go against the grain but I think we need more Wal-Marts in Vermont.''
 But Diane Longley, who was buying a fan, said she would prefer smaller downtown Wal-Marts. ''I do feel that the big stores are detrimental to the community,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Macao, Famously Seedy, Now Bets on Vegas Plush

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: MACAO, May 24 

 BODY:
When Las Vegas Sands Inc. opened the first American-operated casino in the People's Republic of China here last week, the scramble of would-be customers was a reminder of this former Portuguese colony's chaotic past.
 Drawn partly by false newspaper reports that the Sands Casino would hand out $25 chips to the first bettors on opening day, a mob estimated by the police at 20,000 knocked over crowd-control barriers and ripped doors off their hinges in a rush to get inside. But when people were told that there were no free chips, they quickly settled down to gambling.
 The incident underlines Macao's recent transformation from a place of seedy gambling dens to something more like the Las Vegas of the East.
 Heavily tattooed members of Chinese gangs known as triads have stopped shooting and bombing the police, gambling regulators or one another. East European prostitutes no longer openly solicit business on casino floors. Many new regulations are being drafted, including a new money-laundering law to replace the very weak statute now on the books. 
 In the late 1990's, gang killings were so frequent here that a top police official tried to reassure tourists by telling them they were unlikely to be caught in the cross-fire because the city had ''professional killers who don't miss their targets.'' China began cracking down on the triads in 1999, the year Portugal handed over the colony, stamping out most violent crime and making Macao safe instead for an invasion by American gambling companies.
 Beijing also broke the monopoly on gambling in Macao that Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong billionaire with a dozen small casinos here, held for four decades. With gambling illegal in most of East Asia, including the rest of China, Macao's casino industry is set to grow rapidly, with plans under way for a Vegas-like strip of 20 large casino resorts and 60,000 hotel rooms. The local government accepted bids for new gambling licenses in 2002, and the Sands is the first to open.
 The wealthy Lui Chi Wo family of Hong Kong, the partner of Las Vegas Sands in the Sands Casino, is scheduled to open another here this summer. Wynn Resorts, led by the Las Vegas entrepreneur Stephen A. Wynn, plans to break ground this summer for a much larger casino, a project that had been delayed in part by a dispute over Macao's laws on extending credit to gamblers.
 The big question now is how Mr. Ho's gambling empire, known here as S.J.M. -- short for the company's Portuguese name, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau -- will respond to the new competition.
 Manuel Joaquim das Neves, the director of Macao's gambling regulatory agency, said in an interview here on Monday that he expected S.J.M. to conclude some kind of corporate alliance soon with MGM Mirage, which did not win a gambling license of its own here. ''I think very probably we will get an agreement, and we will get another operator in Macao,'' he said, adding that MGM might be allowed to open casinos as a subconcessionaire using S.J.M.'s gambling license.
 S.J.M. had no immediate comment Monday. A spokeswoman for MGM Mirage, Yvette Monet, said it was ''very interested in Macao -- if anything should become finalized, we will announce it accordingly.''
 Before the Sands opened, there were questions about how many hard-core gamblers in the Chinese market would be willing to leave the low-ceiling haunts they had frequented for years. The Sands responded by offering dancers in skimpy blue outfits scampering in front of a soft-rock band, a 65-foot ceiling over the baccarat and blackjack tables, an indoor tea terrace offering 200 varieties of free tea, and slot machines that pay off with a triple 8, a lucky number in Chinese culture, instead of triple 7.
 The combination appears to be working. The Sands was packed on Sunday evening and again on Monday afternoon, and was surprisingly busy even Monday morning. By contrast, there were more dealers than bettors in the cramped, smoky Oriental Casino next door on Sunday evening, and at Mr. Ho's flagship, the Lisboa Casino, on Monday morning.
 In a written reply to questions about his new rivals, Mr. Ho struck a diplomatic tone. ''We welcome competition, as long as it is friendly and constructive to the economy,'' he wrote. ''We have lots of confidence in Macao's future, and we believe that under friendly competition, together we will contribute to the continuing healthy development of the gaming industry in Macao. The pie is going to be bigger and bigger, and we all could get a fair share of it.''
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Ho said it was too soon to assess the effects of the Sands on his own casinos.
 In truth, Mr. Ho may gain over all even if his casinos falter in the short run, because his business interests extend beyond gambling to dominate the broad economy of Macao -- like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. He controls the hydrofoil ferries that make 80 hourlong trips a day across the Pearl River estuary between here and Hong Kong; he owns luxurious hotels like the Westin and the Mandarin Oriental, and the only television station; and he has stakes in the airport, a local airline, the electric utility and the racetrack.
 If anything, the gambling market here appears likely to expand even faster than anyone expected because of developments in Hong Kong. China, trying to use economic growth to defuse a democracy movement there, has in the last year dropped many of the restrictions against individual visits by mainlanders to Hong Kong and Macao, while retaining those restrictions on travel elsewhere.
 A result has been a flood of tourists from an economy growing so fast that regulators are now trying to slow it down for fear of overheating. The number of mainlanders crossing the land border into Macao quadrupled the day the Sands opened.
 The chairman of Las Vegas Sands is Sheldon G. Adelson, who built the Comdex computer industry trade show into one of the world's largest conventions and then sold the trade-show business in 1995 to Softbank of Japan for $860 million. Macao is now so important to him that he flies here from Las Vegas every four to six weeks.
 He is about to trade in his Gulfstream 3 jet, which must land and refuel twice each way, for a Boeing Business Jet, a long-range 737 that can make it from Las Vegas to Macao with just one stop, and then cruise back again with the jet stream on its tail without stopping at all. Mr. Adelson said he had personally overseen a lengthy fitting out of the new jet's interior, including his private bedroom.
 The gambling industry in Macao still faces problems, among them the large number of loan sharks. These lenders accompany borrowers to the gambling table and claim a share of any winnings as well as their principal and 10 percent interest, according to Fong Ka Chio, the research coordinator at the Institute for the Study of Commercial Gaming at the University of Macao. Losers are typically given a week or two after returning home to settle their debt, Mr. Fong said; after that, ''how they collect it, you can imagine.''
 Mr. Wynn has argued strongly that Macao should start allowing the casinos themselves to provide credit to gamblers, in the form of chips. The territory's legislative assembly is close to passing the necessary legislation, but the bill does not now include provisions for casinos to write off bad debts against profit -- an important matter in Macao, which gets two-thirds of its tax revenue from a 35 percent tax and 3 percent surcharge on gross gambling profits. Mr. Joaquim das Neves said the deductibility question was a difficult one and that the city would not make a decision on it until next year.
 Two senior colleagues of Mr. Joaquim das Neves, who was born in Macao and educated in Portugal, were shot in the neck in separate incidents during the violence of the late 1990's. One died instantly, at lunchtime next to the Lisboa Casino; the other survived.
 Next to such incidents, the disorder at the opening of the Sands last week paled; there were no serious injuries, although a few people were reported to have fainted in the crush. Mr. Adelson said he did not believe that any of his rivals in the gambling industry had started the free-chips rumor. Mr. Ho's newspaper, Jornal do Cidadao, did not publish it.
 Lei Siu Peng, acting commissioner of the Macao police, said in an interview at the city's aging colonial-style police headquarters on Monday that his investigators suspected that some travel agents might have started the free-chips rumor to lure more visitors into buying tickets to come here. But he acknowledged this would be difficult to prove. 
 Just the same, he said, the police are considering buying some sturdier crowd-control barriers.

HEADLINE: Campaign Ads Are Under Fire For Inaccuracy

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
A record year for political advertising has brought with it a hail of televised exaggerations, omissions and mischaracterizations that pollsters say seem to be leaving voters with mistaken impressions of Senator John Kerry and President Bush.
 The degree to which the advertisements push the facts, or go beyond them, varies by commercial. While Mr. Bush's campaign has been singled out as going particularly far with some of its claims, Mr. Kerry's campaign has also been criticized as frequently going beyond the bounds of truth. 
 In three of its advertisements, Mr. Bush's campaign has said Mr. Kerry would raise taxes by at least $900 billion in his first 100 days in office. Mr. Kerry has no such plan. 
 In an advertisement for Mr. Kerry, an announcer said, ''George Bush says sending jobs overseas makes sense for America.'' Mr. Bush never said that. A report to Congress by his top economic adviser said cheaper production of goods overseas had long-term benefits but did not make the plain case that domestic job losses were a good thing.
 Outside groups are getting into the act as well. 
 The League of Conservation Voters, which has endorsed Mr. Kerry, is running an advertisement in Florida warning that ''President Bush opened up Florida's coast to offshore drilling.'' But the drilling area that was opened under Mr. Bush is 100 miles off the coast, much farther than it would have been under a Clinton administration proposal.
 Of course, it is a time-tested practice to make one's opponent look as bad as possible in a political campaign, whether the race is for a town council or the presidency of the United States. And the campaigns and outside groups say they are under no obligation to present defenses for their opponents in their own advertisements, all of which are at least tenuously based in fact.
 But this campaign season, with total advertising spending at roughly $150 million since early last summer, the number of distortions and omissions is worrying some good-government groups, which say they fear that the big money behind the claims is leaving indelible impressions.
 ''Even people who don't think there is much information in these ads and say they don't learn anything from them tell us they believe factoids they could only have gotten from these ads, and they're wrong,'' said Brooks Jackson, director of Factcheck.org, an Annenberg Public Policy Center Web site that vets political advertisements for accuracy. 
 This month the Annenberg Center, at the University of Pennsylvania, released a poll of voters in swing states that found many believed misleading statements made in the advertisements. 
 In a survey conducted from April 15 to May 2, 61 percent of the 1,026 voters questioned in the 18 swing states where most of the advertising has run said they believed Mr. Bush favored sending jobs overseas. And 72 percent said they believed that three million jobs had been lost during Mr. Bush's presidency. Mr. Kerry made that claim in a spot in late February, when the most commonly used Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed the actual net job loss to be closer to 2.3 million, down from 2.7 million in late summer. That number is now less than 1.6 million. (Mr. Kerry's figures did not include government jobs.) 
 In the same survey, 46 percent of those questioned said they believed Mr. Kerry ''wants to raise gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon.'' Three spots for Mr. Bush, which came in for particular criticism, have said that Mr. Kerry supported a 50-cent-a-gallon tax increase on gasoline, an assertion based on comments from Mr. Kerry that appeared in two newspapers 10 years ago regarding a position he never acted on and has long since abandoned.
 More than half of those surveyed also said they believed Mr. Kerry had ''voted for higher taxes 350 times.'' That idea, Annenberg researchers concluded, is based on a commercial for Mr. Bush in which an announcer said , ''Kerry supported higher taxes over 350 times.'' While Bush campaign aides say the claim is accurate and have made public a list of instances to which it refers, they acknowledge that in several of these cases Mr. Kerry had in fact either voted to maintain tax rates or even to cut them, but not by as much as Republicans had proposed. 
 ''Each of these votes amounted to higher taxes than an alternative,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ''We expect that voters will reach the obvious conclusion that John Kerry will increase your taxes or will oppose efforts to cut taxes.''
 Asked why the spot did not simply say that Mr. Kerry has consistently voted for higher taxes than Republicans have proposed, which even the Kerry campaign would not dispute, Mr. Holt said, ''We said 'supported higher taxes,' as provably true and totally accurate.''
 Several other commercials this year have been criticized as pushing past the facts when they could have indisputably conveyed similar points with less sensational-sounding claims.
 For instance, one of Mr. Kerry's new commercials boasts that he provided ''a decisive vote'' for President Bill Clinton's 1993 economic plan, which, it maintains, ''created 20 million new jobs.'' The bill passed by a single vote in the Senate, giving anybody who voted for it a claim to have provided a decisive vote. But at the time, it was the last-minute support of Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, that was considered decisive. And even economists who credit the plan with playing a significant role in the 1990's boom say Mr. Kerry's spot goes too far. 
 ''To say that any one economic package was responsible for all of the stuff going on in the 90's is kind of ridiculous,'' said L. Douglas Lee, president of Economics From Washington, an economic policy analysis firm. Still, Mr. Lee said, the 1993 package was an important factor in the boom. 
 Asked why the spot did not simply say that Mr. Kerry voted for a package credited with helping to set the conditions for the boom, Michael Meehan, a Kerry spokesman, said: ''That's why we have elections. People get to decide. We said it created 20 million jobs. If people don't believe that, they should vote for someone else.''
 Aides on both sides said privately that it was hard to fit all the nuance of complex policies into a vehicle designed to convey thoughts no more complex than ''Tastes Great, Less Filling.'' 
 ''There's only so much you can do in a 30-second ad,'' said an aide to Mr. Kerry, making a point that was echoed by a senior strategist for the Bush campaign.
 Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, does not accept that. ''When they could make the 30-second ad accurate and they don't, you've got to believe that they're intentionally misleading you,'' she said.
 Kenneth M. Goldstein, an associate professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said that it was to be expected that the campaigns would take liberties, and that with both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush flush with cash, there was plenty of time for them to answer each other's claims.
 ''Politics is about putting your best foot forward and putting the other person in the worst light,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''Do we expect someone who's advertising to say, 'You know, I really don't want to put this person's record in the worst light because that's not fair'?''
 In the end, Mr. Jackson of Factcheck.org said, it appears that a new rule requiring candidates to appear in their own advertisements and express approval has not reduced the number of misleading claims. All that can be done, he said, is to continue to vet commercials for accuracy and try to set the record straight as publicly as possible. That, he said, can be a thankless task:
 ''I've had consultants tell me, 'Your ad watch runs once, my ad runs many times; who's going to win?'''

HEADLINE: Many Arts Groups in City Lag In Naming Blacks as Trustees

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
On Thursday, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater announced that Oprah Winfrey would contribute $1 million toward a scholarship program at its school, a gift secured by Judith Jamison, the dance company's artistic director and a trustee.
 The gift was only the latest example of big-dollar charitable fund-raising by wealthy black professionals -- a growing pool that is being successfully exploited by Jazz at Lincoln Center and Alvin Ailey, some arts and business leaders say, even as it remains largely neglected by most of the city's major cultural institutions.
 ''Is there an adequate candidate pool of people of difference who bring resources? Yes,'' said Bruce Gordon, who stepped down from the board of Lincoln Center Inc., the governing body of the arts campus, at the end of December, when he retired as president of retail markets for Verizon Communications. Mr. Gordon's departure left Lincoln Center Inc.'s 55-member board without a single black trustee. 
 Money, donating it or raising it, remains the key to membership on New York City's major cultural boards, and because wealth remains concentrated among white people, arts boards remain predominantly white. 
 Yet Jazz and Ailey, organizations with deep roots in black cultural life, have a significant number of black trustees. And each has managed to raise the sum necessary to open a new building this fall -- a $128 million home for Jazz at the Time Warner Center and a $54 million building for Ailey on Ninth Avenue.
 Out of Jazz's 34 trustees, 9 are African-Americans; out of Ailey's 35 trustees, 14 are. By contrast, the Museum of Modern Art, Carnegie Hall and the American Museum of Natural History -- each with 40 to 60 trustees -- have only one African-American board member apiece.
 Experts in philanthropy and the arts say that many of the leading boards, which took generations to stretch their memberships beyond well-heeled white Protestants, have pursued the same small group of black chief executives for trusteeships. 
 They note, too, that blacks traditionally give to schools and churches before the arts. Earlier last week, Alphonse Fletcher Jr., 38, a Wall Street money manager, announced that he would give $50 million toward improving race relations to mark the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. 
 And vestiges of racism, some arts leaders say, also explain why boards have diversified their membership at a snail's pace.
 But black executives who serve on cultural boards say that Jazz and Ailey can serve as an example to the city's other arts groups -- that there are blacks with the inclination, the means and the connections to serve, including links to the white establishment. 
 Mr. Gordon said Jazz at Lincoln Center ''may prove to be a model that the larger Lincoln Center can learn from.'' Aside from Jazz, many of the constituent groups have only one black trustee, including the New York City Ballet, with 38 board members; the New York City Opera, with 32; the Juilliard School, with 26; and the Chamber Music Society, with 19.
 To be sure, there are still far fewer rich blacks than rich whites -- 33,000 black households have an income of $150,000 or more in the New York metropolitan area, compared with 587,000 white households in the same income bracket, according to an analysis of 2000 census data by the Queens College department of sociology.
 But the number of black millionaires nationwide is up sharply, rising by nearly 79 percent in constant dollars from 1983 to 2001, said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University. ''There is a new wealthy African-American community now,'' he said.
 Social factors help explain why this new group has yet to be represented on major cultural boards, Mr. Wolff said. ''There is a club that makes up these boards,'' he added. ''It's a very closed network and probably highly related to their wealth.''
 Brooke Waring Mahoney, president and founding executive director of the New York-based Volunteer Consulting Group, is more blunt. ''It's the societal norms of fear of the other that have kept nonprofit board rooms from being emancipated,'' she said.
 Moreover, blacks tend to give to institutions that directly affect them. A recent survey of 94 black individuals or organizations that give at least $25,000 a year to charity found that 22 percent had an interest in arts and culture, compared with 64 percent with an interest in education. 
 ''Donors want to feel invested in the outcomes and see the results of their philanthropy in the communities in which they live and have a personal affinity,'' it says in the survey, conducted by the 20th Century Foundation, which makes grants to African-American organizations.
 The city's large arts groups say they are committed to adding minority trustees, but concede that money matters most in choosing board members. 
 David Rockefeller Jr., chairman of the Museum of Modern Art's nominating committee, said that the Modern's $800 million fund-raising campaign for the renovation of its Midtown Manhattan building influenced the museum's priorities.
 Board diversity is ''definitely on our minds,'' he said. But, he added, ''When you're in a capital campaign, it puts such an emphasis on people with good fund-raising skills and people who can make large contributions.''
 Richard Clarke, an African-American executive recruiter who serves on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said every potential trustee should be evaluated by the same standards. ''The criteria for selection is the same for minorities as for nonminorities,'' he said. ''The first one is money, the second one is influence.'' 
 Institutions, he said, have no choice but to recruit those who offer the greatest resources, even if that predominantly means white people. ''You fish in the waters where you get whales, rather than minnows,'' Mr. Clarke said.
 Much of the money raised by Jazz and Ailey comes from predominantly white corporations, foundations and individuals, or from the city. 
 Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home and its three main stages, for example, are named for white or white-led donors: Frederick P. Rose Hall and its main stage, the Rose Theater, after the philanthropist who donated $10 million to get the project started before he died in 1999; the Allen Room, after Allen & Company, the investment banking firm that also contributed $10 million; and Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, after the Coca-Cola Company, which contributed another $10 million.
 Large gifts also came from the Irene Diamond Fund ($10 million) and from New York City ($27.5 million).
 Gordon J. Davis, the founding chairman of Jazz and a former New York City parks commissioner, said that some donors expressly want to give to groups whose boards are integrated. 
 ''It can be very important to these kinds of donors that the staff and the board reflect the mission of the organization and the growing heterogeneity of American society,'' said Mr. Davis, who sits on the boards of the New York Public Library, the Public Theater and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
 Moreover, some black trustees of Jazz have made big gifts or helped secure them. Robert L. Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, gave $1 million in operating money. Hughlyn F. Fierce, Jazz's president and chief executive, helped obtain a $1 million building donation from J.P. Morgan Chase, having spent most of his career at Chase Manhattan Bank.
 Other black board members offer expertise, like Albert Murray, the cultural critic, and Ed Bradley of ''60 Minutes,'' who acts as M.C. at Jazz's gala performances and is the host of its weekly radio show.
 Arts executives say that a handful of prominent black corporate leaders are always in demand for boards. Richard D. Parsons, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, serves on the board of the Museum of Modern Art. E. Stanley O'Neal, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, is on the board of Lincoln Center Theater. Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive of American Express, sits on corporate and nonprofit boards, but no arts groups. Mr. Fletcher has served on the board of the Public Theater and is a member of the Metropolitan Museum's business committee.
 ''The same names show up on every list,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''To me, the opportunity that is not being exploited is the opportunity to go after up-and-comers, the ones that are not yet the C.E.O.'s or group presidents but will be easier to attract.''
 A few public agencies around the country have tied their financial support for cultural groups to board diversity, like San Diego's arts commission. The Old Globe Theater in San Diego recently added five minority trustees in response to the a funding cut. 
 New York City would not consider such a quid pro quo, said Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner. ''The primary rationale for public funding is the quality of the public service that's being provided,'' she said.
 Ms. Levin added: ''Many organizations have achieved an impressive level of diversity and many of them have not. I do see the effort being made.''
 A few major city arts groups are more diverse. Out of 45 trustees at the New York Public Library, for example, four are black, one is Latino and one is Asian-American. At the Metropolitan Museum, the board of 39 includes three blacks, four Asians and two Latinos, compared with one black and 29 whites in 1980. 
 Reynold Levy, Lincoln Center's president, said his board had recently expanded to a maximum of 75 members, from 56, specifically to allow for greater diversity. 
 That goal, he explained, is consistent with the planned redesign of Lincoln Center's campus, which currently turns its back on Amsterdam Avenue, including the mostly black Martin Luther King High School and a housing project.
 ''We need to lower the barriers to entering Lincoln Center,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We want to be as receptive and as unintimidating as we can.''
 During his time at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gordon said these outreach efforts seemed genuine, if incomplete.
 ''I believe, for the short period of time that I served, that the board was beginning to wrestle with the issue of how to make Lincoln Center and its governance more diverse,'' he said. ''Having said that, there is a lot of work to be done.''

HEADLINE: Failing to Disband Militias, U.S. Moves to Accept Them

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Warzer Jaff contributed reporting from Falluja and Sulaimaniya for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 24 

 BODY:
With only weeks to go until an Iraqi government takes over, American officials have failed to disarm the tens of thousands of fighters in private militias deployed almost exclusively along ethnic and religious lines.
 In the 15 months since the fall of Saddam Hussein, American officials have declared repeatedly that they would disband the private militias, recognizing that their narrow, sectarian interests could threaten a unified and democratic Iraqi state.
 But with the sharp deterioration of the security situation in recent months, American officials appear to have resigned themselves to working with militias in Falluja, Baghdad and elsewhere even as American soldiers die fighting them in street battles in Karbala and Najaf.
 A senior allied official said Monday that the Americans were engaged in delicate negotiations with several of the country's main militias to disband and integrate them into the security forces. The official said the Americans hoped to announce an agreement with the militias as early as this week. But it is not clear, with so few weeks left before the transfer of sovereignty, whether the Americans will have the leverage to disarm the militias. 
 The danger is that on June 30 the Americans will hand over power to an Iraqi administration that will not have a monopoly on the use of armed force, in an environment that many fear could set the stage for sectarian and ethnic warfare as the country moves toward what are intended to be democratic elections.
 As that date approaches, the Americans are quietly allowing some of these armed groups to flourish and, in some cases, have even helped recreate them. 
 In Falluja, the scene of deadly fighting last month, American commanders agreed to set up an Iraqi security force composed almost entirely of former members of Mr. Hussein's Republican Guard and anti-American guerrillas.
 In Baghdad and southern Iraq, the Americans have allowed the two largest Shiite militias, the Badr Corps and the Dawa army, to remain intact, largely on the promise by their leaders that the fighters will stay off the streets.
 In northern Iraq, as part of the effort to disband the 60,000-man Kurdish militia, entire military units simply donned police uniforms of the new Iraqi state but otherwise stayed in the same place with the same commanders. 
 Even fighters in the Mahdi Army of the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whom American soldiers have been killing in large numbers in recent weeks, may be given a chance for legitimacy. In a recent news conference, the general commanding American forces in Najaf and Karbala said he would be willing to consider taking Mahdi Army militiamen into a new Iraqi security force being set up to help secure southern Iraq.
 In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 18, the deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, suggested that the American government had accepted the continued existence of the militias, provided they remained friendly to the United States.
 Asked if he intended to disarm militias controlled by the mainstream Shiite parties like Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Mr. Wolfowitz suggested that he did not.
 ''That is not part of the mission unless it is necessary to bring them under control,'' he said. ''The approach to those militias is to try over time to integrate them into new Iraqi security forces. And the real answer to disarming militias is to create an alternative security institution. And then the militias can go away.''
 Most of the militias were formed during Mr. Hussein's rule by groups opposed to him, and they have evolved into the armed wings of various political groups and factions.
 The decision to turn over control of Fallujah to former members of the Republican Guard has bought a measure of peace and stability to the city after weeks of ferocious fighting.
 But one former American official familiar with the issue said that while tolerating militias may lead to greater security in the short term, doing so could threaten the democratic process and risk dividing Iraq along ethnic and religious lines.
 ''We are not going to get free and fair elections, and we are not going to get sustainable democracy of any kind in Iraq unless we make some kind of progress in demobilizing these militias,'' said Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority.
 Mr. Diamond said he was worried that the militias, most of which are connected to political parties, would use their guns to intimidate voters, steal ballot boxes and assassinate opponents. ''Everything we know from similar situations in other countries tells us that the militias will use their control of arms to create facts on the ground,'' he said.
 The persistence of the militias is fueled by the deep insecurity each of the main ethnic and religious groups feels about the others. No one wants to disarm first, so no one disarms at all. Iraqi political and religious leaders complain loudly about the other groups' militias, but rarely mention their own.
 A senior leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq sharply criticized the American decision to gather former Republican Guard soldiers into a ''security force'' in Falluja.
 ''Of course we are not happy -- they are Republican Guards, with the same uniforms, the same mustaches,'' said Adel Abdel Mehdi, the group's leader.
 Yet Mr. Mehdi's party controls one of the largest militias in Iraq, the Badr Corps, whose cadre are thought to number in the thousands. Not only does Mr. Mehdi not regard the Badr Corps as a problem, he says they should be deployed to provide security around the country.
 So far, the Americans have held firm, vowing to crush any militia, like the Mahdi Army, that comes out into the streets. But since the Iraqi security forces disintegrated in the face of the uprisings in Falluja and southern Iraq last month, the American forces have begun to reconcile themselves to two realities.
 One is that the rapid military training offered to the Iraqis failed to turn them into effective fighting forces. The other is that Iraqis are reluctant to fight other Iraqis on behalf of the Americans.
 With little more than a month to go before sovereignty is transferred, most of the big armed groups remain intact, sustained in the last year by either the tacit or explicit approval of the American administration.
 In some cases, the Americans have allowed militias that it considers friendly simply to change their names. The Badr Corps, for instance, has changed its name to the Badr Reconstruction Organization, and its leaders claim that it is now involved only in cultural activities. The head of the group, Abu Hassan al-Ameri, remains in his same offices, and his men still carry Kalashnikov rifles. ''All of our guns have been licensed by the Americans,'' Mr. Ameri said.
 As with most other militias, the Badr organization is made up almost entirely of a single religious or ethnic group. So strong is the Shiite identification of the Badr Corps that in the 1980's, during the Iran-Iraq war, some of its members fought for Iran, another majority-Shiite country, against the Sunni-led forces of Iraq.
 From the beginning, the task of disarming the militias has been a difficult one. Every Iraqi family is permitted to own one high-powered assault rifle, and virtually all of them do. Like the American minutemen of yore, the militias are composed mostly of civilians, who assemble -- or disappear -- on short notice.
 While the United States has tried a hands-off approach with armed groups it regards as friendly, it has tried to co-opt ones that have demonstrated hostility. After the heavy fighting in Falluja last month, American commanders accepted an offer from a former general in the Republican Guards to set up a security force of his former troops.
 One result is that Falluja has been mostly peaceful since the deal was reached a month ago. But the peace has come at considerable cost: It has enraged mainstream Shiites, who were stunned to learn that the Americans had resurrected the very soldiers they deposed a year before. Shiite leaders worry that the short-term peace in Falluja will give way to disaster in the future.
 ''Today, they are in Falluja; tomorrow they will be in Baghdad,'' said Mr. Mehdi, the Shiite leader.
 These days in Falluja, the line separating an insurgent and a member of the ''security forces'' is sometimes invisible.
 ''All the people in Falluja are fighters,'' said Naji Obeid, a 35-year-old member of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, an American-sponsored force.
 When the Marines tried to enter Falluja last month, Mr. Obeid joined the fight against them. When the peace deal was struck, he put his Iraqi civil defense uniform back on and returned to work.
 ''The people, they were fighting against the Americans, and they were fighting to protect their city,'' he said. ''And now they are in the new Iraqi Army, protecting their city.''
 American officials insist that the Falluja security force will be disbanded soon. Yet there are indications that far from ending the Falluja experiment, the Americans are considering applying its lessons in other cities.
 In a news conference this month, Maj. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the commander of the American division that has been battling the Mahdi Army, said he might be willing to accept members of that militia into a new, 4,000-man security force he and his men are creating to police areas like Karbala and Najaf.
 ''If the militia dissolves tomorrow, what I've got is 600 unemployed young men on my hands,'' General Dempsey said. ''Some of them are probably decent young men who have been badly led astray.''
 For months, the solution posed by the Americans, at least publicly, has been to break up the command structure of the sectarian militias and disperse their fighters into ethnically mixed government-run security forces. Yet American officials concede that they have seldom accomplished that.
 In northern Iraq, where Kurdish militias number as many as 60,000 men, the ''pesh merga'' have in some cases simply changed into Iraqi government uniforms.
 Anwar Dolani, 46, was a pesh merga fighter for 25 years. A few months ago, he and 891 of his comrades joined a local battalion of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps together.
 ''The same peshmerga commanders are now the I.C.D.C. commanders,'' Mr. Dolani said.
 Not surprisingly, perhaps, Mr. Dolani said his primary allegiance was still to the Kurds, not the Iraqi nation. ''If the Arabs try to be in charge of us and try to take our rights,'' he said, ''we will not be silent. We will fight.''
 Only in rare cases have the Americans have been able to deploy ethnically diverse military units. While much of the Iraqi security forces disintegrated during the uprising of the Mahdi Army last month, one unit stood out: the 36th I.C.D.C. Battalion. That unit, a unique creation, was formed by drawing militiamen from the main Iraqi political parties and mixing them together.
 General Dempsey has said the 36th Battalion is a template for the security force he plans to form to take over in places like Najaf and Karbala once the Mahdi Army is dispersed. ''When things became difficult, they stood and fought,'' he said.
 Under the plan being negotiated now, Iraqi militiamen would be offered jobs in the Iraqi security services and become eligible for army pensions. They would even qualify for job training.
 But some Iraqis doubt that the 36th Battalion can be duplicated outside the ethnically mixed cities of Mosul and Baghdad. In most other parts of the country -- Basra, the Sunni triangle -- local populations tend to be much more homogeneous -- and rivalrous.
 Mr. Diamond, the former coalition authority adviser, said the Americans had initially intended to dismantle the militias fully and spread the fighters around. But after the revolts in Falluja and the south, he says he is not so sure the Americans will be willing to do that, especially with those militias that are nominally friendly, like those controlled by the Shiites.
 ''You are talking about a long, long process,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''I don't see that we have the will or the stomach for it anymore.''

HEADLINE: The 50-Cent-a-Gallon Solution

BYLINE: By Gregg Easterbrook. 
Gregg Easterbrook is the author, most recently, of ''The Progress Paradox.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republican strategists have been making hay of Senator John Kerry's support a decade ago of a 50-cent-per-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax. History let Mr. Kerry off the hook: the proposal never advanced in Congress, so he never cast a vote for it. 
 Few politicians, especially those with presidential ambitions, would entertain such a big jump in the federal gasoline tax today. With the price of gasoline reaching more than $2 a gallon at the pumps this month, Senator Kerry has argued for oil to be diverted from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a plan President Bush has rejected in pursuit of his energy bill. 
 But the country would indeed be better off if gasoline taxes had been raised by 50 cents a gallon when Mr. Kerry favored the idea. And the United States would still be wise today, if it increased gasoline taxes by the same amount now.
 The federal gasoline tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, while state gasoline taxes average 24.6 cents per gallon. Had federal gas taxes gone up 50 cents a gallon 10 years ago, several things might not have happened or would have had far less impact. 
 The S.U.V. and pickup-truck crazes would not have occurred, or at least these vehicles would be much less popular; highway deaths would have been fewer; and gasoline demands would be lower as would oil imports. To continue, the world price of oil would have been lower, since petroleum demand in the United States is the first factor in oil markets; greenhouse-gas emissions in this country would be lower; Persian Gulf oil states would have less influence on the global economy and less significance to American foreign policy; fewer dollars would have flowed to the oil sheiks; and the trade deficit balance for the United States would be smaller. 
 Don't all those things sound pretty good? And if higher gasoline taxes had moderated the ever-growing national thirst for oil, fuel at the pump still would have become more expensive -- but Americans would be sending the extra money to Washington rather than Riyadh.
 Of course, Americans don't want to send extra money to Washington. But new gasoline taxes could be revenue-neutral -- intended to discourage oil waste rather than fill government coffers, with other taxes cut as the pump tax rises. Ideally, proceeds from a revenue-neutral gasoline tax could be used to reduce income taxes and payroll taxes of the poor and lower middle class. Gasoline prices affect this group regressively. 
 Most economists would say that higher pump prices are a better counterforce to rising oil consumption than complex regulatory schemes. (When prices rise, consumers make their decisions on how to respond, usually preferred over government-imposed solutions.) Three decades ago, the United States used about 15 million barrels of oil a day; now it's 20 million barrels and rising. About 10 million barrels a day are imported now, compared with about 4 million barrels 20 years ago. 
 One downside would be lower profits for the Big Three in Detroit, which are S.U.V.-dependent. Any new gas tax would need to be phased in over a period of years, giving Detroit time to adjust. General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler all sell high-quality cars with a higher mile-per-gallon performance at a profit in Europe. They can do so here, too.
 When the Bush campaign broadcast an ad highlighting Mr. Kerry's 1994 gas tax position, the Kerry campaign was quick to point out that one of those who had promoted the idea of a higher gasoline tax, offset by reductions in other taxes, was N. Gregory Mankiw, now chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. In 1999, Mr. Mankiw proposed that the federal gasoline tax be increased by 50 cents per gallon, with income taxes reduced an equivalent amount. ''Cutting income taxes while increasing gasoline taxes would lead to more rapid economic growth, less traffic congestion, safer roads, and reduced risk of global warming,'' Mr. Mankiw wrote.
 This was a good idea when John Kerry spoke of it a decade ago; it was a good idea when Mr. Mankiw proposed it five years ago; it remains a good idea now.

HEADLINE: Delusions of Triumph

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Republicans, we hear, are frustrated by polls showing that the public has a poor opinion of George Bush's economic leadership. In their view, the good news about Mr. Bush's economic triumphs is being drowned out by the bad news from Iraq.
 A recent article in The New York Times, citing concerns of ''Republican elected officials, pollsters and strategists,'' put it this way: ''The creation of nearly 900,000 new jobs in the last four months -- a development that might otherwise have redefined the race in Mr. Bush's favor -- has been largely crowded out of the electorate's psyche by images from Iraq.'' 
 Funny, isn't it? In 2002, Republican strategists used the impending Iraq war to distract the public from the miserable economic news. Now they're complaining that Iraq is taking voters' focus off the economy.
 But is the economic news really that good? No. While the recent economic performance is better than in the administration's first three years, it isn't at all exceptional by historical standards. And after those three terrible years, the economy has a lot of ground to make up. 
 Let's start with the ''nearly 900,000 new jobs'' created in the last four months. Is that exceptional? Well, during the first four months of 2000, the last presidential election year, the economy created 1.1 million new jobs. An e-mail message to Bush's supporters from Ken Mehlman, his campaign manager, takes a longer view, boasting of 1.1 million jobs created since last August (when job growth finally turned positive). But in April 2000, payroll employment was 2.3 million higher than in August 1999.
 And that was after seven years of sustained employment growth; rapid job growth is hard to achieve when the economy is already close to full employment. To find a year comparable to 2004, we need to look back to 1994, when the economy was still recovering from the first Bush recession. In the first four months of that year, the economy added almost 1.3 million jobs. 
 The experience of 1994 also gives us some indication of how likely job growth is to ''redefine'' an election. Between December 1993 and November 1994 the economy gained 3.6 million jobs, a number beyond the Bush administration's fondest dreams. Yet voters, convinced that Bill Clinton was leading the country astray, gave his party a severe defeat in that year's midterm elections. So it's interesting that a new CBS News poll finds that 65 percent of Americans believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction -- a level not seen since 1994.
 If you want to convince yourself that I'm not playing games with dates, go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site at stats.bls.gov. Click on ''U.S. economy at a glance,'' then on the green dinosaur next to ''Change in payroll employment'' for a 10-year chart of monthly job gains and losses. The chart reveals that for 37 months, from January 2001 to February 2004, the Bush administration presided over dismal job numbers: employment for each month fell, or grew far more slowly than the norm during the Clinton years. March and April were much better, but they still weren't exceptional by 1990's standards.
 And a mere return to Clinton-era job growth isn't enough: after all those years of poor job performance, we need extra-rapid growth to make up for lost time.
 Here's one way to look at it. The job forecast in the 2002 Economic Report of the President assumed that by 2004 the economy would have fully recovered from the 2001 recession. That recovery, according to the official projection, would lead to average payroll employment of 138 million this year -- 7 million more than the actual number. So we have a gap of 7 million jobs to make up.
 And employment is chasing a moving target: it must rise by about 140,000 a month just to keep up with a growing population. In April, the economy added 288,000 jobs. If you do the math, you discover that President Bush needs about four years of job growth at last month's rate to reach what his own economists consider full employment. 
 The bottom line, then, is that Mr. Bush's supporters have no right to complain about the public's failure to appreciate his economic leadership. Three years of lousy performance, followed by two months of good but not great job growth, is not a record to be proud of.

HEADLINE: Bush Starts Out on a Five-Week Run Concerning Iraq, Much of It Apparently Uphill

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
President Bush's speech on Monday night kicked off a critical five-week period in which the White House must not only make good on its pledge to return self-governance to the Iraqi people but also convince the American electorate that the benefits of deposing Saddam Hussein have outweighed the costs in blood, money and battered prestige.
 It is a tall order. Mr. Bush spoke against the backdrop of unabated violence in Iraq, the prison abuse scandal, confusion about the plan for transferring authority to an as-yet-unnamed interim government on June 30 and the difficult negotiations concerning the role of the United Nations. 
 Making his task that much more complicated was the hard-fought presidential campaign, in which Mr. Bush's role as commander in chief is no longer the unalloyed strength the White House once assumed it would be. 
 In the hours before his address, delivered at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., Mr. Bush got a fresh reminder of just how fully his political fate is now tied to events in Iraq.
 A new crop of opinion polls showed that his job approval ratings continue to fall, that Americans increasingly think the nation is on the wrong track and that most people do not think Mr. Bush has a clear plan for bringing the involvement of the United States in Iraq to a successful conclusion.
 With so much of what is happening in Iraq beyond Mr. Bush's control, the five-part plan for stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq that he outlined Monday night may not unfold in the orderly manner he described. 
 ''Did this prepare the American people for the fact that Iraqis might make different choices, that Iraq could devolve into a civil war, that what we're doing there is much less popular in Iraq than the president implies, and did he look at the downside rather than the upside?'' asked Anthony Cordesman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''The answer is no.''
 Mr. Bush has a plan, Mr. Cordesman said, but ''it's very easy to see the plan unravel because it's not so much dependent on the quality of our plan but on the dynamics of Iraq's internal politics.''
 Mr. Bush made only one concrete concession to the grim reality of the past few weeks, setting out a plan to build a new high-security prison and tear down Abu Ghraib, the jail where some Iraqi prisoners were abused by their American captors and where Mr. Hussein's government had earlier tortured and killed untold numbers of its own citizens. 
 Otherwise, Mr. Bush stuck to the basic approach he has settled on over the past several months, betting that his steady-on strategy would ultimately be judged resolute rather than inflexible or unrealistic. He again tied what is happening in Iraq to the broader war on terror, and he warned that the attacks in Iraq would not end with the planned handover of sovereignty in five weeks, but he was optimistic about the final outcome.
 ''There are difficult days ahead and the way forward may sometimes appear chaotic,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Yet our coalition is strong. Our efforts are focused and unrelenting and no power of the enemy will stop Iraq's progress.''
 If the five-point approach he set out covered all the bases on paper, it still risked appearing detached from the violence and chaos that has threatened to engulf Iraq and extract a heavy political price from Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans at home. Coming into the address, Mr. Bush was clearly under pressure from within his own party as well as from Democrats to go beyond his usual counseling of patience and fortitude.
 ''There's a growing unease in this country and in Congress about whether we have a plan for success in Iraq,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. ''Even those who have been stalwart supporters of the president's decision to invade Iraq now have many questions about how we make the transition to a peaceful and democratic country.''
 Senator Collins said it was clear that the administration had misjudged what the United States would face once Mr. Hussein was deposed, and that this speech was critical to his efforts to maintain both domestic and international support.
 ''America needs to hear from the president not only his resolve, which very few people doubt, but also his plan for accomplishing what right now seem to be very difficult and daunting goals,'' she said before the speech.
 As he presses ahead on the diplomatic and military fronts, Mr. Bush is also confronting the continued fallout from the prison abuse cases, which have expanded to encompass incidents beyond those first disclosed at Abu Ghraib and fueled intense reactions in the United States and abroad. There are sure to be continued questions about the administration's trust in Ahmad Chalabi, the Iraqi exile leader, who is under investigation for passing highly classified American intelligence to Iran.
 It is uncertain whether the Iraqi people will accept as legitimate the interim government that is to be named this week by the United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and whether that government will be subject to the same types of attacks that cost the life of, among others, Izzedin Salim, the president of the Iraqi Governing Council, who was killed by a car bomb last week. With Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis all vying for power, there is no assurance that the interim government will hold together or be able to function.
 To Mr. Bush's allies, the main job now is not so much to adjust policy as to do a better job of reminding the American people why the United States went into Iraq in the first place and the benefits to the United States of succeeding in nurturing a stable democracy in the heart of the Middle East.
 ''Over the last several weeks there's been an overemphasis on the prison situation and the continued bloodshed and attacks in Iraq,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia. ''Now is the time for the president to step up and tell the public why we're doing what we're doing and remind them of the importance of the mission.''
 In a statement after Mr. Bush's address, Mr. Cantor, the chief deputy Republican whip in the House, said the president ''reiterated our nation's noble but realistic goals for Iraq, highlighting a tough road that will not be completed soon.''
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the expected Democratic presidential candidate, continued his strategy of muting his criticism of the president's Iraq policies. Content to allow Mr. Bush to take the political heat for what is happening in Iraq, Mr. Kerry issued a mild statement noting that Mr. Bush had said little that was new and that the challenge now was to reach out to allies so the United States would not have to go it alone.
 Strategists in both parties were poring over the latest public polls, all of which showed Iraq taking a heavy toll on Mr. Bush's political standing. A CBS News poll found that Mr. Bush's approval rating for his handling of the war in Iraq had fallen to 34 percent, down five percentage points from two weeks ago and down from 72 percent a year ago. 
 For Democrats, the torrent of bad news from Iraq has had the effect of denting Mr. Bush's post-Sept. 11 aura as commander in chief and simultaneously drowning out good news on the economy that might otherwise put Mr. Bush in a more commanding position.
 But some Republicans said the situation in Iraq would only focus more attention on Mr. Kerry and what they said was his unsuitability to run the war on terrorism. The political implications for Mr. Bush would be limited, said Alan K. Simpson, the former Republican senator from Wyoming, because voters did not trust Mr. Kerry to provide any better answers.
 ''If it's a threat to his re-election, then the question is, What is the other guy saying?'' Mr. Simpson said. ''Out in the land -- and I travel all over -- people are saying, 'What's Kerry going to do about it? Got any new ideas, chum?' ''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush Speech on American Strategy in Iraq

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's address at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., yesterday evening, as recorded by The New York Times. A complete transcript is at nytimes.com/iraq.
 I've come here tonight to report to all Americans and to the Iraqi people on the strategy our nation is pursuing in Iraq, and the specific steps we're taking to achieve our goals.
 The actions of our enemies over the last few weeks have been brutal, calculating and instructive. We've seen a car bombing take the life of a 61-year-old Iraqi named Izzedin Salim, who was serving as president of the governing council. This crime shows our enemy's intention to prevent Iraqi self-government, even if that means killing a lifelong Iraqi patriot and a faithful Muslim. Mr. Salim was assassinated by terrorists seeking the return of tyranny and the death of democracy.
 We've also seen images of a young American facing decapitation. This vile display shows a contempt for all the rules of warfare and all the bounds of civilized behavior. It reveals a fanaticism that was not caused by any action of ours and would not be appeased by any concession.
 We suspect that the man with the knife was an Al Qaeda associate named Zarqawi. He and other terrorists know that Iraq is now the central front in the war on terror. And we must understand that as well.
 The return of tyranny to Iraq would be an unprecedented terrorist victory and a cause for killers to rejoice. It would also embolden the terrorists, leading to more bombings, more beheadings and more murders of the innocent around the world.
 The rise of a free and self-governing Iraq will deny terrorists a base of operation, discredit their narrow ideology and give momentum to reformers across the region. This will be a decisive blow to terrorism at the heart of its power, and a victory for the security of America and the civilized world.
 Our work in Iraq has been hard. Our coalition has faced changing conditions of war. And that has required perseverance, sacrifice and an ability to adapt.
 The swift removal of Saddam Hussein's regime last spring had an unintended effect. Instead of being killed or captured on the battlefield, some of Saddam's elite guards shed their uniforms and melted into the civilian population. 
 These elements of Saddam's repressive regime and secret police have reorganized, rearmed and adopted sophisticated terrorist tactics. They've linked up with foreign fighters and terrorists. In a few cities, extremists have tried to sow chaos and seize regional power for themselves. 
 These groups and individuals have conflicting ambitions, but they share a goal: They hope to wear out the patience of Americans, our coalition and Iraqis before the arrival of effective self-government and before Iraqis have the capability to defend their freedom. Iraq now faces a critical moment. As the Iraqi people move closer to governing themselves the terrorists are likely to become more active and more brutal. There are difficult days ahead. And the way forward may sometimes appear chaotic. Yet our coalition is strong. Our efforts are focused and unrelenting. And no power of the enemy will stop Iraq's progress. . . .
 There are five steps in our plan to help Iraq achieve democracy and freedom. We will hand over authority to a sovereign Iraqi government, help establish security, continue rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, encourage more international support and move toward a national election that will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi people.
 The first of these steps will occur next month when our coalition will transfer full sovereignty to a government of Iraqi citizens who will prepare the way for national elections. On June 30, the Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist and will not be replaced. The occupation will end and Iraqis will govern their own affairs. America's ambassador to Iraq, John Negroponte, will present his credentials to the new president of Iraq. Our embassy in Baghdad will have the same purpose as any other American embassy: to assure good relations with a sovereign nation. 
 America and other countries will continue to provide technical experts to help Iraq's ministries of government. But these ministries will report to Iraq's new prime minister.
 The United Nations special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is now consulting with a broad spectrum of Iraqis to determine the composition of this interim government. The special envoy intends to put forward the names of interim government officials this week.
 In addition to a president, two vice presidents and a prime minister, 26 Iraqi ministers will oversee government departments, from health to justice to defense.
 This new government will be advised by a national council, which will be chosen in July by Iraqis representing their country's diversity. This interim government will exercise full sovereignty until national elections are held.
 America fully supports Mr. Brahimi's efforts. And I have instructed the Coalition Provisional Authority to assist him in every way possible. . . .
 The second step in the plan for Iraqi democracy is to help establish the stability and security that democracy requires. Coalition forces and the Iraqi people have the same enemies: the terrorists, illegal militia and Saddam loyalists, who stand between the Iraqi people and their future as a free nation. Working as allies, we will defend Iraq and defeat these enemies.
 America will provide forces and support necessary for achieving these goals. Our commanders had estimated that a troop level below 115,000 would be sufficient at this point in the conflict. Given the recent increase in violence we'll maintain our troop level at the current 138,000 as long as necessary. . . .
 The third step in the plan for Iraqi democracy is to continue rebuilding that nation's infrastructure so that a free Iraq can quickly gain economic independence and a better quality of life. Our coalition has already helped Iraqis to rebuild schools and refurbish hospitals and health clinics, repair bridges, upgrade the electrical grid and modernize the communications system.
 And now a growing private economy is taking shape. A new currency has been introduced. Iraq's governing council approved a new law that opens the country to foreign investment for the first time in decades. Iraq has liberalized its trade policy. And today an Iraqi observer attends meetings of the World Trade Organization. Iraqi oil production has reached more than two million barrels per day, bringing revenues of nearly $6 billion so far this year, which is being used to help the people of Iraq. . . .
 The fourth step in our plan is to enlist additional international support for Iraq's transition. At every stage the United States has gone to the United Nations: to confront Saddam Hussein, the promise serious consequences for his actions and to begin Iraqi reconstruction. 
 Today the United States and Great Britain presented a new resolution in the Security Council to help move Iraq toward self-government. I've directed Secretary Powell to work with fellow members of the council to endorse the timetable the Iraqis have adopted, to express international support for Iraq's interim government, to reaffirm the world's security commitment to the Iraqi people and to encourage other U.N. members to join in the effort. . . .
 The fifth and most important step is free national elections to be held no later than next January. A United Nations team headed by Karina Pirelli is now in Iraq helping form an independent election commission that will oversee an orderly, accurate national election.
 In that election the Iraqi people will choose a transitional national assembly, the first freely elected, truly representative national governing body in Iraq's history. This assembly will serve as Iraq's legislature and it will choose a transitional government with executive powers. 
 The transitional national assembly will also draft a new constitution, which will be presented to the Iraqi people in a referendum scheduled for the fall of 2005. Under this new constitution Iraq will elect a permanent government by the end of next year.
 In this time of war and liberation and rebuilding, American soldiers and civilians on the ground have come to know and respect the citizens of Iraq. They are proud people who hold strong and diverse opinions. Yet Iraqis are united in a broad and deep conviction. They're determined never again to live at the mercy of a dictator. And they believe that a national election will put that dark time behind them.
 A representative government that protects basic rights, elected by Iraqis, is the best defense against the return of tyranny. And that election is coming.
 Completing the five steps to Iraqi elected self-government will not be easy. There is likely to be more violence before the transfer of sovereignty and after the transfer of sovereignty. The terrorists and Saddam loyalists would rather see many Iraqis die than have any live in freedom. But terrorists will not determine the future of Iraq. That nation is moving every week toward free elections and a permanent place among free nations. . . .
 I sent American troops to Iraq to defend our security, not to stay as an occupying power. I sent American troops to Iraq to make its people free, not to make them American. 
 Iraqis will write their own history and find their own way. As they do, Iraqis can be certain a free Iraq will always have a friend in the United States of America.

HEADLINE: In Latin America, a Cellular Need

BYLINE: By BRIAN ELLSWORTH

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, May 25 

 BODY:
Communicating with the outside world has never been easy for residents of Nueva Tacagua, a remote neighborhood on the outskirts of Caracas dotted with crumbling government housing, rickety sheet metal shacks and pools of sewage. The area is an arduous ride from the city along an isolated road, and telephone wires have never made it this far into the hills. 
 Yolimar Zambrano, who runs a makeshift store in her concrete block home, says staying in touch with friends and relatives has been a lot easier in the last year -- thanks to her cellphone. But Ms. Zambrano, 30, admits that she and her husband spend as much on monthly cellular service as they do on two weeks of groceries. 
 ''The signal doesn't even come in very well,'' she said, struggling to listen to voice messages, ''but it's the first time I've ever had a phone.''
 Ms. Zambrano is part of an explosion in cellphone use in Latin America that has linked millions. Subscribers jumped from fewer than 40 million in 1999 to 118 million today, turning one in five Latin Americans into a cellphone user and making this a $20.4 billion market, according to Pyramid Research in Cambridge, Mass. Economic powerhouses like Mexico and Brazil have the biggest number of subscribers, but competition is fierce here in Venezuela, where cellphones are both a status symbol and a necessity. 
 Even after its economy contracted 8.9 percent in 2002 and 9.4 percent in 2003, Venezuela still has Latin America's second-highest rate of cellphone use, after Chile.
 Driving the boom is an explosion in prepaid service that has made cellphones available to millions of low-income users, once excluded by monthly payments and credit checks. While in 1995 fewer than 2 percent of people in most Latin American countries had cellphones, the introduction of prepaid service has sent use skyrocketing, to 29 percent in Venezuela and 48 percent in Chile.
 ''Given Latin America's demographics, the cellular business couldn't take off until prepaid service made it possible'' for everyone, said Patrick Grenham, a telecommunications analyst with Citigroup Smith Barney in New York.
 Although the cost of prepaid service can be 10 times that of traditional service, it attracts clients whose incomes are frequently too erratic to make a monthly payment. 
 Also driving cellular growth is a system that charges users only for outgoing calls, allowing them to receive unlimited calls free -- and thus keep their phone active even when the budget is tight. 
 With the right cost structures, providers can turn a profit within a year, even from users who make only a few calls. While Latin America's cellular providers once depended on upper-class users, revenues come increasingly from millions of low-income clients.
 Fixed-line phones are found in close to 11 percent of Latin American households, according to figures from IDC, the research group. Many people simply do without fixed-line service to avoid large upfront payments, enormous delays and onerous monthly charges. To bring in users interested in having a home phone, providers in several countries now offer a home telephone that operates within a cellular network but at lower prepaid rates than mobiles.
 The business of prepaid services has considerable drawbacks, like declining use during hard times and the constant cycle of users whose service is cut off because of inactivity. Providers still rely largely on revenue from customers with credit cards, many of them now using a service that allows paying bills by phone and creating closed-circuit group conversations. 
 Latin America's cellular market is dominated by Telefonica Moviles of Spain and America Movil of Mexico, whose grip is likely to become even stronger. Led by the Mexican entrepreneur Carlos Slim Helu, the $7.5 billion America Movil owns Mexico's largest service provider and has more than 46 million subscribers in seven countries.
 Telefonica Moviles this year bought out BellSouth's cellular operations to give its Latin America subsidiary 41 million subscribers in 14 countries and potential revenue of $5.4 billion. 
 Telefonica Moviles will soon be operating Venezuela's leading provider, Telcel, which is battling for market position with Movilnet (owned by the Venezuelan telephone company CANTV) and Digitel (backed by Telecom Italia Mobile). Venezuela today has over 6 million cellular subscribers, and Telefonica Moviles expects this to reach 12 million within five years. 
 Status seems to play a big part in Venezuelans' use of cellphones. ''Venezuelans have always needed a public way to show their status,'' said the Venezuelan sociologist Leoncio Barrios. ''Thirty years ago, people would buy the fanciest car on the lot. But since times are tougher now, the best alternative is to have the newest mobile phone clipped to your belt.'' 
 Venezuelans have become increasingly creative in getting more bang for their mobile buck.
 Text messaging allows virtual conversations that cost much less than a call. The average Venezuelan cellular user sends 113 text messages a month, many between teenagers with too little money for calls. Providers sometimes face losses from text messaging, which can eat into profits by replacing calls.
 ''We have a phone in the house, but I'd rather send text messages to my friends,'' said Andreina Valerio, 13, who lives in the 23 de Enero neighborhood, a poor part of Caracas. She said this saves her money, but sheepishly admitted that her text messaging cost her parents more than $45 last month. 
 Dozens of Venezuelan radio and television programs allow users to participate in surveys or send in their opinions through text messages. The Miss Venezuela pageant, for example, allowed viewers (for 50 cents a message) to send suggestions for new beauty queen categories last year. 
 Cellphones have also been a boon to thousands of enterprising Venezuelans who buy prepaid phone time in bulk, then rent their cellphones by the minute, charging only 20 percent of what most users pay for a minute of service.
 Gregorio Mayta, 33, who shut his carpentry business last year for lack of work, now sells calls on the Sabana Grande Boulevard in Caracas from seven cellphones displayed on a plastic picnic table.
 ''When business slowed down, I started selling the extra minutes on my calling plan,'' he said. ''These days it makes more than carpentry.''
 Mr. Mayta spends over $200 a month to buy the cheapest prepaid minutes in bulk, then resells them in the form of one- or two-minute conversations purchased by an average of 500 customers a day. 
 But these alternatives have not damped Venezuelans' craving to have a mobile in hand -- even in areas of severe poverty like Nueva Tacagua, where cellular service is more consistent than running water. 
 For Yobran Nieves, the husband of Ms. Zambrano from Nueva Tacagua, cellular service is worth the sacrifice it entails. ''I feel like I'm getting robbed every time I put money into this thing,'' said Mr. Nieves, 25, scrolling through color pictures of the Eiffel Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge on the screen of his $375 mobile phone. ''But I still like having it.''

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Up Slightly; Sales of Existing Homes Climb

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose less than expected this month as record gasoline prices and developments in Iraq tempered optimism about jobs, the Conference Board said yesterday. In another report, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes jumped in April to the second-highest on record. 
 ''Consumer attitudes are really being tested right now,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn. ''These forces are battling to a standstill, so that confidence measures are stable.'' 
 The New York-based Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 93.2 from a revised 93 in April.
 Home resales unexpectedly rose 2.5 percent, to an annual pace of 6.64 million, the National Association of Realtors said. 
 The gain of 288,000 jobs in April capped the biggest two-month increase in four years. That and other signs of economic expansion have pushed up interest rates, which economists said might be encouraging some Americans to buy homes sooner than they planned. At the same time, high gasoline prices have siphoned money that consumers might have spent on other goods and services. 
 Economists had expected the confidence index would rise to 94 this month, based on the median of 60 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey, from April's previously reported reading of 92.9. The index averaged 103 in the record expansion from 1991 to 2001. 
 Sales of existing homes were forecast to slip to a 6.46 million annual rate from 6.48 million in March, based on the median of 56 estimates. The median selling price in April was $176,000, up from $164,100 in April 2003, the association said in Washington. 
 ''High energy prices, a hesitating stock market and troubling news in Iraq are probably weighing on consumers' minds,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. 
 Mr. Stanley predicts growth in consumer spending will slow to a 2.5 percent annual rate this quarter compared with a 3.8 percent pace last quarter.
 ''Look for the growth in consumer spending to remain decent but not to pick up along with labor income,'' he said. ''Instead, the impetus for growth this year should come on the business side.'' 
 The Conference Board surveys 5,000 households each month about general economic conditions, their employment prospects and their spending plans. The index component that tracks consumers' expectations for the next six months rose to 95.2 from 94.8. A gauge of optimism about the present situation slipped to 90.3 this month from 90.4 in April. 
 Gains were held back by a mixed outlook for employment. The percentage of consumers who saw jobs as hard to get now increased to 30.6 from 28, the highest since December. Yet the percentage who saw jobs as plentiful rose to 16.6 this month, the highest since July 2002, compared with 15.6 in April. Over the next six months, 19.2 percent foresaw more jobs being available, up from 18.3 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Atlantic Center With the Customer in Mind

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The Atlantic Center mall is not like other malls. 
 Instead of open, multilevel atriums where dozens of storefronts are easily captured by the naked consumerist eye, there are vast expanses of nothingness and dead corridors leading, it seems, to nowhere. In place of furnished common areas offering respite between purchasing bouts, there are broad stretches of shiny institutional floor tile and walls left bare save a hodgepodge of clown-colored signs advertising stores that no longer exist, or that cannot be reached without wending a route of circuitous switchbacks, or leaving the structure entirely. 
 And rather than the soothing strains of generic background music or the burbling of a water feature, there is the endless refrain of questions from dazed and confused would-be shoppers: Can you get to Pathmark this way? Have you seen an A.T.M. anywhere? Where is the D.M.V.?
 Although critics have long called the mall an eyesore and complained about its seemingly incoherent design, there are reasons for its structure and layout, reasons embedded in both the perception and the reality of race, class, economics and crime in late 20th-century Brooklyn. 
 Planned and built in the early 1990's, when the area there -- at the crossroads of Fort Greene, Prospect Heights and Downtown Brooklyn -- was just beginning to emerge from a cocoon of high crime and bleak prospects, the center was intended not as an oasis but as the target of a kind of consumer dive-bombing: customers would dart into one place, grab what they needed and quickly leave. 
 The isolation of stores and lack of gathering locations inside the building was intentional, said its developer, Bruce Ratner of Forest City Ratner, driven by the needs of skittish national retailers and the notion that urban malls had failed because they became magnets for loitering teenagers who frightened the shoppers away. 
 ''It's a problem of malls in dense urban areas that kids hang out there, and it's not too positive for shopping,'' Mr. Ratner said. ''Look, here you're in an urban area, you're next to projects, you've got tough kids.'' 
 Adding that it was not an issue of class or ethnicity, he said: ''You know it's kids that cut school. In the burbs, a 15-year-old can't get to the mall without his parents. Here, it's a little different.''
 As a result, the stores draw shoppers who often find themselves lost in a maze of nondescript corridors interrupted by the occasional sign pointing to a shuttered business or an indeterminate location. ''It's difficult, the way that the mall is situated,'' said Dianne Smith, who works at the Marshalls on the second floor. ''You have to go out or go around. I heard a lot of people say that the way the mall is made up is kind of weird.''
 But now, as Mr. Ratner battles heated opposition for his grand plan to bring a Nets arena to the area, he is trying to fix some of what seems wrong with the Atlantic Center. Although there is little that can be done to the layout itself, there is plenty that can make it more inviting and easier to navigate, Mr. Ratner and his associates said. 
 The changes should also better integrate it with the Atlantic Terminal mall, which will occupy floors below offices in a new building atop the Long Island Rail Road station at Flatbush Avenue near Atlantic Avenue. 
 ''We decided to redo the interior and do as best we could with the exterior,'' Mr. Ratner said. ''Honestly, it isn't beautiful. It's not architecturally outstanding. It's kept clean, and we do try and take care of it. It's not as bad as a strip center in the burbs, I mean, but it's not something that we would build again.''
 Back before it was built, the site, part of an area designated for urban renewal, was altogether different. Desolate at night, the neighborhood was known for drug dealing and prostitution; a hotel for the homeless, the Brooklyn Arms, was there as well, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose housing subsidiary developed homes there.
 Times were also shaky economically. Kenneth K. Fisher, the former city councilman who represented downtown Brooklyn, said it was difficult to convince businesses that the area would draw their target customers. 
 ''You would bring investors over the Brooklyn Bridge,'' he said, ''and they would only see the color of people's skin on Fulton Street, and they didn't see the color of their American Express cards.'' (In fact, executives at Forest City Ratner said, the mall is now doing $580 in sales per square foot, higher than the average American mall.)
 Mr. Ratner said it took near-Herculean efforts of persuasion, plus low rents and say in how the mall was designed, to bring in the original tenants, mainly big box retailers selling a variety of discount goods. So creating a perception of safety was paramount, Forest City Ratner executives said. (Forest City Ratner is The New York Times Company's partner in developing the new Times headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.)As crime has fallen, though, the company has become more adept at policing its property, and executives have realized that customers visiting the Atlantic Center want to shop at more than one store. So the developers have revisited some of the old assumptions and are altering the design. 
 Outside, executives said, many of the more garish elements, like the center's enormous blue-and-beige A logos and multicolored signs, will come off. The outside will be painted to match the brick and terra cotta colors of the Bank of New York building that houses the Atlantic Terminal across the street. 
 Entrances will be more clearly marked, and awnings will be added to create a pedestrian corridor outside. Plans also call for new columns with clearer and more tasteful directional signs.
 It remains to be seen if the changes, scheduled for completion in July when the Atlantic Terminal is set to open, can quell the criticism and calls for demolition.
 ''It's not very hospitable, and it's not very open and inviting,'' said Letitia James, a city councilwoman representing the Fort Greene-Clinton Hill area. ''And because of the way it's constructed, it's not like malls that you see in other parts of the city or in the suburbs. I'm hoping and praying the Bank of New York building will be a little bit more inviting and more welcoming to the community.''
 On a recent Friday afternoon, some shoppers echoed that complaint. ''From the other level you've got to walk all the way down just to go to Circuit City,'' said Dionne Goodridge-Primo, who works at a Target store and who was sprinting toward the Burlington Coat Factory through a third-floor corridor. ''That shouldn't be.'' To go between the two stores, she said, ''You've got to go back the other way. I've never seen, like, a directory. I was at the D.M.V. and saw a sign for Burlington. That's the only way I'd known that Burlington was there.''
 But others like the mall just the way it is. ''I live closer to Kings Plaza, and I think this is a better environment than that,'' said Steven Green, a dentist. ''I've been here over the years, and it's never crowded, it's clean, neat, friendly and the stores have a better variety, I think.'' Even the long passageways between stores are a plus: ''I like to walk,'' he said, ''so it doesn't bother me.''

HEADLINE: Good Teachers + Small Classes = Quality Education

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
The secret to quality public education has never been a big mystery. You need good teachers and you need small enough classes so those teachers can do their work. Period. After that, everything seems to pale, including the testing accountability programs, technology, building conditions. Even curriculum seems secondary, as our best public colleges demonstrate. We have West Point and we have Berkeley, and the question isn't which has the correct curriculum; the question is which curriculum is the best fit for the student and teacher.
 Parents get this. Joe Gipson, a black parent from Sacramento who feels that black students are too often shortchanged, told me the best thing that happened to his children's school was the California law capping class size at 20 through third grade. You can still have incompetent teachers, he said, but with small classes you can spot them faster and weed them out. 
 Good teachers and small classes. Those were the two main factors New York's highest court cited last year when it ruled that the state had financially shortchanged New York City schools.
 The state must provide more money, the court ruled, so the city can afford to attract more good teachers and improve classroom conditions, particularly reducing class size.
 Michael Rebell, the lead lawyer for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which brought the suit on behalf of the city's poor children, says that research has shown it's hard to attract the best teachers until you have good working conditions. And the crucial element for good working conditions? ''Small class size,'' he says.
 In the original 2001 trial court opinion, Judge Leland DeGrasse put it succinctly: ''The advantages of small classes are clear. A teacher in a small class has more time to spend with each student. Fewer students mean fewer administrative tasks for each teacher. Student discipline and student engagement in the learning process improve in smaller classes.''
 There were 72 witnesses and 4,300 exhibits for the trial, but as Leonie Haimson, a parent advocate, says, the most important piece of evidence may have been a single table showing how much larger classes are in New York City than the rest of the state. In middle school -- when so many children are lost -- city classes averaged 28 versus 21 statewide.
 Academic studies show small class size carries many benefits, even mitigating racial problems that interfere with learning. A recent study by Tom Dee, a Swarthmore professor, in ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'' concluded that both white and black children achieved more when they were taught by teachers of their own race. This is bad news for black children since the vast majority of teachers, even in big cities, are white and the vast majority of urban children -- 85 percent in New York City -- are minority. 
 But there is a hopeful exception. If classes are small, Dr. Dee found, black children do equally well with a white or black teacher. ''It may be because there's more personal interaction, less chance for stereotyping,'' Dr. Dee said.
 Market forces tell us that small class size is worth a lot. Well-to-do parents pay for private schools with good teachers and small classes. At Horace Mann in the Bronx, a leading private school, tuition is $25,000 and class size averages 15 in the middle grades, or half of what it is in nearby public middle schools.
 So what's the obstacle to small class size? Money, of course. New York's top court did not specify how much was needed and the politicians have spent the last year creating committees that have concluded that city schools need $2 billion to $6 billion more a year in operating funds. Similar cases in other states have dragged on for years. The New York case took 10 years to get through the courts, with Gov. George E. Pataki fighting it every step of the way.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is losing patience, as well he should. Having made his own billions in the private sector, he understands that quality costs. He estimates city schools need $5.3 billion from the state in extra yearly operating funds and $6.5 billion more in construction aid. Smaller class size requires more classrooms, and many city schools are overcrowded.
 Which raises the question: Are we as a people willing to pay the price -- are we willing to sign the social contract -- to give city children more good teachers and small classes?
 The answer is supposed to be the federal No Child Left Behind law, passed in 2002. It mandates that every American child be proficient in reading and math by 2014, that the achievement gap between white and black be eliminated once and for all.
 To do this, President Bush's budget calls for spending $13 billion for all Title I poverty schools in America. In other words, what Mayor Bloomberg says he needs extra for the New York City schools is what the president has offered for all the nation's poor schools.
 At heart, leaving no child behind is about eliminating poverty's effects. To President Lyndon B. Johnson, that meant war -- a war on poverty -- since war is the best model we have for the kind of mobilization it would take. We understand that military wars cost; that's why the president has asked Congress for an extra $25 billion for Iraq.
 And for the education war? All the rhetoric and data are in place for the education war: high standards, tough accountability, disaggregated data by the truckload. But financing?
 No Child Left Behind is superb at finding fault. It has labeled a third of America's schools failing. It has labeled over half of New York City's middle schools failing. Within a few years, almost all city middle schools are expected to carry that label. Fine, fail them all. But where is the money from the states and the federal government to arm city schools with small classes and more good teachers?
 Blaming public schools, their principals and teachers for losing the education war feels a lot like blaming the ground troops for losing the Vietnam War. Are we committed to an education war? Do we have the will? I fear that the late Walt Kelly, creator of the comic strip Pogo, had it right: We have met the enemy and he is us.

HEADLINE: Business Deal Is Examined For Rowland the Consultant

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., May 25 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors have a deposition that could shed a sliver of light on why John G. Rowland was paid $35,000 by a wealthy businessman before his election as Connecticut's governor.
 The businessman, Robert V. Matthews, who has emerged as an important figure in the investigations of Governor Rowland, was asked in a deposition he gave in a civil lawsuit in 2002 about any business deals he may have had with Mr. Rowland personally over the years. 
 He said Mr. Rowland worked for him as a consultant and that he possibly reimbursed him for travel expenses for his help in a business deal. He never mentioned the $35,000 figure, but said there were no other business deals between them, raising questions about whether he left out crucial details in his testimony about his dealings with Mr. Rowland. 
 The Hartford Courant reported on Sunday that Mr. Matthews made a $35,000 payment to Mr. Rowland in July 1993, but it did not identify the reason for the transaction. A lawyer for Mr. Matthews, Hubert J. Santos, on Monday would say only that the money changed hands in a business deal before Mr. Rowland became governor in 1995. 
 ''It was a private business transaction between Mr. Matthews and the governor, when he was out of office,'' Mr. Santos said. He stressed that Mr. Rowland ''was not in Congress and he was not governor.''
 Mr. Rowland, a United States congressman and a rising star in the Republican Party, lost his first bid for governor in 1990 to Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent. Mr. Rowland spent the next four years in the private sector as a consultant before succeeding Mr. Weicker in 1994. Mr. Matthews was one of many names on Mr. Rowland's client roster in those years.
 Mr. Matthews has recently attracted the attention of federal prosecutors for his role in renting and selling the governor's condominium in Washington in 1996 and 1997, and for having the governor stay free for five days at his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2001.
 Mr. Matthews answered questions about any payments he might have made to Mr. Rowland while under oath in a deposition taken in December 2002. The testimony was taken in connection with a lawsuit that Mr. Matthews had brought against a former client, Pinnacle Foods. 
 Mr. Matthews had charged the Pennsylvania-based meat-packing company with breach of contract for failing to pay him 2.2 million shares of its stock he said he was owed for having promised to help the company in its quest for $10 million in economic development funds from Connecticut.
 When Connecticut officials only offered $2 million in April 2001, the company rejected the state's offer. It also decided against moving into one of Mr. Matthews's commercial buildings in New Haven, despite an invitation from Governor Rowland to move to Connecticut that the company received over the phone while Mr. Rowland and Mr. Matthews were playing golf.
 The company found money elsewhere and, after several business reversals, had its assets seized by another company and entered into litigation. Mr. Matthews's earlier claim against Pinnacle was settled in his favor when the parties agreed to a $2.2 million judgment. But with the company's troubles, a lawyer familiar with the case said he has yet to collect.
 Conducting the questioning on Dec. 4, 2002, was Steven M. Greenspan of Day, Berry & Howard, who was representing Pinnacle. Representing Mr. Matthews was Elizabeth J. Robbin of Rogin, Nassau, Caplan, Lassman & Hirtle in Hartford.
 According to a 200-page transcript of the deposition, Mr. Greenspan asked Mr. Matthews whether he had ''ever been involved in any business deal of any kind with the governor in his personal capacity, not in his capacity as the governor of the State of Connecticut.''
 Mr. Matthews answered, ''Yes.''
 ''How many times?'' Mr. Greenspan asked.
 Mr. Matthews replied: ''Well, he was kind of a consultant. I think we hired him to work on some -- I think we were trying to buy Katharine Gibbs schools, and he was a consultant when he wasn't a governor or a congressman, and I don't know if he did anything else besides that.''
 Mr. Matthews had trouble remembering details, but asserted that Mr. Rowland put in time on the deal. ''I remember he maybe talked to some people in Washington about it,'' Mr. Matthews said.
 Mr. Matthews testified that their agreement was never put in writing. He said he believed he had paid Mr. Rowland, even though another suitor snapped up the chain of seven training schools in early 1994. ''I can't imagine he just did it as a friend,'' Mr. Matthews testified. ''I'm sure we paid his travel and something.''
 Mr. Greenspan then asked whether there were ever other joint business deals or potential business deals with Mr. Rowland, ''aside from the Katharine Gibbs school potential.''
 ''No,'' Mr. Matthews answered.
 Such depositions are not ordinarily part of the court record. But federal prosecutors who are investigating the governor have subpoenaed copies of that and other records as part of their interest in Mr. Matthews.

HEADLINE: A Fragile Victim of Love Long Past

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
A sorcerer named Laura Linney is performing an act of magic that happens only in live theater. She has rewritten a play without changing a word. Ms. Linney, as you probably know, is not a writer but an actress. Yet her emotional incandescence in the revival of ''Sight Unseen,'' which opened last night at the Biltmore Theater, has the effect of entirely shifting the focus of Donald Margulies's fine drama from 1992 about art, time and moral compromise.
 Theatergoers who saw ''Sight Unseen'' a dozen years ago probably left the show thinking that it was about a charismatically egocentric painter who had sold his soul to that old devil success. Audiences for this latest production from the Manhattan Theater Club are likely to conclude that it is about a charismatically uncertain woman, played by Ms. Linney, who erases her very sense of self through her love for an egocentric painter. 
 It should be noted that it was surely not the intention of Ms. Linney, an actress of uncommon modesty, to relocate the center of ''Sight Unseen.'' But because she gives the one unconditionally authentic performance in this production, directed by Daniel Sullivan, her character becomes the prism through which everything is refracted.
 Admittedly, this creates a lopsidedness that is not to the play's advantage. Still, anyone who has followed Ms. Linney's increasingly impressive career onstage (''The Crucible'') and in film (''You Can Count on Me,'' ''Mystic River'') should make a point of seeing her here. Actually, make that anyone who savors acting that is paradoxically clear to the point of transparency and as subtle as shadows at twilight.
 Ms. Linney was also in the original New York staging of ''Sight Unseen,'' in a different, smaller part: that of Grete, a fierce German critic who turns an interview with the American painter Jonathan Waxman (first played by Dennis Boutsikaris) into a shrewd attack on his identity as artist, American and Jew. The interview scenes are what most people who saw the show then remember most vividly.
 In this new production, Jonathan is played by a nebbishy Ben Shenkman and Grete by Ana Reeder, who brings her own clawed kittenishness to the role. It's still a pretty compelling encounter. But it doesn't make half the impression as do the scenes of Jonathan's reunion after 15 years with Patricia (Ms. Linney), his lover from their college years.
 Part of this has to do with changing times. In 1992 the economic boom of the 1980's in American art was still a fresh and sore subject, as was the ascendancy of the hotshot celebrity artist. Grete's interview with Jonathan, set in a London gallery, had a sting of topical satire that has lost its immediacy.
 But Mr. Margulies, the author of ''The Loman Family Picnic'' and ''Dinner With Friends,'' has never been merely a satirist. His plays are usually about how time and memory transform feelings, relationships and the perception of the past. In scrambling chronology to consider the life and losses of Jonathan Waxman, ''Sight Unseen'' becomes a commentary on the sacrifices entailed in getting older and getting ahead.
 The essential problem with this production, which features handsome sets by Douglas W. Schmidt, is its Jonathan. In fairness to Mr. Shenkman, who appeared memorably on Broadway in ''Proof'' and in the television version of ''Angels in America,'' he has two ghosts to contend with: that of the performance given by Mr. Boutsikaris and of the performance that wasn't given by the brilliant Liev Schreiber, who was originally cast for the revival and is an expert in defining moral shadiness. Mr. Shenkman exudes an effortless naturalism but is so low key that he seems at moments to dematerialize. This is in some ways appropriate to a character who has become disorientingly detached from who he was. But what Mr. Boutsikaris provided that Mr. Shenkman does not was the sensual fierceness and cruelty of ravening ambition.
 In Mr. Shenkman's scenes with Ms. Linney -- set in the rustic farmhouse Patricia shares with her husband, Nick (Byron Jennings), an archaeologist -- her character's frustration and resentment are intensified by your impression that she is trying to milk responses from a human vacuum. It doesn't help that the usually impeccable Mr. Jennings brings an exaggerated comic vehemence to the part of the surly husband.
 Still, you can't dismiss a show that allows Ms. Linney to create such a beautifully shaded study in unhappiness. (Deborah Hedwall, by the way, was excellent in the same part in the original production, but because of Mr. Boutsikaris's high-voltage performance did not stand out in the same way.)
 Ms. Linney has a rare gift for suggesting that what her characters do and say is at odds with their deeper feelings. Arms folded, chin high and mouth set in a willful smile, her Patricia greets Jonathan, a man who used her badly, with the look of someone who knows she has the upper hand but also doesn't have the strength to take advantage of it. In her mind, she lost the battle of her life long ago.
 In the final scene Mr. Margulies transports Patricia and Jonathan to the moment of their first encounter, when she was a model and he an art student. When I first saw ''Sight Unseen,'' this conclusion seemed to coast a little too smoothly on the ready-made resonance of young, idealistic characters destined to tarnish.
 This time, though, the same scene broke my heart, as Ms. Linney evoked an openness and fragility that clearly harbored the seeds of its own destruction. Ms. Linney, who lives in Manhattan, recently said in an interview that she would probably soon move to Los Angeles. As good as she is on screen, let's pray that this actress -- whose natural theatrical grace brings to mind Meryl Streep, a star long lost to movies -- doesn't deprive New York audiences of another rare presence that lights up a stage.

HEADLINE: Witness at Tyco Trial Testifies She Received No-Interest Loan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A human resources administrator at Tyco International, who helped run the employee relocation program that lent Mark A. Belnick, the former general counsel, $15 million, testified yesterday at Mr. Belnick's trial that she also received a no-interest loan.
 The administrator, Gina Spencer, told jurors that Tyco's former finance chief, Mark H. Swartz, telephoned her in 2001 to offer her a no-interest mortgage on her house in Boca Raton, Fla. Ms. Spencer had moved there from Massachusetts in 1999, when Tyco transferred some offices to Boca Raton. 
 ''At that point, I had no reason to think that it wasn't O.K.,'' Ms. Spencer said.
 Testifying on cross-examination, Ms. Spencer later admitted that she had signed a false loan document for a subsequent move. 
 Mr. Belnick is charged with falsifying records to hide almost $15 million in no-interest loans. His lawyers contend that such borrowing was routine at Tyco and did not need to be reported to the company or to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Belnick, 57, is accused of lying about the loans on company questionnaires used to prepare S.E.C. filings. Prosecutors say the money financed moves from Harrison, N.Y., to Manhattan, and later to Park City, Utah, where Tyco had no offices. Defense lawyer Reid Weingarten said in his opening statement that L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief executive, personally gave Mr. Belnick permission to work from Utah.
 Mr. Belnick is also accused of taking an illegal $17 million bonus and of stock fraud. 
 Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz were on trial in New York for six months, accused of looting Tyco of more than $600 million. The case ended in a mistrial in April. Prosecutors in the Belnick case say he got the bonus and loans as rewards for covering up wrongdoing by his boss.
 Ms. Spencer testified on Thursday that she initially refused the 2001 loan offer from Mr. Swartz and asked her boss, the human resources director, Patricia Prue, if it was ''kosher.''
 ''She said yes it was, and I'd be crazy not to do it,'' Ms. Spencer testified.
 A year later Ms. Spencer moved about a mile away and asked Mr. Swartz if she could ''roll over'' the loan to cover her new house, she said yesterday. Mr. Swartz told her she could, she testified.
 Ms. Spencer told jurors that she had signed a document in connection with the loan that indicated the move was required by Tyco, which was not true.

HEADLINE: Worries Rise Over the Loss Of Arts Focus At Ground Zero

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
With needed fund-raisers backing away and decision making stalled on the cultural component of a redeveloped World Trade Center site, a growing chorus of critics are questioning the effectiveness of the process and whether the project has gone off track.
 Lost in the debate over whether an opera house can fill its off-season or whether a dance and theater space could together attract sufficient funds, some arts leaders and planning experts say, is the more fundamental question of whether either of these options lives up to the grand plans for Lower Manhattan's hallowed ground.
 ''How can the arts over time express the meaning and importance of what's happened here: that is the challenge,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. 
 Since 112 cultural institutions made proposals for ground zero in September, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation -- with New York City and the state -- selected 15 finalists in February, with two main candidates emerging: New York City Opera and a combination of the Joyce Theater, which presents dance, and the Signature Theater Company, which focuses on one playwright a season. A Museum of Freedom, details of which remain vague, is also expected to be picked for the site. 
 In requesting proposals the development corporation said that it was ''in search of cultural institutions that will establish and maintain Lower Manhattan as a world-class cultural destination,'' one that ''will honor and celebrate life while providing an appropriate setting for remembrance.''
 While no one argues with these goals, there is sharp disagreement about how to achieve them. Should a new performing arts center provide entertainment designed to appeal to international tourists? Neighborhood services for Lower Manhattan residents? Or a prestigious destination that would lure cultural New Yorkers downtown? 
 Similar disagreements surrounding the overall aims for rebuilding at ground zero sent the development corporation back to the drawing board in creating a master plan in July 2002. After public outcry that rejected the first round of designs as uninspired and overly influenced by business interests, new designs were solicited and displayed for all to see at the World Financial Center. 
 The cultural competition has been more closely guarded. The development corporation has not made the proposals available to the press or the public. This has left cultural organizations unclear about why they were eliminated and the public almost entirely excluded from the evaluation process. 
 Rick Gell, who submitted a proposal for ground zero, said he had not heard anything from the development corporation. Mr. Gell, the founder and former president of Second Line Search, a New York-based film research and licensing company, had proposed a Moving Image Museum of New York, which could include such things as archives from the WPIX News Collection and home movies of the trade center attacks. ''Why has this been such a secretive process, outside of the public view?'' Mr. Gell said. ''Is moving the City Opera the best thing for New York -- simply transplanting an existing institution as opposed to creating a new one?
 ''Does a Museum of Freedom serve local residents? What did the New-York Historical Society propose, and don't New Yorkers have a right to know before the decision is made? I believe in my concept, but wonder whether other good ideas are being pushed aside by politics and money?''
 The historical society proposed a museum with several other institutions, including the Museum of the City of New York, the New York State Museum, the New York City Police Museum and the New York City Fire Museum.
 Some say the main criterion should be what is best for New York, not what will lure tourists. ''I have a favorite saying: If you do it for the local, the visitor will come,'' said Roberta Brandes Gratz, a member of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University who is also an adviser to the mayor, said an opera house is not in the city's interests. ''This should be designed to help Lower Manhattan, not to help a cultural organization,'' he said. ''The demographics of City Opera don't coincide with Lower Manhattan's future.''
 But others say that a big, established institution like City Opera is necessary if ground zero is to become a major cultural magnet. Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, said the bigger the performing arts center, the better ''to be able to compete with other cities.''
 Deborah Borda, president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which recently moved into the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, said a stage like hers can be an economic engine. Disney Hall has helped spur a potential $1.2 billion development project in downtown Los Angeles.
 ''Because there are so many independent and smaller dance companies, I think to go for the larger gesture makes sense, particularly with the goal of urban development,'' Ms. Borda said. 
 City Opera proposed a 2,200-seat auditorium, which it said could be shared by major dance companies. 
 ''It seems to us that what New York needs is a theater that can house performing arts organizations from all over the world as part of its season,'' said Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of City Opera. ''If City Opera acts as an anchor tenant, we want to be able to present large international companies that would bring a kind of new life and vitality to the performing arts in New York.''
 The Joyce and the Signature -- whose separate proposals have been combined by the development corporation -- have suggested four theaters under the same roof, one at 900 to 1,000 seats for the Joyce and three for the Signature ranging from 99 to 499 seats. 
 ''Any organization that's down there has to be reflective of the larger cultural dynamic,'' said James Naughton, the artistic director of the Signature. 
 The development corporation originally said it would announce a decision by early May. Instead the process has become bogged down and some of those involved describe an impasse they predict can be broken only by the governor.
 Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is also involved in downtown redevelopment, Gov. George E. Pataki is widely expected to have the final word on what happens at ground zero. It was Mr. Pataki who asked Sanford I. Weill, the financier, and Jerry I. Speyer, the developer, to lead the foundation charged with fund-raising for the memorial and cultural buildings. The two declined, extending the search, which some say has delayed the decision on a cultural component.

HEADLINE: Bold Urban Planning

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Though I appreciate the misgivings about a new stadium expressed in your May 19 editorial, there is a philosophical misstep regarding New York City's current road to post-9/11 redemption.
 Manhattan is experiencing a literally bottom-up rejuvenation of its urban land-use debate and its determination to realize complex works of contemporary architecture.
 Instead of focusing on how the city ''should quickly rethink its proposal to build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan,'' you should encourage efforts to innovatively design and integrate crucial infrastructure. Ideas need to be explored in the depth they deserve, instead of shot down as they are proposed.
 Tragedy has inspired us to seek redemptive designs for New York City; let's not make a tragedy of falling back on old habits of criticism without construction and construction without criticism.

COK, ANDRES

 BODY:
 COK--Andres. Beloved husband of Violeta, revered father of Silvia and Vivian, respected father-in-law of Manny Wong, passed away on May 23rd in a swimming accident in Miami Beach, FL. He was 84. Andres was loved and respected by all those who were fortunate to know him during his full and interesting life. Happiest when surrounded by his five grandchildren: Olivia, Sabrina, and Marissa Wong, of Miami, FL; and Andrew and Jacqueline Chang, of Fresh Meadows, NY, he cherished his family and friends. Andres spent his early years in his hometown village of Toi San, in southern China. Fleeing the ravages of the Sino-Japanese conflict in 1939, he joined his brother Gustavo in Havana, Cuba. After finishing his studies and completing a stint as assistant secretary to the Chinese Ambassador in Venezuela, he returned to Havana where he established himself as an entrepreneur, owning and managing a food market in La Vibora, a suburb of Havana, and marrying Violeta Pons, the love of his life, with whom he shared fifty-one years of marriage. In 1960, Andres once again uprooted himself and his family to seek ideological and economic freedom away from Fidel Castro's oppressive regime, this time making one final and decisive journey to New York City. After a persistent and laborious start, he simultaneously built up a soy and rice products business, while developing a strong presence in NYC's Chinatown community. He served several terms as President of the CubanChinese Association as well as the Toi San High School Alumni Association, engaging their members in many charitable and communityoriented activities. 
Having touched the hearts and minds of many, Andres will be dearly missed. The family will receive friends at Wah Wing Sang Funeral Home at 26 Mulberry St. in New York City on Monday, May 31st. A graveside ceremony and burial will take place the following day at noon at Evergreen Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to one's favorite charity.

HEADLINE: Kerry Says He Would Clear the Air With American Allies

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., May 25 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, denounced the Bush administration here on Tuesday for conducting a foreign policy of ''arrogance and ineptness'' and argued that only a new president could ''clear the air'' with the United States' allies.
 Mr. Kerry also asserted, in response to a question from a high school student about the possibility of another military draft, ''If you elect me president of the United States, I will give us a foreign policy that absolutely makes it unnecessary to have a draft in this nation.''
 He accused the Bush administration of ''running a kind of clandestine draft'' that ''turned the National Guard and the Reserve into almost active duty.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's comments came at a forum billed as a discussion of high gasoline prices and the need for energy independence. He asserted that drivers were paying a ''Saudi-George Bush gasoline tax'' because of the administration's mishandling of energy policy. But the audience quickly turned its questions to Iraq, one day after President Bush began a new effort to explain and justify his policies there, in the face of continued turmoil in the region and doubts at home.
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, denounced Mr. Kerry's remarks as another ''in a series of gratuitous political attacks'' intended to cover up his lack of a vision for Iraq. ''John Kerry, rather than explaining his indecision and vacillation regarding the war on terror, routinely resorts to political attacks,'' Mr. Schmidt said.
 Mr. Kerry told his audience that in fact he had no personal quarrel with Mr. Bush, whom he described as ''a nice man.'' But he asserted that the stakes could not be higher in this election, nor the choices starker.
 When one man asked if it was realistic to think that a new president could begin anew in the Middle East, Mr. Kerry responded, ''I believe it will take a new president of the United States to clear the air, to re-establish American credibility in the world and to be able to reach out to leaders not just in the Middle East but all over the world.''
 Mr. Kerry said that after 20 years in the Senate, particularly on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he had had many relationships with leaders around the world. ''I believe I could sit down with them at a level of trust that would allow us to begin an entirely new dialogue,'' he said.
 This trip to Portland and Seattle marked Mr. Kerry's second visit to the Pacific Northwest in a little over a week, reflecting the region's political importance to the Democrats. 
 At a fund-raiser in Portland on Tuesday night, before a cheering crowd of several hundred Democratic donors, Mr. Kerry continued his attack, egged on by shouts of ''Throw him out!'' as he made his case against Mr. Bush. ''We're proud of our troops,'' the senator said. ''And we're proud of what they're doing for their country. But they deserve leadership that's as good as they are.''
 Mr. Kerry said he believed that ''this is the most arrogant, reckless and ideological foreign policy ever pursued in the modern times of our country.'' He also declared that ''not for one instant am I going to let these armchair patriots in Washington define for us our rights and our ability to question the direction of this nation.''
 Mr. Kerry crossed a milestone Tuesday, officially launching the new, and larger, campaign plane that will carry him through November. At a rally at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Tuesday morning, before heading west, Mr. Kerry compared his new plane to the aircraft that he and other soldiers used to see flying overhead in South Vietnam, ferrying troops into the country, carrying the lucky ones home again. The soldiers called them ''freedom birds,'' he recalled.
 ''This is my freedom bird now,'' Mr. Kerry said. 
 Despite his lacerating criticism of Mr. Bush's foreign policy, Mr. Kerry shied from direct questions about Mr. Bush's speech on Iraq. He said he would have more to say on the subject later and noted that he would deliver a major speech on foreign policy and national security later this week. 
 That speech, much anticipated by Mr. Kerry's fellow Democrats, is expected to begin what his campaign described as an 11-day focus on ''security and strength for a new world.''
 David Wade, a campaign spokesman, said meanwhile that Mr. Kerry would make a decision ''soon'' on whether to delay accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. 
 The Associated Press reported Tuesday that Mr. Kerry was under pressure from other Democrats to decide quickly, although Mr. Wade said there was ''no timetable.''
 Last week, some Democrats floated the idea of postponing his acceptance of the nomination to even the financial playing field with Mr. Bush. Both candidates plan to use federal money for the general election campaign, meaning each must abide by a spending cap of about $75 million. 
 That cap begins once they are formally nominated -- late July for Mr. Kerry, but not until early September for Mr. Bush -- and will give Mr. Bush a significant financial advantage.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says No Backtracking On $400 Property Tax Rebates

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg struck a confrontational tone yesterday on his budget negotiations with the City Council, saying he would not budge from his plan to give $400 property tax rebates to homeowners.
 ''I don't see any reason for any compromise whatsoever,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of his rebate proposal, which is estimated to cost $250 million. ''These are the people that are hurt the most, and these are the ones that we're going to help first.'' 
 Responding to questions from reporters at a public appearance in Queens, the mayor also said that council members ''can lick their chops all they want'' over the prospect of an additional $200 million in tax revenues the city expects this year, but added that any additional spending would require similarly sized cuts elsewhere in the budget. 
 ''This is an either-or situation for this city,'' he said, ''and if you want to spend money, I'm going to introduce the 'or' to you.''
 The tax rebate, the centerpiece of Mr. Bloomberg's $46.9 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, faces competition from an alternative proposal put forward by Gifford Miller, speaker of the City Council. Mr. Miller's plan, which would cost about $300 million, would reduce property taxes permanently by 2 percent for all property owners, including businesses.
 Mr. Bloomberg has rejected that idea, saying it offers minuscule financial savings for owners of single-family homes, while providing windfalls for corporations that own large buildings. But the mayor's plan faces a hurdle: Because the rebate is aimed at just one class of property owner, it requires approval from the State Legislature. Mr. Miller's all-inclusive proposal does not.
 On Monday, the mayor's budget director, Mark Page, said the administration was working in Albany to try to get the rebate approved.The Council must adopt a budget by June 5. It just concluded a series of hearings on Mr. Bloomberg's budget proposal on Monday, and is now in the process of attempting to reconcile its own tax and spending plans with the mayor's.
 David K. Chai, a spokesman for Mr. Miller, said he was disappointed by Mr. Bloomberg's comments, which suggested he was not inclined to compromise on major sticking points. ''It's unfortunate that the mayor still wants to stick with his Republican-style tax gimmick,'' he said. ''We want to see permanent tax relief.''
 Mr. Chai also criticized the mayor's objection to additional spending on health, cultural and social service programs that were cut in this year's budget, saying that if the city managed to pay for them despite facing a major financial crisis last year, ''why can't we find the money now, when times are getting better?''
 Mr. Bloomberg said that any additional revenues from higher tax collections this year should go toward closing the budget deficit in 2006, which is estimated to top $3.7 billion.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Are Ready to Cheer Some Imaginary Devastation

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
A gigantic wave swept across New York Harbor, nearly submerging the Statue of Liberty. Then it raged through the streets of Manhattan, destroying everything in its path and drowning or crushing tens of thousands of panicked New Yorkers in minutes.
 When the waters finally leveled off, there was silence, and then a huge round of applause.
 ''Wow,'' one man said, clapping like a basketball fan after a half-court shot. ''Wow.'' 
 Granted, most of the people at the American Museum of Natural History on Monday night who watched the premiere of the environmental disaster thriller ''The Day After Tomorrow'' had some connection to the movie or its makers, and they were generally applauding the stunning results of millions of dollars of special effects.
 But still, it seemed as if a kind of moment, minor but worth noting, had passed in the city's post-9/11 history: New Yorkers were finally ready to watch Roland Emmerich destroy their city again on the big screen.
 Mr. Emmerich, the director of this $125 million movie (which opens on Friday), has wreaked havoc on the city twice before, once with the help of aliens in ''Independence Day'' (1996) and two years later with a big lizard in ''Godzilla.'' But those movies were made before the Sept. 11 attacks forced movie producers to rethink plots involving deadly mayhem. (After the attacks, for example, Warner Brothers delayed the release of ''Collateral Damage,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Los Angeles firefighter tracking down Colombian terrorists.) 
 But on Monday night an audience that included longtime New Yorkers like Sydney Pollack, Tina Brown, Andrew M. Cuomo, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Peter Boyle left the theater with animated smiles after the movie ended with Manhattan flash-frozen and encased in an iceberg, no thaw in sight.
 Emmy Rossum, a lifelong New Yorker and one of the movie's stars, said she hoped New Yorkers would be able to enjoy the movie because, of course, it's just a movie. But also, she said, because it shows strangers in the city banding together to help one other, as they did after Sept. 11.
 ''It shows that there can always be hope,'' she said.
 Thomas M. Hammel, a co-producer of ''Tomorrow,'' a 20th Century Fox film, said that the makers were always aware that the film had no villain, unless you count very bad weather or general human disregard for the environment. Because of this, they said, they hoped it would be easier for New Yorkers to watch. (It is also worth noting that while New York buildings are flooded and frozen, none collapse in the movie.)
 Paul Iaffaldano, a senior vice president of the Weather Channel, who lives in New York and Atlanta, said he was sitting with lots of longtime New Yorkers at the screening and noticed that everyone reacted almost with glee as parts of Los Angeles, including the Hollywood sign, were decimated by tornadoes.
 ''But we were all a little more subdued when it came to the New York scenes,'' he said, adding: ''I have to admit, when that tidal wave came in, I looked really close to see if it was going to hit my building on the East Side. I had a little bit of personal reaction.''
 Darryl Spence, an unemployed telemarketer who had joined the crowd of stargazers across the street from the premiere, said he thought his city had been a stomping ground for cinematic murder and mass destruction for so long that it almost comforted people to see it back in that role.
 ''If people were squeamish, they wouldn't all be out here like this, going crazy over this movie,'' Mr. Spence, 42, said, as snow-making machines blew strange, apocalyptic-looking flakes over sunny Central Park West. ''Look at them.''
 He added: ''If the ice age comes again, you know, I'll deal with it. I'll get by. It's always something.''

HEADLINE: Increases In Health Care Premiums Are Slowing

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Health insurance premiums are expected to rise up to 10 percent this year, well below the annual increases of 14 to 18 percent in the last few years but still more than double the overall inflation rate.
 While the slowdown in the rate of increase will provide a bit of relief to employers and their insured workers, the rise in premiums means that the price of health care coverage will remain a burden.
 ''Ten percent is still a lot,'' said Louise Probst, the executive director of the St. Louis Area Business and Health Coalition, which represents 40 large and small employers. ''While any reduction is good, increases of 10 percent will still mean virtually doubling our health care costs every seven years.'' 
 Three large insurance companies, United Healthcare, Aetna and Humana, have already pared premium increases this year. Aetna has signaled to Wall Street analysts that its premiums are rising in the range of 8 to 9 percent this year, compared with 14 percent last year.
 Nationwide, premiums averaged $9,068 for a family in 2003, up from $7,954 the year before, according to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employer health benefits. The employee's share of that 2003 figure was $2,412. And out-of-pocket expenses rose, too. 
 Annual deductibles increased to $561, on average, from $488 in 2002, for using doctors or hospitals outside a health plan's network.
 Several factors are putting downward pressure on rate increases. A big force is last year's decline in the costs of insured care provided by hospitals and physicians, as fewer people were hospitalized and consumers shied away from paying more for expensive drugs. That means many insurers socked away sizable profits that can enable them to restrain their premium increases this year. 
 ''The fact that cost trends are slowing will lead to slowing premium trends,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group that plans to issue a report on costs next month.
 Still, experts and analysts said insurers would be less likely to curb their rate increases if it were not for a second, related factor: growing competitive pressure. In states where Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies are still nonprofit organizations -- including Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina -- regulators and legislators are pointing to the insurers' big surpluses and pushing the companies to limit the amount they raise premiums, or in some cases, even provide rebates. 
 Lower rate increases by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which have a combined 90 million enrollees nationwide, put pressure on commercial insurers to rein in their increases. 
 Federal actuaries in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services say that growth in overall health care spending began ''a marked slowdown'' last year. A study in the journal Health Affairs headed by Stephen Heffler of the agency's Office of the Actuary, estimated that the increase in the private-sector share of spending would drop to 7.6 percent this year, down from 8.9 percent in 2003. That would still be well ahead of the rate of general inflation. The Consumer Price Index has been rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent this year. 
 The major reason for the slowdown, the actuaries said, was the slowing in the growth of health insurance premiums as well as the tendency of insurance companies to seek new members in a pattern that experts call the underwriting cycle. 
 Adding to the competition among insurers is the dwindling number of jobs in manufacturing and other fields that traditionally offered generous employer health plans. New jobs tend to be in small businesses and service industries likely to provide skimpier benefits, if any at all. That means the insurers are more likely to be fighting over customers -- and competing on the basis of price. 
 Wall Street analysts say the commercial companies have set hard-to-reach goals for adding members, which may be achievable only by offering more attractive prices. Aetna, which has said it hopes to add 750,000 new members this year for a total of 14 million, has already signed up 342,000 at the new rates. 
 United Healthcare has also added 860,000 members, and Anthem and Wellpoint Health Networks, two large for-profit Blue Cross companies that are merging, have added 845,000 between them. 
 Some big managed care insurers are complaining about the impact of competition, which they say is cutting into profits. ''There's no question now I'm seeing pricing that can't be rationalized,'' said Michael B. McCallister, the chief executive of Humana, which is holding its price increases to 7.5 to 9.5 percent this year, down from 12 to 14 percent in 2003. 
 Humana and at least three other national commercial insurers -- Health Net, Cigna and First Health -- are reporting that price competition is reducing their earnings, noted Matthew Borsch, a Wall Street health care analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
 The largest employers, which typically use their own money in self-insured health plans for their employees, are keeping cost increases per worker in the 6 percent to 8 percent range, said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a Washington-based association of large companies. 
 In a recent survey by her group, ''one large company reported no increase,'' she said, and ''nobody was above 11 percent.'' The group's employers say that next year they expect medical cost increases to be about the same as this year's levels. The companies usually keep their forecasts on the conservative side, because ''their financial people hate surprises,'' Ms. Darling said. ''Also, they do not like to talk about the numbers in public.''
 Bruce E. Bradley, director of health care strategy and public policy at General Motors, said that ''the increase in health care costs continues to be a very serious problem, especially for companies competing in the global marketplace.'' 
 Indicators of slowing rate increases include a move last week by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, one of the nation's largest purchasers of health care.
 Calpers approved a 7.7 percent ''preliminary'' limit on rate increases for next year for one of its basic self-insured health plans. That plan, PERS Choice Basic, had been able to build up a financial surplus after raising premiums by 18.2 percent for 2004 and 18.9 percent in 2003, said Clark McKinley, a Calpers spokesman. 
 Calpers, which also said last week that it was dropping 38 high-cost hospitals from its networks, plans to announce its full array of 2005 rates in mid-June. 
 Another trend indicator, a survey of insurers' 2005 asking prices for health maintenance organizations, is scheduled for release next week by the Hewitt Associates consulting firm.
 An analysis of 34 nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans by Goldman Sachs helps explain the forces at work. The plans' profit margins nearly doubled last year, to 4.8 percent, up from 2.5 percent in 2002.
 The combined surpluses of those plans increased 67 percent, to more than $8 billion last year, according to Mr. Borsch, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, while their total reserves grew 30 percent, to $31.9 billion. 
 Besides the slowdown in medical cost inflation, other analysts said, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans benefited from good returns on investing part of their reserves in the stock market. 
 The Blue Cross plans ''are cutting prices when their profit margins are sufficiently high, and they are confident that they will have more capital than they need,'' said Charles Boorady, a securities analyst at Smith Barney. 
 There is also the pressure from legislators and regulators in some states. North Carolina Blue Cross and Blue Shield, for example, said it was deliberately trimming profit margins to 6.3 percent this year from 8.1 percent a year ago. That meant that the increase in premiums was reduced to 5 percent for individuals in one of its plans. North Carolina Blue Cross and Blue Shield says it has added 156,000 members this year, raising its total to three million.
 Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New Jersey and the Tennessee Blue Cross plan have drawn on their profit hoards to distribute one-time rebate checks to members. 
 Blue Cross subscribers in Rhode Island have not fared as well, though. In that state, where the chief executive of the Blue Cross plan recently resigned under criticism for accepting a $600,000 loan from the company, the plan's administrators have agreed to hold rate increases below last year's 16 percent level. But this year's premiums will nonetheless be sharply higher at 12 percent. 
 When it comes to the cost of health insurance, the good news is relative.

HEADLINE: Flood Toll Rises to 1,950 in Haiti and Dominican Republic

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 26 

 BODY:
The death toll from devastating floods and landslides in Haiti and the Dominican Republic rose to at least 1,950 on Wednesday with the discovery of more than 1,000 bodies in a Haitian town.
 The bodies were found in Mapou, a rural southeastern town where communications are poor, said Margareth Martin, the head of the civil protection office for the region.
 Rescue workers dug through mud and debris for bodies three days after torrential rains sent rivers of mud and swirling waters through Hispaniola, the Caribbean island shared by Haiti's 8 million people and the Dominican Republic's 8.5 million. 
 Haiti's death toll stood at 1,660, including 1,000 in Mapou, 500 elsewhere in the southeast, 158 in the riverside town of Fond Verrettes, and 2 in the south, at Port-a-Piment.
 The Dominican authorities said they had recovered 300 bodies, mostly from Jimani, near the Haitian border, where a river overflowed its banks before dawn and swept homes away as people slept.
 In Haiti, troops from an American-led peacekeeping force flew in bottled water, fruit and bread by helicopter to Fond Verrettes, where the storm washed out the winding mountain road from Port-au-Prince and cut off ground transportation to the town of 40,000.
 The floodwaters flattened fields of crops and ripped apart crude shacks fashioned from sticks and sheets of iron. 
 The Dominican president, Hipolito Mejia, declared a day of mourning for Thursday. 
 In the town of Jimani, bodies were taken from the mud and from Lago Enriquillo, a lake where they had been swept by the raging waters. Survivors said the floodwaters rose to 15 feet. Bodies were found crushed against walls, clinging to tree trunks and buried in the mud.
 Dogs trained to sniff out bodies were sent to join the recovery effort. Relief workers wore surgical masks against the stench of decomposing flesh and hauled away the dead on stretchers, while others hacked through the rubble of stick shacks with hatchets searching for bodies.
 Many were buried in mass graves. Bulldozers dug holes to bury others where they were found, in ground where buildings stood a few days ago.
 Several hundred people were still missing.
 Relief workers and supplies of medicines, food, blankets poured into the Jimani area. Army tents sprang up to shelter dozens of Dominican soldiers helping with relief efforts. 
 The European Union was preparing a package worth $2.43 million for flood victims, the European Commission said in Brussels. The United States Agency for International Development said it was giving $50,000 to help the relief effort and was sending two disaster experts to evaluate damage. Japan also said it was giving $100,000 in emergency aid. 
 In New York -- with a Dominican population of 400,000 and a Haitian one of 118,800 -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sent a team of three disaster management specialists from the city's Office of Emergency Management to the Dominican Republic to make recommendations for aid to the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

PERSON: David Dellinger

HEADLINE: David Dellinger, of Chicago 7, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
David Dellinger, whose commitment to nonviolent direct action against the federal government placed him at the forefront of American radical pacifism in the 20th century and led, most famously, to a courtroom in Chicago where he became a leading defendant in the raucous political conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven, died Tuesday in a retirement home in Montpelier, Vt. He was 88. 
 His death was reported by Peggy Rocque, the administrator of the home, Heaton Woods.
 An avuncular figure among younger and more flamboyant mavericks, Mr. Dellinger emerged in the 1960's as the leading organizer of huge antiwar demonstrations, including the encirclement of the Pentagon that was immortalized in Norman Mailer's account ''Armies of the Night.'' At the same time, making use of his close contacts with the North Vietnamese, he was able to organize the release of several American airmen held as prisoners and to escort them back from Hanoi. 
 In the often turbulent world of the American left, Mr. Dellinger occupied a position of almost stolid consistency. He belonged to no party, and insisted that American capitalism had provoked racism, imperial adventures and wars and should be resisted. 
 A child of patrician privilege, he had since his days at Yale learned and practiced strategies of civil disobedience in a variety of causes, steadfastly showing what he called his concern for ''the small, the variant, the unrepresented, the weak,'' categories he cited from the writings of William James. 
 In the federal courtroom in Chicago in 1969, when Judge Julius J. Hoffman presided over the trial of opponents of the Vietnam War charged with criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot at the Democratic National Convention a year earlier, Mr. Dellinger loomed over his co-defendants in age, experience, heft and gravitas. 
 The next oldest of the defendants, Abbie Hoffman, was 20 years his junior. Mr. Hoffman and Jerry Rubin were Yippies who mocked authority in star-spangled shirts; Mr. Dellinger favored quiet business suits. Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John R. Froines and Lee Weiner had led student movements; Mr. Dellinger had not. 
 Within this radical bouquet of representatives from what was called the New Left, Mr. Dellinger stood out as a link to a homegrown pacifist strain that had its roots within America's Old Left.
 Paul Berman, who wrote about the radicals and revolutionaries who rose to prominence in the years around 1968 in ''Tale of Two Utopias,'' said that Mr. Dellinger ''came of age in one of the tiniest currents of the American left -- the Rev. A.J. Muste's movement for World War II pacifism, a movement based on radical Christian values and vaguely anarchist instincts. No rational person observing that movement during the 1940's would have predicted any success at all, and yet during the next two or three decades, Mr. Dellinger and his pacifist allies transformed whole areas of American life.''
 Mr. Berman said that they ''did it by supplying crucial leadership in the civil rights revolution and by playing a central role in the mass movement against the war in Vietnam.'' 
 ''Dellinger, himself,'' Mr. Berman said, ''became the single most important leader of the national antiwar movement, at its height, from 1967 through the early 1970's. You could quarrel with some of his political judgments, but he was always sober, always resolute, always selfless and always brave.''
 If his co-defendants in Chicago captured most of the attention of the news media, in the eyes of Judge Hoffman, it was Mr. Dellinger who had been the most guilty. The jury had acquitted all seven on conspiracy but found all but Mr. Weiner and Mr. Froines guilty of inciting to riot. Of the convicted, Mr. Dellinger was given the harshest penalty by Judge Hoffman, five years in jail and a $5,000 fine. He was also sentenced to two years and five months on the basis of 32 citations of criminal contempt for comments he made during the five-month trial, which ended in February 1970.
 Two years later, with all the defendants free on bail, an appellate court, citing prejudicial conduct by Judge Hoffman, voided the convictions for inciting to riot. The next year another court upheld Mr. Dellinger's contempt conviction, but declined to impose sentence. 
 Mr. Dellinger was by his own lights more radical that many of his like-minded compatriots, a figure who often found the strategies and tactics of close colleagues like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mr. Muste, his mentor in radical pacifism, too conciliatory. 
 When Mr. Dellinger was a young man, he had, for the experience, ridden boxcars with hobos during the Depression. Soon after, he drove an ambulance behind Loyalist lines in the Spanish Civil War and he traveled through Germany to witness the rise of Nazi power. He resisted the draft and in prison took part in hunger strikes to integrate the mess hall of Danbury prison. He edited Liberation magazine, which Mr. Mailer once described as ''an anarchist-pacifist magazine of worthy but not very readable articles in more or less vegetarian prose.''
 In the 1940's Mr. Dellinger met Elizabeth Peterson at a Christian students' meeting, and they married. She survives him, as do two sisters, Nancy Marshall, of Massachusetts, and Elizabeth Cushman, of Sarasota, Fla. Also surviving are three sons, Patchen, of Seattle, Daniel, of St. Johnsbury, Vt., and Howard Douglas, of Nazareth, Pa.; two daughters, Natasha Singer, of Schnevus, N.Y., and Michele McDonough, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. 
 David Dellinger was born in Wakefield, Mass., on Aug. 22, 1915. His father, Raymond, was a lawyer and chairman of the town Republican Party, influential enough to take his son to a private White House lunch with Calvin Coolidge. His grandmother was active in the Daughters of the American Revolution. 
 Like his father he went to Yale, where he did well in his studies and was elected captain of the cross-country team. He also became close friends with Walt W. Rostow, who years later would face him from the other side of the barricades as a senior adviser on Vietnam to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He was drawn to pacifism through readings of Tolstoy and most particularly of ''The Power of Nonviolence,'' by Richard Gregg, an American who had spent years working with Mahandas K. Gandhi.
 But his personal commitment to nonviolence came after a football game in which Georgia beat Yale. New Haven ''townies,'' who resented the Yale students, swarmed onto the field and tore down the goal posts. Mr. Dellinger joined in the melee and chased one young man, whom he hit and knocked unconscious. He recalled: ''I shall never forget the horror I felt the instant my fist struck solid flesh. When my victim fell, I dropped to my knees, lifted his head and I cradled him until he came to. I walked him home. I never saw my enemy again.'' 
 He pledged he would never hit anyone again and forswore all violence.
 In ''Armies of the Night,'' Mr. Mailer's account of the famous antiwar protest march on the Pentagon in 1967 that Mr. Dellinger helped to organize with Mr. Rubin, the writer compared the radical leader in nonviolent action to an alumni officer at a Yale reunion. ''He had the hard-working, modestly gregarious, and absolutely devoted sense of how mission and detail interlock, which is so necessary to good class agents, that rare vintage mixture of New England incorruptability and good fellowship.''
 Mr. Dellinger graduated magna cum laude from Yale in 1936 with a degree in economics. He received a fellowship that enabled him to attend Oxford, where his interest in pacifism deepened. Returning to the United States, he entered Union Theological Seminary in New York, intent on becoming a minister, though he never got around to choosing a denomination. In 1940, as war clouds gathered, the United States required men to register for the draft. Mr. Dellinger and seven other seminarians announced that they would refuse to do so, despite assurances that as candidates for the ministry they would not be inducted into the Army. He wrote that accepting such a de facto exemption would in Gandhian terms amount to complicity with violence. 
 Mr. Dellinger, who was president of his class at the seminary, was expelled with the other dissenters and denounced from the pulpit by prominent churchmen across the country for what they contended was his doubtful patriotism. Mr. Dellinger had been living in a black neighborhood in Newark with several other draft resisters. Mr. Dellinger was tried for draft evasion, convicted and sent to Danbury prison for a year. In 1943, with America at war, Mr. Dellinger returned to Newark and was again summoned to report for a preinduction physical examination. Again he refused to report. He was arrested and convicted of draft evasion and sent to Lewisburg, a maximum security prison, for two years.
 In 1956 along with Mr. Muste and Dorothy Day, the Catholic anarchist, he founded Liberation, eventually becoming its editor and and publisher. It was the escalating war in Vietnam that brought Mr. Dellinger into heightened prominence. In 1965, he helped to sponsor the first major antiwar demonstration in New York, which took place in October, involving liberal and radical groups. Mr. Dellinger, along with a few other opponents of the war, sent invitations to antiwar groups to join in another protest against the war during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968, focusing on what was anticipated as the renomination of President Johnson. Although Johnson declined to run again, groups massed in Chicago, where violent clashes with police led to the indictments that led to the indictments of the Chicago Seven and Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers. For a while it was the Chicago 8, but Judge Hoffman had Mr. Seale removed from the trial and the courtroom after ordering him bound and gagged after he insisted that he was being denied his right to a lawyer of his own choice.
 Even before the trial ended, Mr. Dellinger, who had earlier established close contacts in North Vietnam, flew to Hanoi in August 1969 to escort home three American servicemen who had been held as prisoners. He made a similar trip in 1972, and during much of the war he served as a conduit to North Vietnam, advising the Hanoi government which Americans should be permitted to visit there and making travel and visa arrangements. During the peace talks in Paris he was a consultant to the North Vietnamese delegation.
 In the 1970's, Mr. Dellinger and his family moved to a house on a dirt road in Peacham, Vt., where he made what he described as a precarious living teaching in the adult education program at Vermont College in Burlington and writing. In addition to his autobiography, he wrote ''Revolutionary Nonviolence'' (Anchor Books, 1971), ''More Power Than We Know'' (Anchor Books, 1975) and ''Vietnam Revisited'' (South End Press, 1986). 
 The dedication of this last one read, ''To all veterans of the Vietnam War; those who fought in it and those who fought against it.''

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales and Durable Goods Orders Fell in April

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell 11.8 percent last month, the largest decline in a decade, after mortgage rates reached a five-month high, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods declined 2.9 percent in April after the biggest two-month gain since 1992, when such records were first kept.
 The drop in single-family home purchases was greater than expected, to 1.093 million at an annual pace, after a record 1.239 million pace in March. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast that sales of new homes would decline to a 1.2 million annual pace from 1.228 million the month before. 
 But sales of previously owned houses rose 2.5 percent in April, to a 6.64 million annual pace, the second highest on record, a report yesterday from the National Association of Realtors showed. 
 The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased in April to 5.83 percent, up from 5.45 percent in March, according to Freddie Mac, the No.2 purchaser of mortgages in this country. The median price of a new house increased to a record, and the supply of homes rose.
 ''The price appreciation that we've seen is unsustainable,'' said Van Davis, chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate. 
 April sales of new homes fell in three regions of the United States and rose in one. They dropped 22 percent in the South, to 460,000 at an annual pace; 9.4 percent in the West, to a 339,000 pace; and 2.5 percent in the Northeast, to 78,000. Sales increased 10.8 percent in the Midwest, to a pace of 216,000.
 New-home sales account for 15 percent of the market and are considered a harbinger of the market for sales of previously owned homes. New-home sales are counted when a contract is signed, while resales are tabulated at the contract's close.
 Even with the April decline, sales so far this year are at an annual pace of 1.283 million houses, which would exceed last year's record.
 Five chief economists from housing trade groups and mortgage-buying companies said in a report for the Homeownership Alliance yesterday that the construction of 1.85 million to 2.17 million homes a year would be needed for the next decade.
 The median price of new homes increased 8.8 percent last month, to $221,200 from $203,300 in March. Inventories of new homes for sale rose to a 4.3-month supply in April from 3.7 months.
 In California, known for hot real estate markets, home prices registered the second-biggest increase in 26 years in April, the state Association of Realtors said. The median price of an existing single-family detached home in California rose 24.6 percent from a year earlier, to $453,590.
 April's decline in orders for durable goods, products intended to last at least three years, reflected less demand for commercial aircraft and automobiles. 
 Unfilled orders to factories rose in April for an eighth month in nine, and there was an increase in shipments of business equipment, which economists expect to help fuel the economy this quarter. Manufacturers hired more workers last month than at any time in almost four years. In March, business inventories were at record lows compared with sales, recent reports show.
 ''The slippage in orders in April looks modest and leaves volumes high enough to ensure continued expansion of production in the months ahead,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
 Economists at Bear Stearns said the value of nonmilitary capital-goods shipments excluding aircraft, a component in calculating the gross domestic product, was 15.8 percent higher at an annual pace than the first-quarter average. 
 The strength ''suggests that business-equipment spending will likely post another double-digit gain in the second quarter,'' John Ryding, Bear Stearns' chief market economist in New York, said.

HEADLINE: Shoulda, Woulda, Can

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I'm glad the president gave a sober talk about where we're going in Iraq and in confronting terrorism. But I can't say I found it reassuring. I still don't feel we have a broad, workable strategy. We currently have two national commissions looking backward -- one on how 9/11 happened, and another about why no W.M.D. were found in Iraq. Those are key questions. But what we really need is a bipartisan commission looking forward. I'd call it the National Commission for Doing Things Right. Its mandate would be simple: tell the country what U.S. policy would be if we were determined to do things right in confronting terrorism, no matter what the political costs -- so we don't have to have yet another commission looking backward two years from now. Here's what I'd like to see: 
 * We would take all the money the Bush team has wasted on P.R. campaigns directed at the Arab-Muslim world and put it into three programs: a huge expansion of U.S. embassy libraries around the world, which have been cut in recent years (you'd be amazed at how many young people abroad had their first contact with America through an embassy library), a huge expansion of scholarships for foreign students to study in America, and a huge expansion of our immigration service so it can quickly figure out who should get visas to study or work in America and who shouldn't. Too many good students are getting shut out of the U.S. You don't get better P.R. from ads. You get it from bringing people into America or American libraries and letting them draw their own conclusions. 
 * We would adopt a 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, the Patriot Tax (along with my wife's proposal: free public parking anywhere in America for any hybrid or other car getting more than 35 m.p.g.). A Patriot Tax would help pay for the Afghan and Iraq wars and help finance a Manhattan project to speed the development of a hydrogen economy, enabling the public to make a contribution to the war effort while lessening our dependence on foreign oil.
 There is simply no way to stimulate a process of economic and political reform in the Arab-Muslim world without radically reducing their revenues from oil, thereby forcing these governments to reform their economies, and societies, to produce real jobs for their people. Is there anything dumber than the Bush campaign ads chastising John Kerry for once favoring a gasoline tax? Had we imposed a Patriot Tax a year ago, gasoline might still cost $2 a gallon today, but 50 cents of that would have gone to paying for American schools rather than Saudi madrassas.
 * We would spearhead efforts in trade talks to reduce U.S., European and Japanese farm subsidies. Nothing would be more helpful to Pakistani, Egyptian and other poor farmers in the Muslim and developing worlds than no longer having to compete with our subsidized produce.
 * We would make a serious effort to diffuse the toxic Arab-Israeli conflict, including using NATO forces to separate the parties.
 * We would spell out that the war on terrorism is a long-term war on radical Islam -- and while force is necessary in that effort, it is not sufficient. We have to connect all of the above dots to strengthen Arab-Muslim moderates, because only they can take on their extremists. Unfortunately, the Bush team reacted to 9/11 as if all the old rules and methods had to go. I believe 9/11 was gigantic. But the old rule book -- emphasizing allies, the Geneva Conventions, self-sacrifice, economic development, education, Arab-Israeli diplomacy -- was and remains our greatest source of strength in the effort to promote gradual reform in the regions most likely to breed threats to our open society. 
 I think David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it best: ''The answer for us lies not in what has changed, but in recognizing what has not changed. Because only through this recognition will we focus on an effective multilateral response to W.M.D. proliferation, the creation of real stakeholders in globalization among the world's poor, the need for reform in the Arab world and a style of U.S. leadership that seeks to build our base of support worldwide by getting more people to voluntarily sign onto our values. We need to remember that those values are the real foundation for our security and the real source of our strength. And we need to recognize that our enemies can never defeat us -- only we can defeat ourselves, by throwing out the rule book that has worked for us for a long, long time.''

HEADLINE: Santa Monica Design Firm Chosen for Olympic Site in Queens

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
They did not play the national anthem or drape the champion in red, white and blue, but there was plenty of other fanfare as city and state officials gathered yesterday in Long Island City, Queens, to announce the architect chosen to design the 2012 Olympic Village.
 The winner, selected from 132 proposals from architects worldwide, was Morphosis, a firm based in Santa Monica, Calif., known for its innovative designs.
 Standing next to the Morphosis model for the village, the officials beamed at its several serpentine low-rise buildings depicted on the banks of the East River, and its four sleek high-rises jutting up as if to mimic the United Nations building across the river from the proposed site. It sits at the southern margin of Queens West, a waterfront development plan the state is sponsoring. The village would include 4,500 units of housing for 16,000 athletes and coaches, and athletic fields and indoor training areas, all with views of the Manhattan skyline. 
 At a morning news conference at the Tennisport club, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, called the Morphosis design strong enough to give New York the edge over the four other finalist cities competing for the 2012 Summer Games: London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris. A decision is expected in July 2005.
 Mr. Bloomberg said the $1.5 billion Olympic Village project, on a 52-acre waterfront site, would be converted into ''first-class housing'' after the Games. The plan was selected by a steering committee organized by NYC2012, the organization leading the city's bid to play host to the Games.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said the Morphosis design would be ''incredibly important'' in the competition for the Games and for the Games themselves, since ''the athletes are the center of the Olympic Games.'' 
 Thom Mayne, 60, head of the Morphosis firm, is known for creating graceful designs out of unlikely materials, like industrial metals. Among the firm's current projects are a building for Cooper Union in Manhattan, a recreation center at the University of Cincinnati and a housing project in Madrid. 
 His Olympic design features three long, low-rise buildings that follow the contour of the shoreline, like flowing ribbons wrapping sections of tree-shaded parkland. Mr. Mayne said he tried to design the village as a ''Central Park on the Hudson'' and create ''a contrast with the urbanity and density of Manhattan,'' all while connecting it to Manhattan.
 Paved walkways are designed as extensions of Midtown streets, and many breezeways and open spaces are incorporated into the buildings to preserve Manhattan sightlines.
 Another goal was to capitalize on its proximity to transportation and the security benefits of being partly bordered by water.

HEADLINE: Panama Canal Thinks Big, Bringing Fear to the Jungle

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: PANAMA 

 BODY:
From a helicopter at 1,600 feet, Alberto Aleman Zubieta takes a bird's-eye view of the vast wealth that flows through the Panama Canal and the poverty that thrives right next to it.
 There are cruise liners carrying enough tourists to populate a small city and cargo ships carrying goods from Asia to the American East Coast. The canal, which stretches some 50 miles between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, is one of the engineering wonders of the world. Its locks function like elevators, each using millions of tons of water to lift ships the size of skyscrapers off the ocean and onto a manufactured passageway through the divide between North and South America. 
 The jungle, by contrast, seems stuck in time. Most of the residents are Indians who live on little more than the food they grow, and die young. A fifth of all children do not attend school. Some 70 percent of people live without electricity, even more without telephones.
 When the helicopter lands in the tiny village of San Pedro, people stare blank-faced. No one approaches.
 ''The government has never done anything for these people,'' Mr. Aleman says. ''Politicians come at election time and make all kinds of promises and then disappear. So when we come along with new ideas, and promise people that we're going to take care of them, it's no wonder they don't believe us.''
 Mr. Aleman is the director of the Panama Canal, a post of such economic and diplomatic importance to this country that it is considered second only to the presidency. 
 The problem is that the 90-year-old canal is at risk of becoming obsolete as vessels being built in Asia -- as long as the Empire State building is tall -- will be too big to squeeze through its locks. And a planned renovation of the canal for the coming decade or two could devastate villages like San Pedro, turning a part of the area into a lake and forcing thousands off their land. Given the canal's history as a corner of colonial privilege, fears are rampant that the $6 billion renovation will not benefit those who most need it -- villagers like those in San Pedro.
 ''They tell me the future of the canal depends on our land,'' said Eduardo Coronado, a 40-year-old farmer and father of three. ''I tell them that my children's future depends on the land.''
 When the canal opened to commercial traffic in 1914, it was operated by American engineers and protected by 10,000 American troops. To enter the Canal Zone was like crossing a border. American law was supreme. English was the official language. There was an uneven division of privileges between American managers and the Latin American work force. 
 In 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty to turn over control of the canal to the people of Panama. The last American authorities left the canal zone five years ago. Talk of expanding the canal seems to have brought back old suspicions and fears.
 ''People are worried that the secrecy and cover-up that was used by the Americans when they ran the canal is now being used by its Panamanian managers,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Panama. ''We are told that the canal will be good for the country. But most people think it will be benefit a small circle of powerful businesses.''
 Martin Torrijos, Panama's president-elect and the son of the former dictator who negotiated America's withdrawal from the canal with Mr. Carter, called the expansion of the canal this country's ''most important decision of the century.''
 It could cost a fortune and deprive the needy of land or it could stimulate an economy that has sharply slowed in recent years, by creating thousands of jobs and bringing millions of dollars in private investment.
 The stakes are clearest in remote jungle villages like San Pedro, where people live on $3 a day doing the same jobs their fathers and grandfathers did. They say they need schools, roads and hospitals more than they need a bigger canal.
 ''I do not know how to live in a city,'' said 56-year-old Feliciano Benitez. ''We are farmers. We want to stay on our land. But if they come to take it, what can we do?''
 Indian activists and church groups have campaigned for months in communities like San Pedro, to inform the peasant farmers about the proposed expansion and educate them about their rights. They have published a series of pamphlets bearing the message ''No to the Flood,'' 
 The pamphlets mention Mr. Aleman by name. So it is no wonder people seem leery of him when he arrives at San Pedro.
 ''He's the one who wants our land,'' Mr. Coronado said. ''I hope he does not deceive us.''
 Indeed his visit seems motivated by cross-purposes. Joined by the departing president, Mireya Moscoso, Mr. Aleman delivers titles that give the farmers legal claim to the land they occupy.
 The canal authority has helped the government pay to provide titles to farmers living in the canal's watershed.
 When asked why he would give titles to peasants for land that might soon be taken from them, Mr. Aleman was adamant: decisions about the expansion plan were still a long way away, and no one would lose their land without fair compensation.
 Whether or not the canal authority goes forward with the expansion, he said, it has an interest in giving the farmers incentives to take care of their land. The canal relies on the water collected in the rain forest that stretches to the east and the west of it. Those resources are diminished with each acre of jungle that is cut down. And the view from the helicopter indicates they are being cut down fast.
 ''We want to do what is best for Panama, for the canal and for the people,'' Mr. Aleman said. ''But first for the people.'' 
 He understands that the people think he is hiding ulterior motives. 
 ''They will not believe my words,'' he said. ''So we are speaking with actions.''

HEADLINE: Human Crematory Finds Home With the Holsteins

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: GUILFORD, Vt. 

 BODY:
Most everything on Bob and Jackie Gaines's 200-acre dairy farm blends right into the pastoral setting: the 60 Holsteins, the tractors and heavy equipment, the wooden shack where a son makes maple syrup in the spring.
 Then there is the human crematory.
 Located in a small gray building on the other side of rural Route 5 from their home, the crematory diverges a bit from the farm's bucolic atmosphere. 
 But it does have the advantage of assuring the survival of a two-century-old family business. 
 Called Vermont Blessings, the crematory opened in December and belongs to Jim and Ellen Curley, but sits on the Gaines's property. The alliance was set last year when Mr. Curley began a second career as a crematory operator after 25 years as a management consultant.
 Vermont was certainly a promising place for the venture. Forty percent of people who die in the state are cremated, according to the Funeral Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit watchdog group, compared with a national average of 25 percent. Moreover, there are only six other licensed crematories in the state.
 As he made plans for his start-up, Mr. Curley realized he had a problem: His own 67-acre spread, straddling the side of a small mountain, would be inaccessible for clients in the winter. So, last summer, he knocked on the Gaineses' door and asked if they would be willing to let him set up shop on their farm, which produces milk, cream, maple syrup and alfalfa, and where Mrs. Gaines breeds and boards dogs and operates haunted hayrides in the fall. 
 Mrs. Gaines was skeptical at first. A crematory might emit unpleasant odors or pollutants, she fretted, or be seen as an eyesore, or damage the farm's reputation. She had already rejected an overture from a man who had wanted to develop a huge chunk of her land into a storage facility.
 But she trusted the Curleys. And she realized that the additional income would keep her farm in the black and assure its eventual passage to the hands of her three grown sons, the ninth generation of Gaines farmers.
 ''Our first and foremost concern is to continue our dairy farm,'' Mrs. Gaines said. And so Mrs. Gaines, her husband, Bob, and her father-in-law, Bob Sr. took a chance on the Curleys.
 And the gamble has paid off, they say. The crematory emits no discernible odors or pollutants that they know of. The building that houses it sits on a hill and resembles a wooden shed with stained glass windows above and on both sides of the door, fitting in unobtrusively with the landscape. And none of the Gaineses' neighbors have publicly complained about it, though they had a chance to do so before the permit was granted. 
 ''We joke and say it's the nicest building on the farm,'' Mrs. Gaines said. 
 Best of all, the money they receive from the Curleys is helping keep their farm afloat, she says. (She would not disclose the size of the payments.)
 John McKiernan, director of the Small Business Development Center at Boston College, said small businesses often come up with innovative ideas to stay alive. For example, farmers, he said, have recently been renting out space for cellphone towers to make extra money. While subletting space is a common small-business practice, Professor McKiernan said, it is usually for the short-term, not a long-term agreement like the one reached between the Curleys and the Gaineses.
 ''Small businesses are really quite innovative in coming up with things,'' Professor McKiernan said. ''There's no particular pattern to them. It's 'who do you know who has something that I can use?'''
 Mr. Curley charges $975 for a customized cremation package, which includes pickup and transport of the body and urn. He declines to say how many cremations he has performed, but insists business is doing well. He has lined up about 25 prearranged cremations, he says, and hopes to obtain a license to run a funeral home and perform services within the next year.
 Joshua Slocum, the executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, which is based in Burlington, Vt., said Mr. Curley's fee seemed excessive, saying somewhere from $500 to $800 would be more reasonable. Mr. Curley, however, said the fee guaranteed a personal service not available elsewhere.
 Many residents of this town of 6,500, whose main commercial establishments are a general store and gas station, say they welcome the contribution the crematory is making to the local economy. ''The more I thought about it, I realized it really is a nice idea,'' said Karen Baker, an office manager at a law firm who lives about an eighth of a mile south of the Gaines farm. ''It's a business. I don't see why it wouldn't be good for the town.'' She said she would use the services of the crematory when the time came.
 Several other neighbors went to a crematory-management class and became certified in biological transport to support Mr. Curley's venture in case he ever needed their help. (So far he has not.)
 But not everyone is pleased. Dianne Brooks, a law professor who lives a half-mile from the crematory, said she and her husband, Robert Kells, were ''shocked'' and ''appalled'' when the Curleys approached them with the idea. She said they did not want their 4-year-old daughter playing a few hundred yards away from burning human remains. The Curleys' original plan was to place the crematory just a few yards from the front yard of the Brooks. 
 The couple decided not to fight the plan, however, Ms. Brooks said, opting instead to move back to Northampton, Mass.
 ''I really don't want to live next door to the crematory,'' she said. ''It makes me feel weird and creepy. We were already thinking we weren't going to stay here.''
 Even so, Ms. Brooks says, she appreciated the decision by the Curleys to sound her out and move the site of the crematory farther back from her property than they had planned. 
 The subject is no big deal for the Curleys' youngest daughter, Mary Cate, a high-school sophomore and devotee of the HBO series ''Six Feet Under'' about a family-run funeral home. Classmates and teachers peppered her with questions about the crematory, she said, ranging from whether she would be helping out to whether her family had an obsession with death. (The answer to both is no, she says.)
 ''It's a good party story,'' she said. ''The second you say your family owns a crematory, everyone wants to talk to you.''
 For Mrs. Gaines, the business has helped ease some of the sleepless nights that come with operating an independent dairy farm, especially as milk prices have swung up and down in recent years.
 ''It's become normal,'' she said. ''It's brought up some strange dinner topics, but other than that, it's good.''

HEADLINE: The oil price spikes give new urgency to the debate over their consequences.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
JAMES CARVILLE once mused that instead of coming back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter if there were reincarnation, he would rather come back as the bond market, because ''you can intimidate everybody.'' 
 Perhaps he should reconsider: the oil market might be a better bet. 
 Gasoline prices surpassed $2 a gallon last week, up from $1.20 in early 2002. This increase was driven largely by an increase in the price of crude oil, which in turn has been fueled mainly by growing worldwide demand in the face of fairly stable supply. Other factors have also played a role. For example, terrorist attacks against foreign oil workers in Saudi Arabia have caused speculation that supply might drop in the future. 
 The run-up in oil prices has become a major issue in the presidential election, as well as a threat to the economy. 
 The detrimental effect of oil price increases on economic growth was first emphasized by economists in the early 1980's. In a landmark study, James Hamilton, now of the University of California, San Diego, concluded, ''All but one of the U.S. recessions since World War II have been preceded, typically with a lag of around three-fourths of a year, by a dramatic increase in the price of crude oil.'' Surprisingly, Professor Hamilton found that oil price increases were associated with slower growth even before the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. 
 Time has been good to Professor Hamilton's hypothesis. 
 Many macroeconomic variables that appear to move together over time in a systematic way cease moving together after they are first studied. Sometimes this happens for mysterious reasons, like the unraveling of the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the 1990's, and sometimes it happens for expected reasons, like the tendency for stock prices to rise in January, which disappeared once investors became aware of it. 
 The correlation between oil prices and economic activity, however, has held up rather well. 
 Sharp increases in the price of oil preceded four of the last five recessions. The correlation between the real price of crude oil in a quarter and the unemployment rate a year later is a robust 0.72, according to a study by Alan A. Carruth of the University of Kent, Mark A. Hooker of State Street Global Advisors in London and Andrew J. Oswald of Warwick University. 
 ''Oil price spikes are probably as close as we get to world laboratory experiments in macroeconomics,'' Professor Oswald said. 
 Still, economists have not reached a consensus on the reason that oil price spikes depress economic activity -- and probably never will because many aspects of the economy and economic policy change in tandem. 
 In addition to gasoline, crude oil is used to make rubber and plastics, asphalt, synthetic fibers and fuel for electrical power generators. Crude oil purchases account for about 2 percent of gross domestic product, and all energy sources -- their cost is probably linked to crude oil prices -- account for about 5 percent. While it is true that the share of oil dollars in the economy has declined, it is also likely that the ease of substitution for remaining uses of oil has also declined. There is little reason to believe that oil prices have become irrelevant for economic activity. 
 Some economists argue that oil price increases matter because they make it more costly to produce a variety of products. Consequently, prices increase. Unless workers are willing to accept lower real wages, employment falls. Others argue that oil price increases cause a shift in demand across sectors, disrupting production. For example, higher prices reduce the demand for S.U.V.'s and other gas guzzlers, causing Detroit to lay off workers. Still others argue that oil price increases act like a tax because most oil revenues flow overseas. 
 Another question involves the extent to which the adverse effect of oil price shocks on economic growth results from the shocks themselves, or from the response of the Federal Reserve Board to those shocks, which is typically to raise borrowing rates to cool inflation. Higher interest rates bring actual output in line with (the lower) potential output. If it were less worried about inflation, could the Fed offset the adverse effect of oil price increases on economic activity? In an important 1997 study, Ben S. Bernanke, now a member of the Fed; Mark Gertler of New York University; and Mark Watson of Princeton presented evidence indicating that interest rate adjustments account for nearly all of the depressing effects of oil price shocks on the economy. 
 In the latest issue of The Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Professor Hamilton and Ana Maria Herrera of Michigan State University cast doubt on this view, and the three authors respond. The exchange is unlikely to settle the debate, but Professor Hamilton and Professor Herrera persuasively argue that the three set the bar too low by assuming that the effect of higher oil prices is shorter-lived than most other researchers do. 
 Elsewhere, Professor Hamilton has stressed that the relationship between oil prices and economic growth is not so straightforward. He finds that a price jump has less of an effect if prices had been high at some point in the preceding three years. Precisely such a situation now exists, as crude oil prices peaked at the end of 2000 and remained high through most of 2001 before dipping and then rebounding. As a result, he expects the 44 percent increase in crude oil prices over the last year to reduce G.D.P. by 0.5 percent from where it otherwise would have been by the end of this year. 
 Other estimates, which focus on the increase in oil prices irrespective of recent levels, imply a larger effect, on the order of a 2.2 percentage point reduction in output growth. 
 If the Fed refrains from raising the federal funds rate very much despite the rising price of oil, we will have as close as possible to a controlled experiment for estimating the impact of oil prices separately from Fed policy -- in other words, a test of whether it is better to come back as the oil market or the bond market.

HEADLINE: A Film That Could Warm Up the Debate on Global Warming

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.

 BODY:
Even as a summer disaster film, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' does not rank with the greats of yesteryear. Its dialogue is overwrought, its symbolism sophomoric, its subplots annoyingly irrelevant and its relationship to scientific reality tenuous at best. 
 But the special effects are terrific, and the timing couldn't be better. Scientists, environmentalists and a few lonely politicians have been trying without great success to get the public and the Bush administration to take global warming seriously, and to inject the issue into a presidential campaign that so far seems determined to ignore it. 
 Whatever its flaws, ''The Day After Tomorrow''' could do more to elevate the issue than any number of Congressional hearings or high-minded tracts. That's one reason the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan was happy to present the premiere in a theater not far from its Hall of Biodiversity, biodiversity being one of global warming's most likely victims. It's also a reason why mainstream environmental groups have rushed to offer sage commentary on what, after all, is just a mindless summer blockbuster. One group, the Worldwatch Institute, goes so far as to offer on its Web site energy-saving tips on how to ensure ''a better day after tomorrow.'' It exhorts the 20 million Americans the producers hope to draw to the movie to install more efficient shower heads to cut down on hot water use, and to ride bikes to the theater instead of driving.
 Senator John McCain is among the believers, expressing the hope that the film may win a few more votes for a bill he's co-sponsoring with Senator Joseph Lieberman. That bill would slowly begin to reduce industrial carbon-dioxide emissions, which are a huge part of the problem. Despite its over-the-top story, the film does leave you with the unnerving feeling that the natural world deserves far more respect than we and our leaders are giving it. ''We'll take all the help we can get,'' said Mr. McCain, who got 43 votes for his bill the last time around. He plans to bring it back to the Senate floor before Congress's July 4 recess.
 The movie, which opens this weekend, revolves around a scientist named Jack Hall, played with tortured earnestness by Dennis Quaid. Hall's obsessions with climate change have not only busted up a perfectly good marriage but made him a complete pain in the neck to a complacent White House. The real power in this White House is not the well-meaning but vacant president, but a reactionary vice president who is meant, unmistakably, to be Dick Cheney and is played that way by Kenneth Welsh. While Hall keeps warning of disaster, Welsh/Cheney keeps whining that doing anything meaningful -- ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, for instance -- will bankrupt the economy.
 Hall, of course, is right. Before you know it, all hell breaks loose: The polar ice cap splinters, hailstones flatten Tokyo, and tornadoes level Los Angeles. All that is merely a prelude to the Big One, namely the complete devastation of New York City, first by a huge tidal wave, then by an ice storm that flash-freezes everyone and everything in sight, except the wolves in the Bronx Zoo.
 As for the underlying science, the movie rests on the respectable theory that at some point, the melting of the ice sheets in Antarctica or Greenland, or both, could disrupt important oceanic currents that act as heat-carrying conveyor belts, like the Gulf Stream, and in so doing trigger a sharp drop in temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere.
 But most experts believe that a sudden switch from gradual climate change to an instantaneous hemispheric deep freeze, like the one portrayed in the movie, is all but impossible. If the currents did shut down, a more likely result would be a temperature drop of 10 or so degrees, limited mainly to northern Europe.
 Moreover, the film offers viewers who come to it with little knowledge of the subject almost no enlightenment on the underlying causes of global warming. The role of all those S.U.V.'s owned by Hollywood celebrities, for instance, is nowhere mentioned. There is even less on what might be done about it, beyond getting rid of dunderheads like Welsh/Cheney. ''If you are expecting this film to educate you on global warming, forget about it,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, an adviser to Environmental Defense and a Princeton professor whose studies on warming helped put the issue on the map. On the other hand, he adds, the movie may well cause people to start paying attention to the realities of the issue, which ''are plenty bad enough.''
 Moviegoers who find themselves inspired to learn more will benefit from a new book called ''Red Sky at Morning'' by James Gustave Speth, dean of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale. The book, an overview of environmental threats, provides a list of the already observable consequences of warming -- coral bleaching, the gradual loss of coastal salt marshes and wetlands, melting permafrost, vanishing glaciers -- as well as a forecast of even greater calamities, like drought, deforestation and even widespread starvation if nothing is done to arrest the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
 To bring matters back to New York, Dr. Oppenheimer's calculations suggest that business-as-usual will mean the certain loss of every beach in the metropolitan area by the end of the century and -- should one or the other of the big ice sheets in western Antarctica or Greenland begin to go -- the inundation of much of Lower Manhattan as well. This isn't the frightening event portrayed in ''The Day After Tomorrow.'' It's slower and stealthier, though no less dangerous to global stability. Dr. Oppenheimer observes that ''the future is still in our hands.'' That's fine, as long as someone in authority grabs hold of it, which the real-life Bush administration seems no more disposed to do than the movie version.

HEADLINE: Mayflower and Its Vacant Lot to Be Sold

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Every spring, rumors pop like buds on the trees among developers, real estate investors and residents of the Upper West Side that the much coveted Mayflower Hotel site near Lincoln Center is about to be sold for a major new project.
 After more than two decades, the rumors have finally come true about the property, considered by many developers one of the most valuable sites in Manhattan.
 The mysterious Greek family that owns the Mayflower has agreed to sell the 15-story hotel and the long-vacant lot behind it to a development group for a record-setting $401 million, more than twice the going rate for land in Manhattan on a per-square-foot basis.
 The group -- a joint venture of William Lie Zeckendorf and Arthur Zeckendorf, the Whitehall real estate fund of Goldman Sachs and an investment company controlled by Eyal Ofer -- said it had no immediate plans to develop the site. 
 But that kind of statement only adds to the speculation about the property. Rival bidders, real estate experts and local residents say there are plans for the kind of luxurious residential tower that could easily take its place among Central Park West's premier apartment houses, the Century, the San Remo and the Dakota.
 Geto & de Milly, a public relations firm speaking for both the buyer and the seller, confirmed yesterday that a contract had been signed transferring ownership of the land, but gave few details about the deal. Rival bidders, however, said the Zeckendorf brothers had offered $401 million. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
 It is easy to see why the property has drawn so much cash and attention. It sits on an entire city block bounded by Central Park West and Broadway, between 61st and 62nd Streets. Lincoln Center is two short blocks to the west. To the south, there is the Trump International Hotel and Tower and the twin towers of the Time Warner Center, where apartments sell for millions. 
 ''It is probably the best residential site left in New York,'' said Adam R. Rose, president of Rose Associates, which manages 30,000 apartments in New York.
 The deal was yet another sign of New York's robust residential market, which hardly paused for breath during the recession in recent years.
 The $401 million bid from the Zeckendorfs and their partners was far higher than those from a half-dozen other prospective buyers, including Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, Steve Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Edward J. Minskoff, according to executives involved in the sale. 
 William H. Kinn Jr., president of Kinn Real Estate Counselors, said the price ''would reflect a new record at, or close to, double any recent land sale.''
 The Zeckendorfs are paying roughly $690 per buildable square foot. That compares with $276 a foot in a recent high-priced sale at 1563 York Avenue, Mr. Kinn said.
 The acquisition costs are even higher, other bidders said, because there are hefty tax obligations connected to the property and four long-term tenants of the Mayflower have to be bought out.
 And to build a somewhat taller building under the current zoning, the buyers will have to build housing for low-income residents at a site at 210 West 102nd Street near Broadway. Under the terms of the deal, the buyers could get a zoning bonus by building the housing.
 Although they admired the property, many real estate executives said the price was risky. ''If it's your money, this is a level of risk no one would take,'' one executive said. ''If it's someone else's money, the spread between risk and reward is sufficient.''
 The Mayflower is within the Lincoln Square Special Zoning District, which would limit the total height of a new tower on the site. The drab brown Mayflower would presumably be torn down. According to several bidders, models built for the owners by the architects Cesar Pelli & Associates showed two towers of about 34 stories sitting on a five-story base. 
 Hope Cohen, chairwoman of Community Board 7, which covers the community that includes the Mayflower, said the board has long been concerned about the potential size of the project. ''We've had one large-scale development after another, each one done piecemeal,'' she said.
 The owner of the Mayflower has long been described as a faceless entity, the Park Summit Realty Corporation, which was represented by John J. Avlon. As recently as April, Mr. Avlon denied that a sale was imminent. ''We're being approached on a fairly consistent basis,'' he said. ''I would have to tell you that the rumors that contracts are about to circulate would not be accurate.''
 But according to rival bidders and real estate executives, the Mayflower property is owned by the Goulandris family, a wealthy Greek shipping family with a large art collection and an obsession with privacy. They placed all the bidders under a strict order forbidding them to name the owner.
 The Goulandris family and Mr. Avlon began assembling the property in 1973, buying parcel by parcel until they owned the entire block in 1978. They angered preservationists in 1982 when they stripped the 74-year-old Mayflower of almost all of its terra cotta ornamentation. The last building on the Broadway side of the property was demolished in 1987. 
 Mr. Avlon has held a holiday party every year, drawing developers and real estate executives who longed to buy the property. But the real estate boom came in and went in the 1980's, as well as one in the late 1990's. Little happened except that the price kept going up.
 With the number hovering at $300 million or higher in 2001, Donald J. Trump, who has long wanted the Mayflower, said, ''The Mayflower pricing is crazy, but it's certainly a great piece of property.''

HEADLINE: City Diverted $600 Million Set Aside for Low-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, New York City agreed to spend $600 million that it receives from the Battery Park City Authority on low-cost housing. But a report issued on Wednesday said that little if any of that money had actually been spent on housing, because the city had used it for general budget needs.
 The money is paid to the city in lieu of property taxes from Battery Park City, and was set aside in a 1989 agreement to leverage the economic growth from the area into assistance for low-cost housing elsewhere in the city. But instead, according to the report issued by the city's Independent Budget Office, the city relied on a loophole to funnel the money into the city's general fund. 
 The report comes two months after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he wanted to use an estimated $30 million a year from the authority to finance the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as part of $2.8 billion West Side redevelopment project. 
 Housing advocates said they saw the report as a cautionary reminder that promises made regarding public money for low-income programs often take a back seat to other priorities.
 ''We're not accusing malfeasance,'' said Joseph Weisbord, staff director of Housing First!, a coalition of civic, business and labor groups, which asked the Independent Budget Office to conduct the study. ''The issue is really more bad faith on a pretty monumental scale when you think about what Battery Park City was. A broader commitment was made to the public, and it hasn't been fulfilled.''
 In response, Mr. Bloomberg's aides said that every administration since Mayor Edward I. Koch had used the Battery Park funds to plug holes in the city's budget. They also said that Mr. Bloomberg's primary housing focus remained his $3 billion plan, unveiled in Dec. 2002, to build or refurbish 65,000 units of housing.
 ''Over the last 10 years, the city has spent more than $5 billion on affordable housing, nearly a tenfold increase of what was produced by Battery Park City in the last 18 years,'' said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg. ''Mayor Bloomberg has made an unparalleled commitment to affordable housing -- more than $3 billion to build and maintain over 65,000 units for 200,000 New Yorkers.''
 The Battery Park City Authority, which was created by the state in 1968, collects rent and payments from landlords that are made in lieu of taxes, and pays off its debts. Every year, the authority gives the city an average of $55 million.
 The agreement between the city and the authority called for $600 million to be used to produce 60,000 units of housing, but the commitment included an exception. ''If the city determined that it needed the funds to 'maintain fiscal stability ... or existing city services,''' said the Independent Budget Office report, ''the city was allowed to use the funds for those purposes, rather than to increase spending on housing programs.''
 So the city did just that, and by 2003, that $600 million had been used up, according to the report.
 Now the city is setting its sights on a new stream of money from the Battery Park City Authority to help finance its West Side projects, subject to the approval of the city comptroller.
 In particular, the mayor wants $30 million from the authority's excess annual revenues to leverage $350 million in bond debt for the expansion of the Javits Center. That $30 million would come from what the Independent Budget Office estimates will be $88.1 million in revenues in 2005, $81.7 million in 2006 and $57.9 million in subsequent years.
 To housing advocates, though, the balance after subtracting the $30 million would still leave enough for the low-cost housing initiatives -- something that they say the city should have been doing all along.

Questioning of Detainees Produced Little of Value
The questioning of hundreds of Iraqi prisoners last fall in the interrogation center at Abu Ghraib prison yielded very little valuable intelligence. Most of the prisoners apparently were not linked to the insurgency and had been questioned already by the troops who captured them. A1

Three of the seven soldiers now charged with abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison repeatedly committed infractions and disobeyed orders in the six months leading up to the investigation, but received only the mildest of punishments. A13

An Iraqi nuclear scientist touted as the likely interim leader of Iraq withdrew his name from consideration, while the American military captured a close aide of the radical Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr. A11

Linked Car Bombs in Pakistan
One police officer was killed and at least 26 people were wounded in Pakistan when two car bombs went off within 25 minutes and a dozen feet of each other in Karachi.

HEADLINE: Technology Shares Keep Nasdaq and S.&P. 500 Aloft

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average stumbled yesterday on weakness in telecommunications companies, while both the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged higher as investors bought technology names like TiVo.
 The Dow dipped 7.73 points, or 0.08 percent, to 10,109.89. The S.&P. 500 added 1.89 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,114.94, to achieve its fifth consecutive positive day. The Nasdaq gained 11.50 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 1,976.15, its fourth consecutive day of gains. 
 SBC Communications and Verizon Communications restrained the Dow, after Comcast, the cable operator, announced plans to offer telephone service to millions of people by 2006, challenging the core business of the nation's local phone companies. Comcast rose 12 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $29.69. SBC fell 55 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $23.50, and Verizon fell $1.05, to $34.40. They were the Dow's top percentage losers.
 TiVo was among the Nasdaq's most active stocks yesterday because of investors' optimism about the company's prospects for subscriber growth. The company posted a wider quarterly loss on higher costs, but said demand for its digital video recorders rose sharply. Shares of TiVo rose 43 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $7.99. On Tuesday, TiVo backed its financial outlook for fiscal year 2005, and forecast total subscriber additions in its second quarter would triple from year-ago levels.
 On the S.&P. 500, shares of the Boston Scientific Corporation, a maker of coronary stents, jumped $4.46, or 11 percent, to $44.82. The company reported favorable medical research this week on its stents. 
 Also on the S.&P., the drug maker Pfizer rose 15 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $34.89. The Belgian drug company Omega Pharma said it would buy 60 European brands from Pfizer for $163 million.
 Shares of Home Depot advanced after the company, the world's largest home improvement retailer, declared a 25 percent annual increase in its dividend, and said it authorized $1 billion to buy back its stock. Shares of Home Depot ended up 16 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $35.46.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.37 billion shares, below the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 1.59 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq, less than last year's 1.69 billion daily average.
 Stocks declined briefly in early afternoon trading as the government warned that Al Qaeda was plotting a big attack inside the United States, but then recovered.
 Oil remained in the spotlight on Wall Street, as crude prices once again approached $41 a barrel. Two economic reports, one showing that new home sales tumbled in April and the other that durable goods orders were much weaker than forecast last month, kept a lid on buying, analysts said.
 ''The economic data was not healthy, but the markets didn't seize upon it. That to me shows there's underlying strength in the market, when it refuses to acknowledge news of weakness in the economy,'' said Paul Cherney, chief analyst at S.&P. Marketscope in New York.
 Traders also said that investors were digesting the rally of the previous session when the major market benchmarks showed their biggest percentage gains in about two months.
 ''It's good to take a breather today to overcome some worse-than-expected economic reports,'' said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist at the McDonald Financial Group, part of KeyCorp, in Cleveland.
 In the bond market, Treasury prices rose yesterday as the government warnings about possible Al Qaeda attacks spurred flight-to-safety buying, and as housing and durable goods reports were weaker than expected.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 17/32 to 100 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.65 percent, from 4.72 percent on Tuesday.

Museums

''ARCADIA AND METROPOLIS: MASTERWORKS OF GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM FROM THE NATIONALGALERIE BERLIN,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through June 7. In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Nationalgalerie Berlin has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* ''THE ART DECO BOOKBINDINGS OF PIERRE LEGRAIN AND ROSE ADLER,'' New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through June 12. The achievement of two French bookbinders is showcased in this sumptuous exhibition of 45 hand-bound rare editions and manuscripts of major French writers from Stendhal to Breton, commissioned by the couturier, collector and philanthropist Jacques Doucet. Only a few have been exhibited before. Their extraordinary exteriors are usually treated as a single flat surface and decorated with bold geometric designs, accented with crocodile, lizard, snakeskin, metal and gemstone. Legrain and Adler are credited with modernizing bookbinding and the show leaves little doubt that they did. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 4. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays, this Monday only (Memorial Day) and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

* ''CORPORAL IDENTITY -- BODY LANGUAGE,'' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through June 4. Skin, hair, orifices, veins, organs, face, feet, sex, birth, disease, plastic surgery, mind-body connections, human cloning and so on come under the relentless scrutiny of the 200-odd German and American participants in this anthology of attitudes toward the body. The show's premise is that given today's view of the body as a repairable, nearly replaceable, longer-than-life object, artists and artisans are exploring all kinds of ways of expressing new views about it. The old craft standbys like ceramics, wood, glass, metal, fiber and fabric play important roles, but so do advanced new techniques and media, some derived from medical and computer technology. Leave the children at home. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; students and 65+, $5 (Glueck).

''FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE WORLD: HINE, ULMANN, STRAND, ARBUS AND THE ETHICAL CULTURE FIELDSTON SCHOOL,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through July 18. A persuasive pitch for the influence of the high-minded, progressive Ethical Culture Fieldston School on four famous photographers: Lewis W. Hine, Doris Ulmann, Paul Strand and Diane Arbus. As a young teacher there, Hine (1874-1940) discovered his own photographic talent and went on to become one of the great documentary photographers of the poor and oppressed in the United States. Ulmann's tenure at the school strengthened her budding social consciousness; Strand was directly mentored by Hine; and Arbus, who received all her formal education there, developed her own vision of the outsider side of everyday life. Along with rather dull photographs of the school, examples of their work are displayed. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Glueck).

''OPEN HOUSE: WORKING IN BROOKLYN,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Aug. 15. This all-Brooklyn show of new art has been timed to coincide with the inauguration of the museum's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza. With 300 pieces installed in the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, and spilling over into the permanent collection galleries, it's a very crowded affair. It's also all over the place in terms of media, styles and themes, not to mention quality; the good, the bad and the iffy mingle. Still there's plenty of good work by artists you know and by some you don't, drawn from across a borough that has many different art worlds. Also on view, though not part of the show, is Alexis Rockman's mural-size painting of Brooklyn 3,000 years in the future, submerged under water as a result of global warming. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

''THE PIERRE AND MARIA-GAETANA MATISSE COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710), through June 26, 2005, in three installments. This heterogeneous array of paintings, sculptures and works on paper was once owned by the Manhattan-based art dealer Pierre Matisse (1900-1989) and his wife, Maria-Gaetana (1943-2001). Most of the material came to the Met after Mrs. Matisse's death. It includes sexy paintings by Balthus, Magritte and Wifredo Lam, batty ones by Jean Dubuffet, and a feminist icon in a self-portrait by Leonora Carrington. A selection of the rich, calm, pleasurable art of Henri Matisse, Pierre's father, takes pride of place. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* ''ROTH TIME: A DIETER ROTH RETROSPECTIVE,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, through June 7. This exhaustive, exhausting but ultimately astounding exhibition offers total immersion in the art of the German-born, Swiss-based multimedia dynamo Dieter Roth (1930-1998), who not only erased the line between art and life, but also fused them into a single insoluble entity. With nearly 400 works of painting, drawing, prints, sculpture, assemblage, collage, music, poetry, film, photography, video and sound, and using every imaginable kind of found object or material -- foodstuffs included -- the exhibition moves through 50 years of incessant, obsessive art-making with remarkable clarity. It culminates in a presentation of five enormous installation pieces at the Modern's little-sister institution, P.S. 1, that reveal a seemingly boundless universe of artistic activity and a radically new picture of an artist at work. MoMA Queens hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50. P.S. 1 hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $2 (Smith).

* ''FRED WILSON, OBJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS: 1979-2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through July 4. Mr. Wilson, who represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale, made his reputation with conceptually pointed, technically polished and visually engaging installations and objects that focused on excavating American racial history and illustrating the exclusionary power of cultural institutions shaped by social, economic and ideological domination. Elements of his subversive museum projects appear in this traveling show, along with sculptures and a fine, short new film. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, $1 (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

* ''GARDEN IN DELFT: WILLEM DE KOONING LANDSCAPES 1928-1988,'' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through June 26. For the centennial of Willem de Kooning's birth, this exhibition of 14 canvases represents a jubilant skip through his long career, with emphasis on his relationship to landscape. Never mind that the suggestion of abstracted still lifes sometimes seems equally strong, especially in two unfamiliar canvases from the late 1930's. A third painting, titled ''Still Life'' and dated circa 1929, may well be the earliest de Kooning painting most of us have ever seen. Its crisp shapes and deep primary colors suggest the influence of Joseph Stella and look forward to David Hockney. A second de Kooning tribute, at the Richard Gray Gallery upstairs through tomorrow, features four paintings from the 1940's and 50's that lean toward, or land in, the realm of figuration (Smith).

* JEFF KOONS, ''Highlights of 25 Years,'' C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 5. This excellent 27-piece survey touches on all phases of Mr. Koons's career, including greatest hits like the basketballs mysteriously hovering in aquarium tanks; the Mylar ''Rabbit'' balloon cast in shiny stainless steel; and the sexy blonde embracing the Pink Panther in glazed ceramic. The climax of the show is the 10-foot-tall ''Balloon Dog.'' Made of stainless steel and coated in coppery translucent orange, it is a breathtaking symbol of the inflationary euphoria and anxiety of our times (Ken Johnson).

JORGE PARDO, Lever House Lobby Gallery, 400 Park Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets, there is no phone through July 31. If Ikea sold sculptures, they might look like the ones Mr. Pardo installed in the lobby of this famous Modernist high-rise: squat wooden constructions resembling the skeletons of biomorphic chairs, with attractive colored glass lights nested like eggs in the depressions where you sit. Curiously, the plywood elements that touch the floor have been cut into the silhouettes of animal feet: hooves, bear paws or tentacles (Johnson).

FRANK STELLA, ''Exotic Birds,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, through June 5. Looking at Mr. Stella's three big, splashily painted reliefs from a 1976 series, it is easy to forget how shockingly flamboyant they seemed in their day. Now, with their curvy, tilting forms cut from honeycomb-core aluminum panels, and neatly puzzled together within wide slanting frames, they seem prettily demure compared to what has happened since in painting as well as in sculpture (Johnson).

''WEEGEE'S STORY,'' Ubu, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 23. Wielding his 4-by-5 Speed Graphic with a master's touch, the New York tabloid photographer Weegee probably shot more murders and fires during his heyday, the 1930's and 40's, than anyone in the business. But his passion for the city also drew him to its many other photo opportunities: the strivers and the homeless, festivities and freaks, politicians and celebrities, posh avenues and mean streets. This show of 220 Weegee vintage photographs, culled from a collection assembled over a 30-year period by the Berlin dealer Hendrik Berinson, reveals his remarkable range (Glueck).

Galleries: Chelsea

ANDREA CHAMPLIN/RACHEL URKOWITZ, Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, through June 18. The two artists appear in separate rooms, but they share a devotion to energetically animated abstraction. Ms. Champlin's big, explosive paintings of pixilated, balloonlike volumes and other bulbous forms are based on digitally scrambled self-portrait photographs. Ms. Urkowitz makes lively collages on large, irregularly shaped sheets of paper, combining passages of Cubist crystallization, biomorphic Surrealism and trippy doodlelike forms. She also presents a series of goofy, free-standing sculptures: oversize cartoon daisies neatly laser-cut from sheets of colored plastic (Johnson).

* WILLEM DE KOONING, ''A Centennial Celebration,'' Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-1111, through June 19. This beautifully installed 40-work survey begins with several previously unexhibited late ''ribbon'' paintings with their wafting, tangling strands of color that intimate both landscapes and still lifes but are, above all, abstract. The presentation seems to argue that de Kooning, like his younger colleague Philip Guston, would still have ample art historical stature had he made no other paintings than these, produced during the decade before he descended into Alzheimer's disease. But the show then backtracks through most of the artist's development, making the counter argument by demonstrating the many divergent and crisscrossing paths he took to reach his final distillation (Smith).

EDGAR JERINS, Tatistcheff, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4547, through June 12. The dramatically lighted realist images that Mr. Jerins draws, in charcoal on sheets of paper measuring about 5 by 8 feet, look like scenes from novels by Russell Banks. There's an air of grim desperation in his self-portrait with his two daughters and his pregnant, exhausted-looking wife, posed in a cramped bedroom and subtitled, ''We Need to Move.'' The portrait of a hunter with a shotgun in his tidy living room -- with a little girl and two women, one pregnant -- projects an unsettling hint of possible violence (Johnson).

DOUG OHLSON, Andre Zarre, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 255-0202, through June 19. Pure formalism with an emphasis on color is not the most fashionable approach to painting these days, which makes Mr. Ohlson's pulsating stripe paintings all the more gratifying to behold. On horizontal canvases, the artist, who is 78, paints vertical bands, some hard-edged, some brushy, in hues that range from glowing sherbets to deep, near-black blues. He orchestrates a rich wedding of Puritanism and hedonism (Johnson).

* CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN, ''Images a la Carte,'' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through July 2. Made mostly on blue-lined notebook pages the size of index cards, using pencil, ink and watercolor, these wonderfully lively and keenly observed drawings depict shrimp cocktails, crabcakes, salads, sandwiches, a banana split, tarts, cheesecakes and other elaborate restaurant fare, interspersed with simpler items like a lemon slice, an apple core and a piece of cornbread. Mr. Oldenburg drew them; his longtime partner, Ms. van Bruggen, contributed ideas (Johnson).

''SYMMETRIES,'' Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through June 30. The four sculptors in this fine exhibition are like cousins with shared as well as divergent interests. The show features a vibrant and whirling new wall painting by Sol LeWitt; an elegant arrangement of three-dimensional geometrical elements by Barry LeVa; a surprising early Cubist assemblage of unfinished boards by Richard Artschwager; and a conflation of vernacular architecture and Constructivist sculpture by Siah Armajani (Johnson).

* ''TERRORVISION,'' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 31. Terror comes in all sizes, shapes and degrees, and this show runs the gamut, with exhibits by some 50-odd artists facing up to their most ''extreme fears'' -- from the general threats posed by Al Quaeda and its franchises to the traumas of personal catastrophe like toothache, breast cancer and heart operations. The gallery's multidisciplinary emphasis is manifest in film, video, audio and computer-generated creations, along with media as simple as prints and photographs. It's a mix of successful efforts and some that don't quite make it, the lightweight with the more substantial. But it's alive and kicking (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

''DOGS + CATS,'' American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530, through June 12. This lively exhibition includes more than 60 feline or canine representations in two or three dimensions. Some are by self-taught artists. A big colorful painting by Jean Metcalf has cats and dogs in it but features a formal parade of rats carrying wounded birds on stretchers. Many are by unknown craftsmen, like the smoothly carved wooden head of a boxer with brown glass eyes and the functional dog-shaped bench in the form of a wooden slab with branches that have been turned into legs (Johnson).

* TONY FEHER, ''The Wart on the Bosom of Mother Nature,'' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through July 2. Mr. Feher makes wryly poetic and visually enchanting sculptures out of the least promising of materials: plastic and glass bottles and bottle caps, foam packing material, bent wire, soda stacking crates, marbles, colored string, crushed aluminum foil and stones. A pyramid of green plastic strawberry baskets has a luminous, dematerialized look. A collection of brown bottles stopped by red and blue marbles is captivatingly sensuous and obliquely political (Johnson).

ANISH KAPOOR, Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, through June 25. Mr. Kapoor is the master of a certain sculptural paradox. He makes abstract sculptures that are powerfully and often luxuriously physical, but which have an apparently immaterial dimension. The four concave sides of ''Whiteout'' bend inward to what seems an impossible extent. ''Vortex,'' a shiny black circle built into the wall, recedes inward like a whirlpool toward a deep, dark and apparently limitless space. The effect is hair-raising (Johnson).

LAMAR PETERSON, ''Milk and Cookies,'' Deitch Projects, 26 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through June 5. The basic ingredients of Mr. Peterson's paintings seem friendly enough: tropical vacation spots, cute pets, quality family time. So does the tasty, candy-colored cartoon-realist style he has couched them in. But something -- maybe everything -- is wrong in this inorganically Disneyesque world, populated exclusively by African-Americans and robots. The racial dimension stands out at first, but the stereotypes he deals with are those of middle-class culture at large, one glutted on fantasies of perfection and excess (Cotter).

HOWARDENA PINDELL, ''Works on Paper 1968-2004,'' Sragow, 73 Spring Street, (212) 219-1793, through June 5. Ms. Pindell belongs to an understudied generation of African-American artists who were working with abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960's and 70's. The earliest drawings in this jewel-like show are composed of sequences of words and numbers arranged in patterns on graph paper and suggest roots in postminimalism. Later she made collages of small circles, hand-punched from sheets of blank or printed paper. In her recent three-dimensional prints, the dots are suspended in clusters on grids made of threads, and the early words and numbers become the names and coordinates of constellations (Cotter).

GERHARD RICHTER, ''Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo,'' Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through June 26. Here is one of the very few sculptures made by Mr. Richter, the immensely influential German painter, during his career. It consists of two plaster heads cast from life, slathered in gray paint and mounted on pedestals. One head is Mr. Richter's; the other, his fellow German painter Blinky Palermo. Facing each other with closed eyes, in a gallery that is empty but for a small study version in a shadow box on the wall, the faux classical sculptures create an ambience of dry existential ennui (Johnson).

T. L. SOLIEN, ''Hollow,'' Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161, through June 5. If you were around in the early 80's you may remember Mr. Solien's intriguingly quirky paintings from the 1983 Whitney Biennial. His last show in New York was 14 years ago, so it is good to see that he is still making beguiling paintings while living in Wisconsin. Mixing abstraction, appropriated cartoons, and illustrations and images of homey, old-time interiors, the paintings create a haunting narrative blend of the domestic and the hallucinatory (Johnson).

Other Galleries

''THE DEVONSHIRE INHERITANCE: FIVE CENTURIES OF COLLECTING AT CHATSWORTH,'' Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through June 20. The stately English country home Chatsworth has been occupied since its construction in 1552 by the Cavendish family, headed by a long succession of dukes and duchesses of Devonshire. They have enriched it with notable collections of fine and decorative arts, an awesome library of books and manuscripts, scientific instruments, silver, furniture and needlework. A glimpse of these treasures is provided by this show, which has works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Durer and Lucian Freud; books and drawings by Andrea Palladio; a spectacular jewelry ensemble worn at the coronation of Czar Alexander II and much else to light up the eyes of the most jaded connoisseur. The next step is a visit to Chatsworth itself, still a private home for the Cavendishes but very much open to the public (Glueck).

''WORLDSCAPES: THE ART OF ERRO,'' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through July 17. The career of Erro, a prodigiously productive Pop-style painter said to be Iceland's most acclaimed artist, is featured in a nearly 50-year retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery. It will not persuade you that he is a great painter, but you may be taken by his manic graphic activity, antic humor and promiscuous sampling from popular culture. If so, you may also want to see ''Femmes Fatales'' at the Goethe-Institut, 1014 Fifth Avenue, at 83rd Street, (212) 439-8700, through July 17, which offers 10 colorful paintings from an Erro series devoted to female comic book superheroes (Johnson).

Last Chance

ROBERT INDIANA, ''Peace Paintings,'' Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through tomorrow. Mr. Indiana's colorful new paintings are about peace, or rather the absence of peace. Each diamond-shaped canvas features a circle, like a life-saver, bearing block-lettered sentences about the loss of peace: ''Peace falls in terror,'' ''Peace dives in oblivion,'' ''Peace plunges in despair.'' Within each circle is the familiar forked peace sign. With their rich colors, punchy compositions and resonant echoes of the Vietnam era, these pictures should be disseminated as posters (Johnson).

* ''GUSTAV KLUTSIS AND VALENTINA KULAGINA: PHOTOGRAPHY AND MONTAGE AFTER CONSTRUCTIVISM'' AND ''WAR IN IRAQ: THE COORDINATES OF CONFLICT, PHOTOGRAPHS BY VII,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Sunday. Provocatively buttressed by two smaller shows, these imposing exhibitions dovetail into a chillingly informative examination of the roles of photography in art, history and science. The political, the personal and the formal alternate energetically in the first exhibition in this country devoted to Klutsis and Kulagina, who were married, and is primarily the tale of an artist whose striking photomontage posters helped establish the graphic look of the young Soviet Union, until Stalin had him killed. ''War in Iraq'' makes manifest the kinds of events that swirled around but rarely registered within the work of Klutsis or Kulagina. Starting with the ruins at ground zero, 53 images by nine intrepid photojournalists associated with the agency VII record the havoc that war, violence, dictatorial regimes and fanatical faith have wrought in our own time. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Smith).

LEONARD KOSCIANSKI, OK Harris, 383 West Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-3600, through tomorrow. For two decades Mr. Koscianski has been painting dreamy, slightly cartoonish, Magic Realist pictures of dogs, boars, hawks and other wild animals in violent Darwinian action. This show finds him in top form. It also includes glowing images of butterflies and tropical flowers that radiate a lush erotic heat (Johnson).

''STAGING THE ORIENT: VISIONS OF THE EAST AT LA SCALA AND THE METROPOLITAN OPERA,'' Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606, through Sunday. For centuries opera was one of Europe's more popular theatrical forms. And while music was certainly a big part of its appeal, for many fans the real attraction lay in spectacular stage sets. These were often designed by leading academic painters and the results, set deep in the past and in places remote from Europe, were examples of how one culture -- Western in this case -- invents exotic, often demeaning visions of others. The Dahesh show considers such matters with the help of prints and drawings and some spectacular costumes worn by famous singers, past and present. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9, students and 62+, $4. (Cotter).

* WHITNEY BIENNIAL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Sunday. Easily the best biennial in a long time. The spirit is upbeat and ingratiating -- almost polite -- on the surface at least, with a utopian streak and a youth-heavy emphasis on gloss and craft. There's plenty of painting and drawing, ratifying the much-hyped trend, and multigenerational work, stressing ecstatic engagement and meticulousness. But the real story is the stress on the handmade in general, on materiality in whatever medium -- a change from the politics-heavy, slacker installations of recent years. The cross-generational dialogue is an interesting subtext. Among the younger set utopia does not mean 1960's-style radicalism; it implies something unattainable, except perhaps in a hand-me-down form, and therefore smaller and inherently poignant. Look for a few standout works from artists both younger and older, including Yayoi Kusama, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Julie Mehretu, Jim Hodges, Eve Sussman, Raymond Pettibon, Slater Bradley, Robert Mangold and Stan Brakhage, who died last year. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Kimmelman).

* DAISY YOUNGBLOOD, McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 688-5951, through today. Ms. Youngblood, who is in her late 50's and lives in Costa Rica, won a MacArthur award last year for her exquisitely sensitive, usually small ceramic sculptures of animals and human spiritual gurus. Here are 18 works dating from 1975 to 2003 in which the interest is mainly in the magical tension between the raw clay and the lifelike, psychologically evocative forms and gestures of animal and human bodies (Johnson).

HEADLINE: If Oil Supplies Were Disrupted, Then ...

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 27 

 BODY:
With demand high, supplies squeezed, prices climbing and refineries already running flat out, what if something really went wrong? Something like a terror attack on crucial oil installations in Saudi Arabia or in the United States, or something less sinister but just as disruptive, like a fire or accident at a major refinery or port or a flare-up of civil or labor turmoil in Nigeria or Venezuela? 
 Industry experts say that the drum-tight American fuel market has become unusually vulnerable to any such nasty surprises, because there is little spare capacity available and because traders, executives and policy makers are nervous about terrorism and other threats -- to the point that crude oil now carries a ''risk premium'' of 12 to 25 percent, analysts estimate. 
 ''The problem is, we've already tasted some of these events in one form or another,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy analysis company. ''The threat of an oil shock is very tangible. If an oil trader wants to think about risk, all he has to do is turn on the television.'' 
 Just how big a risk premium traders will demand on oil is a subjective calculation, driven up or down from day to day by news developments. One energy strategist, Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Company in New York, estimated that worries about Nigeria contributed about $1 a barrel; Venezuela another $3; the situation in Iraq, $4 more; and jitters about new trouble in Saudi Arabia, $5 a barrel. ''In a psychologically charged market, bad news travels faster than good news,'' Mr. Gheit said. 
 Without the black cloud of vulnerability from the market, many analysts say, crude might trade for $30 or $35 today instead of nearly $40.
 Gasoline prices, in turn, reflect worries about crude oil volatility overlaid with jitters about refineries and low inventories.
 To be sure, there are important differences between conditions today and 30 years ago, when tensions in the Middle East disrupted oil supplies. Few economists see much danger of the rationing, gas lines, sharp inflation and deep recession of those years recurring today. Energy is a smaller component of the overall economy now, prices are still fairly low in inflation-adjusted terms, and measures taken after the oil shocks of the 1970's provide some protection, most notably the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with a capacity of 700 million barrels. 
 Even so, President Bush's decision to fill the reserve after the terror attacks of September 2001 has been one of the factors driving up oil prices in recent months, along with reports that China, which recently surpassed Japan as the second-largest importer of oil, is going ahead with plans to build its own petroleum reserve. The Bush administration has resisted calls to release oil from the American reserve. 
 The reserve now holds about 660 million barrels, making it the world's largest source of stockpiled petroleum. Other domestic stocks, held commercially in refineries, pipelines or storage tanks, stand at about 299 million barrels, about 5 percent below the average level of the last five years, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 Analysts say another immediate issue is the ability to turn the available oil into fuels. Consolidation over the last two decades has cut the number of refineries in the United States in half, to 153 from 301, and the survivors are working at well more than 90 percent of maximum capacity.
 Even a small disruption, like a fire or maintenance mishap, could quickly result in a temporary price spike. For example, when a relatively small 85,000-barrel-a-day refinery operated by Valero Energy in Krotz Springs, La., shut for less than a day earlier this month because of a power failure, gasoline futures prices shot up by 5 cents a gallon. 
 No relief is in sight. ''We haven't built a new refinery in this country for three decades,'' Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon Mobil, the nation's largest energy company, told reporters this week after the company's annual meeting. ''Refineries historically haven't made money, and I don't see a lessening of environment restrictions.''
 As a result, the United States now imports about 10 percent of its refined gasoline, mainly from Europe and South America. But many foreign refineries have struggled to adapt as many states have switched to requiring cleaner-burning blends of gasoline this year. 
 Political tensions in Venezuela, historically a leading supplier of both crude oil and gasoline to the United States, have made matters worse. Opposition to President Hugo Chavez within the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, resulted in a management purge that hobbled the company, to the point that the country has recently had to import gasoline. 
 Analysts estimate that Venezuela is now producing only 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, down from more than 3 million before the political crisis; much of the missing production would have been destined for the American market.
 Newer to the picture are the growing concerns about sabotage and unrest spilling over from Iraq to other nations in the gulf. ''The real fear factor is at the heart, within Saudi Arabia,'' said Fareed Mohamedi, chief economist at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''The idea that terrorists could target specific facilities within the kingdom brings the fear to a new level.''
 Attacks in early May that killed five Western contractors in Yanbu, a Saudi refinery and petrochemical center on the Red Sea coast, did not disrupt oil supplies directly, but they created anxiety about the security of other facilities, not least because Saudi officials have suggested that the attacks may have been the work of a regrouping Qaeda terror network that intends to strike again. 
 ''That's why all the Saudi talk about increasing output has already been discounted without having a downward effect on prices,'' Mr. Gheit of Oppenheimer said. ''It's a psychologically charged market that's trading on the fear that the O.K. Corral atmosphere of Iraq could spread to Saudi Arabia.'' 
 A year ago, analysts say, the world could manage without Iraq's two million barrels or so of daily production, but recovery in much of the developed world and roaring growth in China and India mean that the global market now needs every drop. 
 In fact, global oil demand is expected to grow faster this year than at any time since 1988, rising by about 2 million barrels, to 80.6 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. So the production gains from the painstaking reconstruction of Iraq's oil infrastructure in the last year have already been absorbed by export markets. A failed attack in April on an important Iraqi offshore terminal was a reminder of how tenuous those gains might prove to be.
 Along with security concerns abroad, the fear of attacks on energy hubs within the United States also haunts the market. While there is little public evidence that such attacks are being planned, the F.B.I. issued a warning in March that Al Qaeda might be preparing to blow up pipelines and refineries in Texas ahead of the November elections. 
 The Houston area, with two of the four largest oil refineries in the United States and much of the infrastructure used to transport oil and natural gas around the country, has been mentioned as the most sensitive potential target. The city is also the intellectual and financial center for the global energy industry. 
 ''A possible attack is absolutely a concern for us,'' said Rick Hagar, spokesman for the East Harris County Manufacturers Association, which represents 125 industrial concerns along the Houston Ship Channel, among them refineries, shipping companies and petrochemical plants. ''It's something to worry about night and day.''

HEADLINE: New Evidence Of Momentum For Economy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
The economy grew slightly faster than previously thought in the first quarter of the year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, providing fresh evidence of momentum heading into the summer. 
 Gross domestic product from January through March increased at a 4.4 percent annual rate, the department said. That was a gain from both the 4.2 percent pace first estimated for the quarter a month ago and the 4.1 percent growth rate registered in the final quarter of 2003. 
 The gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States. While the latest reading was just shy of the 4.5 percent pace that some analysts had forecast, it nevertheless represented a solid performance.
 Although consumers and the federal government did their part to support the economy in the first quarter, economists said, the better reading mostly reflected stronger investment by businesses to build up inventories.
 Analysts expect the economy to grow at a healthy pace in the current April-to-June quarter. But growth, they said, could be held back by higher energy costs, which could crimp consumer and business spending.
 ''Higher energy prices aren't preventing us from having good growth, but the gain would be stronger without that impact,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management.
 Under most forecasts, growth will be enough to generate jobs and keep the economy on track for a projected 4.7 percent gain in G.D.P. for all of 2004, which would be the strongest showing in 20 years, analysts said.
 The Labor Department, meanwhile, reported that new applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week by a seasonally adjusted 3,000, to 344,000, another hopeful sign for a labor market recovery.
 Payrolls, which had been posting lackluster gains, expanded by 288,000 in April on top of a hefty increase in March, leading economists to believe that the long-awaited recovery in the labor market is occurring.
 With the recovery firmly rooted and inflation stirring, a growing number of economists expect the Federal Reserve to order its first rate increase in more than four years next month.
 An inflation gauge tied to the gross domestic product report showed core prices -- excluding food and energy -- rose at a rate of 1.7 percent in the first quarter. Although that was lower than the 2 percent pace first estimated, it was still a pickup from the 1.2 percent growth rate in the previous quarter.
 Consumer spending rose in the first quarter at a 3.9 percent rate -- slightly stronger than previously estimated and up from a 3.2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.
 Businesses increased spending on equipment and software in the first quarter at a 9.8 percent rate. While that was less brisk than first estimated and down from a 14.9 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, it was still a sizable advance.
 Stronger inventory-building by businesses in the first quarter added 0.75 of a percentage point to the gross domestic product, compared with a the gain of 0.27 percentage point that was first estimated. That was a major reason that first-quarter growth was revised upward.
 Military spending by the federal government grew at a 13.2 percent pace in the first quarter, down from the previous estimate but a big increase from the previous quarter's 3 percent growth rate.

HEADLINE: Haitian and Dominican Communities Reach Out to Flooded Homelands

BYLINE: By JANON FISHER

 BODY:
For the past two days, Ricot Dupuy, the manager of the radio station Soleil D'Haiti in Brooklyn, has been fielding inquiries from concerned callers.
 In Manhattan, the sidewalk outside the offices of Alianza Dominicana in Washington Heights is all but blocked by folding cots, bags of rice, canned goods and children's toys. A shipping container sits by the curb, its doors open and awaiting donations for the victims of the floods that devastated towns along the Haitian-Dominican border earlier this week. 
 The heavy rains, which swept away buildings, unearthed graves and killed as many as 2,000 people in the remote towns along the border, have brought together two of New York's immigrant groups as they await word on the fate of family and friends and mobilize relief efforts. 
 ''It's really bad, one of the worst I've seen,'' said Mr. Dupuy. ''People want to know how many died.''
 Batey Relief Alliance, a group of 15 Haitian and Dominican groups on the island, and Alianza Dominicana are working together to raise money, collect medicine and organize efforts to help the victims.
 In Flatbush, Brooklyn, Haitians struggled to get information on what was destroyed, who had died and who was homeless. At L'Unique, a Haitian restaurant on Nostrand Avenue, Joseph Halcine said that he had heard about the destruction caused by the flooding, but that he did not realize its extent until he saw it on television.
 ''I knew it had flooded, but when I saw it on TV it killed me inside,'' Mr. Halcine said.
 He said that he had not realized that the Haitian border towns of Fond Verrettes and Mapou had been struck hard by the floods. ''I have a couple of friends that live near there. I have to give them a call,'' said Mr. Halcine.
 He said that even if it turned out he did not know any of the victims of the flood, he would still be concerned.
 ''I'm still worried because we are all Haitian. We are all brothers and sisters,'' he said.
 Ulrick Galliard, the executive director of Batey, said that the flood hit his country particularly hard because it came so soon after the departure of the former president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the violence that followed.
 ''We had a political hurricane earlier this year. It's been one calamity after another. The country really has suffered a great deal,'' said Henry Frank, the executive director of the Haitian Centers Council, an alliance of Haitian groups throughout the United States.
 Moises Perez, the executive director of Alianza Dominicana, said that it had started accepting donations on Wednesday and had already filled 200 boxes with donations for the Dominican town of Jimani.
 He encouraged people to donate food, money and medicine, particularly multivitamins, eye wash and stomach medicine. His group is hoping to send the supplies on an airline by the beginning of next week.
 Jose Collado, 58, an unemployed cook who is a Dominican native, stopped by Alianza's office in Washington Heights yesterday to donate food, clothes and shoes.
 ''We are Dominican. Everybody is family,'' said Mr. Collado. ''As something happened over there and we help them, something could happen over here and they could help us.''

A Mill Town Wakes Up
 It has been five years since the opening of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, the 13-acre center for performing and fine arts in the tiny Berkshire town of North Adams, Mass. So now Mass MOCA, as it is popularly known, is taking stock of its accomplishments. 
 ''We've changed the neighborhood,'' said Joseph Thompson, the museum's founding director. ''You don't have to scratch too deeply to find pockets of poverty, but the picture today is far different.''
 Once a sleepy, economically depressed mill town, with the state's highest unemployment rate and lowest downtown occupancy rate, North Adams has changed. According to state government figures, unemployment has declined to less than 6 percent from more than 18 percent in the late 1980's. A study conducted by the museum shows that the storefront occupancy rate, which was below 30 percent in the mid-1990's, now stands at 75 percent. In the last five years eight restaurants have opened in North Adams.
 About 120,000 people a year visit Mass MOCA, the center says, close to the figure projected in 1999. Since then it has organized 45 exhibitions, including the creation of 54 new works of art. It has also presented about 300 performances, film screenings and works in progress.
 It benefits from its proximity to Tanglewood in Lenox, summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge; Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket; and the Williams College Museum of Art and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown. But Mass MOCA tries to create its own buzz with an artist-in-residence program and performing arts events. 
 It also seems to be attracting a younger audience to the area. While the average age of visitors to the Berkshires is 58, Mr. Thompson says, it is 42 for Mass MOCA's visitors.
 Because of the sheer size of the center -- a collection of light-filled 19th-century factory buildings, once the home of the Sprague Electric Company -- Mass MOCA is able to offer artists plenty of space to design, fabricate and install large, complex works. With its performing arts facilities and its own artist housing, it has lured visual and performance artists like Shirin Neshat, Lorna Simpson, Tim Hawkinson and Laurie Anderson.
 ''I'm seeing a striking number of art tour groups from different museums around the country,'' Mr. Thompson added. ''Austin, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles. They realize there's a lot to do and see around here.''

A River Runs Through It
 It's almost unheard of for the work of a contemporary artist to appropriate museum wall space occupied by the likes of Picasso, Matisse, Leger or Mondrian. But that's just what happened this week at the Art Institute of Chicago.
 On Tuesday curators at the museum, working with the conceptual artist Roni Horn, installed a series of her Thames River photographs, which will be on view through Sept. 5.
 In 1999 Ms. Horn made two trips to London. Working from a riverboat, she photographed the Thames at various central London sites, in different weather and at various times of the day and night.
 Her exhibition begins in the Art Institute's contemporary galleries and, like a river itself, wends through the museum, replacing works that have long been on view in the European and American modern painting and sculpture galleries.
 Ms. Horn's photographs also greet visitors at the museum's ticket desks, in hallways and stairwells, and in its library. 
 ''When I was installing the photographs, I overheard children pointing to them,'' Ms. Horn said. ''It was like a treasure hunt.'' By hanging her works in close proximity to masters like O'Keeffe, Magritte, Pollock, de Kooning, Matisse and Picasso, she added, ''you look at what's there a little differently.'' 
 James Rondeau, curator of contemporary art at the Art Institute, worked with Ms. Horn. He said that this was the first time that the museum had done anything like this. ''It traverses a number of nontraditional boundaries,'' he said. ''The genius of the installation is that there is a gentle cadence and rhythm to it. Rather than challenging the museum or the works of art, Roni is more interested in amplifying and reflecting upon what is already there.'' 
 Douglas Druick, the curator of European paintings, agreed to take down some works in his galleries. It was not ''as if one artist had the run of the place,'' he said. ''It was all a very respectful dialogue.''
 Since the installation of the photographs, Mr. Druick has noticed the responsiveness of viewers. ''They're surprised to find them,'' he said. ''Yet they definitely heighten the state of looking.''

Letter From London
 Yesterday the Courthauld Institute of Art in London announced the appointment of Deborah Swallow as its new director.
 Ms. Swallow, who has been the director of collections and the curator of the Asian department at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, will take over from James Cuno. Mr. Cuno resigned in January to become director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Ms. Swallow will begin her new job in October.

HEADLINE: 2 Deals Could Reshape Telecom Business in Japan

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 27 

 BODY:
The Softbank Corporation of Japan said Thursday that it was acquiring the country's third-largest fixed-line phone company, while the United States investment fund Carlyle Group said it was negotiating to buy a stake in a unit of the mobile phone company KDDI. 
 The two multibillion-dollar deals could reshape Japan's telecommunications landscape.
 Softbank, a broadband Internet service provider, said that it would enter the telecommunications market by buying Japan Telecom from a group of investors led by Ripplewood Holdings, based in New York, for 340 billion yen ($3 billion). 
 Carlyle, meanwhile, is considering buying a share of KDDI's DDI Pocket, a provider of a simplified mobile phone and wireless data service that analysts say has strong potential in developing countries where more costly cellphones are beyond the means of most consumers. 
 The sale of Japan Telecom and the DDI negotiations announced on Thursday cap a busy week for deal makers in Japan's telecommunications market. Just two days earlier, the world's top mobile phone company, the Vodafone Group, announced that it would pay as much as $4.7 billion for the part of its Japanese operations that it does not already own. 
 The deals highlight the renewed interest by private equity funds and other investors in Japan amid signs that the country's economic recovery is gathering momentum and promise to enliven what is already one of the world's most rapidly developing telecommunications markets. 
 For Ripplewood, the sale of Japan Telecom brings a quick and profitable turnaround on one of its biggest investments in Japan. Ripplewood bought a controlling stake in Japan Telecom for $2.33 billion just last year in the largest leveraged buyout in Japan's history. Ripplewood borrowed about 80 percent of the money from other investors led by J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. 
 Over all, it was ''a very good investment for Ripplewood,'' the company's chief executive, Timothy C. Collins, said, though he declined to elaborate on precisely how much his investors made. Ripplewood first made its mark here by purchasing the failed Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in 2000. Renamed Shinsei Bank, the company went public in February. 
 The purchase of Japan Telecom also represents another sharp change in course for Softbank, whose 46-year-old founder, Masayoshi Son, is considered one of Japan's most aggressive deal makers. The company struck gold as an early investor in the Internet portal Yahoo and spent much of the 1990's trying to turn those profits into larger riches as an Internet incubator.
 Recently, Softbank has refashioned itself into a provider of low-priced broadband Internet service with an aggressive marketing campaign that deploys an army of salespeople into city streets thrusting free modems and sign-up packages at passers-by. 
 Softbank suffered a net loss of 107 billion yen ($965 million) last year as the costs of that campaign outweighed profits. Nonetheless, the aggressive tactics have made it one of the leaders in Japan's broadband market, with four million subscribers, mostly households.
 With the acquisition of Japan Telecom, Softbank expands its household customer base and adds a smaller, but potentially more lucrative, base of corporate clients. Japan Telecom has 170,000 corporate customers, including giants like the Japan Railway companies. 
 ''Until now, we only went after individuals,'' Mr. Son told reporters in Tokyo. ''Now, we'll go after corporate clients to become No.1 in broadband.'' 
 After the acquisition, Softbank will have revenue of 1 trillion yen ($9 billion), the company said. 
 Japan Telecom also has positive cash flow, some 40 billion yen a year, that Softbank can tap to finance its expansion. In addition, Softbank gains a network of 7,456 miles of optical fiber and a team of telecommunications engineers. 
 Analysts applauded the deal. Shares of Softbank rose 0.7 percent, to 4,160 yen. 
 ''They have complementary businesses: one is primarily corporate and the other is predominately consumer,'' said Kirk Boodry, a telecommunications analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. ''Softbank is doing this because they have one product and one customer base and they are trying to diversify away from that with a better customer mix.''
 Softbank has marketed itself as a low-cost broadband provider. If it adopts the same tactics as it takes over Japan Telecom's fixed-line business, the company could pose a greater threat to the market leaders Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and KDDI, analysts said. 
 The 340 billion yen purchase price includes 164 billion yen in Japan Telecom debt that Softbank will assume. Softbank will pay the rest in cash or in the form of options on its own shares. If Ripplewood exercised all those options, it would gain a stake of about 2 percent in Softbank, Mr. Son said. 
 Also on Thursday, Carlyle, one of the world's largest investment funds, confirmed in a statement that it was in exclusive talks to buy a stake in DDI Pocket, though a spokeswoman refused to discuss details of the negotiations. 
 Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Thursday that Carlyle and the Kyocera Corporation, an electronics maker, plan to buy DDI Pocket for 220 billion yen ($2 billion). Carlyle would buy 60 percent of DDI, while Kyocera plans to raise its current stake in DDI to 30 percent from 13 percent, the report said. Spokesmen for KDDI and Kyocera confirmed the discussions were taking place, but refused to comment further. 
 DDI Pocket's Personal Handyphone System was developed as a cheap alternative to cellphones, but lost much of its price advantage as cellular rates declined. DDI has partly offset a decrease in subscriber numbers for its phones by repackaging the service as a wireless Internet connection. DDI Pocket now has three million P.H.S. subscribers, with a third of them using the service to connect computers or other portable devices to the Internet. The personal handyphone service is a hybrid wireless service that covers a smaller area at a lower cost. 
 Analysts say a sale would allow KDDI to focus on its much larger cellular phone business while Kyocera concentrates on developing DDI's P.H.S. technology for sale in China and elsewhere in Asia where its low cost could give it an advantage. 
 ''This is a very good product for emerging markets because the network is simpler,'' Mr. Boodry said. ''It's cheaper to install and the handsets generally aren't nearly as functional so they're cheaper as well.''

HEADLINE: MTV's Front Man on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
GIDEON YAGO, the top political correspondent for MTV News, paints a bleak picture of the lonely, pathetic creature he was growing up in Forest Hills, Queens. King of the geeks, it seems. Yet it's hard to reconcile this image with the engaging journalist found in front of his computer in a dimly lit, cramped office in Midtown Manhattan. He stands up abruptly, sheepishly looking around at the messy clutter. ''My mother will kill me.'' Dressed in a seersucker blazer and jeans, he wears nerdy-cool, rectangular glasses and a neatly trimmed beard. He is 26.
 Mr. Yago has surfaced as the Dude who delivers the news to younger viewers. He was ranked as an influential news personality in covering this year's presidential campaign, having more ''juice'' than Dan Rather, Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings in an informal Newsday survey. He is the first MTV News correspondent to travel to Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. He played host to a Tuesday night special on the job market and outsourcing, which took him to India last month. (Walter Cronkite appeared on the program as the resident sage.) Mr. Yago has interviewed John Kerry, and hopes to score face time with President Bush. 
 So what would his schoolmates at Kew Forest High have to say now? ''I was a morose teenage knucklehead,'' he recalls grimly. He had no prospect of a date. He was smart, yet the last to know when cool things went down. He was deeply into the Smiths, the Brit rock band. He dyed his hair purple and blue. On occasion, he sullenly wore a dog collar and eyeliner. ''I was horny and scared and weird; uncomfortable,'' he says. Oh. He delivered Shakespearean sonnets and monologues in school competitions.
 ''I was a total geek in high school; not in a cool way but in an 'Oh, my God, am I ever going to get out of here?' kind of way,'' says Mr. Yago, who went on to study European history at Columbia University.
 Mr. Yago, whose short black hair is now flecked with gray, insists that all the attention he is receiving has not gone to his head.
 ''There's a difference from being famous and being on television,'' he says. ''It's all fleeting, man. It's all ephemeral.''
 He adds: ''I just think it's really reflective of the times. Young people aren't following the news in the way their parents are. They get information from a lot of alternative sources, and we've adapted to that on-air.''
 Mr. Yago becomes more serious when talking about MTV's ''Choose or Lose'' campaign to drive younger people's interest in the presidential election. The aim is to get 20 million younger people to the polls this fall. He sees the goal as entirely doable, noting that 18.6 million younger voters turned out for the general election four years ago, a campaign he also covered.
 He says top voting issues for younger people include the economy and jobs, education, terrorism and the war on Iraq, in that order. ''This election is just a constellation of things going on that are affecting people,'' he says. ''They feel it. They are talking about it, following it. They are out on the front lines. It's a remarkable time to take advantage of that opportunity. I'm trying hardest not to blow it.''
 HE says that last part a bit distractedly. What does he mean? ''When you have people's attention, what do you do with it? How do you talk to them? You never want to turn them off. The bottom line is the audience looks at us as peers. That's a responsibility that all of us take really seriously.''
 This from a man who, in the 1996 presidential election with a write-in ballot, voted for the baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. ''It was knuckle-headed but it's funny.'' He won't say who he voted for in 2000. He is an Independent, though, a nonallegiance he says he shares with many younger people who identify themselves as neither Democrat nor Republican.
 Mr. Yago's outlook was shaped in an immigrant-filled Queens neighborhood. He was raised by politically active parents who divorced when he was 18. His mother is a German-born psychoanalyst who now lives in Macon, Ga. His father is an economist in Los Angeles.
 Mr. Yago first hooked up with MTV when he was a college freshman and became a contestant for the game show ''Idiot Savants.'' In his senior year, he stumbled onto an MTV talent search on campus. He was hired after he cut a tape of a Ku Klux Klan rally in downtown Manhattan. 
 Since then, he has been on the road a lot. During six weeks on the campaign trail, he spent only 72 hours in the city, barely enough time to see his girlfriend of two years, an English major at New York University. He lives on the Lower East Side.
 He sheds his blazer. A tattoo is noticed. He has three of them. He got the first one at 19. It is based on a disturbing Goya painting often called ''Saturn Devouring One of His Sons.'' He loves Goya. ''There's something about his handle on emotions and the psyche.'' He gushes on about how Goya was a precursor to Expressionism, Impressionism and modernity.
 Suddenly, he is aware that he is on the receiving end of a quizzical stare. He knows why. It is his turn to laugh. The geek has risen! ''Now you can see why I couldn't get a date! Now you can see why I had no friends.''

HEADLINE: Staten Island, Start Your Engines: Nascar May Be On Its Way

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and ERIC DASH; Viv Bernstein contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
For years, Nascar has sought to penetrate the New York metropolitan area, trying to build speedways in places like the Catskills and the New Jersey Meadowlands. Now, it has set its sights on New York City itself and is negotiating to transform a Staten Island industrial park into a major speedway on 440 acres of waterfront land near the Goethals Bridge.
 Nascar speedways are phenomenally popular in the South and the Midwest, and the circuit has gradually moved to the Northeast in recent years. But establishing a beachhead right in New York City, where pedestrians and mass transit rule, would be a major coup as Nascar seeks to broaden its appeal. 
 Racing promoters have held preliminary discussions with economic development officials in the Bloomberg administration in recent weeks about building a 2.5-mile oval track at the vacant GATX industrial park, a onetime oil tank farm south of the Goethals, near several major highways.
 David Talley, a spokesman for the International Speedway Corporation, Nascar's sister organization, confirmed that Staten Island was under consideration.
 ''Ever since we kind of looked away from the Meadowlands, we've been looking at other places,'' Mr. Talley said yesterday. ''Staten Island is one we're looking at. We're looking at a couple of sites in New Jersey as well. We are nowhere close to breaking ground and building a facility.''
 International Speedway, the largest motorsports operator in the country, owns 13 racetracks, including Daytona International Speedway in Florida, Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama and Watkins Glen International in upstate New York. 
 The prospect of a Nascar track in Staten Island seemed to baffle some people in the borough who were questioned about the idea.
 ''Shocking. I wouldn't think they'd build a racetrack on Staten Island,'' said Babatunde Adedapo, 19, a Staten Island resident who is now a student in Massachusetts. ''We're not really known for racing. New York City is not known for racing. Staten Island doesn't bring in any tourists. We have a baseball park, and no one goes there.''
 The area where the track would go is the site of a tank farm that GATX closed four years ago and put up for sale while simultaneously marketing it as an industrial park. William Hettler, a New Jersey real estate broker at Resource Realty who is handling the property, did not return calls requesting comment.
 One executive who had been briefed on International Speedway's plans said that Staten Island was high on the list. ''I do know it's a pretty serious effort,'' the executive said. ''I think there's a possibility something could happen.''
 But even a vacant industrial site, which sits only a few feet above sea level, will pose challenges for Nascar. The property, which embraces about 100 acres of marsh, almost certainly requires some sort of environmental cleanup given its long history as a terminal for oil and other bulk liquids. Environmentalists have also sought to protect the wetlands from development.
 New Jersey officials had spent a lot of time in the last couple of years trying to accommodate Nascar on a relatively tiny 104 acres at the Meadowlands sports complex, already home to a stadium, an arena, a horse racing track and lots of parking lots. At one point four years ago, the racing promoters were looking for a 750-acre site that could accommodate up to 300,000 fans.
 ''You've got to have a lot of land to park the Winnebagos,'' said George R. Zoffinger, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. ''We tried to see whether it would work in the Meadowlands. But the huge amount of traffic on the three weekends a year they operate would be paralyzing to the northern part of the state. Local political leaders opposed it.''
 Mr. Zoffinger said he had heard that Nascar was now looking on Staten Island.
 ''I daresay they'll probably run into the same issues over there,'' he said. ''About the only place it would work in New Jersey is southern New Jersey where there's less traffic congestion and you could build some infrastructure to get people in and out. But they wanted to be within eyesight of New York.''
 Members of the City Council from Staten Island said that interest in building a Nascar track in the area north of the Fresh Kills landfill had risen in the last two months, as the talks had gotten more serious.
 ''It's an intriguing idea that we would like to explore further,'' said Councilman Andrew Lanza, adding that he is planning to meet with International Speedway representatives in July. ''At first you are concerned about the additional traffic and noise, but then you take a closer look at it, and you are only talking about a couple of events a year and you have a great facility that can be put to other uses.''
 The site is only a couple of miles east of the New Jersey Turnpike. A typical Nascar track can hold as many as 150,000 spectators, and at many sites across the country, the lines of cars during race days sometimes stretch for miles. That notion worries Councilman James S. Oddo, whose district includes the prospective site.
 ''We are an island that is clogged already. We have four bridges, and three are overutilized,'' he said, adding that the racetrack developers ''better come forward with an attractive package or they will get booed out of town.''
 According to officials with knowledge of the proposal, the site's location along the West Shore of Staten Island mitigates some of those traffic concerns because it would allow visitors from New Jersey to enter the site from the West Shore Expressway without using Staten Island's streets.
 International Speedway has asked city and state officials for cash grants and tax breaks for the project. One government official said they were listening, but ''these guys are smoking rope. They're looking for subsidies for what can hardly be the highest and best use of the land.''
