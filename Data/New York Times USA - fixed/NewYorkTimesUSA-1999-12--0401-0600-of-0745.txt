HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Collecting;
Hard-to-Get Cars Are Hot Wheels, but Cold Investments

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN 

 BODY:
WHAT is the common thread among Tickle Me Elmo dolls, Egghead.com shares and the Plymouth Prowler? Prices of all three skyrocketed when they were chased by speculators looking to flip them for quick profits, and all have come crashing back to earth.
To put a Tickle Me Elmo under the Christmas tree in 1996 might have set you back $200 or more, but you can buy all you want today on eBay for $10 each or less. Egghead.com stock, which soared to $108 a share in late 1998, now languishes around $16. 
 Prices rise, of course, when demand outstrips supply. When a carmaker has a particularly hot product, speculators and dealers try to obtain as many as they can at wholesale prices, then sell the cars for as much as the market will bear.
The sticker price on the original Prowler, a modern-day hot rod, was $39,000 in 1997. But in the four and a half years between when the prototype was unveiled, in '93, and the production car reached showrooms in '97, Prowler mania set in. Speculators sold contracts guaranteeing delivery of Prowlers for premiums of $20,000 or more over sticker price. The feeding frenzy culminated at a collectors' auction in Auburn, Ind., when the first Prowler available to the public brought the astounding sum of $149,500 (and whispers of "Hey, what has he been smoking?" in the audience). For a year, Prowlers changed hands for $75,000 to $80,000. Now that the novelty has worn off, the cars are advertised at sticker price or less.
Today's hottest and hardest-to-get cars include the Honda S2000, a racy roadster that will be imported in limited numbers (about 5,000 a year, Honda says) and the Porsche Boxster S, a high-performance version of the popular sports car.
Fast-talking salespeople may tell prospective customers that these cars are such good investments that it makes perfectly good sense to pay $5,000 over sticker to be first in line. (The industry jargon is A.D.P., for additional dealer profit.) But while being first in a coveted new sports car is an investment in ego-gratification, history has shown that very few cars are ever worth more than their initial sticker price -- and that even for those cars, it generally takes at least 20 years to recoup the original price. If you pay an extra $5,000 to have one of the first Mercedes-Benz ML55 "muscle sport utilities," you're buying an experience, not making an investment.
Even the cars that do eventually increase in value are, in financial terms, terrible investments. For instance, a nicely equipped 1965 Mustang convertible cost $3,200. Today, even in perfect condition, that car will bring barely more than $25,000. Although the Mustang has had a sevenfold rise in value, if you had put $3,200 in a Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fund in 1965, and reinvested the dividends, the investment would be worth $179,000 today. And you never have to change the oil on a stock certificate.
New-car mania is nothing new. The Oregonian newspaper recently reported that the first motor car on the streets of Portland was an 1898 Stanley Steamer, for which the owner paid $1,000. The car had a list price of $600, so he paid a $400 premium to be the first man in the city behind the wheel of an automobile -- the equivalent of paying $53,440 today for a $32,000 Honda S2000.
A century later, speculators are still working to make a big killing from limited-production cars. But few actually make money.
"There's never been a new car made that hasn't gone down in value once they start rolling off the production lines in quantity," said Craig Jackson, owner of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, which hosts a sale of more than 800 high-end collector cars each January in Scottsdale, Ariz. "If you want to make money on a new car, you've basically got to sell it the same day you buy it."
Mr. Jackson speaks not just as an expert on the collector market, but from personal experience. In his own garage is a '90 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 coupe that has traveled just 68 miles since new. Mr. Jackson paid $5,000 over the $59,000 list price in 1990, and was sure that given Chevy's announced plans to build just 1,000 ZR-1's -- which had distinctive bodywork and a four-cam, all-aluminum, Lotus-designed engine -- that he could double his investment.
"At our auction in 1990, the car was bid to $78,000," Mr. Jackson said. "Everyone was getting $100,000 for theirs, so I held onto the car.
"Then Chevrolet announced they were going to build 2,000 instead of 1,000, and then 3,000, and before the run was over they built almost 7,000. That just killed the value."
The auction company owner promised to "run it across the block at our auction this January, and if I can get $40,000 for it, it will be gone."
Automakers are constantly searching for a reason to create limited-run "special editions" of production cars, hoping to increase sales. For instance, Cadillac announced in 1976 that it would stop building convertibles and that the final 200 Eldorados would constitute a "Bicentennial Edition." The 19-feet-long, all-white softtops even had dashboard plaques affirming their status.
"Sticker price was around $12,000," said Rick Cole, a former auction company owner who is now chief operating officer of Bilstein Engine Flush Systems in North Hollywood, Calif. "But I was getting over $50,000 for them, and the demand was incredible."
The value of a Bicentennial Eldorado today? "If you could find one that was still in the wrapper" -- like new -- "you could probably get about $12,000 for it," Mr. Cole said. His value may be conservative; the National Automobile Dealers Association's price guide values a standard 1976 Eldorado convertible in perfect condition at $18,200; it puts the additional premium for the Bicentennial Edition at a mere $825. Cadillac resumed production of Eldorado convertibles in 1984, helping to depress the values of the older ones.
Mr. Cole says that paying a premium is not necessarily foolhardy, given the tremendous devaluation that always occurs when a costly car, like a Rolls-Royce, is driven off the lot. "Whenever you buy any expensive new car, price-wise, you might as well be putting your head in a vise and squeezing it," he said.
Mr. Cole recalled buying one of the first Acura NSX sports cars from a dealer in Idaho and selling it the same day for a $10,000 profit. The purchaser was a Japanese speculator who shipped the car home and resold it yet again at a higher price. "I wasn't about to hang onto it, and I told everyone who was trying to speculate on NSX's to get rid of them as fast as they could," he said. "I knew that once there was one in every Honda showroom, you'd be lucky to get sticker for them. And I was right."
It's not just big-ticket cars that attract speculators. Advertisements promising the Honda S2000 for "just $5,000 over sticker" have begun to appear. How long will this price inflation last?
"Only a few months," said Jay Lamm, author of "The Miata MX-5 Guide" (Motorbooks International). "In 1989, when the Miata was introduced as a 1990 model, it had a sticker of $13,800. One of the very first cars available sold for $35,000. Then, for the next nine months, you had to pay $2,000 or $3,000 over sticker. But ever since then, Miatas have been selling for list price or less."
The best reason to pay a premium for an early car in a new-model run is to be the first with a new toy. "If you want to be cool, and you think that being the first to show up with a new BMW Z8 will impress your friends, and you can afford it, then who cares what you pay?" Mr. Cole said. "It's not about an investment. It's about being the baddest boy on the block."

HEADLINE: THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS: THE COST;
Paying for Peace Is Clinton's Challenge

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Peace is expensive.
Any agreement reached in the Israel-Syria talks is certain to entail huge costs -- to monitor security arrangements, to relocate Israeli settlers and to bolster the Syrian economy. If the past is any guide, the United States will bear the lion's share of the burden. 
 President Clinton's immediate challenge is to continue serving as midwife in negotiations between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria, scheduled to resume on Jan. 3.
But even if the negotiations succeed -- and that is by no means certain -- the president will have to present a multibillion-dollar bill for peace to a bitterly riven Congress that lately has been reluctant to grant Mr. Clinton political or budgetary victories. That is likely to get worse in a presidential election year.
The president's position is complicated by Syria's record as a haven for terrorists, its presence on Washington's list of nations that tolerate large-scale narcotics traffic, and Mr. Clinton's dwindling term in office. Mr. Clinton has criticized Congress for what he calls growing isolationist sentiment, another factor that will undercut his appeal for billions of dollars more in foreign aid to bankroll reconciliation in the Middle East.
The president, in a preview of arguments he would make for new money to support an Israeli-Syrian accord, said that continuing conflict in the Middle East is more expensive than peace.
"For we have learned from experience that tensions in the region can escalate," Mr. Clinton said in a Rose Garden appearance with Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara at the start of the negotiations on Wednesday. "And the escalations can lead into diplomatic, financial and, ultimately, military involvement, far more costly than even the costliest peace."
Administration officials refuse to discuss the potential level of American financial support for a possible agreement between Israel and Syria, saying such questions are speculative and premature.
The cost would probably far exceed the $1.8 billion price tag of implementing the Wye River accords reached by Israel and the Palestinians last November. Even that relatively modest sum was hung up in Congress for weeks this fall in a battle over unrelated issues in the appropriations bill for foreign aid and State Department operations.
Israeli officials and Middle East analysts estimated that the immediate costs of a deal under which the Golan Heights would be returned to Syria would be at least $15 billion -- and perhaps several times that.
The United States has provided $100 billion since 1979 to support the peace deal between Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Menachem Begin of Israel, worked out at Camp David under the auspices of President Carter.
A deal between Syria and Israel would entail different costs, some higher and some lower. Part of the American commitment at Camp David was an assurance that Israel's military would always maintain a technological superiority over neighboring armies. The billions in American aid and Israel's own technological prowess have given Jerusalem a significant qualitative edge over any Arab state -- and over virtually any combination of Arab states.
As a result, American military aid following an accord with Syria would focus more narrowly on creating a security buffer between northern Israel and Syria, including sophisticated monitoring systems. While these would be expensive, they would not require the same level of spending as the 20-year effort to upgrade Israel's land and air forces.
Still, an Israel-Syria agreement would be a costly proposition, and Congress would have to sign the checks. The bad blood between the administration and the Republican-led Congress could make it a tough fight for a lame-duck president.
Advocates of Middle East peace say that Mr. Clinton must involve Congressional leaders early in the process if he wants to win their support for large new appropriations.
"If there is a deal -- assuming there is a deal -- the only way this is going to succeed is if both the administration and Congress get behind this historic opportunity," said Howard Kohr, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. "Congress has to have some ownership of this issue. The administration cannot go it alone."
The price of ignoring Congress until late in the process was dramatized for Mr. Clinton this fall when Congress rejected a global treaty to ban nuclear testing. The White House and treaty supporters did not consult with Republican leaders on the treaty and had no idea of the depth of opposition until it was too late. Mr. Clinton tried to delay a vote on the nuclear treaty but was dealt a humiliating defeat by a well-organized Republican majority.
Congress has traditionally given bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but Syria presents a different case. President Hafez al-Assad has long been a leader of Arab hostility to Israel, and many in Congress may be reluctant to reward him for an 11th-hour conversion to the cause of peace.
Any direct economic reward to Syria, therefore, would probably have to come from Europe, Japan or the Arab world.

Rates Jump as Investors Ponder the Fed's Intentions

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates jumped to their highest levels in more than two years yesterday as the persistent strength of the United States economy convinced more and more investors that the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates sharply to rein in growth.
The view of how hard the central bank will have to push on the brakes seems to change almost daily. Just a month ago, after the Fed raised its interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point, the third increase this year, many analysts thought the Fed was finished. 
 But a few weeks later, the talk was of one more rate increase, but not until the March meeting of policy makers. Then the one rate increase moved up to February. Now the talk is of two rate increases. And there is even speculation that the Fed might raise its target for the federal funds rate, the overnight loan rate between banks, by a half-point in February.
"Fed policy makers are going to tighten until they see the economy slow down," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "And there is no sign the economy is slowing."
The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond jumped to 6.39 percent yesterday, from 6.32 percent on Wednesday. That is the highest the yield has been since October 1997, surpassing the recent high of 6.37 percent in October of this year. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 27/32, to 96 17/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is more sensitive to threats of higher rates from the Fed, rose to 6.13 percent from 6.06 on Wednesday. The narrow gap between the yields of the 30-year bond and the 2-year note is also a sign that investors expect the Fed to act.
Stephen D. Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, and Ethan Harris, the senior economist there, are two of many analysts who have been forced by strong growth to raise their expectations of Fed rate increases. A month ago they thought the Fed was through; now they are predicting two Fed rate increases in the first half of 2000.
At the same time, they have increased their forecast of fourth-quarter growth to 5.5 percent from 4.3 percent. And this week's economic data seem to confirm that judgment. Retail sales in November jumped 0.9 percent, well above expectations. Industrial production rose 0.3 percent, which was strong considering the revision of October's climb to 0.8 percent.
Yesterday's report of a record trade deficit in October was also a worry because the record imports for the month were another sign of relentless consumer spending. A decline in initial jobless claims to a 26-year low also showed how hot the economy is.
The force that seems to be driving the consumer is the continued strength of the stock market, which increases consumers' willingness to spend. So until the stock market slows down its pace, it will be hard to slow the economy.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said yesterday that the stock market would climb at a more moderate pace next year, in part because the market is fully valued. Her year-end target for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 1,525, a 7.5 percent move from its close yesterday.
But to get this kind of performance, Mr. Harris said that the Fed would probably have "to take a few more warning shots across the bow of the stock market."

HEADLINE: Ambulance Dispute Delays Changes in Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
A disagreement between the Giuliani administration and the City Council over a plan by the mayor to increase the use of private ambulance companies on some overtime shifts now handled by the Fire Department has delayed the city's first-quarter budget modification.
The budget modification, involving routine revisions to reflect actual revenue and other changes since the fiscal year began in July, is normally agreed on by the mayor and the Council in November. But officials said yesterday that it would be delayed at least until early next month. 
 While the lack of an agreement will not disrupt the operations of city government, the delay is an embarrassment for city budget officials at a time when New York's continuing economic prosperity makes budget negotiations relatively easy.
Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's November budget plan, which is presented to the Council as a draft of the budget modification, city tax revenues are expected to be $178 million more than was expected in the budget passed in June.
But the delay in passing the first-quarter budget changes has focused not on how to spend additional revenues but on about $1.6 million in savings that the Giuliani administration wants to achieve by turning over some overtime ambulance tours to ambulance companies run by local hospitals. Those tours are now handled by city ambulances, which are part of the Fire Department.
Council officials, including Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, have opposed the change, saying it represents a shift in policy that should not be made through the routine mechanics of a budget modification. The union that represents city ambulance drivers also opposes the change, saying it could be the first step in an effort to privatize ambulance services.
The mayor's budget director, Robert M. Harding, said the saving in overtime was an accounting issue, with the hospital ambulances already operating in the city. "This is not a large step," he said. "It's the fire commissioner doing a very good job of managing the budget and realizing that as a result of the voluntary ambulance work that's being done, there will be overtime savings."
Robert A. Ungar, a lawyer for the union, said that the city had recently allowed private and nonprofit hospitals to increase the number of their ambulances linked to the city's 911 system and that he was opposed to those ambulances potentially replacing city ambulances.
"The city always expressed that what they were doing was somehow supplementing the Fire Department's service," he said. "This is the first time that we have seen where they are actually saying, 'We are transferring ambulance tours from the Fire Department to private hospitals,' and there we have a strong objection."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Technology Shares Send Nasdaq to 53rd High of the Year

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday with the Nasdaq composite index streaking to its 53rd record this year as positive news from technology companies eclipsed a jump by bond interest rates to the highest in more than two years.
"The story all day has been Nasdaq," said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential Securities. "Technology has been powerful." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 19.57 points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,244.89, with Microsoft, a Dow component, countering weakness in financial services stocks that had weighed on the blue-chip index most of the day. Shares of Microsoft rose 5 1/4, to 113 11/16, on enthusiasm for its Windows 2000 operating system.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 5.46 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,418.78.
The Nasdaq composite index surged 93.11 points, or 2.57 percent, to 3,715.06, topping Monday's close of 3,658.67, after sailing past the 3,700-level for the first time.
The technology-laden index was bolstered by earlier news of the Microsoft announcement, positive comments on semiconductor stocks by Morgan Stanley and a narrower-than-expected loss from the Internet company CMGI, traders said. Shares of CMGI surged 21 13/16, to 221 9/16, the day after it reported a first-quarter loss of $117 million, or $1.08 a diluted share -- much less than the per-share loss of $1.76 that had been expected. The company also announced a two-for-one stock split Wednesday.
The Nasdaq index is now up some 69 percent since the beginning of the year. Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman, Sachs's United States stock market strategist and one of Wall Street's most influential forecasters, set her targets yesterday for the year 2000.
She now predicts that the Standard and Poor's 500 index will hit 1,525 by the end of 2000, a gain of nearly 8 percent over Wednesday's closing price. She set a corresponding target of 12,300 for the Dow Jones industrial average, a gain of 9.6 percent over Wednesday's close. Ms. Cohen's primary research focus is on the S.& P. 500 universe of companies.
It was the first time Ms. Cohen has made public her targets for the end of the year 2000. Previously, she had set a target of 1,475 to be reached by fall 2000.
American Express slumped 5 93/16, to 152 5/8, while J. P. Morgan dropped 1 1/2, to 128 7/8. It was the second consecutive day of weakness for these financial services companies because of the rise in bond interest rates.
Among other big movers, Sprint PCS Group was down 12 5/8, to 99 5/8, after Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the wireless unit of Sprint to "neutral" from "outperform."
Nextel Communications, another wireless company, was down 6 1/16 at 92 15/16.
In company news, the hotel franchiser Cendant announced a $400 million strategic alliance with Liberty Media, sending its stock up 6 13/16, to 22 1/2. Liberty Media's shares finished up 1 3/8 at 48.

HEADLINE: Buchanan, In a Change, Calls for End To Sanctions

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Conceding "a dramatic departure from what I've argued and believed," Patrick J. Buchanan today called for an end to economic sanctions by the White House as a "sword that slaughters children" and entrenches dictators.
"Our sanctions are sowing seeds of hatred that will one day flower in acts of terrorism against us," Mr. Buchanan said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 Mr. Buchanan, who is courting independent voters and the Reform Party for its nomination for president, said his decision to oppose sanctions grew out of recent reporting on the effects of sanctions in aggravating the health and nutrition problems of rogue nations like Iraq.
"When Arab terrorists murder Israeli children," Mr. Buchanan said, "we Americans are rightly filled with horror and disgust. But what do Arab peoples think of us when U.S. sanctions bring death to literally thousands of Iraqi children every month?"
A supporter of sanctions in the past against Cuba, Mr. Buchanan said conditions had changed with the fall of Soviet Communism.
"Because of the siege mentality our embargo has created inside Cuba," he said, "our sanctions may today be the main pillar of Castro's power."
Sanctions, he continued, "may fairly be called America's silent weapon of mass destruction whose victims are almost always the weak, the sick, the women and the young."
In his address, Mr. Buchanan cited what he called counterproductive sanctions by the Clinton administration in a dozen countries, including Iran, Libya, Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, India, Pakistan and Serbia. He vowed that as president he would end all sanctions depriving food, medicine and other basic necessities to the suffering subjects of rogue nations.
"Embargoes and blockades are weapons of war," Mr. Buchanan said.
They must be designed, he continued, "so that innocent people are not the principal casualties."
Speaking of Serbia, Mr. Buchanan criticized the administration for first "smashing" the country with a 78-day bombing campaign, and then denying Serbs heating oil and aid in removing the debris of war.
"This immoral policy shames us as a people," Mr. Buchanan said. "We are putting old men, women, and children under a sentence of death for failing to do what NATO itself could not do: overthrow Slobodan Milosevic."
Dictatorial governments do not justify sanctions, Mr. Buchanan said, adding, "No one has deputized America to play Wyatt Earp to the world."
He denounced "all this Beltway braying" about the United States being the world's indispensable super power. "Have we, too, succumbed to the hubris of hegemony?" he asked.
There are better ways to punish rogue states, Mr. Buchanan said, including cutting off overseas assets of dictators, denying them international loans and levying tariffs to deny them hard currency.
Accusing President Clinton of "monumental hypocrisy" in applying sanctions, Mr. Buchanan said, "He blockaded, starved and invaded tiny Haiti for human rights violations, but he proudly chaperones China into the W.T.O."
Later, when answering questions about his presidential campaign, Mr. Buchanan exulted that he was not caught up in the primary campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire but was instead visiting Reform Party gatherings around the nation.
"I have seen no organized opposition," he said. "We are winning delegates quietly, and we are moving on this nomination."
Mr. Buchanan said he had always known he would be working at the complex Reform nomination process with little public notice. His aim is to "surface" again in March, when, he said, the two major party candidates will be clear and the public will begin to be anxious at the choice.
"People," he said, "are going to look out and say, 'Oh, my Lord, that troll is still out there under the bridge.' "

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rises Again As Imports Continue Climb

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit swelled again in October, to $25.9 billion, setting a record for the seventh time this year as prosperous American consumers and businesses kept up their spending spree. Exports were essentially unchanged, while imports continued to grow.
Higher prices for imported oil, on which the United States relies for more than half its needs, more than offset reduced volume and accounted for one-fourth of the October gap, which was much larger than expected. Record deficits with China and Japan accounted for more than half of the deficit. 
 "Consumer demand in the U.S. is extremely strong," said Bill Sharp, senior economist at Chase Securities, predicting that booming sales of foreign cars would contribute to a further widening of the deficit in the coming months. Weak growth by some Asian and European trading partners, on the other hand, caused demand for American goods to lag.
"There's very rapid growth of our economy vis-a-vis the rest of the world," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The wider trade gap provides some ammunition for those who argue that the United States is being victimized by the unfair labor practices of other countries and that American workers need some protection, perhaps by imposing higher labor and environmental standards on some trading partners.
This was a significant issue at the recent World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, where efforts to start a new round of trade liberalization failed amid unexpectedly widespread protests.
In addition, an agreement by the United States to support China's bid to join the W.T.O., in exchange for better access to Chinese markets is still subject to approval by Congress.
William Daley, the commerce secretary, cited the far faster rate of American economic growth as the main reason for the growing trade imbalance but warned of the political problems it posed.
"We have carried much of the burden," he said, referring to the way the United States has bought large amounts of goods from struggling trading partners, especially in Asia. "Politically, that gets very difficult over a long period and other countries have to understand that."
The rise in imports in October was 1.6 percent, to a record $107.9 billion, with the biggest increases in computer-related and other capital goods, including semiconductors. Some analysts had expected chip imports to decline because of an earthquake in Taiwan in September.
The nation's bill for imported oil, meanwhile, reached a new peak of $6.4 billion as the average price rose to $20.74 a barrel from $19.52 even as the number of imported barrels fell.
Exports edged down one-tenth of 1 percent, to $81.9 billion, with telecommunications equipment one of the biggest drags.
Through the first 10 months of the year, exports have climbed 1.9 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier, while imports have surged 10.7 percent. This has resulted in a deficit running at an annual rate of $262 billion, far above last year's peak of $164.3 billion.
The deficits with Japan and China each climbed to $7.2 billion for the month, the most ever recorded with any country. The widening with Japan was 8.1 percent; with China it was 3.6 percent. Unlike the other figures, those for individual nations or other geographic areas are not adjusted for seasonal variations.
The deficit with Mexico narrowed to $1.4 billion as both exports and imports reached peaks, while the deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, rose to $3.2 billion. Record imports from Western Europe helped push the American deficit with the region to $5 billion, the report showed.
It will probably take the better part of next year before the deficit starts to narrow, Mr. Dudley said.

HEADLINE: Gore and Bush 'Debate' Education at a Distance

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush stood on Mr. Gore's home turf here today and sparred over their education plans, acting for all the world as if they were their party's nominees.
Mr. Gore, who today pledged a $115 billion federal commitment to education that drew positive reviews from teachers unions, accused Governor Bush of Texas of wanting to drain money from public schools to provide vouchers to students for private school. 
 Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore, a Democrat, of advocating a big-spending liberal education program that invited the federal government to intrude into local decision making. The problem with the Gore plan, Mr. Bush, a Republican, said, is that it assumed that Washington was the source "of all wisdom."
Neither man has captured his party's nomination, but each held his party's fundamental principles aloft today in a preview of a classic fall election matchup. Their messages, delivered hours apart from the libraries of two schools here today, were noteworthy for the underlying assumption that each man would become his party's standard-bearer.
And their broadsides were delivered at the same time that their two maverick challengers -- former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey on the Democratic side and Senator John McCain of Arizona on the Republican side -- sought to capture the hearts of independents by making a joint appearance in New Hampshire on campaign finance.
With Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley garnering much of the attention today, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush both seemed eager to get on with their own show.
Mr. Gore was asked whether he wished he were involved in the session in New Hampshire.
"I'm involved in a debate here in Nashville," he replied.
And Mr. Bush clearly relished the idea of engagement in Mr. Gore's home state. He said he looked forward to debating Mr. Gore about education because Mr. Gore was focused on "bricks and mortar."
"The vice president talks about buildings," Mr. Bush said dismissively. "I'm talking about children. The vice president talks about bricks and mortars; I'm talking about hearts and souls. I'll be glad to make that debate all day long across America."
The two also collected money at the same saloon here, the Wildhorse, with Mr. Gore staging a fund-raiser Wednesday night and Mr. Bush following tonight, in his first fund-raising foray into Tennessee. Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, introduced him by saying, "He's good enough, he's smart enough," an allusion to the idea that Mr. Bush lacks the intellectual heft to be president.
Mr. Bush appeared with the state's top Republican officials, including Gov. Don Sundquist and Senator Bill Frist and former Gov. Lamar Alexander.
Mr. Gore drew more than $1.6 million, and Mr. Bush took in about $750.000.
Mr. Gore set the tone for the day by filling in the numbers of the education plan he outlined in May. He said he would spend $115 billion over 10 years, $50 billion of it to provide universal access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. He would use federal money to help increase teacher salaries, a novel proposal in a presidential campaign, and to provide incentives to failing schools to reverse course.
The plan engendered much support from the teachers unions, which have endorsed Mr. Gore.
Sandra Feldman, president of the one-million member American Federation of Teachers, liked the plan's comprehensive approach toward recruiting teachers and retaining them.
"Ultimately we have to have higher teacher salaries along with higher standards as we go forward because otherwise we aren't going to be able to attract teachers into districts that have the greatest needs," Ms. Feldman said in a telephone interview from New York.
Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the largest union in the United States with 2.2 million teachers, also hailed the plan.
"The whole preschool program is particularly important," Mr. Chase said in a telephone interview from Washington. "All research shows us those early years are vital to the ongoing success of the child, and when you couple that with smaller class size, and standards for students and teachers, tying that into questions of salary is appropriate."
More skeptical was Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a conservative education analyst.
"Our problem is not class size, it's that we don't have a sufficient number of top college graduates going into teaching," Ms. Thernstrom said.
"The federal government doesn't have a track record of doing this kind of thing well," she said. Mr. Bush had a similar response when asked his reaction to Mr. Gore's plan.
"I heard the amount of money, which is fairly typical of somebody who runs around the country saying I'm going to spend money and solve your problems," Mr. Bush said. "We have a fundamental disagreement on the role of the central government. I believe the role of the central government is to do a few things and do them well. And when we have money left over, to pass it back to the working people."
That's what Mr. Bush would do with his proposal for a $483 billion tax cut over five years, which Mr. Gore today referred to as his "risky tax scheme" that would throw the nation back into deficits and back into a recession.
One big difference in the two candidates' education plans is how they deal with failing schools. Mr. Bush would take back federal money from nonperforming schools and give it to students to use as vouchers toward private schools. Mr. Gore said he would require the school districts to adopt an aggressive plan to turn around the school and provide pay incentives for teachers in districts that managed to do so.
Mr. Gore said that Mr. Bush's plan, in draining money from the public schools, would give new meaning to the three Rs: "Reckless and retrograde, reactionary, radical -- that's four Rs. I sincerely believe that it's an ideologically-driven mistake," the vice president said.

HEADLINE: White House, Citing Fraud Charge, Seeks to Block Russian Loan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
White House officials called today on the independent Export-Import Bank of the United States to delay or cancel a pending $500 million loan package to Russia.
The officials said the aid, in the form of loan guarantees to a Russian oil company for the purchase of American equipment, should be blocked because of allegations that the Russian company had defrauded foreign investors in another deal. 
 The officials said their position was not related to Russia's war in Chechnya, but there has been a growing debate at the White House and at the State Department about whether approval of the transaction would send the wrong signal as the Russian Army wages an increasingly violent conflict in the Caucasus.
The International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is the largest shareholder, is also continuing to withhold a $640 million loan to Russia because Russia has failed to meet the necessary economic and financial conditions, though this explanation has been greeted with skepticism by Moscow.
The Export-Import Bank is an independent agency whose charter precludes it from making decisions based on political considerations. It had scheduled a board meeting for Friday to vote on the loan guarantees, but postponed the meeting until Tuesday.
Although the bank makes its decisions independently of the administration, the State Department can halt loans if it determines that the recipient violates human rights.
The guarantees are to go to the Tyumen Oil Company, which has been embroiled in a dispute with BP Amoco, one of the world's largest oil producers, and investors including George Soros. The fight is over Tyumen's acquisition -- at a bargain price through a bankruptcy proceeding -- of an oilfield in which BP Amoco and Mr. Soros were part owners.
Another investor in the oilfield, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, denounced the bankruptcy deal as a "sham" that raised questions about the Russian government's commitment to attracting foreign investment.
Asked about the issue by reporters today, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, "I have my people looking into it."
But the White House took a harder line, clearly intending to send a public signal to the bank even as White House officials said the administration was not lobbying the bank.
White House aides said that Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council at the White House, had concluded that there was enough merit to the allegations that Tyumen had acquired the oilfield in an unscrupulous manner that the bank should at least delay its decision while the legal fight over the acquisition goes forward.
They said Mr. Sperling was concerned that going ahead with the loans now could be perceived as a reward for a Russian company that had undermined Russia's halting efforts to develop laws and rules for the conduct of business.
The loans are tricky for the administration not just because of the Russian assault on Chechnya. Vice President Al Gore's rivals in the presidential race have intermittently raised questions about whether he failed to act aggressively enough in demanding that Russia clamp down on corruption.

HEADLINE: Transit Official Says Labor Accord Won't Increase Fares in Near Future

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority took pains yesterday to assure subway and bus riders that the tentative agreement with the transit union would not force a fare increase in the next few years.
The pact's increased labor costs, including a 12.5 percent raise in base pay over three years, were not so large and unanticipated that they would seriously affect the budget, said Marc V. Shaw, the executive director. 
 Mr. Shaw defended the deal in an interview as transit officials and union leaders spent much of the day rebuffing their critics. In a curious reversal of what the two sides were saying before they struck the deal early Wednesday, M.T.A. officials were arguing that the accord was not too generous, while union leaders asserted that it was plenty generous.
Even though the transit workers obtained the largest pay increases, after inflation, of any New York City public-sector union since the 1980's, Mr. Shaw said the agency had already budgeted money to cover most of those increases. "It's not going to have a significant effect on next year's budget above what was already budgeted," he said. "It's not going to have a direct impact on the fare."
Mr. Shaw defended the contract after Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed monitoring group, said the tentative deal was so generous that it might force an increase in the $1.50 fare for subways and buses. The contract will give transit workers, who earn an average of $39,000 a year, a 5 percent raise in the contract's first year, 3 percent in the second year and 4 percent in the third year.
Factoring in wage increases and reductions in the transit workers' pension contributions, several labor experts who analyzed the contract said it would effectively increase pay by nearly 18 percent over three years. But M.T.A. officials insisted that because of some complex financial factors and some savings caused by productivity increases, the authority's labor costs would rise considerably less than that.
Willie James, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, predicted that the city's 33,000 bus and subway drivers would vote to ratify the contract, which he boasted was one of the best public-sector labor pacts in years.
Mr. James praised E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A.'s chairman, for being more generous than many labor experts had expected. He said Mr. Conway knew that the workers' poor morale could worsen if the workers thought the authority was being stingy with them.
Mr. James sharply criticized dissidents from the militant New Directions faction, who are urging rejection of the contract as they contend that the raises are too low and that there are too many concessions.
"If I got 20 percent in every year, they'd still say everyone should vote against it," Mr. James said in an interview. "Their agenda is not to be sensible or responsible. Their agenda is to take over the local. And they'll misinform the membership to do that."
He said the contract would benefit workers by substantially reducing their annual pension contributions and by improving the union's health plans. He added that the agreement revamped New York City Transit's strict disciplinary procedures by, for example, barring managers from suspending workers for minor infractions until a hearing is held.
Mr. James spoke yesterday at a board meeting of the New York City Central Labor Council, where he received a huge ovation from 20 other labor leaders, many of whom said they hoped his contract would serve as a model for the city's negotiations with its municipal unions next year.
"You put together one of the best contracts we've seen not only for public employees, but for collective bargaining in general," said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O.
But Roger Toussaint, a leader of the New Directions movement, said that the pact was a disappointment and that it deserved to be rejected.
"This contract falls far short of all the major goals that the membership set," he said. "The amount of money we got doesn't make up for the concessions we made in the last contract. I believe we could have and should have gotten more."
The contract comes as the M.T.A. asserts it will have a $191 million operating deficit next year. But many fiscal experts said that the agency, during the contract negotiations, deliberately painted a negative financial picture and would actually have a surplus.
Mr. Shaw and Gary Dellaverson, the M.T.A.'s chief labor negotiators, differed with some experts over estimates of what the contract would cost the transit agency. While several experts said the increased health contributions would raise the authority's labor costs by 2 percent over the life of the contract, Mr. Shaw put the cost at less than one-fourth that amount.
In another important provision, the authority pledged to seek legislation that would enable transit workers now paying 5.3 percent of their income toward pension contributions to pay just 2 percent. While union officials said on Wednesday that such a move would effectively increase most workers' pay by 3.3 percent during the first year of the contract, the M.T.A. officials said that provision would not go into effect until the contract's second year.
This would mean most workers would receive a 5 percent effective increase in pay in the first year, and a 6.3 percent increase in the second -- that year's 3 percent wage increase plus the 3.3 percent reduction in the amount deducted from their paychecks for pension contributions.
Mr. Shaw said this pension provision would not require the M.T.A. to spend its own money to offset the workers' reduced pension contributions. Thanks to the Wall Street boom, he explained, the pension plan already holds enough money to cover the workers' pension obligations even with the smaller contributions. "This contract meets the fair and reasonable test and is not being done on the backs of the workers or the passengers," he said.
Several labor experts said the M.T.A. had hoped to keep wage increases to about 3 percent a year. But these experts said the wage increases averaging 4 percent would not unduly strain the agency's finances because each extra 1 percent in labor costs comes to just $16 million a year. New York City Transit's operating budget in the 1998 fiscal year was $3.8 billion.
Mr. Shaw said the contract would save the M.T.A. some money -- he would not say how much -- through more flexible work rules that allow individual workers to handle more responsibilities. An engine mechanic, for example, might also now do body work. He said this was in no way a concession. Mr. James said the union accepted these productivity measures because the contract promises no layoffs and because workers will be paid extra when they are trained to take on additional responsibilities.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Why India and Others See U.S. as Villain on Trade

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The week after global trade talks collapsed in Seattle, India's commerce and industry minister rose in Parliament here to denounce what he called a pernicious attempt by the richest, most powerful nations -- led by President Clinton -- to rob developing countries of their great advantage in trade: cheap labor.
And, he said, what had really galvanized the developing countries' rebellion against the creation of a working group on labor in the World Trade Organization was Mr. Clinton's remark, in an interview with a Seattle newspaper, about an eventual use of trade sanctions against nations that failed to comply with international labor standards. 
 The cabinet minister, Murasoli Maran, who was India's chief representative at the talks, described Mr. Clinton's statements as having electrified envoys from developing countries, made the danger to their economic interests clear, and unified them in opposition to any linkage of trade and labor standards.
"Sir, finally the last straw was cast by President Clinton himself," Mr. Maran declared. "It made all the developing countries and least-developing countries to harden their position. It created such a furor that they all felt the danger ahead."
In large part because of Mr. Clinton's handling of the issue, the American attempt to add labor issues to the international trade agenda widened the gulf between rich and poor nations and contributed to the collapse of the latest efforts to further free up world trade.
In the eyes of India, Egypt and other third world nations, Mr. Clinton's call to link trade accords to labor standards for workers around the world was protectionism in the guise of idealism, motivated by his desire to woo labor union support for the presidential campaign of his vice president, Al Gore.
Some delegates from developing countries even expressed the belief that he had orchestrated the sometimes violent street protests in Seattle to justify the American position.
"The Western world, the industrialized world, wants to take away our comparative advantage," Mr. Maran said. "It is a pernicious way of robbing our comparative advantage. The developing countries consider it as a maneuver by wealthy nations to force our wages up, to undermine our competitiveness. This is the secret."
Opposition to the inclusion of labor standards in trade deals was not limited to government officials. In India, even labor unions that regularly battle employers for higher wages and improved benefits opposed using trade negotiations as leverage for a better deal.
Before the Seattle talks began, while American unions and others were planning street demonstrations to demand that trade accords protect workers' rights, Indian unions were quietly meeting with government officials and agreeing to oppose any linkage between trade and labor standards.
D. L. Sachdev, secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, which represents 2.5 million workers in industrial and service jobs, said it was peculiar to stand on the same side as employers and the government.
But he and other union leaders here maintained that making trade agreements conditional on meeting labor standards could be used to keep out goods from low-wage countries like India, damaging workers and employment in those industries.
"Unfortunately, trade unions in developed countries feel that because of cheap labor and relocation of industries by multinational corporations, their employment prospects are imperiled," Mr. Sachdev said.
With some trade unions' backing, a group of cabinet ministers headed by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee agreed before the country's delegation left for Seattle that India would oppose the proposal for a working group on labor and trade.
"This was not an issue on which there could be compromise," said N. K. Singh, a civil servant who is one of Mr. Vajpayee's top advisers.
The developing countries won vigorous backing from a group of African, Latin American and Asian academics, led by the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati. They, as well as a variety of labor and nongovernmental leaders, signed a statement against including labor and environmental issues in trade deals. Their contention was that the labor issues in particular are selectively used against developing countries for the economic gain of the richer nations. For example, President Clinton had cited child labor, a problem of developing countries like India, but had made no mention of lax enforcement of laws to protect workers in garment sweatshops or migrant farm workers in the United States.
Professor Bhagwati, who began calling for India to open itself to foreign trade and investment 25 years before it began to do so, said that those who signed the statement were strong opponents of child labor and bad working conditions, but thought that trade deals were the wrong place to combat them.
The Indian delegation arrived in Seattle not expecting that the labor issue would be at the top of the American agenda. Just a month earlier, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, had met in Lausanne, Switzerland with ministers from more than 20 countries, including India, Brazil, Egypt, South Africa and Argentina, and assured them that the United States wanted a group that would only study labor issues, officials here said. It had no intention, the officials added, of taking the matter any further.
Since the Seattle talks collapsed on Dec. 3, President Clinton has said that India and Pakistan, another outspoken opponent of linking trade and labor standards, had misunderstood his remarks.
The president said he had not meant to suggest that the United States would cut off American markets to India and Pakistan if they did not raise wages to American levels.
But government officials and labor leaders here say they see the United States as calculatingly pursuing its own interests on trade -- and they are girding for future battle.
Mr. Maran, speaking in Parliament, said, "If you ask me to tell you in one word what happened in Seattle, my answer will be, 'We have postponed D-Day.' "

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
A License to Practice Medicinal Love

BYLINE: By RACHEL E. INGBER 

 BODY:
Although Nina A., a doctor from the former Soviet Union, told New York rescue workers that her husband, Boris, was having a heart attack, at first they diagnosed only his high blood pressure. Nina was unable to help because she could not speak English well, nor did she have a license to practice medicine in the United States.
Nina, who is 63, still practices medicine unofficially -- devoting six to seven hours a day to the care of Boris, who has been in a coma since the heart attack a year and a half ago. Nina finds hope in small improvements, like when her husband responds to her voice or flinches in pain. But Boris's doctors at the Cliffside Nursing Home in College Point, Queens, have told Nina that her only real hope is "to pray to God." Her husband's central nervous system is slowly deteriorating, and Nina cannot afford expensive neurological exams. 
 After spending a full day at the nursing home, and an hour and a half on two buses to return to her apartment in Rego Park, Queens, Nina rushes home to care for her mother, Evelina, who had a stroke four months before the family moved to the United States.
Nina, Boris and Evelina immigrated to the United States in 1994 from Uzbekistan, searching for greater religious freedom. During the Soviet years, anti-Semitism, from the government and neighbors, forced Nina's family to practice a "closed doors, closed windows" form of Judaism. Nina became used to schoolyard taunts of "move to Israel" at an early age.
Despite discrimination against Jews, Nina's family prospered in Uzbekistan. Nina and Boris met in the park as students, and married in 1965. Nina trained 10 years for a medical degree with a specialty in infectious diseases, and raised three children.
But the anti-Semitic climate at home only intensified in recent years, she said, once people were more free to speak their minds and the economy worsened. Even though their children immigrated to Israel, Nina and Boris moved to Queens to join a tight-knit community of Jews from their part of the world.
When the family arrived in the United States, Boris, who was a civil engineer in Uzbekistan, cleaned streets while learning job skills and English. Nina also dedicated herself to studying English so that she could retake her medical exams and practice in the United States.
Nina's studies were interrupted when a car hit her while she was waiting for a bus in 1995. She was in a wheelchair for eight months and had three surgeries within the next year, two knee operations and one to remove a tumor from her uterus.
In Uzbekistan, Nina led a productive life helping patients, but by July 1999, she was tired and depressed from long days of caring for loved ones and ashamed of being on public assistance. On a friend's suggestion, she called Bluma Palvanova, a social worker at the Rego Park Counseling Center in Queens.
The center runs support groups for recent emigres, helping them overcome culture shock, pass the citizenship test and learn English.
Nina diligently completes the homework and looks forward to her group sessions every Monday at the center, which is run by the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation, one of seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Ms. Palvanova, who is also from Uzbekistan, leads six adjustment groups a week and helps Nina and her 90 other clients navigate the daunting system of immigration and welfare agencies.
The majority of Ms. Palvanova's clients are like Nina -- highly educated Russians over the age of 60 who have a more difficult time adjusting to the cultural changes than their children and grandchildren. Some staff members at the counseling center speak Persian and Hebrew, in addition to Russian.
Nina has access to Rego Park's staff of social workers and psychologists who offer therapy, emergency financial assistance and job placement to an average of 300 to 400 immigrants per year. The counseling center has found a Russian-speaking home attendant to care for Evelina four hours a day.
Since participating in counseling at the Rego Park center, Nina says she no longer feels as helpless and overwhelmed. The other members of her adjustment group telephone her often during the week to find out how she is coping.
With this emotional support, Nina has enough energy to devote her attention to Boris. She is positive that she makes him feel better. Every day, she lovingly bathes him and massages his hands so they do not turn blue from lack of circulation.
"When one is kind and shows good feeling, that is more important than any medicine or surgery," she says.

HEADLINE: Public Interests;
Hold the Gluten Gruel

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
A century ago, a writer named Paul Devinne published a novel about a man who falls asleep in 1900 and wakes up in New York City in the year 2000. Here's how the hero describes the area that's currently my neighborhood:
" 'Glorious' was the only word I could utter. As far as the mammoth city extended, I saw only one huge garden, pierced here and there by slender towers or giant cupolas. . . . Where in my time Morningside Park lay, I saw a gigantic Statue of Liberty, standing upon the great gold dome of a colossal building of vast extent and classic style." 
 Well, we do have some nice new plantings in the street divider by the Burger King. But we haven't quite gotten to Devinne's vision of urban renewal. It's just as well; rents are high enough already.
People falling asleep and waking up in the year 2000 was a very big theme around 1900. It started with Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward," one of the biggest best sellers of the era. Bellamy's hero wakes up in an enlightened, egalitarian Boston in which the state owns all the businesses. Each worker gets exactly the same pay because everybody, from doctor to ditch digger, tries his or her hardest. People eat in beautiful public dining rooms. They shop at beautiful public stores, and the stuff they order arrives home before they do.
Readers fell in love with Bellamy's vision of a happy, cooperative and extremely white-bread society of the future. They formed Bellamy clubs to work on creating a utopia just like the one he wrote about. The book also launched a raft of imitators, like Devinne's "Day of Prosperity," in which everybody lives in marble hotels in what seems to be a state of perfect communism. In "News From Nowhere," the hero wakes up in a year 2000 London that's become a paradisical medieval village. Salmon swim upstream in the Thames.
One of the endearing things about these novels is the way the authors reorganize society to gratify their own particular little obsessions. "The Future Commonwealth" gives a great deal of attention to the efficient way travelers' luggage would be handled in 2000 -- and boy, are we glad that author didn't live to see the airports this weekend. In "Utopia Achieved," the hero spends about 70 pages describing the diet of the future. (Breakfast begins with "gluten gruel" and creamed potato. Supper is zwieback, cherry sauce and eggnog.) My favorite part of the Devinne book was not the four-hour workday, but the fact that you could call up any theater at 7 p.m. and get a ticket for the performance.
But the first thing you notice is the books' optimism, their excitement about the future's possibilities. (Well, actually, the first thing you notice is the awful writing. But the optimism would be next.) A hundred years ago, people all around the country were scribbling out their visions of what a good and just society would look like, and how to get there. Why aren't we spending this turn-of-the-millennium period working up utopian projections for 2100?
Maybe we're not into politics or societal self-improvement these days. Maybe that Soviet experience has made us leery of anything that looks like social planning. Or perhaps -- it's the holiday season, let's be optimistic -- we're just a lot more respectful of human differences. In all these utopias, uniformity was a given. Bellamy has every single person in the year 2000 behaving like a middle-class minister's son from Chicopee, Mass. In "The Ideal City," New Orleans is voluntarily segregated by happy black residents who enjoy keeping to themselves when they aren't doing the white citizens' grunge work. Written by a doctor, "The Ideal City" also has a general practitioner's view of the perfect society, in which the whole world is obsessed with hygiene. There are almost no traffic accidents because the streets are all one-way. Public kitchens provide everybody with exactly the same super-nutritious meal three times a day, and "no one thinks of demanding a variety merely to satisfy taste."
Middle-class Americans at the turn of the last century were unhinged by the huge influx of immigrants and labor unrest. They wanted the world to move forward in order to make it more like the homogeneous small-town America of the past. We're smarter, at least, in understanding that utopia ought to be an equal-rights community. And it definitely would not serve zwieback for breakfast.

HEADLINE: With a 'Don't Be Vexed' Air, Chirac Assesses U.S.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Among allies, France has had for 50 years a unique capacity to annoy Americans who may love French fries, French wine -- and sometimes even the French themselves, at least in those rare moments when they stop their constant hammering.
Irritation at the French is running high now in Washington, so President Jacques Chirac and other French officials are putting out the word that it is time to apply a little Gallic charm to their sensitive American friends. 
 "I do not feel in any way irritated or annoyed at the United States," Mr. Chirac said in a relaxed interview in French in Elysee Palace.
But Mr. Chirac, 67 and in his fifth year as president, spoke out critically on subjects ranging from the Senate's rejection of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, to the failure of global trade talks in Seattle this month, to plans for a new European armed force early in the new century, which in his view will by no means be an American century.
"I sometimes read that France wants a multipolar world so as to take the United States down a notch, or create rivalries to American power," he said. "I talk about a multipolar world because I think it's inevitable."
China, India, Europe (as Mr. Chirac believes) and Russia (according to Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine) will all be great powers in the next century.
French criticism of American ebullience may seem as relentless as Cartesian logic.
"There are moments when Americans get exasperated and think all we're trying to do is create difficulties for them," Mr. Vedrine told a group of American journalists here the other day, and those moments have sometimes stretched on endlessly since the days of de Gaulle.
Nothing irritates the French more than being dismissed as cranks rather than accepted as helpful critics. Mr. Chirac in particular bends over backward to assure Americans of his friendly predisposition, proudly telling visitors that he has credentials as a soda jerk from Howard Johnson from a student summer in Cambridge, Mass., and has scores of American friends he considers family. So he feels entitled to offer a little constructive criticism.
"I have been, of course, an observer of Congress for quite some time," he said. "To be perfectly frank, there used to be prominent people you could telephone, ask about things, discuss, consult, have a dialogue with. Today it's more difficult."
On the whole, he said, Congress does not seem as open to the world as it once was -- "Not the best attitude, given the responsibilities the United States has in the world." He was particularly critical of the Senate's rejection of the test ban treaty this fall, a vote that threatens, he said, "to set a bad example and start the arms proliferation race again."
A decision by the Clinton administration next year to build a limited antimissile defense against intercontinental rockets launched by small nations like North Korea, Iran or Iraq would create more global strategic instability than it would eliminate, Mr. Chirac believes.
"If you look at world history," he said, "ever since men began waging war, you will see that there's a permanent race between sword and shield. The sword always wins. The more improvements that are made to the shield, the more improvements are made to the sword."
"We think that with these systems," he said, referring to the possible United States antimissile shield, "we are just going to spur swordmakers to intensify their efforts."
"China, which was already working harder than we realized on both nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for them, would of course be encouraged to intensify those efforts, and it has the resources to do so," he said. "India would be encouraged to do the same thing, and it, too, has the resources.
"And it would also increase tensions within NATO, which would be too bad."
"The threat from North Korean missiles is sometimes mentioned as well," Mr. Chirac said. "Quite honestly, it isn't persuasive, but I'm ready to talk about it. I could be wrong, but I'm not the only one who thinks this way. But these are such important subjects that they ought to be discussed."
American criticisms of the rapid deployment force Europe plans to build for itself by 2003 as an attempt to torpedo the NATO alliance, Mr. Chirac said, just about caused him to fall off his chair. "The Americans kept saying Europe had to do more for its own defense, so we finally said, all right, we will," he said. "Now you shouldn't criticize us for doing what you wanted us to do."
American ambassadors in European capitals made coordinated approaches before the Europeans agreed on the details in Helsinki this month, asking in no uncertain terms for close coordination with NATO and assurances that the European force would strengthen the alliance and not weaken it, according to French and American officials.
"The United States has to make a choice," Mr. Vedrine said. "They have always been for sharing the burden. They've never been much for sharing the decision-making. Obviously, there are some real questions we have to answer, such as how are we going to organize this so as not to interfere with the alliance. We are well aware that it's complicated."
Mr. Chirac was even more reassuring. "Very soon the Americans will understand that this is not going to cause them any problem," he said.
This time around, it was not the French but Tony Blair, the British prime minister, who in October 1998 first suggested a European armed force that could intervene in crisis situations where the United States did not want to get involved. Later, Britain and France, followed by other European allies, formally proposed one, and all 15 European Union leaders endorsed a 60,000-strong force in Helsinki last week.
"If there was going to be a real problem, Tony Blair would never have suggested it in the first place," Mr. Chirac said. "All this strengthens NATO, it doesn't in the least mean any diminution of our commitment to the alliance."
Mr. Chirac said he would not use Mr. Vedrine's word, "hyperpower," to describe the economic, military and technological power of the United States, perhaps because he knew it sent American officials into overdrive.
Still, Mr. Chirac, a Gaullist conservative whose current term runs out in 2002, said he understood the foreign minister, a Socialist who came into office in 1997 when Mr. Chirac called a parliamentary election he mistakenly thought the conservatives were going to win.
"In French, 'hyper' is a word kids like to use," like "super," Mr. Chirac explained. "When Vedrine said that America was a hyperpower there was nothing pejorative about it."
Mr. Chirac and the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, along with the rest of the European Union, have said no to imports of American beef treated with hormones, despite American assurances that it is safe. The World Trade Organization authorized the United States earlier this year to retaliate by imposing high tariffs on European delicacies and luxury goods.
"We have been through some big traumas in France, in particular with blood contaminated with the AIDS virus," Mr. Chirac said, "so you have to understand that these things are highly sensitive."
"There are five or six hormones in hormone-treated beef, and of those, one is officially recognized by the highest scientific authorities as being carcinogenic," he said.
American officials have disputed such assertions, but, Mr. Chirac said, "You can't make us eat something we don't want to eat." The same goes for British beef, which France is refusing to import even though the European Union recently decided that it was now free of so-called mad cow disease, a neurological disorder in cattle that may be communicable to humans.
Mr. Chirac has called for an international world scientific body to resolve such disputes in the future.
Mr. Chirac and other officials say they are not trying to cause trouble for their powerful ally across the sea. Both Mr. Chirac and Mr. Vedrine, for example, charitably refrained from describing the collapse of the trade talks in Seattle early this month as an American failure.
"It's not an American failure, not a European failure, not a failure of the developing countries," Mr. Chirac said. "It will work out next time."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
A 10-Gallon Place With Dreams to Match

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The words and music have stuck in my mind for 40-odd years, because they seemed so apt. Frank Loesser wrote them for a musical called "The Most Happy Fella," and they stopped the show every time.
"You're from Big D I can guess," a brassy dame sang, "by the way you drawl and the way you dress. You're from Big D, my, oh yes. I mean Big D, little a, double l, a, s. And that spells Dallas, my darlin', darlin' Dallas . . . where every home's a palace, 'cause the settlers settle for no less." 
 Big money, big hair, big talk. Such is the lingering stereotype of this city. It occupies a sizable spot in the national consciousness as the home of the big, bad Dallas Cowboys, of J. R. Ewing and Miss Ellie and all the gang at Southfork, and of the little guy with the big ears and bigger ambition, H. Ross Perot, who was a billionaire before he turned 40.
And for those old enough to recall the events of November 1963, it occupies an especially dark corner of memory, as the cursed place where John F. Kennedy was shot.
Yet Dallas and its smaller sibling, Fort Worth, an unmatched pair if ever there was one, amount to much more than that. Together with the little cities that cluster around them like pilot fish, they constitute the largest metropolitan area in the nation's second largest state. (Houston is bigger, but its metropolitan area is slightly smaller.) They boast the largest collection of major corporate headquarters outside of New York and Chicago.
Identified with all that is brash, Dallas is also the home of Neiman Marcus, an emblem of all that is stylish, and of its impresario, Stanley Marcus, an emblem of all that is civilized and sophisticated, who still travels alone at age 95. (Mr. Marcus brought the designer Coco Chanel to Dallas in 1957 for one of his store's fabulous Foreign Fortnights and reported later that he had found her a dull luncheon companion.)
Once known as Cowtown, Fort Worth is the home of the Kimbell Art Museum, the masterwork of the great modernist Louis I. Kahn, with an exquisite collection of Old Masters in its top-lit galleries. At the risk of offending fans of the Frick in New York, the Gardner in Boston and the Phillips in Washington, I would choose it as the nation's best small museum.
Enormously wealthy, often eccentric men populate the histories of the two cities: Columbus Marion (Dad) Joiner, who discovered the largest oil field in the world on Daisy Bradford's farm in Rusk County; H. L. Hunt, who bought the leases from him for $30,000, built an empire and spent his old age as a megarich loony, selling Gastro-Majic indigestion pills at the state fair; and Sid Richardson, a legendary wildcatter whose great-nephews, the Bass brothers, have invested it well, amassing a huge fortune and rebuilding downtown Fort Worth in the process.
Dallas is incredibly inventive, endlessly entrepreneurial. Here Herb Kelleher dreamed up Southwest Airlines, with its low prices and jokey style ("Austin Auften," say the billboards). His planes have become the Greyhounds of the 1990's. Here a Texas Instruments engineer named Jack Kilby, who had been with the company too short a time to earn a vacation, spent July 1958 in the lab and hit upon the idea of the silicon chip, or integrated circuit, ushering in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution.
A lot has changed since Harry McPherson was growing up in Tyler, 100 miles east of Dallas. Mr. McPherson went to Washington in the Johnson years and stayed on, writing what is widely considered one of the best books ever written on the capital, "A Political Education" (1972). And there is much that still rings true about the description of Dallas that he wrote 20 years ago for The Atlantic, including this passage:
"Just as you passed the Buckner Orphans' Home -- I imagined it full of city kids like Mickey Rooney, presided over by Spencer Tracy -- you could see the metropolitan skyline. It floated in the cold autumn sunlight, or trembled in the waves of summer heat. Dallas. Mysterious. Rich. Full of merchants, criminals and transplanted country boys."
 
Shocks in the 80's
Dallas took a pasting in the second half of the 1980's. "They're going to go broke, making all of these crazy loans," Theodore H. Strauss, the businessman-brother of Robert S. Strauss, the Dallas and Washington lawyer and politico, remembers telling his friends.
He was right. One by one, the big Dallas banks, overextended, stuck with worthless real estate and energy paper, were forced to turn to Washington or out-of-state holding companies for rescue. Finally, not a single locally owned bank was left, only subsidiaries of the big outfits in New York, and Charlotte, N.C., and Columbus, Ohio. A lot of proud old Dallas families watched fortunes vanish.
There were other shocks. Walker L. Railey, the minister of the First United Methodist Church, one of the largest in the nation, was accused of choking his wife, leaving her in a permanent vegetative state. He had been the golden boy of the religious community in a city where religion counts for a lot, where a broadcasting network ornaments its offices at Christmas with red tinsel letters spelling out the words, "Happy Birthday, Jesus."
So the downfall of Mr. Railey, who tried to commit suicide, confessed to an affair with the wife of another minister and then left town with her, staggered the city almost as much as the big banks' collapse. Even when a jury acquitted him.
And then there was the scandal at Southern Methodist University. Southern Methodist is another of the city's defining institutions, as pivotal in its way to Dallas as Harvard is to Boston. With its splendid Meadows Museum of Spanish art, it lies at the heart of the enclave, north of downtown, known as Park Cities -- Highland Park and University Park. Conservative, wealthy, snobbish, the Park Cities are also known as "the Bubble."
As its residents see things, scandals belong to the messy world outside the Bubble, not the orderly one inside, but it emerged in 1987 that Southern Methodist had been illegally paying its football players. Worse, the board of trustees, led by Gov. William P. Clements Jr., had known of the payments and had contrived an elaborate scheme of bribes to cover them up. The National Collegiate Athletic Association imposed the toughest sanctions in its history, and Southern Methodist, which had produced gridiron immortals like Doak Walker and Don Meredith, fielded no football team at all for two seasons.
As John Steinbeck wrote in "Travels With Charley," in 1962, "Football games have the glory and the despair of war, and when a Texas team takes the field against a foreign state, it is an army with banners." In war, rules are often bent.
"It's a kind of metaphor of how far things can get out of hand when people are so highly focused on competition, success, being No. 1," Dr. Leroy T. Howe, the president of the university's faculty senate, commented at the time. "In Dallas, the people who aren't winning are losing."
 
More Cautious Dreams
Dallas is booming again. You see it vividly in the procession of shiny new buildings marching along the so-called Platinum Corridor, a 14-mile stretch of the Dallas North Tollway from the L. B. J. Freeway to Plano. This is now one of many economic nodes of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, as it is known.
Scattered along the freeways, amid the barbecue joints and the used-car lots, with their flags the size of basketball courts, are the headquarters of companies like Frito-Lay and Exxon, J. C. Penney and American Airlines, Texas Industries and Electronic Data Systems, and scores of little companies in the computer, software, Internet and communications businesses. Alcatel, Nortel, Nokia and Ericsson all have offices on the North Tollway.
But things have changed. Dallas is no longer so closely tied to one business, as it once was to cotton, and then to oil, and then to aerospace, and the bankers and developers have learned the value of caution. They are not quite so eager to make or take loans secured mostly by thin air.
"We call ourselves 'the city without boundaries,' but we're growing up a little," said Gail Thomas, founder of the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture. "Dallas dreams big dreams; it always has. You come here with a little idea, and it turns into a big one. But there's a new realism."
Hard times produced some new and different leaders. At the low point, with oil prices at rock bottom and the patriarchy in retreat, the city turned to a woman, Annette Strauss, wife of Theodore Strauss, as its mayor. She promptly got dozens of new arts projects moving. And then Dallas, a little to its own surprise, elected a black man, Ron Kirk, to succeed her.
 
Stubborn Problems
The Trinity River, the British weekly The Economist said not long ago, "bisects the city of Dallas as certainly as an ocean." Highland Park's whites enjoy average household incomes of more than $200,000 a year; in largely black and Hispanic South Dallas, the figure is a measly $11,350. Poor education takes a toll. Latinos will make up the majority of the city's work force by 2010, but today only 1 percent of high-tech employees are Latino.
Downtown Dallas is another difficult problem for Mr. Kirk.
Banks and law offices -- including Robert Strauss's powerhouse firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, with more than 900 lawyers -- bring thousands of workers into the area by day, but by night the sidewalks are eerily empty. New high-rise apartment blocks are going up in and around the center of town, and the red Pegasus sign, a landmark since 1934, is soon to be reinstalled atop the recently renovated Magnolia Hotel. But Neiman Marcus's store looks lonely amid shabby neighbors; hoped-for new restaurants and theaters have not arrived.
Eventually, a new arts center may be part of the answer, but it has been a long time a-coming.
The arts center's linchpin is the 2,062-seat Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, named by its principal donor, Mr. Perot, for one of his business colleagues, who sings in the Dallas Symphony Chorus. Designed by I. M. Pei, it combines the sharp angles of the National Gallery's East Building in Washington with swelling glass "blisters" that allow sunlight to penetrate into restaurants and lobbies. There are echoes of Garnier's Paris Opera in its monumental exterior, and touches of Josef Hoffmann in the interior, which is richly paneled in warmly hued woods.
Both the building and its acoustics have won the affection of the city, as has Andrew Litton, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra's 40-year-old conductor. New York-born, he reminds me of Leonard Bernstein both in his athleticism on the podium and his fondness for dramatic musical effect. He made his reputation with the Bournemouth Symphony in England, which accounts for the frequent appearance of Walton and Elgar on his programs.
 
Lively Arts Scene
Only 25 years ago, the orchestra was in such stormy financial straits that it had to suspend operations for a year. But at a time when many orchestras face shrinking audiences, Dallas runs a solid surplus, with subscription sales near 100 percent. It records regularly, appears every year in Carnegie Hall and tours Europe -- all of the things that the big guys do.
The Dallas Opera has no splendiferous new home, although the arts center's master plan calls for one. For the moment, the opera plays in the barny old Music Hall at Fair Park, a building with all the charm and acoustical subtlety of an airplane hangar. Still, it manages accomplished productions like last year's "Katya Kabanova" and this year's "Walkure," which starred James Morris as Wotan. Next year, it will gain a new leader, Anthony Whitworth-Jones, who served as the chief executive officer of the much-admired Glyndebourne Festival Opera in southern England.
A new leader has already arrived at the Dallas Museum of Art: John R. Lane, who put the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on the map. He inherits a collection comprehensive in scope but uneven in detail, with strong pre-Columbian and decorative arts departments and several stellar individual paintings, including Mondrians stretching from the early, representational style to the neo-plastic masterpiece "Place de la Concorde"; van Gogh's golden "Sheaves of Wheat," and Hopper's evocative "Lighthouse Hill." The highlight may be Frederic E. Church's immense, chill-inducing canvas, "The Icebergs," which was rediscovered in England and bought in 1979.
Next door is a real jewel, a small museum of Asian art established last year by Trammell Crow, one of the world's largest real estate developers. The jade, the crystal ball (the world's second-biggest, after one in the Smithsonian) and above all the 18th-century sandstone facade of a Rajasthan palace are don't-miss attractions. Installations are immaculate.
 
Memories of 1963
Many come to Dallas to see the grassy knoll near which Kennedy was killed, "allegedly," as an official plaque puts it, by a shot fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. Dallas still has doubts. In addition to the city-backed Sixth Floor Museum, which shows assassination-related articles like the camera used by Abraham Zapruder to film the shooting, there is also a privately run Conspiracy Museum nearby.
Dallas had a mean streak in the 1960's; Lyndon B. Johnson was jeered and spat upon in downtown Dallas in 1960, and Adlai E. Stevenson was hit on the head with a placard by right-wing demonstrators in 1963. Douglas Kiker, then a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune, covering President Kennedy's visit, said after the president was shot: "If I had the power to, I'd call the bombers over this place. How could a thing like this happen?"
But of course Dallas did not kill Kennedy, any more than Los Angeles killed his brother Robert.
 
Leading Architects
Seven years afterward, a memorial designed by Philip Johnson and paid for by 50,000 people across the country was opened a few blocks from the knoll. It consists of four 30-foot-high concrete walls, with narrow openings on two sides and an unadorned gray granite cenotaph at its center. Some find it moving; some find it sterile. Everyone finds it grubby with age, and early next year, a long-overdue, $70,000 cleanup is scheduled to start.
Mr. Johnson, whose Houston buildings helped define that city's sleek skyline, has designed a number of duds in Dallas, including the Bank One tower, a weird neo-Palladian effort, and Crescent Court, which marries lacy New Orleans ironwork to a monstrosity of a mansard roof. Mr. Johnson once said (jokingly?) that he saved all of his best ideas for Houston.
Other well-known architects have misfired here, too, like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, with a skyscraper pierced for no apparent reason by a huge keyhole-shaped opening, and Frank Lloyd Wright, whose Dallas Theater Center (completed in 1959) is watered-down Guggenheim-ery. (Which is by no means to denigrate the quality of the dramatic productions mounted there; the company, heir to the tradition of Margo Jones, a regional theater pioneer, is capably run by Richard Hamburger, son of Philip, the New Yorker writer.)
Mr. Pei's glittering, glass-sheathed Fountain Place, surrounded by water terraces created by Dan Kiley, is the best high-rise in town, just as Meyerson Hall is the best low-rise. But his Brutalist City Hall, built in 1978, already looks dated.
Perhaps the most remarkable set of buildings in Dallas is the 26 Art Deco structures on the 127-acre Texas State Fairgrounds, including the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of State, a celebration of the state's gaudy history. For 24 days each fall, tens of thousands of country folk, and thousands of others pretending to be, come to ride the Ferris wheel and see the rodeo.
 
Museums on the Rise
In Fort Worth, pride of place goes to the Kimbell. Mr. Kahn's long, vaulted, refined galleries in oak, travertine, concrete and stainless steel work as well today as the day they were built (1972). Miraculously, every single picture in the building is worth seeing, and almost all of them -- the Duccio, the Mantegna, the two Georges de la Tours, the Caspar David Friedrich (the only one in an American museum) and the magisterial "Cardsharps" of Caravaggio -- were acquired in the 1970's, 80's and 90's.
Two other Fort Worth museums are rebuilding, with the ubiquitous Mr. Johnson doing the honors for the Amon Carter Museum, which focuses on American art, Western and otherwise, and Tadeo Ando, the respected Japanese architect, designing a new home for the Museum of Modern Art. The city, which was once the southern terminus of the Chisholm Trail, has clearly grown well beyond its colorful old stockyards and its raucous, gargantuan honky-tonk, Billy Bob's Texas. Even beyond its longtime slogan, "Where the West Begins."
People call Fort Worth "Bassville." The Basses have given it a new performance hall, named after their father, Perry, with limestone angels on the facade blowing immense brass trumpets. A pastiche of Secession, Beaux-Arts and postmodern styles, it is much loved locally, but I agree with a Dallas critic who termed it a romance novel of a building.
Dallas's latest benefactor is Raymond Nasher, a developer whose collection of modern sculpture, widely viewed as the world's best, was courted by major museums from New York to Washington to San Francisco. Instead, he is building a museum and garden across from the Dallas Museum of Art to house a rotating selection of his Matisses and Ernsts, Calders and Miros and Dubuffets, now displayed in and near his brick-and-glass home in northern Dallas.
The architect is Renzo Piano, the Italian who designed the superb Menil museum in Houston.
"At the moment," Mr. Nasher said, "Dallas has nothing of real artistic significance, internationally. Perhaps this can be it. This is a nice city, but it's mostly about money. We're hoping to change that a little."
 
Diverse Diversions
 
The Dallas-Fort Worth area is about 1,565 miles southwest of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:
 
Where to Stay
 
ADOLPHUS HOTEL, 1321 Commerce Street, (214) 742-8200. Built in 1912 by the beer baron Adolphus Busch, restored and expanded often since, this is the best bet downtown. The lobby, a vast, opulent Gilded Age drawing room, is furnished with oversize chairs, 10-foot-tall potted palms and an antique silver chandelier adorned with Budweiser eagles. Upstairs, the bedrooms are less lavish, but Texas big; some have terraces. Cheerful service. Double room: $149 to $179.
 
CRESCENT COURT, 400 Crescent Court, (214) 871-3200. Like the Mansion, the newer Crescent Court belongs to Rosewood Hotels, the luxury group developed and partly owned by Caroline Rose Hunt. Just a step behind its stablemate, and not a very big one, it offers many of the same amenities, including deluxe bathrooms and sheets soft enough for a princess. Its public spaces, with acres of marble, may strike some as a little chilly. Double room: $350 to $440.
 
THE MANSION ON TURTLE CREEK, 2821 Turtle Creek Boulevard, (214) 559-2100. If this sanctuary just north of downtown isn't the best hotel in the mainland United States, it comes close. The brilliant flower arrangements are worth the price of admission by themselves. Sumptuous furnishings, of course, including a few old pieces, along with extras like Ethernet facilities in every bedroom. The service is stunning. Need a phone cord for your computer on Thanksgiving Day? No problem; it arrives in six minutes flat. Double room: $300 to $450.
 
MELROSE, 3015 Oak Lawn Avenue, (214) 521-5151. A more modestly priced option in Oak Lawn, an old neighborhood conveniently close to downtown, this 75-year-old red-brick dowager has been well restored. Its 182 high-ceilinged bedrooms feature mahogany armoires. A cheerful, dimly lit little library, complete with bar and piano, opens off a bright, immaculate lobby. Double room: $$195 to $245.
 
Where to Eat
 
ABACUS, 4511 McKinney Avenue, (214) 559-3111. Open only a few months, Abacus has already found its niche. A snappy, geometric modern decor is warmed by potted orchids and autumnal colors on the walls, to say nothing of the Asian-influenced food. Some dishes falter, but two dazzled us: lamb potstickers with a tamarind sauce, and lobster-scallion balls, moistened with chili- and coconut-infused sake -- a bit like savory Mounds bars.
 
CITIZEN, 3858 Oak Lawn Avenue, (214) 522-7253. Another newcomer, more pan-Asian, less fusion-focused than Abacus, more casual, more appealing to young people. Order an assortment of sashimi, and a lovely lacquer tray appears, heaped high with shaved ice and scintillatingly fresh raw fish. Some is conventional (salmon, tuna, yellowtail), some is Texified (tuna belly marinated in chili oil, tuna studded with jalapeno and cilantro).
 
THE FRENCH ROOM, in the Adolphus Hotel (see above). Few hotel dining rooms anywhere create such a gala mood. The soaring ceiling is decorated in the pinks and pale blues of the French Rococo style; the service is formal but warmly unpretentious; the wine list offers mature, affordable claret and Burgundy, and the food is refreshingly untheatrical. I'm not sure I've ever eaten a better, tenderer or more authentically gamy loin of venison.
 
THE MANSION ON TURTLE CREEK (see above). Spicy house classics, like tortilla soup and lobster taco, are matched by special-occasion treats like roast turkey with tortilla stuffing and cranberry-jalapeno relish. The team here, from Dean Fearing, the chef, to Alex Jureeratana, the maitre d', has worked together for years. You can spend thousands on wine; if you're a bit short, seek the advice of Kent Rice, the state's best sommelier.
 
PRIMO'S, 3309 McKinney Avenue, (214) 220-0510. This is the favorite Tex-Mex joint of Bob Strauss and top Dallas chefs. Chili con queso and deep-fried jalapenos will satisfy the most leathery palate, and chicken quesadillas will please more sensitive souls. (Another to try: Mia's, 4322 Lemmon Avenue, (214) 526-1020. Ask for brisket tacos, which are not on the menu.)
 
SONNY BRYAN'S, 2202 Inwood Road, (214) 357-7120. This concrete-block shack has been at it for 40 years. You eat lean, tender, sublimely smoky barbecued brisket of beef at old school desks or off the hood of your BMW. You could slice the atmosphere with a knife; for the beef, you don't need one.

Rock shrimp with tomatillo sauce or the mellow garlic custard tart topped with crab meat make good starters; a cowboy ribeye is the semiobligatory main course.

HEADLINE: THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS: THE OVERVIEW;
ISRAEL AND SYRIA PLAN NEW TALKS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Leaders of Syria and Israel agreed today to begin intensive and accelerated talks early next month intended to end the state of war that has existed between them for 50 years, President Clinton announced.
Mr. Clinton warned that "the journey will be tough" when the talks start near Washington, and he pointedly did not predict success. But he emphasized the determination of the Israelis and the Syrians to negotiate in good faith and promised American aid at every step. 
 The president announced the talks in a five-minute statement on the White House driveway this afternoon. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel stood tight-lipped and mute to his right; Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria stood in impassive silence to his left.
"Over the past 48 hours," Mr. Clinton said, "Israel and Syria have taken critical steps in the journey toward peace. That journey will be a difficult one. But with courage and perseverance on both sides, the result will be deeply rewarding to the people of Israel and to the people of Syria." Excerpts from Mr. Clinton's comments and those of the secretary of state, Page A21.
The three men returned to the West Wing of the White House after the president's remarks without answering questions. Mr. Clinton guided them with a hand on each of their backs, but the Israeli and the Syrian did not speak or shake hands.
Still, the moment was heavy with promise and symbolism, coming after nearly four years of cold silence between the two nations. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who is thought to be in ill health, did not attend the talks, but it is clear that Mr. Shara carries his proxy.
Today's announcement is not the end of enmity between Israel and Syria, but it is perhaps the beginning of the end. The just-concluded talks, which began on Wednesday morning in the Oval Office, had a narrow goal: to set a time and ground rules for more formal negotiations on the issues that divide Israel and Syria. Those include borders -- particularly the status of the Golan Heights -- security, terrorism, water rights and diplomatic and economic relations.
Those substantive matters were not on the table and were dealt with only obliquely. Thus all three parties could claim that the two days of talks were an unqualified success.
The negotiations will resume on Jan. 3 at a location that has not yet been chosen. State Department officials are searching for a place near Washington that is secure and secluded but also close enough for Mr. Clinton to reach on short notice.
No deadline has been set for securing an agreement, and White House aides said the talks would continue as long as they are making progress. Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara agreed to stay in the United States for an extended period, or to break off for a time and return, if the prospect of success remains, a senior White House official said.
But an Israeli official said Mr. Barak was not willing to conduct open-ended talks without the promise of a comprehensive settlement.
Mr. Clinton briefed several world leaders by telephone after the talks ended, a White House spokesman said. He called Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader; Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain; President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt; Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; King Abdullah of Jordan, and King Mohammed VI of Morocco.
The Americans, Syrians and Israelis agreed not to discuss the substance of the talks conducted over the last two days, and for the most part kept the bargain.
Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara decided not to speak on the White House driveway this afternoon, in part because Mr. Shara's bitter harangue on Wednesday morning about Israeli occupation of Syrian territory morning was poorly received by Israeli and American officials.
Mr. Barak told an Israeli reporter as he was leaving the White House today that the talks were "hard, but we're on the right track."
Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman, said: "Over all, the atmosphere was quite positive. It was the first step in the right direction."
Mr. Shara made no comments as he left the White House, nor did any other member of his delegation.
American officials were more expansive, but offered few details of the substance or the tenor of the talks.
There was, however, a sense of relief that the initial round had borne fruit, and a guarded optimism that next month's more pointed negotiations could lead to a peace treaty that would forever change the psychological and physical map of the Middle East.
"What is significant is that the two sides at the very highest level met together for first time in 50 years and decided to launch serious negotiations to reach a peace agreement," Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, said tonight in an interview. "I think that's a big deal."
He continued: "They opened a gate. They now have to walk down a very bumpy road, and I can't say for sure whether they will succeed. But I can say they are embarking on this with a serious intent to reach an agreement."
Mr. Berger described the atmosphere of the talks as proper and cordial, but not warm. He said the Israeli prime minister and the Syrian foreign minister spoke informally during negotiating sessions but did not appear to establish anything approaching camaraderie.
Mr. Shara, for instance, refused to shake Mr. Barak's hand in public. He told American officials that he would reserve that gesture for a more significant moment.
If a warmer personal relationship is to develop, Mr. Berger said, it will grow from the more intensive discussions. American officials have employed a form of diplomatic seclusion bordering on captivity in previous Arab-Israeli negotiations at Camp David and the Wye Plantation in Maryland, as well as in the Bosnia talks at an Air Force base near Dayton, Ohio.
A senior State Department official who handles Middle East matters said Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara would refuse to follow any script, even one written by the chief sponsor of the talks, the United States. And while there will be an element of theatrics to the negotiations -- the withheld handshake, for instance -- there will also be substance, he said.
"The meat is that both sides have their own reasons for wanting to come to a deal, and they're not going to let theatrics get in the way of that," the official said.
In his remarks this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said that Israel had embarked on serious negotiations with the Palestinians and the Syrians and that talks on Lebanon were expected soon. He said the world could hope to see a "new and different" Middle East in the coming months and pledged American assistance "every step of the way."
On the Syrian track, American participation is crucial. Hostility and distrust are so deep that neither side is yet willing to speak without an interlocutor present. At no time during the last two days did Mr. Shara and Mr. Barak meet alone.
The United States is thus destined to be mediator, guarantor and ultimately underwriter of any peace between Israel and Syria. The costs will be large, but the administration is prepared to ask Congress for a multibillion-dollar package to carry out an agreement, should one be reached next year.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the two days of discussions had been "inspiring" because of the apparent depth of commitment to peace by both sides.
"We are talking about a sense of great movement forward and a sense of hope, but also a very realistic view of the fact that we've got a lot to do," she said after the leaders left the White House. "And so these two days were filled with hope and also frank realism about the amount of work that needed to be done."

Chart/Map: "AT ISSUE: What the Israelis and Syrians Must Resolve"
Land
Syria demands the full return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured during the 1967 war. Israel appears ready to concede territory; the question is how much. Syria demands everything extending to the prewar June 4, 1967, borders, which they see as reaching the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Israel has never been willing to withdraw from land beyond the previously accepted international borders between the two countries. The disputed territory is small, but its shoreline location is of great importance.
 
Security
EARLY WARNING STATIONS The Israelis demand an internationally run monitoring station on Mount Hermon, between the new Israeli and Syrian borders. Israelis have long insisted that there should be an Israeli force at that station, which the Syrians reject entirely. It is possible that both sides could agree to an American presence, in which case the Syrians would probably demand that the Americans share intelligence information with both sides.
 
SYRIAN DEMILITARIZATION Israel will seek to push Syrian troops away from the border and toward Damascus, while Syria may be willing to discuss more limited redeployments.
 
Water Rights
To whom does the Jordan River belong? Both sides want to control the sources of the river, but agree that each country should receive the water it needs. It is likely there would be some kind of international supervision of the resources.
 
Normalization of Relations
Israel demands full diplomatic relations with open borders and complete normalization, including economic relations. Syria is unlikely to consider the opening of an Israeli embassy in Damascus until a withdrawal is carried out, and is unsure about trade relations.
 
Lebanon
Israel is expected to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon and to demand that Syria, whose army controls much of Lebanon, rein in the guerrilla forces that threaten Israel's northern border.
 
Timing
Israel thinks that the withdrawal from the Golan Heights will take at least three years. Syria is expected to agree to a gradual withdrawal but demand a shorter time frame. (pg. A20)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Down And OutIn Rural Canada

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SPERLING, Manitoba

 BODY:
A century ago, European farmers spilled across Canada's western prairies, creating "little Europes." As recently as the 1950's, this farming village outside Winnipeg could have been in Germany, supporting one restaurant, two churches, three stores and a high school.
But free market policies -- deeply cutting farm subsidies, allowing inefficient farmers to fail, and promoting productive techniques for the survivors -- have radically transformed the human landscape here. 
 "Twenty-five years ago, there were 25 families on this land -- now there is only one," said Ron Hiebert, a 49-year-old wheat farmer, driving over the 8,900 acres he farms with his family. Sperling's population has dropped in half since 1970, to 100 people, he said, and "all we have now is the post office and the rink."
At the turn of the century, this is precisely the rural depopulation feared by Old World agricultural Europe. It has seen the farming revolutions wrought in the "overseas Europes" -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States -- and wants nothing to do with them. Its resistance to any change in European farming, in fact, is a major reason why the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle collapsed early this month.
To justify their $130 billion in annual farm subsidies, European Union officials divert discussion from the costs for consumers and taxpayers to talk of keeping people on the land and of preserving rural landscapes for tourists.
It is a little late for Canada, which has cut annual farm subsidies to about $3 billion today. With farming now employing only 3 percent of Canada's work force, farmers worry that they have lost the population and political influence to fight for their interests.
Following free trade recipes from earlier international trade meetings, Canada has cut wheat subsidies from 31 percent of gross receipts in 1991 to 9 percent today, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the same time, the two other major wheat producers kept subsidies high -- 38 percent in the United States and 56 percent in the European Union. Australia's wheat subsidy is 4 percent. New Zealand has none.
Today, skepticism prevails in Canada's breadbasket when people hear that Ottawa vows to make cuts in overseas farm subsidies its priority -- when and if the W.T.O. can convene new trade negotiations.
"We took the Captain Canuck, Dudley-do-Right attitude that trade agreements would be followed," said John V. Morriss, editor of the Manitoba Co-operator, a farm weekly. Even if new trade talks happen, he said, "Nobody outside of Ottawa thinks this is going to work."
At the Canadian Wheat Board, a government agency based in Winnipeg, Gordon Miles, the executive vice president, said: "Canada stepped up and eliminated their wheat subsidy. The Europeans didn't. The Americans didn't."
 In an interview published Friday in The Globe and Mail, the European Union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, reiterated the group's opposition to efforts by Canada to seek lower European farm subsidies.
Overseas, Canada is revered, even feared, as a lean and mean agricultural powerhouse. Planting 90 million acres a year, farmers harvest a cornucopia of crops, including an annual average of 25 million tons of wheat. The world's second-largest wheat exporter, after the United States, Canada controls about 20 percent of the world market. In durum wheat, essential for pasta, it controls almost two-thirds of the internationally traded supply.
But inside the powerhouse, Canadian farmers feel besieged.
Journalists in Canadian cities write dismissively of "farm crisis fatigue," and openly suggest that some of western Canada's farmland should be returned to wilderness.
Blaming American and European subsidies for extremely low wheat prices, the premiers of two prairie provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, went to Ottawa in late October to seek aid, or what they called "trade equalization payments." In response, Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief promised $115 million -- one-eighth of what they had sought. The minister, a member of the Liberal Party, a party with little western rural support, essentially told the premiers that Canada has too many farmers. He described his policy as "tough love."
"Why should farmers be rescued to any greater degree than miners or foresters, all of whom were affected by the slump in commodity markets?" The Globe and Mail newspaper editorialized of the austere position of the minister, who himself failed last year as an Ontario fruit and vegetable farmer. "Farmers have cried crisis frequently enough over the years to trigger a wolf whistle when they come to Ottawa."
In response, John Cooper, an Alberta farmer, wrote in The National Post, Canada's other national newspaper: "I feel I am under the heel of the enemy. That is how I view Ottawa, and maybe all urban people."
Even before the minister told farmers to sink or swim, 5 percent of prairie farmers interviewed in August by Angus Reid, a polling group, said they planned to abandon farming; 41 percent said they were "considering" leaving farming.
Last summer, as wheat prices fell to the lowest levels in a decade, prairie farmers blocked highways, drove in tractorcades to Ottawa, and talked of blocking food shipments to eastern cities. One farmer, speaking at a rally in front of Saskatchewan's legislative assembly, brandished a handful of iron spikes and said, "If the family farm is not supported, the railways are coming out, too."
But in Canada's plains, where agriculture has dominated the economy, farmers were shocked when some impatient drivers responded to blockades with obscene hand signals.
In Manitoba, the hardest hit state, farm income is forecast to plummet this year to $33 million -- only 14 percent of the annual average of the last five years. In contrast, the province's manufactured exports have tripled during the 1990's, surpassing agricultural exports last year for the first time. In 1998, this province of 1.1 million people exported $677 million worth of oil seeds and cereal grains, compared with $900 million worth of buses and aircraft parts.
In a demographic shift that spells a loss of rural access to government tax money and political influence, the majority of western Canadians now live in cities. Of the nation's 217,000 farming families, only a minority make more than half of their income from farming.
With dwindling influence, the farmers see little prospect that Ottawa will challenge the farm subsidies of the United States, which total $47 billion a year. The reluctance is partly because American demand for Canadian products is vital to Canada's economic well-being.
In the first 10 months of this year, Canada's trade surplus with the United States hit $31.5 billion, two-thirds higher than in the corresponding period a year earlier. Canada runs a trade deficit with all its other major trading partners.
Now, some farmers are turning Ottawa's free market guns on itself, demanding abolition of the Canadian Wheat Board, a government monopoly-purchasing system that started as a war measure in 1943.
Dedicated to "orderly marketing," this state company buys all the wheat and barley grown for export in western Canada, sells it overseas, and pays farmers the average, or "pool" price. Mr. Miles, the board official, said in Winnipeg, "Because of the strength of the monopoly, we can extract better prices."
But across the street, at the Western Canadian Wheat Growers' headquarters, officials point to independent surveys that indicate Canadian wheat farmers get as little as 80 percent of the price charged by their American farming neighbors.
"Our farmer knows darn well that he is getting a lower price than the farmer across the border," said Paul D. Earl, a manager for the group of 6,000 big western Canada farmers. "The position of our organization is that the Canadian Wheat Board should be a voluntary organization."
In September, Elwin Hermanson, Saskatchewan's conservative candidate for premier, swept rural districts in part by criticizing the Wheat Board's monopoly. But even in Saskatchewan, the province with the highest proportion of rural residents, Roy Romanow was re-elected premier on the strength of city votes.
Some farmers contend that the monopoly has retarded development of western flour and pasta mills, processing operations that add value in the region.
Voting with their seeds, many farmers have switched to canola, a crop that is marketed privately, outside the board's control. Last year for the first time, canola, which is crushed for edible oil, overtook wheat to become Canada's most important source of farm income.
But to preserve soils, farmers must regularly rotate their crops and plant wheat, generally about every three years. At his farmhouse here, Mr. Hiebert regularly checks his desktop commodities monitor, looking for the best moment to sell his oats, lentils or flax to any of a dozen private companies.
But, although he is only a 45-minute drive from the North Dakota border, he knows the penalties for trying to drive a truckload of his own wheat out of Canada. Referring to Canadian customs officials, he said, "They would throw me in jail."
During the last upward spike in wheat prices, in the mid-1990's, about half a dozen western Canadian farmers went to jail for trying to export their own wheat.
The proof of the state monopoly's inefficiency, said Jim Pallister, a farmer opponent, is that American farmers rarely try to send their wheat north to get Canadian prices. "You don't see people in Florida trying to take a rowboat to Havana."

The Future Will Resume in 15 Days

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In the beginning there was sex. Then there was violence. Then there was apocalypse. And finally there was shopping.
Such has been the narrative -- part Old Testament, part old Judith Krantz -- of the Internet thus far. As we have tried to grapple with the daunting growth of a medium unknown to most of us five years ago, we have successively focused on its capacity for spreading pornography and sex scandal, for fomenting explosive political extremism, for compounding the alleged chaos of Y2K, for creating wealth and for letting us shop till we drop without getting dressed. We have made folk legends out of young dot-com zillionaires, national goblins out of online Nazis proselytizing to the young. We have learned of an alternate universe where people live by Internet time and are paid in Internet money. We cannot venture anywhere in the "real" world without consuming ads for Web sites we've never heard of that want to take us to virtual destinations unknown. 
 But in truth we ain't seen nothin' yet, and much of our national conversation to date about the Internet, especially that to be found in the mainstream media-political culture, is not keeping up with the pace of change.
At this moment, only somewhere between a third and a half of America is online, and much of that on slow phone connections. Nonetheless, we already send three times as much e-mail as we do regular mail. Internet traffic is doubling every 95 days. Americans alone are adding two million pages to the Web daily. What will happen in the not-that-distant future when broadband -- that is to say, fast -- connections are ubiquitous rather than a luxury for a tiny minority? What happens once the Internet is always on, seamlessly built into our lives at home and at work, and all other media, from high-quality video to new forms yet to be seen, are instantly accessible through it? We're only at the beginning of this transformation -- the top half of the first inning, as one of the many metaphors applied to the Internet would have it.
Depending on whom you listen to, what is still to come, even as the gold rush continues, is analogous to the advent of movable type, the Industrial Revolution, the arrival of electricity or the phone, the building of the transcontinental railroad, the creation of metal currency or the invention of the Arabic zero. But Zoe Baird, who now runs the Markle Foundation, which is committed to provoking tough policy questions about the Internet's future, observes that even these historical metaphors may fail to do justice to the digital universe that awaits us. Technological leaps of the past may not have had so "pervasive an influence in all spheres of public and private life," she says. The Internet's capacity to have a "global impact in transforming culture and politics and social interaction can create a world we've never seen before in its thrilling potential, or create tremendous instability."
Even at this early point, the flashier changes making headlines just in the past few weeks are random and dizzying, whether trivial or profound. Encyclopedia Britannica was forced by the e-market environment to give away its costly content free on the Web. Ford and General Motors, which epitomize old-tech industry, are moving their huge purchasing operations to the Internet. The University of Texas library reports that while book circulation is down, that of e-books is up, and publishers and retail book chains alike are scrambling to digitize every book possible, so that any title will be instantly available in any form the customer chooses (paper included). Prestigious business schools and Wall Street financial institutions now report a growing brain drain, as young talent splits to join tech start-ups. In Boston, Hale & Dorr, the echt-Yankee law firm, officially ended its jacket-and-tie dress code last month, lest its techie clientele in T-shirts feel out of place. (How much longer will TV news shows, already abandoned by the digital generations, be anchored by guys dressed like 80's investment bankers?) The annual sales of digital video games now match Hollywood's annual box office and have sent companies like Hasbro, still marketing the passe, pre-digital sci-fi of "Star Wars" toys, into free fall.
When E-Bay added some six million new users over the past year and Amazon.com some eight million, that was not just a shopping phenomenon. "These are huge communities," says Eric Schmidt, C.E.O. of Novell, a leader in corporate network software. Unlimited by physical borders, they are not only expanding faster than any communities in history but their citizens "cross cultural, language and income barriers which we've never seen crossed before." Indeed, Steven Johnson, a writer ("Interface Culture") who looks at the Internet in urban-planning metaphors, says that "it's no longer possible to talk about one Web." For every wide-open community like E-Bay, there's a members-only gated community, not to mention the loud parasite communities that spring up opportunistically. Each has its own dynamic and tribal rituals.
Mr. Schmidt, Ms. Baird and Eric Benhamou, the C.E.O. of 3Com (of Palm Pilot fame), were among the participants this week in a panel on the "digital divide" held by the New America Foundation. Both in their forum and in conversations I had with them later, they spoke urgently of issues overlooked amidst our dot-com and Y2K mania. Ms. Baird points out that poorer communities left unwired, whether urban or rural, are as likely to wither as the towns that were bypassed by our interstate highway system. Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Benhamou are alarmed by the failure of black and Hispanic Americans to enter their work force, and by the failure of our schools to deliver the right training. (Hooking up classrooms to computers, though proceeding apace, is barely a first step.) The chasm separating the haves and have-nots of the Net, like all other digital issues, is global; a minuscule number of Africans are on line.
The other digital divide -- generational -- has its own fallout. A perusal of the major presidential candidates' Web sites suggests that only Al Gore is trying to move beyond boilerplate in addressing Net issues. It's not clear if his rivals are much more technologically literate than Bill Clinton, who last month held a bogus first presidential Internet chat in which he never touched the laptop in front of him. So far the campaign's digital policy conflicts have mainly consisted of either pandering or hedging on the issue of an Internet sales tax, and of Orrin Hatch's silly critique of George W. Bush's Web site for not being "user friendly." All the candidates have user-friendly Web sites -- for raising money, not for raising the level of digital debate.
To see how the generation gap wreaks havoc in the private sector, look at any major media corporation, such as Time Warner, that has thrown away millions on an ill-conceived Web portal; chances are you'll find hands-on Internet ignorance among the analog suits at the top (much as the movie moguls of an earlier generation failed to "get" television). As James Fallows writes in The Industry Standard of the newsman Sam Donaldson's clueless daily Webcasts, "This is how it must have been for Ramon Novarro or Theda Bara, great silent-era stars trying to figure out what had changed when the talkies arrived."
"If you want to understand the Internet," says Eric Schmidt, "rent, buy or borrow a teenager. Their view of technology is radically different from the rest of the culture." And there's no time to waste. Once the infrastructure of the virtual world is more or less built, once it is the principal place where we live and work, it will be much harder to address and adjudicate such issues as equity, privacy, intellectual property rights and education than it is when its architecture is still in flux.
Eric Benhamou of 3Com believes that when the obsession with Y2K is history -- Jan. 2 is a mere 15 days from now, whatever happens -- we'll at last start to focus on the extraordinary questions that are rushing at us. As no less a futurist than Stan Lee, the wizard of Marvel comics, declares in Wired, "If you're interested in technology and the progress of humankind, this is the most exciting period ever." He's right, but most of us know even less about the huge social choices raised by software code than those inherent in biological science's parallel breakthroughs in manipulating genetic code. Even a year or two after Y2K, a 1999 fixation like "Will my e-gifts arrive in time?" may seem as quaint and distant as the horse and buggy of a century ago.

Internet Craze Transforms Brazil's Stocks

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Banco Bradesco S.A. is among the biggest and most solemn of Brazil's banks, with the motto "Only work can produce wealth" chiseled into the entrance of its headquarters in a nondescript suburb of this city.
Bradesco is also one of the hottest stocks at the center of Brazil's Internet stock frenzy.
Because of Bradesco's efforts to strengthen its online banking operations, the bank is one of a handful of companies listed on the Sao Paulo stock exchange that investors have chosen as a way to bet on the growth of the Internet in Latin America's largest economy. 
 Recent gains in these stocks have helped push the benchmark Bovespa index up more than 100 percent this year, ranking Sao Paulo among the world's best-performing markets. In dollar terms, the Bovespa has gained more than 40 percent.
While American investors have grown accustomed to the Internet phenomenon on the record-breaking Nasdaq, it is a relatively new trend in Brazil, where the stock market has been dominated by telephone companies and electric utilities. The rush to make Internet investments here is also made a bit stranger by the fact that almost none of the companies singled out as investments are Internet companies.
"It's the Charles Schwab effect," said Roque Sut Ribeiro, a fund manager at Sintese, a Sao Paulo brokerage firm. "When people saw that Charles Schwab's move into online trading made it worth more than Merrill Lynch, it was clear that a stock with a coherent Internet strategy could be in the same league as an Internet company itself."
In Brazil, this redrawing of the way in which companies in more traditional businesses are viewed means that previously unknown companies have become big hits among investors.
Pao de Acucar, for instance, a supermarket chain, has climbed 183 percent this year after investors became enamored of the company's efforts to sell groceries over the Internet. Livraria Saraiva, a bookseller, is up 114 percent on optimism over plans to mimic Amazon.com's model of selling books online.
Yet it is perhaps Bradesco that best typifies this trend. Bradesco inaugurated Brazil's first commercial Web site in early 1995. Since then the bank, the largest financial institution in Brazil that is not controlled by the central government, has sought to draw clients to its site by offering services to pay bills online, for instance, or trade securities.
Last week, Bradesco made its biggest splash by announcing that it would offer free Internet access to account holders, who now number 8.4 million. Although the announcement rattled Brazilian Internet service providers, which are already engaged in a price war to attract customers, investors greeted the strategy by pushing up Bradesco's shares 13 percent in two days. So far this year, Bradesco has climbed 111 percent.
"We're doing stuff that even American banks haven't thought of," said Odecio Gregio, chief of technology at the bank. Mr. Gregio, a white-haired banker with a penchant for dark suits, cited a Bradesco service allowing people to communicate with the bank over the Internet by using the latest generation of voice-recognition software.
Though investors are impressed with the Internet efforts of companies like Bradesco, they acknowledge that such online forays have yet to translate into significant revenue or profit increases. Francisco Chevez, for example, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who covers Pao de Acucar, said the supermarket chain's Internet sales had yet to account for 1 percent of total revenue.
Nonetheless, "It is the hybrid feature of a company like Pao de Acucar which combines online sales with the bricks and mortar needed as infrastructure that makes it an interesting Internet play," Mr. Chevez said. "The Internet in Latin America is still largely about potential."
Projections of Internet growth in Brazil have helped the performance of shares in Globo Cabo S.A., perhaps the only stock on the Sao Paulo exchange that can actually be classified as an Internet company. After the Microsoft Corporation acquired a minority stake in Globo Cabo earlier this year, the company announced plans to offer Internet access over its network of underground cable lines.
And though other companies have similar plans, including Universo Online, Brazil's largest Internet service provider, none are publicly traded on local stock exchanges. So, attention has been focused on Globo Cabo, even though investors were concerned just earlier this year over the stalled growth of its client base after the devaluation of the Brazilian real. In 1999, Globo Cabo is up 473 percent.
Not everyone is certain that the Internet craze will continue to translate into impressive gains on the Sao Paulo market.
"Brazil is nowhere near having a dynamic middle class that could be targeted over the Internet because income is still concentrated in the hands of an elite in most parts of the country," said Pedro Guimaraes, an analyst at Banco Bozano, Simonsen, in Rio de Janeiro. "When the initial optimism over the Internet dies down, the valuations of these companies could go down."

HEADLINE: New Housing Construction Dipped 2.3% in November

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments dipped 2.3 percent in November, to the lowest level since April, as rising mortgage rates cut into demand. Housing activity still remained brisk, but economists see slower growth ahead.
Builders started new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.60 million units in November after being flat the month before, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Though November's performance was weaker than many analysts had expected, housing starts are expected to total 1.66 million units in 1999, the best year since 1986, said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
Still, economists said there was no doubt that rising mortgage rates were dampening demand and were the culprit for November's drop in housing starts.
"Builders are seeing some slowing in demand because of the increase in mortgage rates that we've seen," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Bank of America Private Bank. "It appears the peak of the housing cycle has been reached, and we'll see moderation going forward."
Exceptionally low mortgage rates fueled a record housing boom last year. But interest rates have been rising this year. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.74 percent in November, compared with 6.99 percent in January, when starts hit a 12-year high. This week, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose to 7.86 percent.
Despite unusually warm weather, new construction on single-family homes fell 3.6 percent in November, to an annual rate of 1.29 million units. That followed a 3.5 percent increase the month before.
Starts on condominiums and apartment buildings, however, rose 3.7 percent last month, to an annual rate of 308,000 units. In October, such starts fell by 13.2 percent.
Although experts said the drop in overall housing starts was a result of rising mortgage rates, builders continue to report shortages of skilled workers and available lots for development, factors that can delay or disrupt construction schedules.
By region, the South was affected the most,, with housing starts falling by 9.9 percent last month, to an annual rate of 680,000 units. Housing starts dropped by 6.8 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 356,000 units.
Starts were up 14.9 percent in the West, to a rate of 417,000 units, and rose 7.3 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 147,000 units.
New building permits, considered a gauge of future construction, rose 1.3 percent in November. "That suggests that demand hasn't weakened substantially," said John Faulhaber, a vice president with Harris Bank.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs Law to Help Workers With Disabilities

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
With advocates for the disabled gathered around him at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, President Clinton signed landmark legislation today that could allow millions of people with disabilities to enter the work force by lifting restrictions on their health care coverage.
Advocates consider the legislation the most significant step for the disabled since the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The law expands Medicaid and Medicare so that people with disabilities will continue to receive health insurance coverage once they go to work. 
 Mr. Clinton signed the legislation, called the Work Incentives Improvement Act, at the base of the larger-than-life bronze of Roosevelt, whom the president has called the greatest chief executive of the century for his attention to social programs and a safer world. Roosevelt had polio and, unknown to most Americans at the time, used a wheelchair for much of his life.
"In his time, Roosevelt felt he needed to keep his wheelchair from public view," Mr. Clinton said. "Most people believed being disabled meant being unable. He proved them wrong every day."
Under the previous law, disabled people often lost Medicaid and Medicare coverage because their income rose when they went to work. Even with private insurance from their employers, they often could not afford the costly health care or medical equipment they required.
The legislation, which won broad bipartisan support in Congress, changes rules that discourage many disabled people from working. Under the current system, fewer than 1 percent of the eight million disabled people of working age who receive benefits from Social Security and Supplemental Security Income work.
Mr. Clinton said the primary argument for the legislation was a human one: to prevent people from having to choose between work and health care. But he said the legislation also made economic sense. "One way we can keep this economic expansion going is to take it to people and places who aren't part of it," he said.
James Sullivan, 38, of Hudson, N.H., introduced Mr. Clinton, recounting how he had joined the ranks of the disabled two days before his 18th birthday, when he broke his neck in a diving accident.
"This system, which basically makes people stay at home and punishes them when they work, is a crazy one," said Mr. Sullivan, who is eager to get a job in the telecommunications industry. "There is an untapped population of Americans with disabilities who are dying to get back to work."
The legislation, with provisions that will be phased in, provides $150 million for grants to encourage states to allow disabled workers to buy into Medicaid, paying premiums in amounts that would largely be left up to the states. It sets aside $250 million to help obtain Medicaid coverage for people who are not yet so disabled that they cannot work -- those with progressive diseases, for example.
Leye Jeannette Chrzanowski, who runs the Disability News Service in Chantilly, Va., and has a neurological disorder, considered the legislation groundbreaking. But she could have done without all the symbolic references to Roosevelt.
"Lots of people with spinal cord injuries are very sensitive to temperature," Ms. Chrzanowski said, bracing herself from the cold. "It's aesthetically pleasing to have F.D.R. behind us, but with the temperature like this we all ought to be inside."

Tax Break Renewed
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17
AP
President Clinton signed a tax bill today that renews a business tax break and may protect a million people from an alternative tax.
In the next decade, the legislation would use about $18 billion of the budget surplus.
The main provision, which extends the expired research and development credit, is a priority for the high-technology industry, as well as manufacturers, medical research firms and pharmaceutical companies. The credit in general equals about 20 percent of research expenses and, for the first time, includes companies in Puerto Rico.
A second provision allows middle-class Americans to safely claim the $500 child tax credit, the dependent-care tax credit and other personal credits without falling subject to a tax intended to make sure the rich do not escape paying taxes.

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Fault Russia On Chechnya; Call for Truce

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BERLIN, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The world's biggest industrial countries, meeting with Russia in the Group of 8, today issued another condemnation of Moscow's actions in Chechnya and called for an immediate cease-fire there.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned that Russia was becoming increasingly isolated in the international community, threatening its larger relationships. 
 But Dr. Albright also stressed the importance of relations with Russia for the United States, and none of the foreign ministers even suggested suspending Russia from the group, to which it had originally been invited by President Clinton.
Nor was there any serious discussion about imposing economic or other sanctions on Moscow, which gave no indication of changing its policy or fierce tactics toward the Chechens two days before parliamentary elections in Russia on Sunday.
As Russian forces continued to bomb Grozny, the Chechen capital, and to prevent civilians trapped there from seeking safety, the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, responded soothingly to the Western criticism, saying, "On some issues our opinions coincide, on others they diverge, but what's important is that this issue should not lead to us growing apart."
Mr. Ivanov insisted that "I never felt isolated from my colleagues in the Group of 8," causing Dr. Albright to respond that Mr. Ivanov himself was treated with respect, but that Russia's behavior in Chechnya "creates problems in the ways it deals with its partners."
"What I think has been evident at this meeting, frankly, is that the Russians, through their actions, are self-isolating from the rest of the international community," she said.
European and American officials said the host Germans, including Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, were particularly concerned that the meeting not concentrate on criticism of Russia, so there would be no important breach with Moscow, but focus instead on preventive diplomacy to stop future wars, a key issue for Mr. Fischer's Green Party.
The officials said that the French were particularly outspoken in the meetings about the need to take action to show Moscow that its partners were serious about their criticism, and that the British, too, were taking a harder line.
But even the harder-line European idea of "no sanctions but no aid" to Moscow creates problems for Washington, senior American officials said, since cutting or even suspending aid would be a sanction.
Officials acknowledged that the timing of this meeting, so close to the Russian elections, was awkward, and left Moscow little room to compromise. The battle against the Chechens has been very popular among ordinary Russians, and some Western governments fear that strong Western action now would only backfire and help anti-Western politicians, like the Communists of Gennadi A. Zyuganov. Moscow in the meantime seems to be trying to conquer Grozny by Sunday, an American official said.
Moscow responded to similar criticism by NATO foreign ministers in Brussels earlier this week by complaining of interference in internal affairs and citing NATO's bombing of Serbia over Kosovo this year. "Another splash of crocodile tears in Brussels about 'human rights' simply amazes us by its cynicism," Mr. Ivanov's Foreign Ministry said.
Here, Mr. Ivanov kept his cool. "We are not talking of criticism of one party by another," he said. "The situation is complicated, and there are no simple solutions."
But Mr. Ivanov did not want to appear at a joint news conference with the other foreign ministers, to avoid sitting through public criticism. Instead, each minister had separate news conferences or briefings, while Mr. Fischer read a "chairman's statement" -- since member Russia would not agree to a joint statement -- calling for an immediate cease-fire and political negotiations with Chechen leaders to end the war, as Moscow has already promised but done little to bring about.
"The fight against terrorists cannot be won by indiscriminate war against cities and the whole population," said the statement, approved by the seven other members. "The war poses a serious threat to partnership and cooperation between Russia and all of us."
But having allowed the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Knut Vollebaek, to visit the region, Moscow is now expected to allow a few monitors from the security organization to watch the borders with Chechnya and Georgia -- "a sop," a senior European official acknowledged, "to their need and our need to show that something happened here."
Dr. Albright also met here with leaders of the democratic opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, on a day when a key Serbian opposition coalition finally halted its dwindling and now farcical daily rallies against Mr. Milosevic.

Ernst & Young Agrees To Settle Cendant Suit
Ernst & Young has agreed to pay $335 million to settle charges that it failed in its responsibilities when it certified financial statements that inflated the profits of Cendant, which operates Ramada Inn hotels and Avis car rental agencies.
The settlement was the largest ever by an accounting firm accused of improper practices by shareholders, although Ernst & Young paid more than $400 million in 1992 in penalties and fines to settle claims of Federal agencies growing out of the savings and loan crisis. Ernst & Young said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong, but accounting experts said it was a sad day for the accounting profession and that perhaps new procedures were needed. Page A1. 

Nine Ex-E.D.S. Workers Charged
Nine former employees of Electronic Data Systems were charged with conspiring to defraud the States of New York, Delaware and Massachusetts of $37.9 million in cash and other assets that had been abandoned by customers of brokerage houses. United States Attorney Mary Jo White said in the complaint that from 1995 until early this year, the nine employees had submitted fraudulent claims on behalf of brokerage houses that had hired E.D.S. to recover money that had been turned over to states as abandoned property. C14.
 
G.E. Set to Split Stock 3-for-1
General Electric approved a 3-for-1 stock split; increased its quarterly dividend 17 percent, to 41 cents a share, and expanded its stock repurchase program by $5 billion. The stock split will be General Electric's third in the last six years and its ninth ever. Shares of G.E. rose $4.375 on the news, to $152. C3.
 
Internet Frenzy Spreads to Brazil
Frenzy over Internet stocks has spread to Brazil, where these stocks have pushed the benchmark Bovespa index up more than 100 percent this year, ranking Sao Paulo among the world's best-performing markets. In dollar terms, the Bovespa has gained more than 40 percent. C2.
 
Plants Ordered to Cut Emissions
The Environmental Protection Agency ordered 392 plants in a dozen states, mostly electric generating stations, to cut in half emissions of chemicals that drift with prevailing winds and add to smog along the Eastern Seaboard. The regulators acted at the request of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which said they needed help to meet national smog standards. A1.
 
Home Building Fell Last Month
Construction of new homes and apartments declined 2.3 percent in November, to the lowest level since April, as rising mortgage rates cut into demand. Builders started new homes and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.60 million units in November after being flat in October. Even so, housing starts are expected to total 1.66 million units in 1999, the best year since 1986. C14.
 
Star Cruise Bids for Norwegian Line
Star Cruises of Singapore bid $1.1 billion to take over NCL Holding of Norway, the parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line, after Carnival bowed out of a battle for control. The bid, 35 Norwegian kroner a share, compared with Carnival's 30 kroner a share last month, a bid that NCL had rejected as too low. C2.
 
United Biscuits Favors French Bid
The board of the British cookie company United Biscuits recommended that shareholders accept a $2.03 billion bid from a French-led investment group that includes Banque Nationale de Paris instead of a lower offer from Nabisco Holdings and the buyout firm of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. C2.

HEADLINE: Mexico City Spawns Distant Suburbs

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Cuernavaca, a city of gardens and golfers south of Mexico City, is still dark at 5:30 a.m. when Mario Betancourt, an executive with Pemex, the government oil company, crawls from bed, shaves in a rush and noses his car into a line of other commuters heading toward jobs in the capital.
In Cuautla, another city south of the capital, Roberto Aguilar boards a bus for his own two-hour trip to his Mexico City job varnishing antique furniture. 
 And at the same hour far to the north, in the city of Pachuca on the other side of the vast capital, Javier Chavez, a computer specialist, is beginning his daily drive to work at a Mexico City cellular phone company.
A new class of commuters has emerged in Mexico. A half-century after Americans began to abandon cities for suburbs, thousands of Mexicans are for the first time making a similar choice, fleeing the pollution and clamor of Mexico City in search of quiet houses, well-clipped lawns and safer streets in cities and towns hours away.
The commuters are bringing broad changes to the face of the countryside for 100 miles on all sides of the capital. Land prices throughout the suburban region are rising fast, and the few patches of farm or forest land that remain near major highways are quickly being bulldozed for strip malls and housing developments.
At the same time, the commuters appear to be fueling economic growth in dozens of towns and cities. Schools, hospitals and other services in some suburban towns are being improved to meet middle-class standards.
The daily commute here offers more daunting challenges than those faced by most straphangers and car-poolers in the United States and Europe.
Traffic jams are horrendous. And the cost of parking, gasoline and roadway tolls, which are among the highest in the world, can drive the price of the daily commute by car from many suburban towns above $20 a day. As a result, even many doctors, lawyers and other professionals prefer to travel by bus.
"This is a very Mexican-style suburbanization process," said Reina Corona Cuapio, an urbanologist at the National Autonomous University who conducted a survey that aims to provide the first preliminary profile of Mexico's burgeoning commuter class. "It's taking place with almost no governmental planning, and the costs for commuters in time, money and inconvenience are high."
North of the border, commuters have been polled, profiled and analyzed ever since the United States Census Bureau first included questions about "place of work and journey to work" in the 1950 census. The 1990 census showed that 24 percent of all Americans were commuting to jobs in a county other than the one they lived in.
In contrast, Mexican commuters have never been systematically counted, mainly because they have emerged in large numbers only recently. Ms. Corona's survey counted commuters traveling from Cuautla, 65 miles southeast of Mexico City, and she hopes to count commuters in the entire metropolitan area in broader studies later.
Based on calculations including revenues from highway tolls, she estimated that as many as 500,000 people may be traveling each day between the capital and six surrounding states. Probably a third of them are workers commuting to jobs, she said.
Even cities as far away as San Juan del Rio, 102 miles north of the capital, are being suburbanized, demonstrating Mexican workers' tremendous patience for grueling daily travel. Mr. Aguilar, the furniture restorer, who is 67, spent one recent month journeying by bus, subway and taxi to a job in a city far north of Mexico City, 180 miles from his home in Cuautla.
"I'd leave home at 5 a.m. and get back at 11 p.m." Mr. Aguilar said. "But I didn't want to turn down the job."
For most of this century Mexico City has been a powerful magnet, attracting millions of peasants to its industries and urbanity in one of the world's most extraordinary farm-to-factory migrations. The population of the Federal District, Mexico City's formal name, quintupled between 1940 and 1980, to 8.8 million from 1.6 million.
But early in this decade, experts studying Mexico's 1990 census detected a startling reversal. For the first time, the city's population declined in the 1980's, by about 600,000.
The figures showed a corresponding growth in many mid-size Mexican cities, leading some demographers to conclude that the tremendous forces of centralization that governed Mexico for more than a century had come to an end.
"Recently the process by which population has been concentrating in Mexico City has been turned around," concluded a 1995 essay in the population journal Demos. Because of crime, pollution and the high cost of living, "the city is now expelling rather than receiving migrants," the study said.
But further study showed that many smaller cities like Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Pachuca and Toluca that were showing rapid growth were simply being transformed into suburbs of Mexico City.
Eventually, the metropolitan boundaries of all settlements around the capital, from Cuautla in the south to Queretaro, 142 miles north of Mexico City, are expected to merge, creating one giant urban area.
"Towards the middle of the 21st century, this megalopolis will concentrate approximately 50 million people," Gustavo Garza, a demographer at the Colegio de Mexico, wrote in a recent essay. That will require Mexican commuters to be even more long-suffering.
"Sometimes the wasted time and the long distances drive me to desperation," said Mr. Betancourt, who moved his family to Cuernavaca because his wife came down with a respiratory disease in Mexico City's polluted air. "But you've just got to be patient."

HEADLINE: A Century Ends in Panama

 BODY:
It may be emblematic of our headlong, high-tech rush into the next millennium that a chance to reflect on one of the signal achievements of the American Century -- and one of its less noble subplots -- passed this week with hardly a ripple. The United States handed over the Panama Canal to Panama in a ceremony so bereft of American interest that neither President Clinton nor a single top official in his administration bothered to attend. It was a shabby way to treat a monumental human achievement created at the dawn of this century. Further, it slighted a profound and welcome evolution of American power as the century comes to a close.
The creation of a water passage across Panama linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was a phenomenal undertaking, the moon shot of its time. It relied on an ingenious "lake-and-lock" scheme whereby ships as long as the Empire State Building is tall were hoisted 80 feet into vast freshwater lakes created by dams and fed by torrential rains, connected by a cut through the Isthmus of Panama. But it was achieved at great human cost. Between 1904 and 1915 more than 5,600 lives, mostly Barbadian, were lost to disease and accidents. 
 The canal represented a coming of age for the United States as an assertive global power, better and worse. Theodore Roosevelt famously personified America's turn-of-the-century can-do ideal when, as the first United States president to travel overseas, he posed at the controls of a 95-ton Bucyrus shovel. But that zeal was inherently coercive, and over the decades it took on a neo-colonial dimension. Not a few United States armed interventions in Central America were aimed largely at protecting the canal from hostile powers.
"There is no Panama Canal! There is an American Canal at Panama," ran the slogan of opponents of the 1977 treaties signed by Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos that authorized a phased handover of the canal to Panama by 2000. Mr. Carter, who led the United States delegation at this week's handover, wisely persevered with a deal that signaled a more equal partnership between the United States and the nations of Latin America and removed the onus of maintaining a colonial enclave in a country whose people opposed it. Reflecting a belated respect for a small nation's sovereignty and pride, the world's only remaining superpower has voluntarily given up an immensely valuable asset.
One reason Americans can shrug off the deal is that the canal is no longer strategically or economically essential to American interests. Supertankers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines cannot pass through the canal, and software does not need to. Few doubt that Panamanians possess the wherewithal to make a seamless transition, but there remain legitimate fears of corruption and patronage in a country with little history of transparent government. Conservative critics of the deal have questioned Panama's decision to award port concessions to a Hong Kong company they say has ties to the Chinese military. But the treaties explicitly permit United States intervention if the canal's security is threatened.
President Clinton's lamentable reluctance to risk conservative ire by attending this week's transfer merely underscored the courage shown two decades ago by Mr. Carter and his Senate allies, who at great political cost forged an agreement that recognized how America's long-term interests in that important region were best served by partnership rather than domination.

HEADLINE: France Fretting That U.S. Could Become a Bully

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, on a visit to Tokyo, said today that the United States should be "discreet" in exercising its global power.
Mr. Jospin, a Socialist, also made veiled criticisms of the United States in a speech in Tokyo on Thursday that were more pointed than remarks made by President Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist conservative, in an interview this week. 
 Both leaders chided Congress for sharply cutting the $370 million the Clinton administration had asked for to ease the debts of 41 poor countries, mostly in Africa, as President Clinton and other leaders agreed at a summit meeting in Germany this summer.
"The resistance of the American Congress on this point is worrisome," Mr. Jospin told his audience in Japan.
Mr. Chirac said: "Congress has recently made the participation of the World Bank more difficult. It's hard to tell why. It's not a very large amount of money, and we can settle it without the World Bank, or more precisely the World Bank will find the funds elsewhere. So why did Congress do this?"
Mr. Jospin also seemed to blame American negotiators for the collapse of the opening of a new round of world trade talks in Seattle early this month.
"Certain countries that chose to give priority to their domestic policy goals came with an intransigent attitude and refused to enter into real negotiations," he said. "That should reinforce our determination to counter any temptation to return to unilateralism."
In French political discourse, "unilateralism" is a uniquely American sin.
Mr. Jospin said France, which will hold the rotating presidency of the European Union in the second half of next year, wanted to hold a high-level meeting of member countries in the World Trade Organization to draw lessons from Seattle and make it "more effective, more open and more democratic."
He also took a dig at the United States for failing to pay all its dues to the United Nations.
"All member states should fulfill their financial obligations," he said. "France and Japan do that completely and unconditionally. A responsible attitude by all contributor nations would encourage the necessary reforms of the organization, including the Security Council."

HEADLINE: In Poll, New York Catholics Call Poverty a Top Concern

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO with MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
As Cardinal John O'Connor prepares to step down as archbishop, Roman Catholics in his New York archdiocese are hoping for a successor who will be more spiritual than political, a compassionate leader who will tackle poverty and homelessness as priorities of the church, a survey by The New York Times has found.
A strong majority of Catholics polled in the New York region said things were going well or excellently for the church in America. As Catholics do nationally, though, they favor modernizing and opening up the church, by allowing priests to marry, ordaining women as priests and granting lay people a greater say in naming bishops. 
 In the midst of an economic boom, Catholics in the financial capital of the world's richest country told pollsters in several ways that they consider poverty and homelessness the most serious problems the church should address.
The survey offered a snapshot of feelings among the New York archdiocese's 2.4 million Catholics at a pivotal moment in the life of their church. Church officials expect Cardinal O'Connor, the leader of the church in New York for the last 15 years, to step down soon.
Though the cardinal, following tradition, offered Pope John Paul II his resignation upon turning 75, the pope did not accept it. But next month, the cardinal will turn 80, automatically losing his vote in the papal conclave. He has also been battling ill health recently, after surgery last summer to remove a brain tumor. For the last two Sundays, he has not said Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral and has not appeared in public.
In addition to questions about the next archbishop, the poll asked Catholics about the cardinal, whose voice has been a prominent one on some of most debated issues of the day. But among New York Catholics, he seemed to carry a low profile.
While 57 percent had a favorable view of him, and just 6 percent had an outright unfavorable opinion, only a small percentage could name the best, or worst, things he has done as archbishop. Spiritually, they say they are more influenced by Pope John Paul II and by their local priests than they are by the cardinal. Forty-two percent said his stands on social and political issues had no influence on them at all.
The findings, religious experts said, appear to reflect the ambiguity inherent in the position of archbishop itself, which even Cardinal O'Connor's political visibility has been unable to overcome. A spokesman for the archdiocese questioned the usefulness of the poll and declined to comment on the results.
The findings also demonstrate the increasing independence of Catholics, a trend that most experts on the church say began with the changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960's and has deepened throughout Pope John Paul II's return to a stricter, more hierarchical tradition.
Though the cardinal leads the archdiocese -- through his public stands, management of finances and assignment of priests -- his influence is not always direct or obvious. To most churchgoers, archbishops are more distant figures than their parish priests, and yet not as exalted as the pope. Thirty-two percent of New York Catholics said their priests had "a lot" of effect on their spiritual lives, while 39 percent said the same of the pope. Only 16 percent said the same of Cardinal O'Connor.
"I don't really listen to what the archbishop says," said Abraham Blanco, 74, a retired butcher in the Bronx who was reinterviewed after responding to the poll. Mr. Blanco said he paid more mind to the pope, whom he admires for his extensive tours of the developing world.
Peter Awn, a professor of comparative religion at Columbia University, said the cardinal's role is more "as a father figure and the unifying symbol of the church in New York."
The poll showed that Catholics were evenly divided over whether the choice of the next archbishop would make a difference in the life of the church. Asked for the most important qualities that the next archbishop should have, Catholics most frequently said that the next archbishop should be compassionate and humane, and should help the poor and homeless, show strong leadership and not be overtly political. In addition, 8 percent of those polled said they hoped for somebody similar to Cardinal O'Connor.
Among the 37 percent of Catholics who offered an opinion on Cardinal O'Connor's best qualities as archbishop, the largest percentages, 25 percent, cited his work helping the poor and unifying the church.
Asked about the most important problems facing the church, 59 percent had definite opinions. The most common response was poverty, followed by the shortage of priests, abortion, declining membership, and failure to keep up with the times and connect with people.
More than half of New York's Catholics thought lay people should have a say in selecting the next archbishop. The selection is thoroughly secret and draws in only select churchgoers sworn to silence; then discussions among bishops result in nominations being passed to Rome under papal secrecy. The final decision rests with the pope.
"I think we should have input, but the final decision should be with the pope," said Jasmine Thompson, a Manhattan job recruiter who was polled. She said she hoped the next archbishop would prove "open as you can be." She added, "I understand that you still have to support and defend the position of the Catholic Church, but I think that in some cases there is room for flexibility and compassion."
But another participant, Aloysius Manz, 71, of Montgomery, a retired manager at I.B.M., disagreed. "What you'd get is a popularity contest," he said. "A lot of the decisions a cardinal has to make are going to be unpopular with people, Catholics and others, but when it's right, it's right."
The Rev. Joseph W. Koterski, a philosophy professor at Fordham University, said the support for giving lay people more of a say in selecting bishops reflected the American enthusiasm for democracy.
In applying statistical methods to understand faith -- which can be amorphous and changeable -- the Times survey revealed an intriguing mix of contradictions among believers and nonbelievers.
Nearly 40 percent of those who called themselves practicing Catholics, for example, said they consider the church as an institution to be out of touch with the needs of Catholics today. But they gauged specific people, like their local priests, deacons, the cardinal and the pope, as more aware of their problems.
Just the same, a majority of practicing Catholics said they seldom or never consult their priests about personal problems.
Nearly one in four people who identified themselves as former Catholics said nevertheless that the pope had some or a lot of influence on their spiritual lives.
Of all Catholics polled, only 2 percent consider the sacraments the most important aspect of being a Catholic. Far more important, they said, were faith, the church teachings and belief in Jesus.
The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit, said the survey's findings illustrate that faith is complex, and that the decision to go to church springs from the spiritual quest for meaning, not from feelings about a specific clergyman or even a teaching.
"It's not surprising that people recognize our limitations," said Father Reese, the author of the 1989 book, "Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure of the American Catholic Church." "What's remarkable is that people still come. They're seeing something that's deeper than the human reality."
The poll found practicing Catholics were much more inclined to be opposed to extramarital sex than to homosexuality: 68 percent said a person "who engages in homosexual relations" could still be a good Catholic, while only 42 percent said a person "who is having an affair outside of marriage" could be one.
New York Catholics appeared more accepting of homosexuality than church leaders are, and some found fault with the cardinal for taking a public stand on the issue. Elizabeth Gray, 45, of Monroe, said she generally liked the cardinal but disagreed with his condemnation of gays' marching in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. "It was like him telling the gays they're never going to see God, that they don't have a chance to go to heaven," she said.
New York's Catholics generally consider Cardinal O'Connor and other church leaders to be more conservative than they are themselves. For example, 57 percent favor allowing priests to marry, 48 percent say they favor letting gays be priests if they remain celibate and 61 percent favor ordaining women as priests.
But the survey found that Hispanics, who account for 36 percent of Catholics in the archdiocese, tend to be more conservative than other Catholics. They were less supportive of Cardinal O'Connor, largely because they felt they did not know him. While two-thirds of all Catholics in the archdiocese had a favorable view of the cardinal, less than half of the Hispanic Catholics did.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from Nov. 29 to Dec. 5 with 1,615 adults who live in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The archdiocese comprises Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island and the counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester.
Of these respondents, 567 said their religious preference was Catholic, 198 said they were former Catholics, and 853 said they were non-Catholics. For analysis, the responses of Catholics, former Catholics and non-Catholics were separated.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the 10 counties. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each county was represented in proportion to its number of active phone numbers. For each exchange, the final four numerals were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic area, race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 2 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adults living in the archdiocese.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. It is plus or minus 4 percentage points for Catholics.

HEADLINE: Racing in the Shadow of the City;
New York Area Seen as Ultimate Step in Nascar's Plan

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Nascar has the answer, and it is that stock car racing is coming to the New York region, and the closer to the Manhattan skyline the better.
The 17 million people who live in New York's vast archipelago of city and suburb may still be contemplating the question: Are people here ready for the foot-stomping, rebel-yelling, hard-charging world of stock car racing? Will Manhattan sophisticates, Greenwich stockbrokers, Hoboken artists and the general run of suburban homebodies really want to jam the front-row seats to exult at the sting from bits of tar, tire tread and unburned hydrocarbons as the big cars go shrieking down the straightaway? 
 The country's two biggest promoters of National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing events are certain that enough people in the New York region want to do that to justify building a $200 million speedway somewhere in the region, most likely in New Jersey. To them, the New York market represents a $2 billion racing industry's final step onto the national stage as oval-track racing grows up and away from its Southern roots, where moonshiners first developed a taste for cars that looked showroom-normal, or "stock," but that could be souped up to outrun the revenue agents.
Speeding through the piney woods gave way to racing on the sands of Daytona Beach, Fla., and from there racing moved onto dozens of oval tracks, four fast left-turns to the lap, that quickly spread throughout the South and elsewhere.
Now, as auto racing proves its pull at the gate and among television viewers nationally, the promoters are building 200,000-seat superspeedways near Kansas City and Chicago and, soon, in Denver. But New York, the promoters say, would be the crown.
"We'd love to build a track where we could see the New York City skyline," said Jim Talley, a spokesman for the International Speedway Corporation of Daytona, the country's biggest race operator. "That skyline. That would be the ultimate!"
The I.S.C., as it is known, last March signed no less than Donald J. Trump, the real estate developer, as its partner in a search for a New York regional site for a superspeedway, so called because it would be able to handle the fastest cars.
Meanwhile, Speedway Motor Sports of Charlotte, N.C., a pioneer at packaging motor speedways with hotels, resorts and convention centers, has been looking for a place to race around New York City as well. "We are committed to the region, and we've looked at various sites in and around New York City," said Laurie Wilks, Speedway Motor Sport's general counsel.
In New York City?
"In, out and around New York City," Ms. Wilks said. "I really can't be more specific."
The very scent of high-octane gas and burning rubber in the local air has inspired a group of South Jersey elected officials and business people to lobby speedway promoters for a track near a World War II airfield at Millville, in Cumberland County, below Atlantic City. Donald T. DiFrancesco, president of the State Senate, and Jack Collins, speaker of the Assembly, either one of whom could be New Jersey's next governor when Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's term ends next year, have endorsed putting a track in the sandy soil of the state's economically depressed southern reaches.
O. Bruton Smith, chairman of Speedway Motor Sports, has visited the state five times since 1992, officials with the South Jersey effort said, and has met with Governor Whitman and other officials, but without reaching any deals yet.
Mr. Trump, however, has already rejected the South Jersey site, as well as a location in Suffolk County on Long Island, but local promoters hope he will change his mind. Mr. Trump's group, I.S.C., apparently favors a site closer to the New York skyline. The New Jersey Meadowlands offers such a skyline view, and Governor Whitman is said to favor a site that would help the financially ailing Meadowlands Authority, which now requires a huge annual state subsidy.
But a modern superspeedway along with its attractions and amenities takes about 1,000 acres of land, Mr. Talley said, and the Meadowlands, with Giants Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack and Continental Airlines Arena already on it, has only 759 acres.
"It's not an appropriate use of the Meadowlands," Mr. DiFrancesco told the New Jersey Conference of Mayors in September. The Meadowlands Authority, after confirming earlier in the week that it had been in contact with race promoters, has since gone mum.
"We cannot comment on whether we had a meeting with Nascar," said Dan Emmer, a spokesman. Asked if there was enough room in the Meadowlands for a Nascar-size speedway, Mr. Emmer said, "What kind of room there is in the Meadowlands is not something that we can speculate on at this point."
An official of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Authority, which coordinates economic development for a dozen North Jersey municipalities, said: "A thousand acres? Forget about it."
There may be other problems to overcome before people in the region see their first checkered flag. Speedway developers are accustomed to large public subsidies to help build their tracks. But that level of tax support for sports promoters is a tougher sell in both New York and New Jersey.
In 1987, for example, New Jersey voters rejected a $185 million bond issue to build a baseball stadium in Lyndhurst, even when George M. Steinbrenner III, principal owner of the Yankees, was dangling his team before them.
Speedway supporters like Donald L. Fauerbach, executive director of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors and a Nascar racing team owner himself, say that the state that wins a speedway would have to put in no more than the usual access roads and sewer lines, something done for Atlantic City casinos.
Of course, plenty of people could not care less whether Nascar moves in. "I don't understand the mentality of people who pay good money to watch those cars go around and around," said Eric Mihan, a retired Princeton haberdasher. "But then those people will probably say they don't understand the mentality of people who go and watch someone hit a tennis ball back and forth."
But Mr. Fauerbach said people here would pay $50 to $90 for three hours of racing because Nascar racing had grown up. "Nascar racing is not just a bunch of rednecks anymore," Mr. Fauerbach said. "It's champagne helicopter executives who come in and follow this sport. It's Fortune 500 captains of American industry wining and dining themselves and their employees."
Certainly Nascar racing has changed with the boom in television coverage. The sport known for custom-made muscle cars that are festooned with advertising logos used to be nearly entirely dependent on products you had to be 18 or 21 to buy: snuff, cigarettes and beer.
Now, although the Winston Cup series and the Busch (beer) series are still the premier events in Nascar racing, federal and state tobacco suit settlements have reduced tobacco's role in Nascar.
Drivers who are too young to smoke legally may no longer win prizes in race series named for tobacco products.
The tobacco settlement has sharply curtailed the kinds of advertising tobacco companies may do at Nascar events, forbidding, for example, a display of tobacco logos on the race cars themselves. But even as tobacco restrictions increased, Nascar promoters were looking well beyond the Southern males who were the sport's first and most devoted fans.
According to Nascar, 39 percent of the most dedicated fans are women, and more than a third report incomes of more than $50,000.
Now only National Football League games earn a higher television rating than Nascar's premier races, and race attendance has grown 65 percent since 1990, to 6.3 million people last year.
But will they come? There are Nascar-sanctioned tracks in Flemington, N.J., Pocono, Pa., and at Watkins Glen in upstate New York. Neither are the 1.5-mile, steeply banked ovals used for top events like the Winston Cup, however.
Rick Kuhl is the co-promoter, with his father Paul, at Flemington Speedway, in central New Jersey. It is a short-track course, where racing speeds stay below about 85 miles per hour, compared with speeds approaching 200 miles at superspeedways, and Mr. Kuhl has seen his business fall off as Nascar developed its high speed supertracks.
Mr. Kuhl charges $14 admission, with children and parking free, compared with an average price of $90 per admission to a Winston Cup race. But he thinks the promoters have little to worry about in trying to break into the New York market.
"You're talking millions and millions of people in the New York area, and all they need is 150,000 people to be interested," Mr. Kuhl said. "They'll find them."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
GOODRICH MOVES TO DISMISS 24% OF ITS WORK FORCE

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company, the No. 1 United States maker of airplane landing gear, said yesterday that it would dismiss 500 workers, or 24 percent of the business's work force, close one plant and partly close another to cut costs after its purchase of the aircraft-parts maker Coltec Industries. The 500 workers represent the bulk of the job cuts associated with the Coltec purchase, said Kevin Ramundo, a Goodrich spokesman. Goodrich will close a plant it owns in Seattle and close part of another in Euless, Tex., that was owned by Coltec. Goodrich, based in Charlotte, N.C., expects to save about $35 million annually, beginning in 2002, as it eliminates overlapping costs, Mr. Ramundo said. An additional $25 million in savings will come in 2000 from consolidating corporate headquarters, he said.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Debate Between 2 Democrats

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the joint appearance last night of the two candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription agency. The town hall meeting was held in Nashua, N.H., where members of the audience asked the candidates questions, and its moderator was Ted Koppel of ABC News.
MR. BRADLEY -- I think that the issue really is the health care system is in real distress. There are millions of Americans out there today who have health insurance that are afraid they're not going to be able to see a doctor or to get a hospital. There are millions of middle-class Americans that are really on the brink of losing their health insurance. . . . 
 I think we have to help middle-class Americans also pay for their health coverage, and we have to help cover 44 million Americans who don't have any health insurance. I've offered a plan to do that. It's a plan that will make access to affordable health care available to everyone in this country. It saves billions of dollars in waste and fraud. It provides a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
And I think that the question that I would ask Al is that the difference, the main difference, between our programs is that I do provide access to affordable quality health care for all Americans and his plan does not.
So my question to you is, Who will you leave out? Will you leave out the part-time worker who doesn't have health insurance? Will you leave out the downsized middle-class industrial worker who loses health insurance? Will you leave out the 40 percent of the people who live in poverty, who don't have any health insurance?
MR. GORE -- O.K., I'll answer the question, and the answer is very simple. I won't leave out anyone. I want to reach universal health insurance.
MR. BRADLEY -- But you haven't proposed universal coverage.
MR. GORE -- I don't think that it's lost on anybody that. Now let me back up. I asked the question about Medicare. Let me tell you.
MR. KOPPEL -- Hold it. Hold it. Hold it just one second, gentlemen. . . .
MR. BRADLEY -- You made a mistake, Al, he asked another question.
MR. GORE -- I don't think it's a mistake at all. . . .
MR. KOPPEL -- I'd like to add a little bit to your question. There's a fellow by the name of Trent Lott. You know him well. Senate majority leader, and likely to be the Senate majority leader next time around, too.
The gentleman's question was, How are you going to get any of these programs your program or your program through the Congress?
Neither one of you answered that question.
MR. GORE -- I served eight years in the House of Representatives and eight years in the Senate. I've got close friendships on both sides of the aisle in both chambers. I happen to think there's an excellent chance that we might see a change in the control of the House of Representatives. . . .
But in explaining to the Congress why this can be done quickly and well, we have to fit it in with the economy.
And the reason why I ask the question that Senator Bradley said is because one of our achievements of the last six and a half years has been to have a strong economy. And that means getting the big questions right. . . .
MR. BRADLEY -- I served on the Senate Finance Committee for 18 years. I defended Medicare for 18 years. It was through my efforts that we prevented premiums from going up on a number of occasions. Medicare is the most important public insurance program on health care that we have.
Medicare is now solid until 2017 in this country. The most rapidly changing area of our lives is health care. There is a great probability that people enter Medicare 10, 15 years from now will be healthier because they have been exercising, not smoking. . . .
But no one should doubt my commitment to making sure Medicare is solid. And I would even suggest that, you know, if we have growth higher than what's been projected, that we could use some of the surplus for Medicare. . . .
MR. KOPPEL -- My question is, It's been said that this presidential election is a battle for the American soul. What is your response to that? . . .
MR. GORE -- If you use the word "soul" in a deeper and broader sense, I think that all elections for president in this country are about our nation's soul. Who are we as a people? . . .
We have to have the wisdom and pragmatism to keep our economy prosperous so that we'll have the resources and the confidence of our people to challenge these problems successfully.
If we look out around us and see that we're in an information age where knowledge and learning is more important than ever before, we have to recognize that it says a lot about who we are as a people if we're willing to say to all the young people: We're going to devote the resources necessary to dramatically improve our public schools.
I've put forward a comprehensive plan for revolutionary improvements in our public schools partly because I think we owe that responsibility to our young people in order to respond to the ultimate challenge that is conveyed in that phrase. Who are we as a people, and do we have the courage to keep on moving forward into the future as we did in the past? . . .
MR. BRADLEY -- When someone says the election's a battle for America's soul, I think of our founding fathers, and I think of what Thomas Jefferson wrote about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And I think about where we haven't measured up. . . .
But I don't view that as related to soul. What I view as related to soul are such things as, Can we cross the racial divide in this country and achieve a deeper level of racial harmony? That's the American soul.
Can those people who have resources turn their eyes toward those that don't and realize that it's in all our interests if everybody moves forward together? And, therefore, we do things like increase the number of people in America with health care. We eliminate child poverty in this country. . . .
MR. KOPPEL -- Let me, if I may, follow-up with a question of my own.
There was an ad today in, I believe it was "USA Today," taken by the Siemens Corporation, which had sponsored a contest. And they had taken out an ad in which there were the pictures of approximately 60 youngsters who were science contest winners. Sixty.
Not one was an African-American, not one was Hispanic, I think about 16 of them were Asian-Americans. A couple of them were Indian-Americans, not American Indians, Indian-Americans.
Which says to me that we are failing somehow in terms of educating young African-Americans, young Hispanic Americans in affording them the same opportunities that white kids and other kids have in this country.
What are you going to do about that?
MR. GORE -- Well, that's why I support affirmative action. Because it's still needed. That's why I support the most vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws. That's why I think that we have got to turn around failing schools in the communities that don't have them. . . .
And now, frankly, on the science part of this, I think that it is a national disgrace that we are 18th out of 18 nations surveyed in 12th grade math. And the scores are lowest in the schools that serve communities that are large -- that are disproportionately poor and minority. I have put forward a $115 billion plan to bring about revolutionary improvements in our public schools. . . .
Now, I personally always opposed the vouchers. That's been a big disagreement for 18 years between Senator Bradley and myself. And Senator Bradley has not put forward a plan to turn around failing schools, or to lift up our public schools. I think that if you look at that ad, with those young people involved there -- not represented there, I think that it's one of many signs that we simply have to do a lot more -- not to have incremental improvement, not to settle for small changes, but to bring about truly revolutionary improvements.
Treat teachers like professionals. Reduce the class size. Have higher standards. Have teacher testing for new teachers. Make it easier within due process to get rid of the teachers who are not doing a good job. . . .
MR. BRADLEY -- Well, certainly I support affirmative action. I support strong enforcement of the civil rights laws. I also, though, think the issue turned to education, and Al said that I hadn't offered an education program.
I think that shows the difference between us. If your staff had checked the proposals I've made, they would have found that there's an education component of almost each one of the proposals.
The difference is, I view education as integrated into the lives of people where they're living their lives, not as a program that comes from Washington. I believe in a strong federal commitment to education.
And I believe in education from birth through lifetime and for everyone. And in this campaign I've laid out a program that would begin with early childhood education, that would provide funds through the states to the localities where child care could be decided by the local -- localities as to what's the best way to have child care in that community.
I proposed a doubling of Head Start, 400,000 new slots.
I've proposed that, in a world where we're going to lose over the next decade 2.2 million teachers, that we need to infuse our school systems with 60,000 new teachers a year, many of them aimed specifically at the categories that you said were low performances, in terms of math, science, computer education and foreign language.

BANKS, J. EUGENE

 BODY:

HEADLINE: E.P.A. IS ORDERING 392 PLANTS TO CUT POLLUTION IN HALF

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency today ordered 392 plants in a dozen states, mostly electric generating stations, to cut in half emissions of chemicals that drift with the wind and add to smog along the Eastern seaboard.
The federal regulators acted under the Clean Air Act, at the request of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which said they needed help to meet national smog standards. 
 The plants are in states as far west as Indiana and as far south as North Carolina. Agency officials said they might soon issue similar orders for plants in Illinois. Most of the plants met federal limits on the chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and are in areas that do not exceed smog standards, but now the E.P.A. is tightening the limits.
The states that requested the action are among a group on the East Coast that had already agreed among themselves to impose the stricter standard on nitrogen oxide emissions within their borders. The areas that would for the first time be forced to take action under today's order are in the South and Midwest.
The areas covered by the action today must reduce emissions by 2003 by about half a million tons a year, all in the summer smog season, the federal regulators said. Compliance would cost polluters, which include Ford, General Motors, the Dow Chemical Company and most power providers in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, about $950 million a year, the E.P.A. said.
Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator, said the order would raise the cost of electricity by about 1 percent above what it would otherwise have been, but that because of deregulation of the industry, costs to consumers are still expected to decline.
Officials in several industries said today, though, that they were not sure what compliance would cost. Many executives and state officials from areas covered by the order denounced the act, saying they already met strict standards, that Eastern smog was little affected by Midwestern emissions and that the E.P.A. would ultimately be rebuffed by the courts.
In fact, the action today is in part a response to two recent court losses by the agency.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this year that the agency could not enforce a stricter standard on smog levels, one calculated over an eight-hour period instead of the current one-hour. If that rule had taken effect, more areas would have been out of compliance, and more states would have had to take steps to cut emissions within their borders.
In a separate decision the court blocked the E.P.A. from requiring 22 states in the East, Midwest and South to order a new round of reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from sources within their borders.
So now the E.P.A. is using a different provision of the Clean Air Act that gives states a way to reduce pollution blowing in from other states.
Ms. Browner said today in a conference call with reporters, "Our commitment is to solve the long-distance ozone transport problem."
"We're going to get there, one way or the other," she said. "We are going to get there; we are going to get people clean air."
The order to the states to cut nitrogen oxide emissions -- now blocked in court -- would have gone to 22 states and cut emissions by 1.1 million tons a year; today's order affects 12 of the 22 states and covers 500,000 tons.
The E.P.A. did not rank the plants cited on its list today. David Cohen, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said the four states that filed the petitions provided information based on computer modeling and "we looked at the broad categories to verify the fact that the sources were contributors."
In Michigan, one of the states with plants covered by the order today, Russ Harding, director of the Department of Environmental Quality, said that the appeals court was due to issue a final ruling this winter or spring on the E.P.A.'s effort to have the states order reductions. "I think it's highly inappropriate for the administrator to be doing this," Mr. Harding said. "It may make good headlines, but it's not going to solve clean air issues. She's just creating more lawsuits, wasting more taxpayer dollars."
In fact, owners of some of the plants cited today are already in court against the agency. Earlier this year, the E.P.A. was drafting an order similar to the one Ms. Browner issued today that was based on the need to cut emissions to meet the eight-hour rule. After the eight-hour rule was blocked, the E.P.A. stopped work on the petitions, but the lawsuits are still pending, an industry lawyer said.
At First Energy, the parent company of Ohio Edison, Ralph DiNicola, a spokesman, said, "The E.P.A.'s own studies have indicated that under heavy ozone loading days the Midwest plants contribute to less than 5 percent of the problem in the industrialized Northeast cities."
Mr. DiNicola said that in the East, people could see stone statues eroding, another effect of nitrogen emissions, as they stood next to roads with "12 lanes of stalled traffic."
"It is a little hard to then take a look at plants 500 miles away and claim they are the cause of it," he said.
Ms. Browner was not able to say today how many fewer days of ozone violations the East would record with the new controls in place.
In their petitions, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania cited vast swaths of states near and far, and categories of plants within those areas; Massachusetts, the other state whose petition was approved today, named individual plants, some as far away as Michigan.
Another four jurisdictions -- New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia -- filed petitions later that are still under review and that cover an area partly within the 12 states covered by today's order and partly outside.
Officials in the complaining states hailed the order. "The E.P.A. has come to the realization that we have come to a long time ago, that trans-boundary pollution exists, and that there are specific facilities outside New York's borders that are seriously affecting quality of air here in New York," said William Cahill, the state's commissioner of environmental conservation.
In 30 years of determined work, government regulators have forced extensive changes to cars, fuels, power plants and even hairspray to reduce emissions of chemicals that cause smog. But paired with 30 years of economic growth, they have not succeeded in eliminating violations, and, as Ms. Browner pointed out today, asthma, a respiratory disease made worse by air pollution, is rising rapidly.
At the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit group, David R. Wooley, a lawyer, said that the federal limit for smog was 120 parts ozone per billion parts of air, and that often in the summer, air drifting into densely populated areas of the Northeast was already at 90 parts per billion. Health damage occurs even below 120 parts, Mr. Wooley said, so any reduction would be helpful.
Others were skeptical. In Marshall, Mich., a town of less than 7,000, situated 100 miles west of Detroit, Maurice Evans, the city manager, said he doubted that his town's municipal electric plant could be affecting air in New York.
"We have a small electric utility," Mr. Evans said. "We've got very little pollution that's coming out of that plant."

HEADLINE: Bradley, in Debate With Gore, Goes on the Attack

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Dec. 17

 BODY:
Displaying a calm persistence and aggressiveness, former Senator Bill Bradley tried to poke holes tonight in Vice President Al Gore's health care, education and gun control proposals in their second televised encounter. Mr. Gore, in turn, questioned his rival's commitment to education, health care and managing the economy.
Nearly two months after the first debate, when he declined to engage Mr. Gore, Mr. Bradley tried a strikingly different approach in their 90-minute encounter at Daniel Webster College here, which was televised tonight on the ABC News program "Nightline." 
 Speaking in his usual low voice, Mr. Bradley again and again badgered Mr. Gore with a refrain that his health care plan would extend insurance to all Americans while Mr. Gore's would not: "Who will you leave out?"
"I won't leave out anyone," Mr. Gore replied at one point.
But Mr. Bradley would not stop asking the question.
"No one," the vice president said once again.
"That's not true," Mr. Bradley said.
While Mr. Bradley homed in on health care, Mr. Gore said his opponent lacked a comprehensive education plan and scolded him for supporting a school voucher program while he was in the Senate. This week, Mr. Gore unveiled an plan that would spend $115 billion over 10 years to increase teacher salaries and improve public education.
"Every single time vouchers came up in the Senate, Bill, for 18 years, you voted for them," Mr. Gore said.
Mr. Bradley defended his education proposals, saying: "If your staff had checked the proposals I've made, they would have found that there's an education component of almost each one of the proposals. The difference is, I view education as integrated into the lives of people where they're living their lives, not as a program that comes from Washington."
At one point, Ted Koppel, the moderator, cut in as both men tried to talk over one another on health care. "Hold it. Hold it," he said. "Hold it just one second, gentlemen."
"You made a mistake, Al," Mr. Bradley interjected. "You asked another question."
"I don't think it's a mistake at all," Mr. Gore said.
Despite such clashes, the rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination agreed more than they disagreed. In fact, they agreed so much -- on everything from maintaining an even-handed relationship with China and Taiwan to calling on the entertainment industry to better police itself to advocating gay rights -- that Mr. Koppel noted that their differences did not seem significant. He asked them to contrast their leadership styles.
The political terrain has changed significantly since the first debate. As Mr. Bradley moved up in the polls here in the state that holds the first primary on Feb. 1, Mr. Gore has repeatedly, and aggressively, attacked his programs. Mr. Bradley only began fighting back in recent weeks. But his climb in the polls has stopped, and the two men are in a dead heat in this state, according to several surveys.
Mr. Bradley's assertiveness tonight seemed intended to respond to criticism that his campaign was too passive.
While Mr. Gore was less combative than in the first debate, he was still far more aggressive than Mr. Bradley. More than once, he cut off Mr. Bradley in midsentence.
Strategists for both candidates had predicted far more fireworks tonight because of an open format in which an audience of local residents and Mr. Koppel could ask questions -- and the contenders could quiz each other. The only requirement was that the candidates had to sit on their stools and could not roam around the stage (as Mr. Gore did last time.)
There were barbed comments, however, such as when Mr. Bradley sought to portray his agenda as more sweeping on gun control. "I'm the only candidate in this race who's called for mandatory licensing and registration and of all handguns in this country," he said.
The evening became particularly heated when the questions turned to health care, the major point of contention between the two candidates.
Asked what he would do to get his proposal to expand health care coverage to more Americans through a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Gore instead talked about how his plan could be paid for without raising taxes or jeopardizing other entitlement programs, like Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly.
Mr. Gore has frequently asserted that Mr. Bradley's more expensive health care plan might require raising taxes and would leave none of the federal surplus for other programs, including Medicare. The vice president asked Mr. Bradley what he would do to bolster Medicare as the number of senior citizens rises sharply over the next two decades.
But rather than answer Mr. Gore's question, Mr. Bradley threw a question back. Mr. Bradley asserted that his plan would extend health insurance to almost all Americans, while Mr. Gore's would not.
Then Mr. Gore focused on another part of Mr. Bradley's health care plan that he has frequently criticized: his proposal to replace Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor, with subsidized private insurance.
Mr. Gore touted his role in the Clinton administration's management of the economy, saying that protecting Medicare and Social Security would keep the nation strong.
"One of our achievements of the last six and a half years has been to have a strong economy," Mr. Gore said. "And that has been to get the big questions right," including protecting Medicare. "Bill does not set aside a penny" for bolstering Medicare, he added.
Mr. Bradley responded by saying he considered Medicare "the most important government program on health care that we now have" but said that it was not yet essential to set aside money to bolster the program.
There were no direct mentions of President Clinton during the debate. And neither contender directly mentioned the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
But the candidates did respond to a question about how Mr. Bush and two other candidates mentioned Christ when they were asked about their favorite philosopher-thinkers in a Republican debate this week.
Mr. Bradley said he considered religion a personal subject that he did not want to discuss. But Mr. Gore said, "I affirm my faith when I'm asked about it." He added that "atheists have just as much of a right to the public discourse as any -- as people of any religious faith in this country."
Mr. Gore seized on a question about terrorism to embrace a Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona. On Thursday, Mr. Bradley made a joint appearance in New Hampshire with Mr. McCain to call for overhauling the campaign finance system. Polls show Mr. McCain is very popular among independent voters in New Hampshire, a group that Mr. Bradley is also trying to court.
Asked what he would do to fight terrorism, Mr. Gore noted that he had sponsored with Mr. McCain a bill to control nuclear weapons.
The forum began with Mr. Koppel asking both about their wives and what sort of first ladies they would be.
Mr. Gore responded that his wife, Tipper, would be active and pointed out how she had "worked hard on the issue of health care" and had a graduate degree in psychology. He also said Mrs. Gore "spends a lot of time on the plight of the homeless."
Speaking about his wife, Ernestine, Mr. Bradley said, "In this case people will find Ernestine a unique human being; she would be the first immigrant first lady, having been born in Germany." He added: "She's real; she's dynamic. She will chart her way."
One of the first questions from the audience involved the issue of drug use and the questions about whether Mr. Bush had or had not used cocaine. Mr. Bradley has openly acknowledged that he has smoked marijuana in the past, and pointed out that Mr. Gore had made a similar acknowledgment, but said, "I think people have an understanding of the nuances of life."
Both candidates also spoke forcefully about the responsibility of the news media and the entertainment industry in policing the amount of violence and sex that young people can see. Mr. Bradley recalled the high school seminars he gave in New Jersey and mentioned how he once asked the students if they had seen someone killed. He related how two youths said that they had and then he offered a graphic description of someone being shot in the head. Speaking of one student, Mr. Bradley said, "Then he said, 'You know senator, it was nothing like it was on TV.' "
Mr. Gore called for "self-restraint in the media" and said, "Some kids are vulnerable to having seeds planted that bear bitter fruit."

NEW YORK 1880
 Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age.
 By Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins
 and David Fishman.
 Illustrated. 1,164 pp. New York:
 The Monacelli Press. $85. 
 Over the past two decades the New York architect Robert A. M. Stern, in collaboration with various other authors, has engineered a monumental series of books on the physical history of the city from the late 19th century to the present. "New York 1880," chronologically the earliest volume in the collection, is the fourth to appear (a final tome, "New York 2000," is promised). It covers the architecture and urbanism of the post-Civil War era, with backward glances to the origins of contemporary developments.
You will want to spend some time in the gym building your upper-body strength before picking up this mammoth. "New York 1880" contains something under 1,200 pages and something over 1,200 mostly vintage photographs printed on highly reflective paper. It is 2<4> inches thick and weighs 7 pounds. Since these specifications are typical of the other volumes, we are looking at an aggregate of roughly 6,000 pages and 38 pounds for the series. A Kong-sized production indeed, but one justified by the richness of the subject, and well worth the price for muscular historians of architecture and urban design.
Given the number of illustrations, one might think this a picture book, and it would not be a surprise if more people scanned its illustrations than read its text. There is a long introductory essay, densely packed sections on building types (or, in current architecture-speak, "places") and a hundred pages crammed with footnotes. This is an amazingly thorough work of synthetic scholarship. All that is missing is systematic data about whether or not a building still stands, and if not, when it was demolished. Cryptic captions fail to give this important information, and the vintage photographs themselves offer no help.
"New York 1880" includes an expansive period of architectural change, from red brick and brownstone to buff brick and white terra cotta, from medieval to classical styles, from the filling of the island to the spread of the suburbs. It covers the years in which New York outstripped Boston and Philadelphia to become the great commercial center of the United States. In these years it began to pile office floor upon office floor to create the splintered skyline that heralded the profile of the 20th-century American city; and a mounting inflow of peoples, the newly rich from inland and the "huddled masses" from without, transformed the city's population from largely homogenous to multicultural and fed the widening gulf between the very wealthy and the miserably poor, expressed architecturally in the unbridgeable gap between the mansions of Vanderbilt Row and the "rookeries" of Five Points.
There are major architects here, but they are not the center of attention. Stern and his co-authors, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman, detail the architectural history of the era building by building, from churches and museums, through hotels and tenements, libraries and armories, to theaters and restaurants. The era saw not only the rise of the skyscraper but the flowering of other architectural types: the apartment house, the full exploitation of cast-iron building in the warehouse district and what the authors happily call "the art gallery of the streets," by which they mean the civic embellishment created by the competitively grand facades of high-end town houses. But the book is equal-opportunity history. It covers not only ornamental architecture but also the uptown shanties (which the reigning architectural magazine thought had "a nave charm peculiar to themselves"), Central and Prospect Parks and the infrastructure that made the dense urban complex possible.
Some observations here are economical, graceful and telling, as when the authors write that the dangerously crowded conditions of the tenements led to requirements for fire escapes that "dramatically altered the city's street architecture and to an extent its street life," or when they recognize different social implications for great Fifth Avenue houses, "in which the rivalries of established hostesses and the ambitions of parvenus would not only be played out in private drawing rooms and ballrooms but also in the architecture of the city's principal streets." Such characterizations point up the equally important private and public roles of urban architecture.
There is also the occasional nugget of human interest. It dramatizes the magnitude of Boss Tweed's corrupt reign to learn that his courthouse, begun in 1862, cost twice what America paid for Alaska. That the very rich and their retainers lacked touch with reality is graphically demonstrated by a journalist's description of William H. Vanderbilt's 58-room, $2 million Fifth Avenue brownstone as "a typical American residence." Misplaced confidence shines forth in the story of George B. Post's betting Joseph Pulitzer that Pulitzer's World Building would cost no more than a million -- and losing $20,000 when it did. And how many universal architectural sins are implied by one observer's remark that an early apartment building proved "far more impressive to the beholder than profitable to the owner"?
Much of the value of this history lies in quotations from contemporary social and architectural critics. Perhaps even more than the buildings, these demonstrate the gulf between then and now (although the vast abyss between rich and poor remains a constant). George Templeton Strong, whose diary is mined by every historian of the 19th-century city, noted that the "unventilated, undrained, sunless rookeries" that housed the masses gave rise to epidemics that were "God's judgment on the poor for neglecting his sanitary laws" and "on the rich for tolerating the neglect." When an architect died at the completion of a hotel ill favored by the critics, American Architect and Building News recalled Shakespeare's musing "upon the evil which is not interred with men's bones." And what popular critic now would write about an apartment house, "Of the two temptations of architects of many-storied buildings -- the Scylla of monotony and the Charybdis of miscellany -- the architects have steered clear of the latter"?
But such quotable passages are buried in a dense verbal mass. The aficionado will find the prolixity difficult to negotiate, and even the student of architecture and urbanism will open "New York 1880" more for the occasional fact than for extended reading. After the introductory narrative, the writing takes on the characteristics of a nonjudgmental catalog. One building after another is paraded, its architect and client introduced, its history detailed, its appearance described and contemporary criticism quoted. One building begins to blur into another; page after page of detail makes no concession to the reader's fatigue. Some of this is unavoidable; some is not. Much is the stuff of footnotes. We are told the definition of incandescent lighting, the name of the ship that brought Cleopatra's Needle to the city and the name of every known competitor in a competition, whether his design survives or not. For every building we are given the names, and in some cases biographical sketches, of owner and architect, and complete coordinates ("at the northern end of the block facing Greeley Square, bounded by Broadway, Sixth Avenue and 32nd Street"). Some paragraphs are mere lists of names and dates, addresses and adjectives (among which "pavilionated" grates the most).
But, all that aside, the thoroughness that numbs the casual reader is, paradoxically, the book's great strength. It may leave much to be desired as belles-lettres, but it is architectural history with a capital H. The method is multidimensional; architecture is connected to the rest of life. Buildings are tightly locked into the urban, technical, social, political, economic, demographic, stylistic and other conditions of the place and period. They appear to have been extruded out of the historical pressures of the age, and that is what architectural history should achieve.
All architecture is the result of the call of social need and the response of design solution. In the 1880's, as now, not even the great signature architects could work without reference to demands of urban society that buildings be economical and safe and that they follow some formal expectation. Building programs, technology, designers and stylistic bent may change, but the process remains constant. We gain perspective on our own work by studying processes of other times and other places. When urban architectural history is written, as it is here, as a series of social problems solved, rather than current celebrities praised, it is a valuable educational tool for professionals and persevering laypeople alike. "New York 1880" captures the complexity of architecture as design response. It is too bad it is not better literature, but it is difficult to imagine a better reference work in urban architectural history.

 BODY:

The Rise of the Virtual State
 Wealth and Power in the
 Coming Century.
 By Richard Rosecrance.
 287 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $26. 
 RECENTLY I woke up to discover that I'm working part time for a German company named Bertelsmann A.G. While I wasn't looking, Bertelsmann bought Random House, which published several of my books and still occasionally sends me tiny royalty checks. Bertelsmann is now the largest publisher of English-language trade books in the world. Who's "us"? Who's "them"? Does it matter?
Richard Rosecrance thinks it still does, although not the way it used to. Nations still compete with one another, and they still have different interests, but the terms of the competition have radically changed. During the first centuries of modern history (roughly 1500 to 1900), power went to countries with large amounts of land and key natural resources like iron, coal and copper. They enlarged their power by taking over lesser nations and their land and resources, adding to their military prowess. But roughly a century ago, and again after a pause for the Great Depression and World War II, the terms of competition shifted from territory to trade. Between the 50's and the 80's, the growth of trade easily outpaced the growth of national economies. With goods more mobile than capital or labor, the key resources became state-of-the-art equipment and well-trained workers. Thus were nations like Japan and Germany able to gain large shares of global commerce and indirectly exert significant influence on world events.
The central idea in "The Rise of the Virtual State" is that power is shifting once again, this time to nations whose people are most adept at summoning global financial capital and turning it into conceptual insights for sale around the world. Rosecrance calls these new centers of power virtual states, because their wealth and influence depend on intangible flows of money and ideas. They don't need a lot of exports to finance their imports and their investments in plant and equipment. They need a lot of brains, with which to generate research, software designs, entertainment, engineering concepts, advertising, marketing, styling, legal and financial innovations and information-based inventions. And it is brains -- not land, not armaments, not capital equipment -- on which national wealth and power will depend in the future.
In Rosecrance's view, all nations are evolving toward virtual states, but some are becoming "head" nations, specializing in ideas, and others are becoming "body" nations, making tangible products on the basis of those ideas. In the former category are the United States, the nations of Western Europe and some of the nations of Southeast Asia; among the latter will be China, Eastern Europe, South Asia and the African countries. Rosecrance concedes that the world may grow further divided, yet, like Jesse Ventura, body nations can transform themselves with enough emphasis on training their people's minds.
Indeed, this is an unremittingly cheerful book. Rosecrance expects the planet to become steadily more peaceful because nations no longer need additional territory in order to thrive. And under the new terms of competition, one nation's gains don't come at another's expense. Countries endowed with a lot of capital don't have to conquer countries with a lot of labor; they can just admit more immigrants. Nations with a lot of well-trained but poor workers don't have to pillage their neighbors for capital; they can rely on global capital markets to transfer money to them from capital-rich places, so long as nations on the receiving end remain open and friendly. Developing countries no longer nationalize foreign plants, because that would stem the flow of foreign capital, and flow is more important than any physical plant. The rise of the virtual state will inaugurate "a new epoch of peaceful competition among nations, promising a cooperative transition to the new millennium."
There's no room here for doubters predicting a collision of cultures between a capitalist West and a fundamentalist East or fretting about tribalism. Yet if Rosecrance's sunny forecast is not entirely persuasive, he offers abundant evidence for it. More than a decade ago, he wrote "The Rise of the Trading State," to which this book is something of a sequel. There's a bit of overlap, because much of the history is the same. But in "The Rise of the Virtual State," he ventures more daringly into a new digital economy whose products move through space at the speed of light, and offers some useful insights. Rosecrance, a professor of international and comparative politics at the University of California, Los Angeles, points out that Hong Kong, which used to be known as a cheap place to make things, now earns almost all its money as a center of business services. Moreover, as land continues to decline in value, population density is now positively correlated with a nation's wealth. Consider tiny Singapore.
Rosecrance also makes an admirably strong case for education and job skills as the keys in determining a nation's wealth and influence. A virtual state, he argues, must invest in its people, not worry about amassing expensive production capacity. "At the ultimate stage," he writes, "competition among nations will be competition among educational systems." Nations in effect choose their comparative advantage through the prowess of their graduate schools. But deciding to be an engineering center and not a biotechnology center will have little practical effect, he reasons, if too few citizens have the basic education to specialize.
But there's a paradox at the heart of Rosecrance's argument that he never quite addresses. Who exactly are the citizens of a virtual state, and what exactly are its businesses? Rosecrance refers in passing to a "new type of international crisis" apt to occur as virtual states compete, citing "a frantic two weeks" in December 1994 when, according to his account, the White House and the French vied over a $1 billion deal to manage Brazilian rain forests and air traffic; Washington won it for the Raytheon Company. But it's not at all clear what America's interest was in securing the deal for Raytheon in the first place. After all, Raytheon is fast becoming a global corporation whose employees and shareholders span the world. It's only "virtually" American. Presumably most of the people it would hire to work on these projects in Brazil would be Brazilians. A few years ago my home state of Massachusetts gave Raytheon a lot of money in return for its agreement to keep thousands of jobs in the state. A few weeks ago, Raytheon announced it was pulling the plug on many of them.
I like Rosecrance's idea of investing more money in the education of Americans, especially poor children who are now in lousy schools. But his idea neglects the central question. Whom does he expect to fork up the money? The money Massachusetts gave Raytheon could have been used for public schools, as could all the money states around the country are spending to bribe companies to stay put or move in.
What about individual citizens? By Rosecrance's logic, the citizens of a virtual state will, like corporations, be virtual citizens of the world. They'll be selling their services globally and investing their savings wherever they can get the best return. A growing proportion of the American work force is already employed by companies with headquarters outside the United States. A chief executive of General Motors once said that what was in G.M.'s interest was in the interest of the United States, but G.M. has now gone global. And what about DaimlerChrysler? America bailed out the old Chrysler; the new one seems to have moved its headquarters to Stuttgart. Meanwhile, the fund manager of my 401(k) plan is investing my pension dollars in Europe and Asia as well as America. And don't forget about my part-time job with Bertelsmann.
At the core of a polity are bonds that unite a people and give them a sense of belonging to a common culture. But a virtual state, by its very nature, generates few such bonds and snaps the ones already in place. Rosecrance may be right about the coming of the virtual state. But he hasn't explained why we or anyone else should care about it.

The GoodLife
 By Keith Scribner.
 263 pp. New York:
 Riverhead Books. $23.95. 
 Why is crime so fascinating? Because we suspect a secret criminal within? Because not much seems to separate the law-abiding citizen from murderers, rapists, thieves and swindlers? Keith Scribner's first novel, "The GoodLife," dares us to ponder the question. Inspired by the 1992 kidnapping of an Exxon executive in suburban New Jersey, "The GoodLife" traces three days in the lives of five characters: Stona Brown, a wealthy, retirement-age executive at Petrochem International; his wife, Nunny; Theo and Colleen Wolkoviak, Stona's kidnappers; and Theo's father, Malcolm, a retired detective.
Theo and Colleen, the putative villains, are quintessential aging boomers. Former owners of Hilton Head real estate and "his-and-her white Mercedes," they continually measure what they don't have against what they do, which at the time of the novel's action is little indeed. While they imagine themselves as "creative, hard-working entrepreneurs," they have 26 maxed-out credit cards and debt of "five or six hundred thousand." Now, living under Malcolm's roof, they seek the "single big haul" that will redeem them -- pay for their daughter's college and set up their retirement. Cloaking his desperation with self-help business-speak, Theo has decided to kidnap Stona and ransom him for $18 million. Theo's experience as a policeman under his father's supervision and as Petrochem's security chief leverage his plan -- or so he thinks.
But the kidnapping goes bad from the start, and we follow each of Theo's mistakes with a sense of doom, not exactly rooting for him, but seeing the gap between his dreams and his reality widen by the hour. Listening to the kidnapping case on his police scanner is Malcolm, who though dying of emphysema remains an astute judge of the kidnappers' abilities. "Amateurish," he pronounces. "Seems impulsive. Irrational. Like maybe something got botched." Yet Malcolm is so eager to believe Theo's lie that he is putting together "a big deal" at the local yacht club that he remains blind to the portents around him -- like the police officer measuring the tire prints in his yard.
Colleen, for her part, is a loving wife -- too loving and too weak to protest her husband's plan. Also susceptible to the lures of affluence (even fantasizing about a flirtation with a Tony Robbins-like huckster), she tricks Stona into stopping his car so Theo can force him into a rental van. Colleen protests Theo's imprisonment of Stona in an overheated ministorage locker but doesn't stop him, choosing instead to perform her motherly role at home as if nothing were amiss.
Just as Theo and Colleen's brutal act contrasts with their desire for conventional family happiness, so too is Stona's victimhood complicated by his harsh nature. Although he loves his wife dearly, he has committed sins against her and others, to say nothing of his oil company's effect on the environment. Yet his agony while kidnapped is wrenching. Locked in a stifling trunk, suffering from a minor bullet wound and a weak heart, he lapses from retrospection into hallucination in his attempts to control his fear. "To bend his knees for one minute . . . for 30 seconds . . . he would trade his home." He remembers negotiations with a Kuwaiti oil minister, sees his wife's toes, imagines wandering through the local pharmacy. He attempts an accounting of his sins ("the real estate deal in Pennsylvania . . . scores of decisions that had harmed the lives of innocent people") and promises God good deeds upon his release. We hope for his survival, we really do.
Nunny is hoping for it too, and with her house besieged by plodding F.B.I. agents and their "strange insistent odors," she retreats into recollection of her life with Stona, realizing that she has forced herself to accept Petrochem's damage to the environment as the price of their affluence and the harmony of their marriage. Yet even as she pictures Stona's suffering, she arrives at a cold fury against him, understanding that, while she has pleaded with him to retire, the job he has lived for so long may be the death of him.
The movement of a novel, even one as finely written as "The GoodLife," across five points of view is potentially disastrous: the writer risks a reader confused by the weave of the plot or bored with lesser characters. But Scribner, who teaches in Stanford University's creative writing program, handles this challenge, cutting the focus not only to the action -- Stona bound and gagged, Theo listening to his father's police scanner -- but smoothly away from it, too, into his characters' troubled histories, always elaborating the sense that in premillennial America, failure is common, money is a fungible form of violence and the sum of hope can be ruin.
The drama, we realize, is not simply about the kidnapping of an oil-company executive and whether he will be rescued, but how one marriage strangely destroys another, how a father's belief in his son endures naively for decades and how economic defeat pushes people through despair into savagery.

HEADLINE: $6 Billion in Online Holiday Sales by the End of This Month! $24 Billion in Internet Ads by 2003! 2.3 Trillion E-Biz Predictions by 2010!

BYLINE: By Jim Frederick; Jim Frederick is a senior editor at Money. This is his first feature for The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
You don't need an expert to tell you we're living in the middle of a technological revolution. Everybody knows that the Internet is a big deal and getting bigger, and all those claims that its significance rivals that of the telephone, the railroad, the television and the automobile don't seem as delusional as they did a few years ago. Still, it's easy to wonder, to want to know, to need to know, exactly how momentous the Internet's impact will be. How big will, say, the online advertising industry get over the next three years? Just how many people will trade stocks online? And how much money will be spent shopping on the Web this holiday season, anyway?
The most honest answer to all of these questions is, of course, There's no way to know. But that's pretty unsatisfying, isn't it? Just as nature abhors a vacuum, so, too, does the human mind despise ambiguity. So let's try these answers instead: online advertising will be a $24 billion industry by the year 2003, 20 million households will trade stocks online that same year and consumers will have spent $6 billion online from November through the end of December. 
 Says who? The experts. The experts, that is, at Jupiter Communications in New York and Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. -- the two most prominent companies to have recognized America's Internet-certainty shortage. Stepping boldly into the answer vacuum, the companies have transformed themselves into prediction factories, supplying the world with a steady stream of airy, context-free, yet reassuringly precise projections like the ones above. Of course, seemingly exact yet largely unconfirmable statistics pop up all the time; we seem to need them somehow, so we simply accept it when told that 70 percent of all filed pieces of paper are never looked at again or that the average man thinks about sex four times a minute. But the headlong rush of the Internet, and the fortunes to be made or lost because of it, has created a particularly sharp craving for a numerical accounting of what will happen next. So who can blame Forrester and Jupiter for recognizing that uncertainty is just another demand in search of a product?
As for the companies themselves, they certainly do nothing to contradict the idea that they are virtual oracles. As one Jupiter analyst puts it, "We define a worldview, and everything we say has to fit into that worldview -- kind of like the Catholic Church."
Flip open any major newspaper or magazine on literally any day, and you will probably encounter a headline or a statistic on the order of, "Online grocery shopping will be a $783 million business by the end of 1999." And Jupiter or Forrester will almost certainly be cited as the source. Where do the numbers come from? "You can build a forecast in about 10 seconds by sitting in a room and guessing," says Evan Cohen, the director of Jupiter's data research, between bites of a footlong chicken-and-cheese hero. "Sometimes I fear that folks think that's how we do it. But we have extensive models built for these kinds of things."
This is true, although those models have little resemblance to the statistical techniques, like regression analysis or time-series analysis, used by traditional market researchers or industrial forecasters to determine next year's worldwide consumption of, say, gasoline or Coca-Cola. That, of course, is because enterprises that forecast the consumption of resources or consumer items can draw on decades of historical data. Using such techniques, Cohen notes, "would be nonsense for us, given there's no real historical patterns -- we're dealing with an environment here that has existed for two or three years." (And even sophisticated techniques relying on extensive historical data are hardly infallible.)
To understand how Jupiter and Forrester come up with their numbers in the absence of the kind of raw data available to analysts in more mature industries, consider Jupiter's assertion in November that American consumers will spend $78 billion shopping online in 2003. As most projections at Jupiter do, this one began with telephone surveys conducted in partnership with a traditional market-research company called NFO Interactive. Data was collected on who is online now and on how much they probably spend, and the extrapolations common to all polling data were made. Those who aren't online were asked when they might be; people were quizzed as to how much they plan to spend online in the years ahead, and on what. Jupiter then asked more than 200 retailers, in formal interviews, about their sales expectations.
The problem is that retailers tend to be overly optimistic about their forecasts and that most consumers can't really know how much they will spend on, say, airline tickets in 2001. So Jupiter compared the estimates it got for online shopping with the historical growth rates of similar ways to shop (like catalogs and QVC) and the total size of various retail markets by category. Using these elements to "triangulate toward market sizings," as a recent research report puts it, the analysts estimated that the number of Americans who buy stuff online will grow from 18.8 million in 1998 to 85 million in 2003.
At Jupiter, the world of things you might buy over the Web is cut into 28 product categories -- movie tickets, furniture, groceries, etc. -- whose suitability for sales online is ranked in 13 criteria (like "ease of delivery," "product variety" and "ease of evaluating online"). The rankings are pretty much subjective; the analysts assign each category a relative score that they figure makes sense. When that's done, Jupiter tries to marry the number of people shopping in each of these 28 categories with how much they will spend. Again, the firm concocted a qualitatively scored grid to evaluate how much of a person's total annual expenses in a particular category will shift to the Web over what period of time. Take that dollar amount and multiply it by the number of people you think will be shopping in that category, and you have an estimate of how much will be spent in that category every year through 2003.
At that point, Cohen says, "we go through a process of gut checking." That is, they look for the categories with conclusions that are obvious nonsense. "Once you develop that final number, you can then compare it, for example, to the overall size of that market in the U.S.," he continues. "At first glance, you know, you'll look, and all of the line-by-line assumptions will make sense, but gosh -- the total implies that 50 percent of the hotel market will be online? Well, that doesn't make sense." And when that happens, Cohen explains, they throw out the results, go back into the score cards and retool them, sometimes repeatedly, until the numbers do "make sense."
Only when that's done for each category can you add them all up and get $78 billion spent shopping online in 2003. So when Jupiter employees claim that many of their predictions take weeks to build, it's easy to believe them. Nonetheless, the precise figures that these Rube Goldberg forecast contraptions yield give little hint of the layers of extrapolation and subjective guesswork underneath.
Take another prediction, this one from Forrester: global spending on Internet ads will hit $24 billion in 2003. Charlene Li, the analyst who headed the team that made that projection, notes that advertising is a fairly straightforward business-to-business transaction and that data from years past has shown that fewer than 100 sites capture more than 90 percent of Internet advertising. So rather than build minutely detailed computer models of past and expected behavior, the bulk of her team's research involved phone interviews with 100 or so executives in charge of buying and selling ads, asking how much they expect to spend on Web advertising over the next four years and how much ad revenue they expect to receive from their own Web properties. Those numbers are poured into a spreadsheet, fiddled with to account for exaggerations and overlaps, Li says, and then "we just converge on a number."
No one at Forrester or Jupiter claims that what he or she does is science. Instead, the companies simply maintain that while their methodologies may not be perfect, they are more thorough than anyone else's. "Interviewing 50 people is not statistically valid," concedes Frank Gillett, a Forrester analyst, discussing a favored Forrester research technique. But "somebody has to pull more than 50 people out of their hat to say that they know better."
Five years ago, Jupiter was a modest trend-watching newsletter operation with a dozen employees, but as the Internet has exploded, so, too, has Jupiter's business. Jupiter now employs 250 people, occupies two floors in a cavernous loft building at Broadway and Houston and recently went public in an offering that raised $66 million. "We're the first and last word on what people should be doing and how businesses should be comporting themselves," says Gene DeRose, Jupiter's C.E.O., in his modest corner cubicle sprinkled with rebel artifacts like a guitar, a stuffed Jerry Garcia doll and a poster from the Knitting Factory. "Our goal is to get thousands of companies to trust us in their decision-making process."
Over at Forrester's headquarters in Cambridge, George Colony sits in one of the office's many small meeting rooms named after rock stars like the Allman Brothers (his favorite band), leans back in his chair and stares at the sudden downpour outside. Colony founded Forrester in 1986 to study the effects of the popularity of the personal computer. Despite its original orientation toward more nuts-and-bolts technology topics, Forrester has successfully retooled itself to address the Internet almost exclusively. "We do not sell information," Colony says. "We sell objective advice. We sell ideas. We are an idea factory. We are futurists. We are always looking toward what's next."
More specifically, Forrester and Jupiter are so-called syndicated research firms. This means that they publish a wide range of reports with extremely high subscription fees to a small, targeted audience of corporate executives. For about $20,000 you can buy a subscription for one of eight color-coded subjects, or "practices," from Jupiter Communications. Then, every month for a year, you'll receive a 16- to 32-page report filled with analysis and advice, survey data and industry forecasts. A subscription also includes one-page, news-oriented weekly updates and phone time with analysts. Forrester's pricing plans are a bit more complicated and variable, but the gist is the same. As sidelines, the companies also provide a little one-on-one consulting and hold periodic high-ticket industry conferences at large hotels in places like Miami, Boston, San Francisco or New York.
What happens when they're wrong? "We are like Eisenhower's weathermen," Colony says. "When we are wrong, young men die." Well, not really. In fact, Forrester and Jupiter have made their shares of high-profile blunders. Forrester, for example, claimed a few years ago that AOL's membership would top out at 6 million and then recede; it's now 19 million. Meanwhile, remember Jupiter's prediction from 1997 that online grocery shopping would be a $783 million business by 1999? The real number, $230 million, was off by more than a factor of three. Jupiter came up with its number by way of the same process that it used to predict, more recently, that $78 billion total shopping figure by 2003. What went wrong? "The whole middle part of the grocery-delivery chain is a huge issue," DeRose says. Jupiter knew that at the time, but believed that somebody would "come up with an infrastructure" to solve the problem nationwide. That still hasn't happened. Last year, Forrester underestimated the growth of the number of people coming online because the company didn't foresee the emergence of the sub-$700 PC that included Internet access.
Now ask Shelley Morrisette, who until recently served as Forrester's director of quantitative research, about the consequences of such gaffes. Accountability? He guffaws at the notion, practically shouting: "There's none! There's none!" For 22 years, Morrisette did quantitative research for Gallup. "We prided ourselves on being exactly right," he says. "When you made a mistake, if you called an election and picked the wrong candidate or something like that, you were beat over the head."
In the Internet-prediction business, no one ever seems to get beat over the head, probably at least in part because, so far anyway, winning or losing has proved to be a much murkier concept in e-commerce than it is in an election. Morrisette says he wanted to address more upfront and publicly the uncertainties involved in making such predictions -- for instance, by releasing a "band," or range, of numbers, instead of one precise figure -- but was often thwarted. "I said by the year 2003, the number of households doing online financial services would be between 17 and 22 million households, or whatever it was, depending on what would happen, and I gave a list of the things that might happen," he recalls. "I got slaughtered. They said: 'We need one number. If you don't give one number, it looks like you're equivocating."'
Among those who far prefer something definitive, told to them by an expert, are journalists. Consider this example: not long ago, a reporter for a well-known national magazine was writing an article about all the problems online brokers were having just keeping their Web sites up and running. After researching the problem with various sources, and after almost having finished writing the article, this journalist still needed some numbers to buttress some of his claims, and maybe a quote or two to back up his conclusions. So he put in calls to Forrester and Jupiter.
This reporter was, of course, me. And at the time, I didn't give it a second thought. I was on deadline and I knew the drill: someone at one of these companies would get me what I needed fast. A Forrester analyst, Michael Gazala, it turns out, called me back first. From our brief conversation, I got a quick statistic of how many households were expected to be investing online by the end of 1999 and a handful of snappy quotes. In fact, Gazala seemed willing to riff on the same thought a number of times, until he sensed that he had delivered the perfect quote. He also seemed to know that mainstream journalism often precludes the writer from making an observation in his own voice. So rather than simply saying "Yes" or "You're right" after I volunteered an opinion, he would, without prompting, repeat my conclusions back to me in complete, eloquent, usable sentences.
Now, I'm not the only journalist who has ever done this; practically all journalists need experts in their stories, which is why Forrester and Jupiter pop up in just about every media outlet you can think of -- including this magazine. The point is, Forrester and Jupiter know the press needs them. Both companies aggressively promote their analysts as go-to quote machines through a steady stream of news releases, press hot lines ("Thank you for calling Jupiter Communications, the worldwide authority on Internet commerce," goes the main switchboard's greeting) and job profiles dictating that phone time with reporters is an essential part of every analyst's job. Jupiter, which has 50 research analysts, receives 300 press calls a week. Forrester analysts were quoted more in the first six months of this year than in all of 1998. That impressive tally will translate directly into dollars for Forrester analysts, whose individual bonuses are pegged, in part, to whether or not they meet quotas of major media mentions.
What's more, many of these analysts are perfectly willing to blithely offer a confident take whether they're experts on the subject at hand or not. Charlene Li, who covers Internet commerce for Forrester, says she fields anywhere from 5 to 20 calls a day, on all kinds of topics: "Like deals. I get a lot of calls when there are big mergers. If Lycos buys Quote.com or if there's a new free I.S.P. service, I'll get calls. A lot of times a reporter will call about this deal and say, 'Is this a good deal?' and I will go, 'Hmmmm,' and look it up, or ask them to tell me a little bit about it."
So what if they ask for an opinion on something she knows nothing about?
"I give an opinion," she says. "I was scared at first. It took me a little while to get used to that. But you give 'em an opinion."
From the companies' point of view, there's a good reason to get quoted saying something definitive. Josh Bernoff, Forrester's man on the interactive-TV beat, declared earlier this year that personal video recorders (gadgets that are essentially more flexible, easier-to-use VCR's) would mark "the end of network television." In person, Bernoff is a bearded, heavy-set, quiet-spoken guy who looks quite at home in the academic environs of Cambridge. He is also thoughtful, whip smart and well aware of every move he makes with the press. That now widely quoted crack about the death of network TV? It turns out he didn't really mean it. "I mean, there are still railroads, right?" he says now. What he really thinks is that network TV will lose about half of its market within 10 years. That's an industry-transforming development, to be sure, but it's not quite the end of CBS, NBC and ABC.
But, Bernoff explains, he's not really talking to reporters for the benefit of the average reader. "It's a very deliberate thing," he says. "I want to say something that would make a potential client say, 'Wait a minute, we gotta talk to this guy.' If someone reads that, and it leads to a contract, then I've done a good job."
Authority has been considered a currency built silently over decades; now it is conferred overnight upon those with the largest megaphones. No doubt Forrester and Jupiter have achieved levels of expertise and enjoy good reputations because they were among the first to recognize Internet commerce as a significant business development. And these days, executives at both companies point to their own business successes, and high client-retention rates, as proof of their authority.
Many Internet executives, those who are clients of Forrester and Jupiter as well as those who are not, tend to offer the companies lukewarm praise on the record and lukewarm criticism off it. Publicly, they say that they value certain kinds of reports or individual analysts. Privately, they admit that they view the companies and the media froth they generate as necessary evils. Tom Watson, editor of an online news service covering Silicon Alley called AtNewYork, likens them to players in what he calls the Kabuki dance of Internet business plans. "I have not seen a business plan, and I see hundreds every year, without a Jupiter or Forrester factlet in it," he says. "And every business plan out there is hogwash. Nobody knows what their business is going to look like in five years, and everyone who writes one knows that. And the people who are investing in these companies know that. But you gotta have numbers in the business plan, you just gotta have them, and Forrester and Jupiter provide them, so you put them in."
Journalists rely on Jupiter and Forrester for quotes and figures for much the same reason: we need answers. When I took Forrester's word for it earlier this year that there would be 3.5 million households trading stocks online by the end of 1999, it wouldn't have meant a thing to me if the company named a figure double or even 10 times that amount. I just had a blank to fill with an expert guess about the future, and I got it.
As for Jupiter and Forrester, they have -- to put it mildly -- a conflicted relationship with the projections they produce. There are about four stock defenses they offer for their numbers, each a different step along an ideological retreat from the certainty implied in the numbers themselves. In fact, you often hear a jumble of more or less strident defenses in a single conversation. Sometimes, for example, executives vigorously defend the accuracy and methodology of their predictions and hand you a propaganda sheet touting their greatest soothsaying hits. Other times they insist that clients are not interested in the details, so the difference between $15 billion and $10 billion when you're talking years from now -- it's all academic, isn't it? Still other times they will say that the numbers are really only marketing and press-relations tools because big, specific numbers are what journalists love. Finally, when asked outright if the whole enterprise isn't somehow a little ridiculous, they will sometimes say that the numbers themselves are irrelevant, that the research is not about numbers at all but about acting as a catalyst for thought by the clients.
George Colony and Gene DeRose steadfastly maintain that the accuracy of their companies' predictions is the bedrock of credibility. "As I like to say, if we can bat .700, if we can get it right 7 out of 10 times, then we've helped our clients," Colony says. DeRose echoes that sentiment, almost eerily. "If you can maintain a healthy 60-to-80 range of being on the money, you're doing the right job," he says. Fair enough. So, precisely what percentage of the time are these companies correct, and how do they keep track?
Well, they don't. Turns out, this is a convenient exception to the rules about exactitude; their track records are, the two C.E.O.'s admit, nothing but ballpark estimates. An exact measure of past accuracy would be pretty much impossible, DeRose maintains. "It's a struggle to define what the nature of accuracy is," he adds. Over at Forrester, Colony basically agrees. "We used to track it," he says, as he turns to reassess the downpour outside, "but I don't have any data for you. My feeling is, if we didn't do any better than .700, we wouldn't have a business."

HEADLINE: Unearthing a Riot

BYLINE: By Brent Staples; Brent Staples writes editorials on politics and culture for The Times and is the author of the memoir "Parallel Time: Growing Up in Black and White."

 BODY:
Tulsa grew explosively between 1910 and 1920, built by the oil families who have dominated business, politics and cultural life right up to the present. Downtown Tulsa has changed so little in the last half-century that a traveler who returned after 50 years would find it familiar. But since 1997, Tulsans who thought they knew the city well have been startled to learn of a 1921 riot in which hundreds of people were shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. These grim facts have been churned up by the Tulsa Race Riot Commission, created by the Oklahoma Legislature two years ago to investigate the country's bloodiest civil disturbance of the century. The commission report, due on Gov. Frank Keating's desk early next year, will attempt to fix a death toll, provide an estimate of property damage and explain what caused the disturbance in the first place. But the most controversial mission is to determine whether or not the state should pay reparations either to the black district of Greenwood or to individual survivors. The issue has spawned a contentious dispute in the city as a whole -- and reopened interest in the race wars that swept the country early in this century, when whites and African-Americans engaged in armed combat in the streets.
The race war in Tulsa involved thousands of whites who destroyed most of the 35 square blocks of Greenwood, including its affluent business district, known locally as the Negro Wall Street, in riots that left as many as 300 dead. But the nightmare was soon banished from newspapers, textbooks and civil conversation, so that most Tulsans born just 20 years later grew up with no idea that it had ever happened. Older Tulsans, quiet for decades, have been talking nonstop since The Tulsa World ran a series of articles on the commission earlier this year, inviting people to call the Tulsa Historical Society with their stories. Nearly 150 people have called so far. An employee at the historical society itself tells of an aging black man who shot an unarmed white man during the riot and still cries every time he passes the spot. A nurse tells of a white man who confessed on his deathbed that he had killed many blacks during the riot and buried them near the railroad tracks -- and would do it again if he had to. 
 The commission has located more than 50 black survivors of the riot and has begun to videotape their testimony. Among the survivors who still live in Tulsa is Kinney Booker, 86, who was 8 at the time and relates on one of the videotapes how he listened from a hiding place in the attic as white men called his father "nigger" and took him away at gunpoint: He said, 'Please don't set my house on fire.' Soon as he left, they set our house on fire and we were up in the attic. . . . Five kids. . . . We were able to get out without injury but bullets were zinging around there. . . . But when we got down, the telephone poles were burned and falling and my poor sister who was two years younger than I am said , 'Kinney, is the world on fire?' I said, 'I don't think so, but we are in deep trouble."'
People who have called the historical society focus mainly on corpses. Corpses stacked like cordwood on street corners, photographed for keepsakes. Corpses piled in the backs of wagons, dump trucks and along railroad sidings. Corpses buried in an underground tunnel downtown, where one caller said 123 blacks had been clubbed to death. Corpses left to rot for days in a park under the blistering Oklahoma sun. Corpses dumped in the Arkansas River and allowed to float away.
Tips have led commission investigators to three sites within the city that they suspect to be mass graves containing the riot dead, though given the way the bodies seem to have been scattered, all of them will never be found.
The man who brought the riot back to life is state representative Don Ross, who has served the Greenwood district in the Legislature for 17 years and wrote the riot commission resolution that became law in 1997. Ross has lived with the riot for more than 40 years, and since he became a senior member of the Legislature, has forced Tulsa and Oklahoma to live it with him. As a young magazine editor in 1971, Ross ran an article exposing the carnage in Greenwood that has been widely credited for breaking a 50-year conspiracy of silence. As a community gadfly in the late 70's, he helped fight to preserve the few historic buildings that remained after Greenwood had been almost completely changed by middle-class flight, urban renewal and highway construction. He was elected to the Legislature in 1982 on the basis of his civil rights activism and has since made the riot a top issue -- helping to secure money in 1995 for the Greenwood Cultural Center, which contains a permanent photo exhibit of the destruction, and working to get a black granite memorial to the Negro Wall Street, which was built in 1996.
Ross is a skillful legislator. He knew in the beginning that a bill requiring the state to pay reparations would be dead on arrival. Even so, the initial bill obligated the state to pay $5 million -- but mainly as a tactic. When the Legislature balked, Ross, a Democrat, allowed the provision to be stripped away, but language calling for a study of the history of the riot remained. The bill passed both houses, partly because many legislators were ignorant of the riot.
The case has attracted considerable interest from legal scholars like Alfred L. Brophy, a law professor at Oklahoma City University, who read about the case in the newspapers and volunteered to serve as the commission's legal counsel. Brophy has a keen interest in civil rights issues that predate contemporary civil rights law. He compares the Greenwood case to that of the Japanese-Americans who had property confiscated and were placed in internment camps during World War II, and then waited nearly 50 years before receiving an official apology from Ronald Reagan, in 1988, along with $1.65 billion in compensation from the federal government. What links Greenwood and the Japanese-Americans, Brophy says, is the fact that the government permitted the harm that was committed in both cases.
The case that Greenwood most resembles is that of Rosewood, Fla., a black enclave in the central part of the state that was wiped out by an invading force of whites in 1923. Told that reparations were "a moral obligation," the Florida Legislature voted in 1994 to, among other things, make reparations through a college scholarship fund for Rosewood descendants. In Florida, the government admitted that it knew of the impending disaster and failed to protect the town. But in Tulsa, the city "made the riot worse," Brophy argues, by deputizing a lynch mob. In an analysis of the case, Brophy writes that the city "clothed private citizens with the authority to arrest, almost surely instructed them to kill and quite likely instructed them to burn Greenwood." Brophy thinks Tulsa would "find some money" to pay survivors if a trial appeared imminent. In November, the riot commission's reparations committee suggested a settlement of at least $33 million, including a scholarship fund for black Tulsans and additional payments of up to $150,000 each for survivors whose families lost assets in 1921.
Don Ross, 58, should be contented now that his life's work has been vindicated. But the day I visited him at his yellow ranch house in a subdivision not far from Greenwood, I realized that the word "contented" may never apply to him. Ross seems permanently enraged by the rape of what he calls "my community." The kitchen table, the breakfast counter and his office were awash in manila envelopes and file folders containing photocopies of Tulsa city records from the 20's and newspaper clippings from The Chicago Defender, The Kansas City Call, The New York Age, The Pittsburgh Courier and several other Negro-press newspapers that covered the riot's aftermath critically, while The Tulsa Tribune swallowed whole the "official story."
"See?" Ross says, pointing to the minutes of the Tulsa City Commission in 1921. "This is where the city paid off whites who lost property in the riot and disallowed claims by blacks. This is where the city promised a fund to rebuild the community, but the fund was never created and the money was never paid!" Flipping pages, he continues. "See this! The mayor and the city commission plotted in open session -- open session! -- to steal black land so that the 'colored section' could be pushed farther north. It's right there, in black and white." During lulls in the conversation, Ross sat silently dreaming into the middle distance. But when he spoke of the riot, he was animated and fiery.
The Greenwood business district today consists of a one-block stretch of historic structures built after the riots that were saved from the wrecking ball during urban renewal. This museum block is surrounded by expanses of empty space, the exposed foundations of long-gone houses and ghostly driveways that start at the curb and disappear into the grass.
But the Greenwood Avenue in Ross's mental landscape is a densely built street that runs for more than a mile, a street crowded with hotels, bars, jazz joints, barbershops and poolrooms, with the premier addresses occupied by doctors, dentists and lawyers. When Ross rides these streets in his red Lincoln Town Car, he sees not just empty fields, but shades of the community as it was on the eve of the riot.
Greenwood came into being out of necessity, when black people were forbidden by law to live or own businesses in the white city -- and were expected to be off the white city streets by sundown. By the eve of the riot in 1921, the black city within a city included as many as 15,000 people and supported 191 businesses, including 15 doctors, 2 dentists, one chiropractor and three law offices. With a larger black land-owning class, Oklahoma had about 45 black municipalities -- more by far than any state in the union -- and was known as "the promised land," a veritable capital of black economic independence. At the beginning of the Negro Wall Street, at 102 North Greenwood Avenue, was the three-story Williams Building, the first of several properties owned by John Williams and his wife, Loula, who began their enterprises with an auto-repair business, then built a movie house, the Williams Dreamland Theater, as well as other holdings. A few doors down was the soon-to-be-famous attorney B.C. Franklin, who, like many others, went by his first initials only to prevent white folks from getting overly familiar and calling him by his first name. B.C.'s 6-year-old son, John Hope Franklin, told everyone within hearing range that he planned to be the first Negro president of the United States, but grew up to become one of the most respected historians of his era. At No. 112 lived Emma and O.W. Gurley, rich developers who built much of the black district and estimated their holdings at more than $1 million in 1921. At No. 126 stood The Tulsa Star, whose owner and publisher, A.J. Smitherman, campaigned vigorously against lynching while the white-owned Tulsa Tribune tacitly endorsed it.
Down at No. 301 stood the 65-room Stradford Hotel, the jewel of Greenwood Avenue, built by J.B. Stradford, who had come to the area in 1899 with degrees from both Oberlin and Indiana Law School. Farther along, in a less prestigious block at No. 503, were the offices of A.C. Jackson, who was described by the Mayo brothers, the founders of the Mayo Clinic, as "the most able Negro surgeon in America."
White Tulsans especially hated Stradford and Smitherman. Stradford had already sued a railroad for confining him to the Jim Crow car even though he purchased a first-class ticket. He had once beaten a white deliveryman nearly to death for a racist remark. The pistol-packing Smitherman was similarly volatile. Three years before the riot, he led an armed group of black farmers to prevent the lynching of a black prisoner in nearby Bristow. He was also brazen enough to write about them in his paper, The Star. The white hatred of these "uppity" Negroes was intensified by the city's desire for their land. Hemmed in by the river on the south and Greenwood on the north, Tulsa was burgeoning with nowhere to grow.
The tensions in Tulsa were part of a national pattern during the teens and 20's, when city after city exploded in the worst racial conflicts that the country would ever see. Fear of black independence and self-determination took a Freudian form: rape hysteria. In one town after another, racial violence was sparked by rumors that a Negro had harmed a white woman. This happened in Washington; Omaha, Neb.; Kansas City, Kan.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Longview, Tex.; and Rosewood, Fla.
Rape hysteria touched down in Tulsa on the morning of Monday, May 30, at the Drexel Building on Main Street. The protagonists were a Negro shoe-shiner named Dick Rowland and a white elevator operator named Sarah Page. The Drexel Building was the only one in the vicinity that allowed Rowland and his co-workers to use its bathrooms. That morning, Rowland rode up with Page, used the bathroom and came down again as he did almost every day. When the elevator car reached the lobby, people allegedly heard Page scream and saw Rowland run from the scene. No Negro in his right mind, of course, would attack a random white woman in a public elevator, in a public building, at the height of rush hour in the busiest city in the state. Later, Rowland was acquitted when Page refused to press charges. Articles in the Negro press maintained that Rowland and Page were romantically involved.
But all that was yet to come when Rowland was arrested and taken to a jail cell atop the Tulsa County Courthouse. The Tribune had been raging for weeks against Greenwood -- which it regularly called "Niggertown" and blamed for all of the city's vice and troubles. Seizing on the Rowland affair, the editors published a front-page article and an editorial that bore the headline "To Lynch Negro Tonight," essentially encouraging a lynching. (Both articles were removed from the paper's archives and presumably destroyed before The Tribune went to microfilm. The riot commission continues to search for clippings or copies.) On the evening of May 31, a white mob showed up at the courthouse in search of Rowland. As though on cue, a group of black men marched in from Greenwood to protect Rowland. The two camps exchanged words, then shots, and several men fell dead. Outgunned, the black force retreated north, across the railroad tracks into Greenwood.
Back downtown, the destruction of Greenwood was all but assured when the Tulsa police deputized perhaps hundreds from the lynch mob and, according to court records from the time, instructed them to, in effect, "go out and kill you some damn niggers."
The mob moved to the tracks that separated white Tulsa from Greenwood and began to close in on Greenwood Avenue. During the initial hours, snipers held off the white invaders from the windows overlooking the tracks. But the skirmishing continued through the night, and at dawn the snipers fell back in the face of ever-growing numbers.
Otis Clark, now 96, was eager to defend Greenwood that morning. Clark, then 18, went toward the gunfire and arrived at the Jackson Funeral Home just off Greenwood Avenue, where other blacks had gathered. White snipers had climbed into the old mill across the tracks, which offered an unobstructed view of the funeral home and its garage, where Clark says an ambulance was parked. "While the driver was trying to unlock the door to get the ambulance," Clark recalls, "they shot out of that mill and hit the boy on the hand while he was unlocking the door, and blood shot out his hand . . . and he dropped the keys and whatnot and we ran back to the back part of the funeral home by the dead folks."
Perhaps as many as 10,000 whites surged across the tracks into Greenwood. The commission has found the daughter of a waitress who recalled running into the street to sweep up a child being fired on from a passing airplane. A woman named Mary E. Jones Parrish mentions the plane strafings and the machine-gun fire in her memoir "Events of the Tulsa Disaster," published soon after the event: "There was a great shadow in the sky and, upon a second look, we discerned that this cloud was caused by fast-approaching aeroplanes. . . . The enemy had organized in the night and was invading our district, the same as the Germans invaded France and Belgium." Parrish watched for a long time, frozen with fear, but eventually swept up her young daughter and ran through machine-gun fire to safety. The oral tradition of Greenwood had many variations on this theme. Yet another mother is said to have strapped her baby to her back and escaped Greenwood by crawling through the storm drains.
As the morning wore on, a wall of fire worked its way across Greenwood, destroying everything in its path. The mob burst into one house after another, sometimes killing the occupants outright, often looting the house and setting it afire from within, in the manner of the pogroms that were carried out against the Jews in Eastern Europe.
Among those who survived is 83-year-old George Monroe, a black survivor located by the riot commission. Monroe was 5 at the time and at home with his mother and three siblings. "We saw coming up the walk in front of the house four men with torches in their hands," he told the riot commission. "These torches were burning. When my mother saw them coming, she says, 'You get up under the bed, get up under the bed.' . . . All four of us got up under the bed. I was the last one and my sister grabbed me and pulled me under there, and while I was under the bed, one of the guys coming past the bed stepped on my finger and I was about to scream. My sister put her hand over my mouth so I couldn't be heard. . . . The men set the curtains on fire, and as a result that's how our house started to burning."
The most traumatic story comes from Elwood Lett, who died recently at the age of 82. Five white men came to his family's house but surprised them by allowing the grandfather to place his daughter and two grandchildren into a wagon so that they could leave town. "I was happy to know they didn't shoot him or kill him there at the house," Lett recalled. "He's thinking, 'They're pretty nice people by letting us get in the wagon and go on about our business.' . . . We hadn't got to the town of Sperry before this white guy asked, 'Where in the hell you going?' -- using the 'N' word. My grandfather said, 'We're heading out, we're going out of town.' And he said, 'Not this day you're not going out of town.' Bam! . . . And he just tumbled. My mother let out a scream: 'Oh, you have killed my father, you've killed him,' and I thought he was going to do the same thing to my mother."
As the burning continued unabated, deputies who had been called to defend some of the finest houses in Greenwood -- houses owned by Smitherman, A.C. Jackson and others -- doused the properties with kerosene and watched them burn. By the time the Oklahoma National Guard marched into Greenwood, in the late morning of June 1, virtually all of black Tulsa had gone up in smoke and ash. About 1,200 buildings were burned or looted or both. For months afterward, black Tulsans would encounter white people on the streets wearing familiar clothing and jewelry looted from black homes.
The dead fell so thick in the streets that the National Guard was diverted from quelling the disturbance by the task of piling corpses onto wagons and trucks. The city fathers played down the horror and placed the death toll at an implausible 35. But based on new interviews and newly discovered records, the riot commission's historian, Scott Ellsworth, is convinced that as many as 300 were killed, about 90 percent of them black.
Greenwood was physically wiped out. But in the long run, the loss of leadership and spiritual vitality proved more devastating. Stradford and Smitherman were unfairly indicted for the riot and fled the city. Jackson, the surgeon, was shot while trying to surrender and bled to death. Gurley, the developer, went missing soon after the riot.
Its offices razed by fire, Franklin's law firm set up in a tent overlooking the tracks and prepared for the legal onslaught that was soon to come. The city told the outside world that it would provide a generous rebuilding fund -- and actively discouraged money-raising efforts that had begun all across the country. But the city fund never materialized. In fact, the mayor and the city commission did everything they could to ensure that Greenwood was never rebuilt. The ashes were scarcely cooled before the city passed an ordinance that forbade the building of anything but "fireproof" structures -- a law, expensive to comply with, that would have kept Greenwood a vacant lot had not Franklin and his colleagues defeated the ordinance in court. Black Tulsans filed a total of nearly 200 damage claims, but the insurance companies declined to pay any of them because of a riot-exclusion clause in the policies, and the city refused any claims as well.
In the years after the riot, survivors in Greenwood bragged that they had "won" the shooting war, killing more white people than the white community or The Tulsa Tribune cared to admit. But the shouts of victory faded as survivors grew older and more vulnerable. Fearful that speaking evil would summon it to life, most black Tulsans banned the riot from conversation and no longer spoke of it to young people and newcomers. As Ross put it years later, "Black folks lived with the fear that the whites who had come once might come again."
The conspiracy of silence was locked down tight by the time Ross was born in Greenwood in 1941. He was 15 and a sophomore at Greenwood's Booker T. Washington High School before he learned how the streets that seemed so lively and substantial to him had once been burned to the ground. The news came from a teacher, W.D. Williams, who had watched the early stages of the invasion from his family's apartment on Greenwood Avenue -- and seen his family's real estate holdings reduced to ruins.
When Williams revealed this in class, Ross leapt to his feet. "I thought he was lying," Ross recalls "I challenged him almost with my finger in his face -- something that got you kicked out of school in those days. I thought my community was a proud community that would never have let whites get away with burning us down." But Williams settled the matter with a collection of photographs showing scenes from the riot, including corpses with arms and legs burned away and wicker coffins stacked on the backs of trucks, being borne away to anonymous graves.
Anger at this discovery became the driving force of Ross's life. In his quest to understand and expose the riot, he dragged the city as a whole along with him. This history propelled him into journalism, where, in 1971, he joined with some friends to create a magazine in Tulsa. On the 50th anniversary of the riot, the editors of the magazine, Oklahoma Impact, were casting about for something spectacular when an article called "Profile of a Race Riot" came across his desk. A young white editor named Larry Silvey had assigned it for Tulsa, the Chamber of Commerce magazine, and was about to send it to press when officials at the chamber killed it. Silvey's bosses at the chamber argued that the article was "possibly inflammatory." But Silvey has other suspicions. "I didn't think about this back then," he said recently, "but the men who controlled the Chamber of Commerce were in their 70's in 1971. Which meant that they had been in their 20's during the riot." Given that thousands of young men in the city were in the streets at the time, Silvey said, "it is likely that these men had something to hide."
The article was written by a white amateur historian and radio host, Ed Wheeler, who had learned a great deal about Oklahoma history for his popular radio show, which dramatized historical events -- including episodes based on African-American history. Black Tulsans agreed to meet him and discuss the riot -- but only at night, in their churches, accompanied by their ministers.
On the white side of town, Wheeler had gotten interviews with people who had a great deal to hide. Among them were several former Ku Klux Klansmen, whom Wheeler had tracked through grandsons and great-nephews he knew from his weekend training with the Oklahoma National Guard. The K.K.K. had essentially acted as an execution squad and had crisscrossed the burning streets for the express purpose of murdering black men.
When it became known that Wheeler was moving forward with the article, he began to be harassed by telephone, both at home and at work. One afternoon in downtown Tulsa, a man in overalls tapped Wheeler on the shoulder, whispered, "You'll be sorry if you publish that story," and walked away.
In the spring of 1971, his article nearly finished, Wheeler discovered a message scrawled in soap across the windshield of his blue Ford sedan: "Best Look Under Your Hood From Now On."
After Tulsa magazine rejected the article, Wheeler took "Profile of a Race Riot" to The Tulsa World, where an editor told him that the paper would not touch the article with "an 11-foot pole." This was not surprising since the article trashed The World's sister paper, The Tribune, for the inflammatory articles that had stoked up the lynch mob in the first place. Once competitors, The World and The Tribune had since become business partners.
Shut out of white Tulsa, Wheeler's article found its way across the tracks and into Greenwood -- and into the hands of Ross. The issue of his magazine, Oklahoma Impact, with "Profile of a Race Riot" on the cover, sold out in Greenwood and was largely ignored on the white side of the tracks, at least publicly.
Between the two of them, Don Ross and Ed Wheeler cracked the wall of silence and made it possible to speak openly about the riot for the first time in 50 years. But Ross and Wheeler take opposite sides of the reparations issue, chilling what was once a warm relationship. Wheeler is opposed to reparations and believes that modern-day Tulsans are not responsible for the sins of their fathers. Ross, of course, believes that reparation is the one and only issue, and will think so until the day he dies.

HEADLINE: Cold War Without End

 BODY:
Weisberg miscasts the actual controversy about the McCarthy era. Contrary to the misleading cover, there has been no attempt in academia to resurrect the reputation of Joe McCarthy. Reading the article one would never know that what has taken place is a highly successful academic industry dedicated to rehabilitating American Communism, and it is this effort that has produced a great deal of debate. Just when the recent evidence has finally forced many to discard their old interpretations, Weisberg comes along and argues that the effort is ill advised, irrelevant and based not on a desire to ferret out the truth and uncover historical fact but on personal and psychological factors. 
 If the Communists became "powerless" in America by the 1950's, it is only because of the fierce struggle waged by anti-Communist liberals and conservatives, a struggle they waged at great cost and with little support. As for the Communists not being "murderous" or able to abridge "the freedoms of Americans in America," does Weisberg think they would have not become so had they been able to take political power?

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 12-19-99: The Economics Of Online Toy Shopping;
Funny Business

BYLINE: By Matt Richtel 

 BODY:
The holidays, it's often said, are all about giving -- so perhaps it's fitting that this season Internet retailers like eToys.com are practically giving money away. In the scramble to lure customers and establish themselves as brand names in the new millennium, they've been readily absorbing huge financial losses. To demonstrate this improbable calculus, we visited eToys, a large online toy retailer, and made a typical purchase. Then, with the assistance of an industry analyst, Mitchell P. Bartlett of Dain Rauscher Wessels (who supplied us with the estimates), we unwrapped our gifts, took them apart and saw how the pieces fit together.
 
THE GOODS
 
Bartlett bases his projections on the average order from eToys during the month of December, which he estimates at $70. So we picked a selection of toys to get as close to that figure as possible: the Smart Flyin' Buzz Lightyear doll from "Toy Story 2," which sells for $34.99; Easy-Bake Oven from Hasbro, which goes for $19.99; and "The Big Box" picture book, written by Toni Morrison and illustrated by Giselle Potter, which sells for $13.99. The book is sold at a 30 percent discount (to compete with retailers like Amazon), but the toy prices are closer to the manufacturers' list price; eToys aims to distinguish itself on the basis of selection and service, not on price alone. Our total cost: $68.97 (not including shipping, which is provided at cost).
 
THE EXPENSES
 
Wholesale costs $55.18
For now, eToys pays roughly 80 percent of the retail price. Over the next three to five years, Bartlett projects that eToys will cut wholesale costs to about 73 percent by negotiating with wholesalers for volume discounts, introducing more specialty goods (which tend to have larger profit margins than mass-market products) and selling more accessories like batteries (which customers buy along with toys, rather than going elsewhere for a lower price).
 
Customer
Acquisition costs $27.02
The monster expense for e-retailers. For the last quarter of this calendar year, Bartlett estimates that eToys devotes about $32 million to advertising, spending heavily on television, billboards and magazines. (The ads, based on the slogan "Where Great Ideas Come to You," are aimed at parents and are a good deal tamer than many e-business promotional efforts.) EToys also places ads on Web portals like Excite, Infoseek, Yahoo, Lycos and the Microsoft Network and has a $6 million annual agreement to advertise on America Online. So far, things look pretty good; according to Media Metrix, eToys netted 384,000 "unique visitors" -- that is, individual customers, not counting repeaters -- per day in the first week of December, the highest among Internet retailers that specialize in toys. Just behind them, however, was Toys "R" Us, which is spending relatively little to promote its Web site; it believes its existing brand name will be sufficient to lure customers there.
 
Warehousing and distribution costs $17.50
 
This represents the invisible manpower, machinery, warehouses and shipping facilities that connect the online world to the real world. One of eToys' main selling points is that it offers more than 100,000 different products -- and all of them have to be stored somewhere. EToys operates a 100,000-square-foot warehousing facility in California and contracts for two others. Upfront infrastructural expenses are exceptionally high for mass-market electronic retailers like eToys because they need to handle huge capacity right away. All its costly investments at gaining customers will mean little if the company can't process orders lickety-split.
 
Product-development expenses $7.84
This goes mostly to build and maintain eToys' Web site. The company's site is highly rated for the speed of its search engines and the simplicity of its design; it also offers many personalized options designed specifically to get customers to return, like gift registries and birthday-reminder e-mail services.
 
Administrative and general costs $3.40
This includes executive salaries, lawyers and accountants, as well as various office costs at the company's Santa Monica, Calif., headquarters. EToys currently employs about 500 people.
 
THE PROFITS
 
Total income (from the three toys) $68.97
Total expenses per order $110.94
Profit per order - $41.97
Bartlett projects that within five years, as the company builds a large base of loyal customers, eToys' cost of customer acquisition will soon drop from $27.02 per order to a tiny fraction of that. Other per-order costs will go down, too, if the company can maintain a high rate of growth. It all depends on whether eToys is able to build a brand name powerful enough to overcome its current competitors while fending off the next generation of start-ups. Will there be such a thing as customer loyalty on the Web? Will brands hold up? According to Janine Bousquette, a senior vice president for marketing at eToys, big losses are a necessity now because "there is a basic revolution in lifestyle happening and people are reassessing how they're doing things." When that period of assessment is over -- and eToys has millions of loyal customers -- the company is projected to return a pretax profit of about $9 on that $70 holiday-season order.

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Film Director And a Novelist Of Like Minds

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
SCOTT HICKS was in China in 1995, an itinerant filmmaker shooting a documentary, when he got a message from his wife back in Australia that as relayed by the Chinese hotel clerk, "C.A.M. had called." Mr. Hicks couldn't figure out what that could possibly mean. C.A.M.? Who was C.A.M.? And why were they calling? Finally, he got a line through to Australia. No, not C.A.M., he was told, C.A.A.
"Oh, C.A.A!" Mr. Hicks remembers thinking, the Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood's power brokers. "Even I knew who they were," Mr. Hicks said. "I read Premiere magazine." 
 Mr. Hicks, then still a largely unknown documentarian and filmmaker based in faraway Adelaide, Australia, was in a kind of wonderful middle ground in his career, after he had completed his first theatrical film, "Shine," but before it had turned into a worldwide box office smash and Academy Award nominee. He returned C.A.A.'s call and got an agent on the phone. Well, well, he was asked, what kind of project might he be interested in doing next? "I said the first thing that popped into my head," Mr. Hicks said. "I said that I had just read this fabulous book called 'Snow Falling on Cedars.' " C.A.A. was delighted. The agency, he was told, had arranged a deal for one of its screenwriters, Ron Bass, to write an adaptation of the novel, by David Guterson.
Then "Shine" opened, Mr. Hicks was no longer a little-known chap from Adelaide, and everyone was trying to pitch him with ideas for what might be his second film. He flirted with dozens of projects but "Cedars," he said, was always in the back of his mind.
"Then, one day, out of the blue, I got a fax from David Guterson," Mr. Hicks remembered. "He said he had just seen 'Shine' and wondered if I had ever heard of his novel."
The relationship between an author, especially the author of a highly regarded literary novel like "Snow Falling on Cedars," and a director, especially a director with the kind of meticulous seriousness that produced "Shine," can often be a querulous one. But when there is a meeting of the minds, as there appears to have been in the case of "Snow Falling on Cedars" (which opens Wednesday), the results can be a kind of creative rapture.
"I consulted with Scott exhaustively," said Mr. Guterson. "Every moment in the screenplay, every line of dialogue, was subject to lengthy discussion and work that we did together."
It began, Mr. Hicks said, with a trip he made to Seattle to meet the author and get him to conduct a tour of the offshore islands that form the backdrop of the story -- about a young, embittered World War II veteran caught up in a murder trial involving the husband of a Japanese-American woman he had once loved. Mr. Guterson lives in the area, on Bainbridge Island.
"I was pleasantly surprised," Mr. Hicks said. "David was not the sort of melancholy type I thought he might be. He turned out to have a wicked sense of humor. We just connected as people, instantly." More important, Mr. Hicks said, the two came to realize that they had something in common. Both were creative artists who had been laboring away in semi-obscurity for many years who had recently and quite suddenly had a huge rush of success. "We were two men in early middle age who had worked quietly for a long time on their own little project that had suddenly exploded," he said.
"Snow Falling on Cedars" is a complex story that spreads across many years and while it is, at heart, a love story, it also contains elements of epic historical importance, like the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in detention camps during World War II. And there are three main plot threads, Mr. Hicks said: a murder mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife) and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their community.
The first thing the two men did, Mr. Guterson said, was discuss whether they wanted to make changes in the first draft of the script, by Mr. Bass.
"In the first draft, there was a considerable amount of voice-overs, which was Ron's attempt to bring the voice of the narrator into the film," Mr. Guterson said. "Scott and I were of like mind about that, which was let's try to tell this story without any abstraction or explanation, without any voice-over telling us what it all means, what to think and feel about it. Let's let the images do the work."
Mr. Guterson went with Mr. Hicks to Montana, where the director was to meet with Bob Richardson, the cinematographer, who was then filming "The Horse Whisperer" with Robert Redford. Mr. Richardson lent them the use of a mountain cabin where they hunkered down to work on a new draft of the screenplay.
"Scott is incredibly meticulous," Mr. Guterson said. "I've never met anybody with that kind of energy. I was the author of the book and you'd think I would be the one pushing, but we spent a few days together in a small cabin in Montana working from dawn to dusk, at Scott's insistence." Mr. Guterson said he had had dreams of taking a little time to enjoy the Montana wilderness, but the director had other ideas. "We started working when the sun came up and finally, late at night, he'd say, O.K., let's go to bed. Then, in the wee hours of the morning, I'd hear a knock on my door and Scott's voice saying, 'All right, let's get back to work.' And then he'd tell me about some ideas he'd had during the night. During the night! I don't know about him, but I was sleeping."
During these long hours, the author said, Mr. Hicks would describe for him, shot by shot, how the film would look. "Scott has this three-ring binder, the thing is huge," Mr. Guterson said. "Every single moment in the screenplay is in it, each with its own footnote and bibliography, with drawings, comments, inputs from various people, research he's done. He just keeps building that thing over time, page by page, note by note. He dreams the film, over and over again."
The trick, Mr. Hicks said, was to convey a great deal of information as economically as possible without burying the audience in exposition and without draining the emotion from the story. "I find in movies the plot is the Devil," Mr. Hicks said. At the center of the novel is a series of mysteries. How did the fisherman die? Why is Ishmael so bitter? What happened between him and his former Japanese-American lover? The plot needed to become "a gradual revealing of the truth," Mr. Hicks said.
As for the rhythm of the movie, Mr. Hicks said he wanted it to slowly build to moments of intense emotion and then explode. "My idea was to build a kind of dam of emotion and release it when I was ready to release it," he said.
At various key points in the story, Mr. Hicks would let the music swell and the film zoom back and forth in time, intercutting shots from Ishmael's youth, from his adolescence, from the war, from the "present day" in which the murder trial was taking place (the late 1940's). "The climax of the story is the letter-reading scene," he said, referring to a scene toward the end of the film when Ishmael, wounded in the war, reads a letter that resolves many of the plot's mysteries. "As he is reading the letter, we are cutting between five different time frames," he said. "None of this was happenstance or decided in the editing room. It was all indicated in the screenplay. I wanted to move back and forth in time, in the way that your memory really works."
Once these mysteries are revealed, Mr. Hicks said, the story can have its catharsis, can come to a kind of emotional resolution in the denouement of the murder trial.
"Once the screenplay was finished, my role became that of the happy tourist," Mr. Guterson said. (The screenplay in the finished film is credited to both Mr. Bass and Mr. Hicks.) "I came to the set, brought my family to the set. I'd stand there with my hands in my pockets and stare at the monitors, make a few comments that had absolutely no decision-making authority attached to them, then waltz off to lunch. It was great fun."
Mr. Hicks finished shooting the film -- which stars Ethan Hawke as Ishmael, Youki Kudoh as his haunted love and Max von Sydow as the aged lawyer who defends the accused fisherman -- in 1998 and there was, initially, some idea of releasing it a year ago. But it really wasn't ready, Mr. Hicks said, so he spent the next several months tinkering. "With me, if there isn't a deadline, things sort of trickle on, and so they trickled on for a while."
Still, Mr. Hicks thought the film was in good enough shape to show it to a few people, and he invited Mr. Guterson to visit him at the Skywalker Ranch in northern California, where Mr. Hicks worked on the film's audio mix. "I went down there and I saw it, sitting in this vast, cavernous, otherwise empty theater," Mr. Guterson said. "Having worked with Scott so hard through the whole process, I didn't have any doubt it was going to be a great film. I didn't go in with any apprehension at all. But it was an odd experience, to see actors who were attempting to become these characters, who had been born in my mind and were now taking human shape. It was kind of unsettling."
Mr. Hicks, who had been a little nervous about the author's reaction to the film, waited to hear Mr. Guterson's reaction.
"He was just ecstatic," Mr. Hicks said, grinning happily. "He told me, 'There is not one thing about the movie that could be any better.' "

Taxiing to a Takeoff: The Airpower Museum

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE

 BODY:
A COUPLE of weekends ago a B-17, the World War II bomber known as the Flying Fortress, caused a stir when it flew into Republic Airport here from a Belmar, N.J., airfield.
Now sitting in a hangar on New Highway at Republic Airport's easterly boundary, the bomber and the two other planes of its era sitting beside it will become part of the American Airpower Museum, which was dedicated here on Dec. 7, the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The museum, which will also feature a restored World War II control tower, is scheduled to open in mid-January. 
 "I think that people should be reminded of where they've been, and one way of doing that is to bring the past to life with living history," said Jeffrey M. Clyman, the museum's president. "My particular aspect of that is aviation, in our case airplanes that fly."
The museum, set up as a nonprofit foundation, had been operating in a small hangar in Belmar. But because of Belmar's remote location in Monmouth County, the museum attracted too few visitors, Mr. Clyman said. "So we began searching for a historic location that would give more credibility to the living history concept," he continued. "And I focused on Republic, which will permit the operation of the airplanes for demonstrations in a historic setting."
As the American Airpower Museum gets ready to open, construction of a second museum, this one occupying a restored 1928 double hangar on a portion of what once was Mitchel Air Field in Nassau County, is nearing completion.
Called the Cradle of Aviation Museum, it will include a visitors' center and a 300-seat Imax theater. Scheduled to open next fall, the complex is the first phase of the Museums at Mitchel Center. The second phase, which will also rise on 15 acres that are county-owned or leased from the adjoining Nassau County Community College, will include three museums devoted to children, science and technology and firefighters.
Mitchel Field was one of the country's largest and most important military air bases until it closed in 1961, said Edward J. Smits, the Nassau County historian and planning coordinator for the Museums at Mitchel Center. Republic Airport was the site of a plant that rolled out thousands of fighter planes used in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. The 1.8 million-square-foot aircraft manufacturing plant closed in 1988. The 522-acre airport is now owned by New York State. The American Airpower Museum will rent space from the Long Island Jetcenter, one of the airport's two aviation service companies.
The museum has received a $250,000 grant from the New York State Economic Development Corporation for seed money. At first, it was going to build a new hangar on three of the 27 acres of the Jetcenter property. But William J. McShane, Jetcenter's president, said it made more sense to have the museum move into an existing hangar because of the building's historic associations.
Restoring the former five-story control tower, which until recently had been used for offices, will cost up to $50,000. Much of the work is being done by volunteers, said Mr. Clyman, the museum's president.
A floor of the control tower, which will resemble a World War II officers' club, will serve as an orientation room for visitors. The top floor of the tower will be furnished with radio and radar equipment of World War II vintage, as well as a modern radio system so that visitors can tune in to the Republic Airport operations.
A World War II military truck will be used to ferry visitors between the hangar and the control tower. A military version of a DC-3 cargo plane will be used for short flights to give visitors the experience of "what it was like to fly in one of these machines," Mr. Clyman said. For spectators there will be fly-bys or demonstrations of planes just taxiing along the runway. Up to seven aircraft are to be on exhibit.
Mr. Clyman, who expects his museum to draw up to 40,000 visitors a year, owns a sports apparel manufacturing company in Long Island City, Queens. He and other volunteers pilot the aircraft, which come from a variety of sources.
The B-17 is being leased by the museum from a private owner. A B-25 bomber that Mr. Clyman has donated to the museum is already in the museum hangar, along with the B-17 and a Grumman Avenger. The B-25 was once the personal transport for Hap Arnold, commanding general of the Army Air Forces during World War II. "I found it rotting away at an Addison, Tex., airport," Mr. Clyman said.
Another plane, an AT-6 trainer, was acquired by him from the Spanish Air Force. A Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was acquired from another museum. All planes at the museum will be airworthy.
I LOVE their long-term vision in remembering and memorializing what happened in World War II," said Hugh D. Jones, the director of Republic Airport. Neither the upcoming Cradle of Aviation Museum, nor the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, afloat off 46th Street in Manhattan, have planes that fly, he said. "So I see this museum here, where people can watch the planes taxi out and even fly, as a niche that is complementary to everything else that is going on. And Republic Airport because of the demographics and population base is the right place for it to be."
The Cradle of Aviation Museum, at the former Mitchel Air Field, has been 22 years in the making, with a cadre of volunteers, mostly retired pilots, engineers and others involved in aviation restoring the 65 aircraft and spacecraft to be displayed. The collection, valued at almost $40 million, is being donated or loaned to the museum by private owners and the military. It includes aircraft as old as the 1909 French-built Bleriot, the first plane to fly across the English Channel and, in 1911, the first plane to inaugurate airmail service in the United States, which began on Long Island. It also includes one of only three Lunar Modules on Earth.
Other exhibits include a 1918 Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) once owned by Lindbergh and used by him for barnstorming, and a 1928 Ryan Brougham, one of two surviving sister ships of the "Spirit of St. Louis."
"This is one of the world's greatest air and space collections," said Mr. Smits, the museums' plannng coordinator. Phase One will cost about $89.5 million, including the value of the exhibits, Mr. Smits said. The county accounted for $39 million and the rest has been raised through private donations.
The museum will have a wall listing those involved in any way with Long Island aviation, including private plane pilots and aircraft industry workers, now and in the past. Each name will require a $125 donation. The wall can hold 20,000 names.
The Cradle of Aviation will have about 40,000 square feet of exhibition space. Visitors to the museum, which was designed by Wiedersum Associates of Hauppauge, will enter through a soaring 65,000-square-foot all-glass building that is close to completion. The building, which leads to both the Imax theater and the exhibit areas, will contain a 250-seat restaurant.
"We were trying to create a building that would be part of the history of flight, and which gives the feeling of flying in space with the glass facade bringing outside and inside together," said George A. Ferman, the Wiedersum principal in charge of the Cradle of Aviation project.
The museum is expected to draw as many as half a million visitors a year, said Mr. Smits.
Promoters of the two Long Island museums say they envision not only a link between them, but also links to the Intrepid in Manhattan and the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome in upstate New York, which features World War I aircraft, thus making the state a destination point for those interested in aviation history. They also hope to kindle an interest in young people, said Mr. Jones, the Republic Airport manager.
"We have a Republic Airport Historical Society whose members are constantly complaining that they are getting older and none of the young people seem to have the time or the inclination to join and help in their volunteer programs," he said. "But when you have a Grumman Avenger, a B-25 or a B-17 and all sorts of other planes sitting here, I think you will get young people to say, 'Now I understand what they've been talking about.' "

Bankrupt Jersey City Co-op Returns to Stability

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WE were hanging by a thread and now we have a cable to hold on to," said Howard LaMell, a board officer of Metropolis Towers, a 770-unit limited equity co-op apartment complex in Jersey City that recently emerged from bankruptcy and is about to enter the next stage of its revival.
Under a bankruptcy reorganization plan that became effective in May, the 21-story twin-tower complex was restructured as a free-market co-op, allowing its shareholders to sell their units at a profit. Previously, they could only sell a unit for what they paid for it, plus their contributions to the building's underlying mortgage. 
 This month Metrovest GPNJ L.L.C. -- an affiliate of Metrovest Equities, a real estate services company in Astoria, Queens -- will take over 350 apartments that owners walked away from in the last decade when conditions progressively worsened.
Metrovest GPNJ will also take over the lease for the 40,000-square-foot retail plaza that links the two buildings. The development, formerly known as Gregory Park, is on eight acres bounded by Marin Boulevard, Montgomery and Warren Streets and Christopher Columbus Drive, not far from the city's reviving Hudson River waterfront.
In exchange for the units, Metrovest has a commitment from a bank to refinance its underlying mortgage and restore the co-op to financial health. In July the company started to improve the buildings, including renovating its studio- to two-bedroom units, with 520 to 930 square feet on average, and in September it began leasing the 180 vacant apartments. The remaining 170 of the 350 apartments that had been abandoned by their owners are now rented.
As part of the plan the company will pay for most of the more than $10 million in planned improvements and the Metropolis Towers Apartment Corporation will contribute $1 million that it collected in back maintenance payments over the last year. As a result monthly maintenance fees will remain relatively stable.
"The complex is viable for the first time in its history," said Mr. LaMell, who is the outgoing secretary of the co-op board.
Metrovest said it also plans to switch to selling the units in the future. That prospect is helped by signs that the co-op market, hard hit by the real estate recession when values fell by as much as 50 percent, has rebounded.
"Co-ops are in concert with the rest of the market and values are back to where they were at the '86 peak, at least in Fort Lee," said Charles Oppler, a partner at Oppler-Ketive Realtors in Fort Lee, which has about 4,500 of the state's estimated 25,000 co-op apartments, according to Mr. Oppler's office.
Values have also risen in the state's north and central communities, said Marc Solomon, a partner in the Solomon Organization of Mountainside, which owns or manages buildings in 13 developments with 4,500 co-op unitsin that part of New Jersey. He said at six of his company's projects where unsold units are available nearly 200 were sold this year, the highest number since 1989, and prices have risen. For example, at his company's 702-unit Mountain Club in Parsippany, a one-bedroom that sold for $89,900 in 1988 and dropped to a low of $39,900 in 1994 is now selling for $74,900.
Mr. Solomon said factors stoking the activity include a lack of reasonably priced housing in good locations, a strong economy and rising rents.
Those involved in Metropolis Towers say the tight rental market helps the co-op, as does its location -- close to a PATH station and the riverfront, where rental towers continue to sprout. The activity is now spreading inland with a rental building rising on Montgomery Street, across from Metropolis Towers.
Those factors were part of Metrovest's decision to get involved in the project, said George Filopoulos, its president. "Given its size and the number of unsold apartments we felt the complex had potential," he said, noting that the monthly maintenance fees are also high enough to cover operating expenses.
Allen M. Turek, a lawyer at the Manhattan law firm of Hartman & Craven who represents the co-op corporation, added: "The co-op, once a liability, is now an asset."
BUT getting to this point has not been easy for the co-op, which was burdened with problems almost from the time of its tenant-sponsored conversion in 1986. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which took back the complex through foreclosure when the original developer defaulted, sold the property to the tenants and provided the underlying mortgage. Tenants bought their units for under $10,000.
Then the recession hit and the co-op faced some of the same financial woes that affected many developer-sponsored conversions in the state, where the co-op form of ownership has struggled to gain acceptance. Those woes included defaults on loans by sponsors, nonpayment of monthly maintenance by shareholders and foreclosures by lenders.
New Jersey did not see the same level of co-op defaults as in New York City, and industry analysts agree that the worst problems are over. How many buildings are still under financial strain is unclear because the state does not monitor them.
The key problems at Metropolis Towers, said Mr. Turek, were that nearly half of the shareholders did not pay their maintenance fees and the co-op's structure did not allow it to collect those payments effectively. Also, the shareholders were undermined by a "lack of leadership and unity," he said.
Over time the co-op stopped making repairs and eventually 350 of the 770 shareholders walked away, only to be replaced by tenants, many of whom stopped paying rent. With its monthly income cut in half to about $250,000, the co-op defaulted on its $10 million mortgage, ultimately owing nearly $25 million, including accrued interest.
In June 1998, HUD, after several unsuccessful attempts to save the co-op, which defaulted on its mortgage in 1989, scheduled a foreclosure auction for August. Since shareholders in co-ops must keep up payments on an underlying mortgage on their building as well as on their monthly charges, a foreclosure would have meant that the apartment owners would have lost their investments.
Days before the auction, the co-op, which by then was negotiating with Metrovest, filed for bankruptcy to stay the foreclosure, said Mr. Turek. But HUD argued in United States Court that a stay could not prevent a foreclosure sale. Ultimately, Mr. Turek said, the matter was settled by the current reorganization plan, which 90 percent of the unit owners approved.
Under it HUD agreed to lower the debt $16.35 million. A new $20 million mortgage loan Metrovest negotiated with Dime Savings Bank, which it is to close on this month, will be used to pay off the old mortgage and pay for some capital improvements.
To convert Metropolis Towers to a free-market co-op the shares were reallocated based on the location and size of the units, some of which had been combined. While that led to an adjustment in monthly maintenance fees -- with some of the existing 420 unit owners paying more and others paying less -- the overall amount generated from the fees stayed the same, at $442,000 a month, or a range of $445 to $800 a unit.
Mr. Turek said that the co-op's bylaws had been amended to give it "the ability to enforce its rights against shareholders who do not pay their maintenance, and help it avoid past mistakes."
Mr. Filopoulos said that by trimming operating expenses, rebuilding value and "with everyone paying maintenance fees, the building can operate with a surplus."
Renovations at Metropolis Towers, now 70 percent complete, include installing new elevators and windows as well as giving the 180 vacant apartments new kitchens and baths. In the three months since leasing began, 100 of the units have been rented for $975 to $2,000 a month including utilities, which Mr. Filopoulos said was 30 percent lower on average than riverfront rentals. The complex has such amenities as parking and views of downtown Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.
While the HUD financing was in place the units were not governed by Jersey City's rent regulations, but rents were low and had not been raised since 1991. Now that the rents on the unoccupied units have been raised to market levels they will be subject to yearly regulated increases. In addition, Metrovest said it also intends to do some renovation on occupied units and raise their rents after their leases expire.
For example, Mr. Filopoulos said, the rent on a typical studio will go from $540 to $900.
Though such a move is expected to be challenged by existing tenants, Mr. Turek said the city supported the increase.
Mr. Filopoulos said he had put off selling the units "until the renovations are complete and the building is stabilized." The goal is to get full-market value for the units, he added, estimating that sales could begin by the spring of 2001.
While encouraged by the recent progress Mr. LaMell, the outgoing co-op board secretary, said he knew there were challenges ahead. "We have a good chance to build equity, but time will tell," he said. "We must be alert to safeguard the foundation we have built and continue on a path of recovery."

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER;
A 'Carol' Updated For Today

BYLINE: By DAVID BOUCHIER; E-mail address: liorder@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HEADING for dinner in Port Jefferson a couple of weeks ago, we walked into the annual Dickens Festival. The sidewalks were full of costumed characters: chimney sweeps, bobbies, ragged urchins, characters with names like Thomas Beg Alot, an Lord Dudley Butterworth, and, of course, Ebenezer Scrooge. There was a pretty Dickens stage set, the sound of bells and carols was in the air, there were candles in the windows, and even some real reindeer to be petted and photographed.
Charles Dickens has a lot to answer for. He more or less invented the modern Christmas, with all its excesses. When the Puritans were in charge, Christmas festivities were banned, along with plum puddings. In Puritan New England, Christmas was just a regular working day. Even up to the 1840's, Christmas was not much more than a date on the church calendar. 
 Then along came Dickens and his book "A Christmas Carol," and Christmas was never the same again.
Now Christmas is forever burdened with the ambiguous figure of Ebenezer Scrooge, the miser who was scared into becoming a kind of Father Christmas figure himself.
And it was Scrooge, that made me think that it was time for a change. We need a new moral story for our time. Therefore, in the helpful spirit of the season, I offer this updated, brand new version of Dickens's classic.
Consider the opening words of "A Christmas Carol."
"Marley was dead..."
This won't do for a modern story. We can't have elderly businessmen dying in the late 20th century, not with all the benefits of scientific medicine, and the prospect of a long retirement beside a golf course in the earthly paradise of Florida.
No, in my story Marley was on his way back to Palm Beach, after doing some Christmas shopping in New York. He took a trip to Long Island to see his old business partner Scrooge, whom he found relaxing in his huge house in Glen Cove, listening to his home theater system and sipping single malt Scotch whiskey.
"It won't do, you know, Ebenezer," said Marley, "All this high living, spending money like water. Why, I bet you've even been giving money away to charity you sentimental old fool, just because it's Christmas."
Scrooge laughed. "Of course," he said, "Spread a little happiness, that's my motto. After all, you can't take it with you. Anyway, it's all on credit. Have a drink"
"Credit!" shouted Marley. "That was always your weakness. When I get back to Palm Beach, I will send three spirits to haunt your dreams, and teach you the wisdom of financial planning."
That night the first spirit came, the Ghost of Christmas Past. He took Scrooge back to the Christmases of his miserable childhood. No heat, no television, no video games, no entertainment at all, except singing out-of-tune carols around the out-of-tune piano, homemade decorations, not much food and very few presents. Scrooge was depressed.
"I'd forgotten how awful Christmas Past was," said Scrooge to himself, "What a terrible dream."
Next night the second ghost came, The Ghost of Christmas Present in the unmistakeable form of Donald Trump. He was much more fun. He took Scrooge on a tour of London, Paris and Las Vegas, where they watched people buying $4,000 Hermes handbags, $850 Mont Blanc pens, Armani suits, Gucci shoes and Hermes ties, and yet more people throwing away yet more money in casinos. Scrooge cheered up and started counting his credit cards.
On the third night came the third ghost, shrouded and dark.
"I am the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come," he said. "Do you know where the stock market closed on Friday night?"
"Yes, 17,429," said Scrooge. "Do you have any good tips?"
"Repent," said the ghost. "Buy bonds, Buy government securities, buy gold, pay off your debts, stop spending on yourself, stop giving it away. The end of the world is at hand."
And he took the skeptical Scrooge and showed him the horrors of Christmas Yet to Come -- the Dow Jones down below 4,000, last year's Armani suits visibly being worn on Wall Street, Scrooge's platinum credit cards all canceled, and his limited-edition Jaguar repossessed.
"Oh ghost," cried Scrooge, "Who art thou that shows me such terrible things. Show me no more."
The ghost threw back his hood and revealed the bespectacled face of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"God help us every one" cried Scrooge. "I will repent," and so he did. He gave up day trading, opened a low-interest savings account, moved into a small apartment, bought a Honda, turned the heat down to 68, and drank blended Scotch. When gift catalogs and credit card offers came in the mail, he cried "Bah, humbug!" and tore them up. Scrooge was a changed man.
The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come kept an eye on him for a while, and was satisfied. Indeed, the transformation of Scrooge was, as it was intended to be, a lesson to everyone. Four thousand-dollar handbags lay unsold in the stores, and people went back to wearing Timex instead of Rolex. The Dow Jones Index deflated, interest rates stayed down, the trade gap was reduced, and they all lived happily ever after.
Except for Scrooge, who always had the uneasy feeling that he had made the wrong choice.

HEADLINE: Companies Take the Clutter Out of the Office

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHO among us has not hopelessly shuffled through piles of paper, searching for an all-important document?
Paper clutter, a major office problem, is not only frustrating but also counterproductive, and the best way to deal with it is aggressively, said Celia Wakefield, whose business it is to move her clients from clutter and chaos to control and calm. 
 Ms. Wakefield, a professional organizer, works with both paper and people, helping clients to become more productive by gaining control over their papers, their projects and their time. She started Wakefield & Company in 1990 to fill a niche created by corporate downsizing.
She is among a number of similar businesses in the county, which were started in response to an increasing need to organize work space.
Louise Cristina, who started Organizing, Etc. by Louise Cristina in Mamaroneck 15 years ago, observed that the growing demand for home offices has substantially increased her business.
"I say I came out of the closet, because that's how I began," she said, "by organizing closets in clients houses. Now offices are primarily what I do. Either those in clients' homes or individual offices in offices."
Ms. Cristina, who teaches a course, "How to Organize Your Home, Office and Life" at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, charges clients between $50 and $75 an hour to set up an office. She said that most of her clients are "busy, successful people who don't have the time for such chores as setting up files and organizing space efficiently."
Ms. Cristina who has organized the offices of stockbrokers, dentists and retired executives, said her objective is to leave clients with a system that works easily, which she says is the mark of a good organizer.
Ms. Wakefield saw a need for new organizing techniques in corporations that were making do with fewer people working harder, and she also saw that the new breed of home entrepreneurs had the same needs.
"My goal is to help individuals and groups to improve efficiency and increase productivity," said Ms. Wakefield, who charges $80 an hour. "How do I do it? In a number of ways, such as time-management training, systems for filing, desk management, inventory -- all dealing with clutter control."
Ms. Wakefield calls herself a born organizer who as a child liked to keep lists and build systems into her life.
Eventually, Ms. Wakefield, who grew up in England, went to work for International Business Machines in London, where she met Victor Wakefield, an I.B.M. economist and statistician and the man she later married. When he took a temporary two-year assignment at I.B.M. World Trade Organization in New York, the couple came to America.
"That was 32 years ago, and we're still here, but now we're Americans," said Mr. Wakefield, who joined his wife's company after taking early retirement in 1988 from I.B.M. after 28 years.
The Wakefields share an office in their home in Chappaqua, where they have lived for 30 years.
Mr. Wakefield provides support for the company through research, by designing computer programs for clients to help them manage inventory and data and, he said, "as chief financial officer, I run the numbers tracking our growth and health."
That health, he added, is good. "We've always been in the black, with clients coming to us mainly by word-of-mouth referrals," he said. If the Wakefields help out their clients, "they don't need us any more," Mr. Wakefield said, "so we need a constant stream of new clients in the pipeline."
A surprising number of clients are working for Fortune 500 companies. "They are the executives who have been left behind after downsizing," Mr. Wakefield said. "Some are handling two jobs and yet they have no backup administrative staff available to them. Even secretaries are in a pool or nonexistent. They want to learn how to organize their offices for maximum efficiency."
The other group, the entrepreneurs with home offices, need much the same coaching.
A third group retains Ms. Wakefield for advice on managing employees and increasing their sales.
When Rolf Krauss, the owner of Graphics, a printing and copying shop that has been in Mount Kisco since 1977, wanted to get his employees more involved in the company, he called Ms. Wakefield.
"She spotted what was lacking -- communication -- and helped us with it," Mr. Krauss said. "And when I needed to hire a key employee, she helped me with the job description and the search. And the transition. Actually, she reorganized our staff so we work together more productively." And when Dr. Nancy Schiffman, an optometrist, found that the office paperwork she did at home was getting out of hand, she called Ms. Wakefield. "It was chaos," Dr. Schiffman said. "I work on a lot of claims at home, and I needed a filing system I could rely on. Celia set one up for me and helped me organize my papers properly, making it easier for me to get through the work. We're not finished yet, but already it's easier for me to get through the work."
How do you find a good organizer? Ask for references and ask questions, said Elizabeth Maffucci, who runs the Clutter Warrior in Tarrytown.
"Since it's a team effort between client and organizer, you have to have rapport," said Ms. Maffucci, who charges $50 an hour. "Many of my clients who own small businesses are buried under obsolete ledgers and records, and a large part of my job is convincing them to keep the taxable records and toss the others."
The demand for organizing home offices is such that Stephanie Schur of Space Organizers in White Plains said she could be busy seven days and seven nights a week. Instead, Ms. Schur has produced a video called "Secrets of a Professional Organizer," available from the Video Learning Library in Scottsdale, Ariz., for $19.95 at (800) 383-8811.
"There is so much paperwork generated by daily life, that everyone, not only people running businesses, needs an office today," Ms. Schur said. "Even one that is carved out of the corner of the kitchen, which is something I frequently do for clients."
Ms. Schur, who charges $65 an hour with a four-hour minimum for her services, also charges prospective clients $65 for an hourlong consultation.
Ms. Wakefield, who has taught time and management skills to students in the Westinghouse Science program at Byram Hills High School, is currently training students at the Women's Center at Westchester Community College in Valhalla how to work with mentors.
Yet, the Wakefields, who have helped many clients expand their businesses, are not applying the same strategy to their own.
"We deliberately keep our client list small," Ms. Wakefield said. "Balance between life and work is what we're after. If we want to take off and go to Maine for a long weekend, we do it."

HEADLINE: Skyscraper Museum/'Big Buildings';
Large Models of Accuracy

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
HOW to illustrate an exhibition on really big buildings? Start with a model that is no small structure itself: four towers up to seven feet tall on a landscaped base of about 125 square feet.
That is what Carol Willis did for "Big Buildings," the current show at the Skyscraper Museum, in the soaring former banking hall of 16 Wall Street, at Nassau Street. 
 The exhibition is rich in photographs, renderings and construction drawings, but nine architectural models really give it heft; appropriately enough, since the show concerns itself with large volumes.
Indeed, a model helped spark the show in the first place.
Ms. Willis, the founder and director of the museum, was offered the loan of a very large model of the World Financial Center at Battery Park City by Brookfield Financial Properties, owners of the full-sized buildings and of the plastic ones in which one inch equals eight feet.
As a scholar who views architectural form as an outgrowth of economic forces, Ms. Willis was already thinking about what she calls jumbo and super-jumbo structures -- buildings two to four times larger than the prevailing average for the period.
These categories include two World Financial towers, which qualify as jumbos with more than 2 million square feet of space each.
With theme and centerpiece in hand, Ms. Willis set out to explore the world's 70 largest tall buildings. (This being the Skyscraper Museum, the show excludes such horizontal land-grabbers as the Pentagon.)
She found that oversized buildings doubled in size every era -- 500,000 square feet for super-jumbos in the 1900's, 1 million square feet by the 1920's, 2 million by the 1950's, 4 million by the 1970's, when the World Trade Center was built.
The World Trade Center is represented by a wind-tunnel model that includes the towers, about three feet high, and much of the financial district. The point was to study how surrounding buildings would affect the force of the wind. It was lent by Leslie E. Robertson, the structural engineer for the project.
Easily the most exquisite model is a 51-inch version of 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, its aluminum curtain wall facade rendered with crystalline precision, its open windows revealing the structure within, including the core. It was made by Theodore Conrad and lent by Chase.
The World Financial Center model was built in the 1980's by Awad Models of Manhattan to help Olympia & York, the developer, promote the complex to prospective occupants.
George Awad, the model maker, said he worked closely with the buildings' architect, Cesar Pelli. The most challenging element, he said, was the thousands of mirrored windows.
It is not the largest model Mr. Awad has made. That distinction probably goes to the World Trade Center of Tokyo, which is a towering eight feet -- but not in the exhibition.
"Big Buildings" runs through Dec. 30. The show is open Tuesday through Friday, noon to 6 p.m. There is a suggested admission fee of $2. More information may be obtained by calling (212) 766-1324 or at www.skyscraper.org.

HEADLINE: State's Social Health Ranks High, but Not in All Areas

BYLINE: By MAURA CASEY 

 BODY:
A STUDY released last week by Fordham University that measures the social health of Connecticut found that life is improving for the majority of citizens, but becoming increasingly stressful for some young people and the working poor.
The report, "The Social State of Connecticut '99" and prepared by the university's Institute for Innovation in Social Policy in Tarrytown, N.Y., studied how Connecticut is faring in 11 social areas and found that the state is performing at its highest level in nine years. The study said the state is providing the most affordable housing and the highest average weekly wages in nearly 30 years. The state also recorded good marks in infant mortality and high school completion. 
 Peter Gioia, economist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, cited the booming economy and the subsequent demand for workers as major factors in rising pay levels. He also said that the jobs gained in the last several years have resulted in a more diverse economic base than Connecticut had before the recession. No longer do the defense and insurance industries dominate the state; now there are many different industries and businesses competing for workers.
"A lot of people are getting their first shot at a job," Mr. Gioia said. What's more, he said, the demand for workers won't go away. "We are going to face a shortage of workers for more than a decade."
But the state did not do as well in unemployment, teenage births and violent crime and ranked very poorly in areas such as child abuse, youth suicide and health care costs, all near their worst recorded levels. There was also a sizable gap between rich and poor, which the study found has never been greater.
Although this is its sixth annual report on Connecticut, the institute uses data going back to 1970 to measure the state's progress over nearly three decades. Dr. Marc Miringoff, director of the Fordham Institute and a coauthor of the study, said that analysis of almost every topic in the new report is based on data from 1997, the last year that statistics are available.
He said that the institute also commissioned a survey of state residents. The survey showed that, while most people feel good about their jobs, 50 percent feel overworked; 35 percent had difficulty paying their mortgage or their rent and nearly 20 percent didn't know where their next meal was coming from at some point during the year.
"That tells you something about an island of trouble in a sea of prosperity, and that the island is rather larger than we thought," Dr. Miringoff said. "I thought it was high that one out of five people didn't know where the next meal was coming from. That's kind of scary. There's pressure on people."
Dr. Miringoff said that when examining these social issues, one-year fluctuations are less important than overall trends over the course of several years. He said that, based on a total possible score of 100, Connecticut earned a social health index of 49 -- 4 points higher than last year and the highest score in the 1990's, but still a lower score than was assigned to any year from 1970 to 1988.
Many people were not surprised by the study, particularly as it measured difficulties faced by the working poor.
"This rising tide of economic prosperity isn't raising all boats," said Michelle Doucette Cunningham, public education director of the Connecticut Association for Human Services.
The study made apparent that, while the cost of buying a single-family house is the most affordable, based on the cost of homes and income levels, since 1970, the cost of rents are higher here than nearly anywhere else in the country. Thirty-nine percent of renters cannot afford fair-market rents for a two-bedroom apartment, the report said; to afford such an apartment, a full-time worker would have to make wages of $14.59 per hour.
"Housing is more affordable for the middle class, but the people who can't afford a down payment for a house are paying more in rent than they would for a mortgage," Ms. Cunningham said.
"Low middle-income people are bearing too much burden," said John Olsen, head of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We are still heavily dependent on high property taxes, which translates right into high rents. When you start to look at high mill rates in cities, that translates into pushing high costs onto the lowest level of citizens. Then we see four-acre zoning in some towns, which keeps out the poor people.
Others worried about the gap between the rich and the poor that the survey highlighted, showing a gap that is the widest it has ever been in Connecticut. The report said that Fairfield County's per capita income of $50,473 is more than double the $23,765 per capita income of Windham County residents'.
To Mr. Olsen, the gap highlights the higher burden of social services that the cities bear compared to suburbs and towns. "Exclusive communities don't want to bear their fair share of the responsibilities," he said. "They aren't even paying their fair share of taxes, because their taxes are so low the taxes are disproportionately higher in the cities."
Yet, given that the state's 1997 average weekly salary, at $551.73, was the highest ever recorded, does it really matter that the rich have gotten richer -- as long as everyone is better off?
Some said yes. "I think we need to worry about the income gap," said Shelly Geballe, president of Connecticut Voices for Children, a nonprofit education organization that focuses on children.
"We are in danger of perpetuating a permanent underclass," she said. "When you have that, the health of everyone suffers. When you are poor in a sea of enormous affluence, it's difficult emotionally as well as financially.
"The challenge Connecticut faces is the new economy. A person with a good mind and good training does well. But for kids who don't graduate from high school, the lack of an education is a death knell," she added, explaining that children of high-income parents are 21 times more likely to graduate from high school than offspring of low-income parents.
For the graduating class of 1997, the cumulative high school dropout rate stands at 15.7 percent, an improvement for the third year in a row and lower than any year since 1973. The cumulative rate is the dropout rate a class experiences over four years, as opposed to the dropout rate from just one year.
Mr. Gioia of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, agreed that education is critical, but said, "The wage gap is not a Connecticut phenomenon. It is nationwide and worldwide.
"The problem is that we still have citizens who drop out of high school who don't get training and don't get an education," he said. "These people are really at an extreme disadvantage in our work force right now."
Mr. Gioia disagreed with those who said that Connecticut has replaced the jobs lost during the recession of the early 1990's with poorly paying service jobs.
"The replacement of jobs has been in the service industry," he said, "One service industry is computer software. Another is financial services. They don't pay poorly. We didn't have casinos before the recession and didn't have enough retail stores. Some jobs are more basic. Some jobs, though, have been very high paying."
For evidence of families under stress, others pointed to the rate of suicide among young people -- 10.2 deaths per 100,000, lower than the national average but still 36 percent higher than it was in 1970. The report quoted a recent survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that more than one-fifth, 21.6 percent, of Connecticut high school students had seriously considered attempting suicide during the previous 12 months.
"That's a number that is just amazing," said state Sen. Toni N. Harp, cochairwoman of the Joint Committee on Public Health. "It is critically important that we address it."
She said the state's mental health system for children is inadequate and the role of drugs and alcohol plays a part in youth suicide. "We do very little in the way of prevention. We need to do that," she said. "We recognize in this state that we need systems for children, but not for adolescents. We need social support for kids."
Peter Shutheis, head of the Youth Service Bureau of the Norwich Department of Social Services, said adolescents are under a lot of stress.
"Substance abuse is a fairly high predictor of suicidal ideation," she said. "We're living in very accelerated and amplified times and you are seeing kids who are not well-connected with their parents, kids who are marginally engaged with society," he said. "I don't need to add that adolescence is a big time of change for kids."
Dr. Miringoff said that the report on the social state of Connecticut two years ago was responsible for highlighting the issue of child abuse when it detected a 20 percent increase in abuse in just one year. The latest report said that the child abuse rate had gotten marginally better, but was still high: 45 out of every 1,000 children have been referred to the state for abuse.
The impact of the study that year helped pass a state law mandating that social indicators be compiled every year and reported to the legislature, making Connecticut the only state in the nation to do so, Dr. Miringoff said.
"What we need to do in social policy is to get it out of partisan politics and treat it like interest rates," he said, allowing policy makers to rationally measure society's problems and consider what needs to be done.
To some, certain difficulties appear to be perennial, such as those faced by poor families and children, just as solutions continue to be elusive.
"I've been in Connecticut for 30 years," Ms. Geballe said. "The state is so small and so rich, it drives me nuts that we can't seem to fix this."

HEADLINE: Another Train Track in the Backyard?

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
RESIDENTS opposed to a third Metro-North track in their backyards in southern Westchester are pinning their hopes for delaying the project on the federal government, which could block an environmental statement supporting a plan first put forth by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1993.
Federal officials should soon begin reviewing complaints about the plan, which calls for upgrading an existing track bed on the Harlem Line between the Mount Vernon West and the Fleetwood stations and putting in a third track between the Fleetwood and Crestwood stations. The Harlem Line operates on two tracks from Woodlawn in the Bronx to the end of the line at Dover Plains in Dutchess County. 
 Metro-North and the Federal Transit Administration issued an environmental impact statement in May. The public had until the end of July to comment on that report. The federal agency is waiting to receive those comments from Metro-North, along with the railroad's response. "We expect to begin the process shortly," said Bruce Frame, public affairs director of the Federal Transit Administration, in a telephone interview from his office in Washington.
The agency will then either issue a final environmental statement or ask Metro-North to do more work. Because the railroad is seeking federal money to help pay for the project, the agency must issue a final report before construction can begin. Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro-North's parent agency, estimate that the project would cost more than $40 million.
Mayor Nancy D. Hand of Bronxville, where opposition to the plan is strong, said she spoke to Federal Transit Administration officials on Dec. 7 to remind them of the village's contention that there are deficiencies in the environmental statement. She said the F.T.A. told her that it had questions and issues for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to address on the proposal.
Residents and local officials say the railroad is ignoring their fears of increased noise levels and the possibility of graffiti on proposed retaining walls and noise barriers. But the railroad says the project is essential to meet increased Harlem Line ridership.
Eloise L. Morgan, the Bronxville village historian, said, "Besides cutting the village in two, a barrier of this size will irrevocably change the character of the village."
Patty Dohrenwend, the Eastchester town clerk and a resident of Bronxville, said: "Noise barriers will be a visual eyesore. Why destroy a beautiful village that is the gem of Westchester?"
Claire Esposito, 69, who has lived at 38 Parkway Road in Bronxville since 1943 and refuses to move, said, "People who claim that we're just not-in-my-backyard complainers should come down here and imagine what it will be like with a giant wall behind your house."
Other critics contend that the project is just the first step in extending the third track farther north. "If the project terminates at Crestwood, logic tells me that it will have to be eventually extended north to Scarsdale or White Plains," said Jim Cavanaugh, supervisor of the town of Eastchester.
Metro-North strongly denies that, although the possibility has been raised in some capital planning documents in the past.
The greatest impact of the proposed construction would occur in the Parkway Road section of Bronxville, where the railroad bed rises up to 15 feet above residential property in places. The new track would be 12 to 16 feet closer to homes than the existing track. This track would be separated from the backyards of residents by a new retaining wall extending between 4 and 13 feet above ground level. If any noise barriers are added, they will be put on top of the wall.
The controversy over the proposal was renewed by the 674-page environmental statement, which took the railroad two years to complete. A summary says, "No significant unmitigable adverse impacts are expected as a result of the proposed project."
Many who live in the area, like Mayor Philip A. White of Tuckahoe, disagree. "The biggest problem for Tuckahoe is noise," he said. "Their environmental study agreed that the noise here is above where it should be. This project will just create more noise."
The railroad has offered to install noise barriers "only if the community wants them," said the summary. But that offer has been met with skepticism.
"We are concerned about the graffiti problem involving a wall," Mayor White said. "The railroad seems to take care of the graffiti at the stations. But along the right of way, they have left all sorts of equipment that they don't take care of. This equipment gets filled with graffiti."
Mayor Hand said the completed project would result in the construction of a 3,000-foot-long noise barrier through Bronxville, rising from 4 to 17 feet.
"It will be as if you took one of those giant barriers you see along the highway and put it in the center of a village," she said. "This project deserves to be derailed. The railroad is a public service corporation that does not feel responsible to the people they serve."
On the other hand, Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon supports the project. "I have no real problem with it," he said. "It might be beneficial for us. You cannot be myopic about it. It takes a regional approach to planning." He observed that the additional track might ease road congestion.
E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, called the third track absolutely critical. In a telephone interview from his Manhattan office, he said, "In order for the economic growth of Westchester to continue, there has to be adequate transit in that corridor of the Harlem Line."
Mr. Conway added that the third track is needed to remove a bottleneck between Mount Vernon West and Crestwood in Eastchester.
During a typical morning rush in the first 10 months of 1999, 25,132 people rode southbound Harlem Line trains to Grand Central Terminal, with 17,613 boarding from the 9 stations in the mid-Harlem branch. This branch includes the stations from North White Plains to Mount Vernon West.
"Crestwood is a point of origin where more trains are fed into the system to go south," Mr. Conway said. This means that six trains an hour make their journey to Grand Central Terminal in the morning and must then return empty to Crestwood in order to pick up more southbound passengers.
Adding to the problem, railroad officials said, is the growing number of riders from Dutchess and Putnam Counties, as well as an increased number of reverse commuters who take trains north from New York City to jobs in Westchester. This year there were 3,546 reverse commuters on a typical morning and a total of 1.8 million for the year. In 1997, there were 3,200 reverse commuters on a typical morning. Northbound morning trains often must wait until the southbound express trains go around local southbound trains.
If completed, the third track could put an additional 6 to 14 trains in service during the morning rush. "We have been hugely supportive of this proposal," Lawrence Dwyer, president of the Westchester County Association, said. "It will mean an additional 14,500 more riders accessible to the city and Westchester each day, if just six trains are added. Corporations in the county are dependent on the reverse commute, especially for mid-management positions." Mr. Dwyer took this number from the draft environmental impact statement.
Opponents question the accuracy of Metro-North's ridership numbers. They contended that existing capacity and operational changes could meet all of the Harlem Line's ridership needs for the next 20 years. They recalled that in 1994, the railroad projected a yearly average growth rate of 19 percent on the Dover Plains branch, which consists of the four stations at the northernmost part of the line.
But railroad statistics show that the number of peak riders in the morning from the Dover Plains branch increased by 1.5 percent from 1998 to this year, from 320 passengers a day to 325. Total yearly ridership on that branch rose to 298,000 in 1998 from 258,000 in 1994, an increase of just under 16 percent.
Officials of the municipalities say it would be impossible for the construction to be completed, as the railroad contends, entirely on the right of way without infringing on private property. Residents say the railroad has never approached them about the possibility of buying their property.
Emily Papageorge, who has lived at 20 Parkway Road with her husband, Vel, for 30 years, said the distance from the back of their house to the railroad right of way is exactly 22 feet.
"I can't trust Metro-North," she said from her back porch on a recent weekday, as a train rushed by. "I don't believe anything they tell us. A third track will put these trains dangerously close as far as I'm concerned. No one can tell me that a train derailment is impossible. If a derailment happened here, the train would probably land in my house." While she has thought about moving, she has no desire to do so, because she is happy in Bronxville.
Bob Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a Manhattan-based organization that supports the project, said: "This is a classic case of a public work that should proceed despite the concern of immediate homeowners. I understand the concern of Bronxville homeowners, but this is a situation where tens of thousands of people will benefit."
Bronxville officials say they have not ruled out the possibility of a court challenge if the railroad obtains permission to start the project.

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing Into the Millennium

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IN Darien, First Selectman Robert F. Harrell Jr. jokingly observed that his chief fear about the so-called Y2K computer bug is that the Metro-North trains will stop running on their way through town during the morning of Jan. 1, stranding hordes of people recovering from a night of partying in New York City.
In most other respects the town is well prepared, he said, because it has replaced or upgraded its computers and software, and checked areas such as the 911 emergency dispatch system. It also meant that he got acquainted with just how many computerized controllers there were in town offices, such as chips in the elevators. The myriad of systems that had to be checked, he said, made him appreciate that the town does not operate something more complicated, such as a water or electric company. 
 "It's been an interesting, albeit long, exercise, but I expect a smooth transition," Mr. Harrell said. "As an elected official, it's certainly one date I'll be happy to see go by. We've spent a lot of time worrying about this, and a lot of money fixing our older computer systems."
Throughout the state, most people dealing with the Y2K problem feel that for the most part, computer glitches are not going to cause Connecticut to come crashing down on Jan. 1, but, just in case they're wrong, officials want to be prepared. The state will be operating an emergency command center in Hartford a few days before New Year's and the Red Cross is prepared to open additional shelters. Hundreds of state and local government employees who would normally be off duty on New Year's Eve also will be working this year. Municipalities have been preparing throughout the year for this event, but officials are still wary over how such everyday things as traffic lights, elevators and e-mail systems will work in the new year.
"We will have all 25 of the state armories staffed from Dec. 29 through Jan. 1 with at least two people, just in case something happens and we need to bring people in," said Major John R. Whitford, a spokesman for the Connecticut National Guard. Some states are putting their National Guard units on active duty for the date change, but in Connecticut the 5,400 members of the Guard are just on notice to be ready to come in if called, he said.
Private organizations are preparing for problems as well. The Hartford chapter of the American Red Cross has trained 50 extra shelter managers in its 58-town area, giving it the ability to open as many as 300 shelters in schools, churches and other large buildings, said Lori L. Caligiuri, a spokeswoman. The Red Cross is not, however, going so far as to stock up on large quantities of food and water.
"That question comes up time and time again, but we think there might be disruptions here and there, though we don't expect they will be long enough that we should be stockpiling food," Mrs. Caligiuri said. "We don't expect Armageddon, but we will be here if the communities need us."
The state said it had spent about $95 million to address the problem.
At the State Armory in Hartford, John J. Wiltse, the acting director of the Office of Emergency Management, is readying the banks of phones and radios for the morning of Dec. 29, when top officials from 25 state and federal agencies such as the State Police, Corrections and the Department of Transportation will move into a command post for state operations just in case something goes wrong.
"This is not something special that we've devised just for Y2K," Mr. Wiltse said. "If we go into an operational mode for anything from a winter storm to a hurricane, this is how we do it. There's an entire structure, a protocol, that's already in place."
The Y2K problem is the result of early computer programmers shortening the year in all dates to two digit -- 60 for 1960, 65 for 1965, and so forth -- because early computer memories were so limited. When the clock rolls over as Dec. 31 comes to an end, some computers will read the new date as 1900, instead of 2000.
Peter M. Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Council, said 53 percent of businesses surveyed in October had completed their Y2K preparation plans, and almost 25 percent said they expect it will have no substantial effect on their operations.
But he acknowledged that some businesses have been surprised. One major bank updated the dating protocols on its desktop computers, only to find that noncompliant screen-savers would lock the systems up, Mr. Gioia said.
"In most companies, we've been hearing that the information services staff and management people in critical mission areas will be on-site or on call New Year's Eve," Mr. Gioia said.
Some federal e-mail systems are designed to delete the oldest messages first when memory gets low. That could mean messages arriving in January (coded 00) will be deleted when they arrive, when the computer reads the new message as being 100 years old.
In other cases, the change can cause problems with calculations. State corrections officials, for instance, don't want confused computer systems spitting out early release dates for inmates.
"There's no one answer, because every device is going to react differently," said Rock Regan, the chief information officer for the state Department of Information Technology.
"In some cases, it will just stop. In other cases, it will just give you the wrong date when you try to access the system," he said.
But just because a computer has a wrong date is not necessarily devastating, Mr. Regan said. "How many VCR's in people's homes are blinking 12:00 all the time because no one wants to figure out how to program the right time?"
But sometimes the date does make a difference. In New Haven, Timothy J. Scanlon, the Y2K manager, said the computer system that controls traffic lights had to be replaced, after they discovered the main control and chips in the lights were not compliant.
After Jan. 1, the internal calendar would have been off by 100 years. Routines such as allowing main thoroughfares a longer green at rush hour on weekdays might have been disrupted when the system read it as a weekend or a holiday; lights that were supposed to blink at low traffic time might have gone to blinking during heavy traffic.
Software and hardware in New Haven schools, finance and accounting departments, and other areas have all been checked.
New Haven has spent months coordinating with hospitals, nursing homes and ambulance operators about how to handle any contingency. Representatives of the telephone and light companies that serve the city have assured him they are ready for the transition, but even if there are breakdowns, the systems will be so closely monitored, Mr. Scanlon said, "People won't know there's a problem before it's fixed."
Still, the city's 500-page emergency operations plan calls for him and other department heads to begin staffing a 24-hour-a-day emergency center, as well as 10 police substations and 10 fire stations, at midday Dec. 31.
"We expect a nonevent," Mr. Scanlon said. "But we'll be there just in case."
Most municipalities have been promoting Y2K awareness. In Newington, there have been cable television shows, press releases, and notices on the city's World Wide Web page about the preparations, said Roy C. Zartarian, director of information systems.
"In most cases, our heating and air conditioning and elevator controls are so old, they're analog rather than digital, so we're not having a problem," said Mr. Zartarian, who confesses to using notepaper instead of a personal digital assistant for his own planning purposes. "Where we needed them, we have new computers or software. I'm sure people don't want to hear that we'll be able to print tax bills after Jan. 1, but we will, and more important, we'll be able to collect them."
The only known problem remaining as of early December was the town's voice-mail system, he said.
"It does not mean the system is going to crash, only that some dates might not be stamped correctly, but to tell the truth I'm not sure what it's going to say," Mr. Zartarian said.
In Hartford, Nancy M. Mulroy, a spokewoman for Mayor Michael Peters, said the needed repairs to computer systems presented an opportunity to merge the financial management and payroll systems of the schools and city government offices, which should make both more efficient, as well as incorporating some modern practices such as electronic invoicing.
"We thought it was an opportunity to move forward, rather than just repair the old," Ms. Mulroy said. "We needed to get into the 21st century anyway, and this was a good time to make the investment."
Mr. Regan of the State Department of Information Technology said many state systems have already had a real-life test.
"Our first big challenge on Y2K was almost a year ago, with the Department of Labor systems that do a one-year look-ahead," Mr. Regan said. "They ran fine."
And the problem won't necessarily end on Jan. 1, Mr. Regan noted. There are a number of computer functions tied to the end of the month, or the end of the calendar quarter, that could trigger new rounds of problems.
"There are a whole series of dates that we look at in our testing, not just one test to see if we can get it to roll over without any trouble," Mr. Regan said. So his office has been testing systems all over the state, and fixing computer code that relied on two-digit dates. Mr. Regan said his staff will watch what happens around the world beginning Dec. 30.
"You want to have some insight into what problems might be cropping up for us eventually, you watch New Zealand, and Asia, and Europe, because the clock will hit midnight there hours before it does here," Mr. Regan said.
Of more concern to state officials is all the buildup that the problem has received.
Ice storms or high winds often cause power outages in January. Are people going to panic if there is a random power failure minutes after midnight.
And how many people are going to rush to their telephones to see if they are working at one minute past midnight, triggering failures in the switching gear because it is overloaded.
"I'm pretty confident that when midnight rolls over we're all going to be looking at each other and saying, 'Is that all?' " Mr. Regan said. "The biggest issue now is going to be the people issue -- how is everybody going to react? I just worry that people are going to blame any problem on the year 2000."

At Discount Harry's Ultimate Closeout

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN

 BODY:
The Barbies line the shelves, just like they have at Christmas for decades. Hard by are dozens of boxes of Barbie knockoffs, hot pink trim packaging around the glassine windows showing the Kelly Day Care School Set ($14.99 marked down from $24) or the Backpack Club Fashion Mall (only $7.79, down from $13).
There are Toy Story figurines and Elmo this and Elmo that and electronic dart games and, in the oddment section, crates of hampers and digital alarms and comforters and wooden two-person rockers. 
 No one who has shopped at Discount Harry's, a rambling you'll-buy-what-we've-got store along a chaotic section of Route 130 here, over the last 50 years would notice anything different this December. Except that it is the last Christmas for Discount Harry's, yet another victim of consolidation and chain discounting, a piece of business nostalgia as the millennium turns.
"We had our day, but we can't compete any more," said John Lancaster, who bought the business from the original Discount Harry, Harry Kaufman, in 1976. "The biggest thing that got me is that I no longer have the ability to support a building of this size with closeouts and toys like we'd like to."
Discount Harry's has long been the anchor on a strip of warehouse-like discount stores just off the busy Airport Circle. There is the Forman Mills clothing discounter and Jo Skymer, the discount lighting store, among others. But Harry's, well, that was always something else.
At Harry's vast 100,000-square-foot store, you could buy pools and patio furniture, bikes and Halloween decorations, paint and kitty litter, just about everything imaginable, in or out of season. One day several years ago, a man showed up with a truckload of Maxwell House coffee.
"We checked it out to see if it was legitimate and it was," remembered Mr. Lancaster. He bought the lot for $1.50 a pound, went to a couple of supermarkets and found Maxwell House was selling for $2.99 a pound, and piled it on pallets for sale at $1.99 a pound. He sold it out in days, with even diner owners buying it by the case.
"We put up a sign, 'This store sells more Maxwell House coffee than any other toy store in the world,' " he said.
Ah, toys. That's where Harry's made its nut and its name. In the 1980's, as more and more mom-and-pop toy stores faded from the scene, Harry's thrived by selling inexpensive, often close-out toys. For a time, it was the largest independent toy buyer in the United States. Mr. Lancaster loved the art of the deal, which he learned as a salesman at Kiddie City before buying the store from Mr. Kaufman, one of his idols, at the age of 32.
"Harry was the best," said Mr. Lancaster of his mentor, who now lives in Florida and, until this year, came back every Christmas to help out on the sales floor. "He'd take stuff no one could sell off a truck or from an old warehouse and sell the heck out of it."
There were never any frills at Discount Harry's, so in its final days, it looks no different than it ever has. It has always been a mecca for the masses. Items are piled, sometimes even neatly, in little particular order. The hampers, for instance, are right by the comforters, which are up against the digital clocks.
The black-and-white tiled floors have been scuffed for a generation. The exposed ceilings are not of architectural fashion, but of ease to fix wiring and plumbing. Some of the cinder-block walls got the advantage of white paint; others have chipped-but-still-effective peg board. Utility poles and heating ducts block aisles willy-nilly.
But there always bargains to be found, and still are, so long as Mr. Lancaster has merchandise left in his warehouse. That electronic dart game can be in someone's den for $40. Huffy bikes are down as low as $70. Dozens of Tinkerbell Fragranced Bubble Necklaces will go for $1.99 each.
Then there are the really odd items. One peg board has "Timeless Legends" sports figurines, timeless if you think of Steve Owens, the 1969 Heisman Trophy-winning running back from the University of Oklahoma, or the Milwaukee Bucks semi-star Vin Baker as legends. Another spinning holder has mini-Pennsylvania license plates with names imprinted; what's left are Wesley, Clint, Heidi and Clay.
This is no longer enough in the late 1990's economy. About 40 percent of Discount Harry's annual profits have been tied to Christmas toys. But since Mattel and Hasbro have in recent years bought up second-tier toymakers like Tyco and Galoob and non-toy retailers like Wal-Mart and KMart started using toy staples as Christmastime loss-leaders, independents like Mr. Lancaster have been heavily squeezed.
"If I'm in Bentonville, Arkansas, or Paramus, New Jersey," said Mr. Lancaster, referring to the headquarters cities for Wal-Mart and Toys R Us, respectively, "and I, say, want a million Monopoly sets, I'm going to get a deep discount. So then someone like me buys it for $9.99 and they can run it at $8.99 and make a little money. I lose a dollar just to get people in the door.
"It has also taken the distributors out of business," added Mr. Lancaster, taking a deep breath and thinking back to the old days of dealing. "Twenty years ago, there were 200 toy distributors I could deal with. Now I only know of two. I can't make it in toys any more."
And that means the end of Harry's.
This month, Mr. Lancaster put his building up for sale with Mertz Realty of Mount Laurel. It is a huge place on three acres with 140 parking spaces in a relatively hot real estate market. Mr. Lancaster hopes it goes quickly, so he can move on to his next business.
"I'll do just pools and patio furniture in a smaller place nearby," he said. "So far, the independents still rule there because these items require room and service. The Kmarts and the Targets don't want to deliver and set up pools and they don't want to make room for a lot of patio sets. When I go to the outdoor furniture show in Chicago, there are 2,000 independents there."
Mr. Lancaster hopes to be out of Discount Harry's and into the unnamed new business by spring, when people will be out looking for patio sets and pools and filters. And deals.
"Oh, I feel sad, sure, because of the fun I had doing it every day," he said. "A new deal happened every day. Who knew each day? Kitty litter. Tables. Whatever. But I made all my friends in the business and I don't play golf. Got to do something."

HEADLINE: Bookstores Take On The Mouse

BYLINE: By WENDY GINSBERG 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
AS Joey Shapiro sat on the floor of Micawber Books here, he insisted that he would never shop online.
After surveying the display books, his eyes focused on a brightly colored binding on a nearby shelf. 
 "I didn't even want to come here today," said Mr. Shapiro, classical literature major at Princeton who was clutching a bag of books he had bought. "My friend dragged me. But I get here and find things I didn't even know I wanted."
But Margaret G. Knapp, who owns Micawber Books, knows that the growth of online commerce can be ignored only at her own peril. While she says the virtual bookstores can never replace cracking open a new novel, she maintains a Web site nonetheless.
Miles away, Jeremy L. Schaefer relaxed at home in New Brunswick, reveling in finding the computer book he needed on the Web.
"For Christmas gifts, you go to the mall and it's a madhouse," said Mr. Schaefer, a computer science major at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "It's like football. You have to run through people to get where you're going. Granted, you don't get the warm fuzzies from a Web site like when you walk into an independent bookstore, but at least you can be in your pajamas."
This holiday season -- more than any other that has preceded it -- the shopping battle is pitting the ring of the cash register against the click of the mouse, and the competition will determine if independent bookstores can weather the war of attrition.
The explosion of online shopping, known as e-commerce, has forced many small business owners to rethink their tactics. Economic survival for independent stores is especially acute in the book industry, where online sales have almost doubled since last year, according to several major booksellers.
Indeed, the rapid growth of online shopping cost the state a projected $21 million in lost tax revenue this year, according to the State Treasurer. By 2003 that figure is expected to reach $130 million.
Nabil R. Adam, a professor of computer information systems at Rutgers in Newark, said that the independent bookstore who will have to join the online trend to survive.
"If you don't have a Web site, people might think there's something not quite right about your operation," Professor Adam said.
Smaller bookstores will also have to spend more to make sure they have an easy-to-use Web design and a quality search engine, he said.
"Small businesses will not be able to survive if they continue business as usual," Professor Adams said. "Local bookstores will have to profile their customers and become familiar with their area."
National Small Businesses United, a coalition of small businesses, released statistics estimating that 41 percent of all small businesses had Web sites in 1998, and that the number was expected to jump to more than 60 percent by the new year.
Representatives of Amazon.com and Borders.com say their Web sites are not intended to replicate a visit to the local bookshop. Amazon.com is unique in that exists only on the Internet. "People that shop at Amazon.com are looking for ease and convenience,' said Paul P. Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon. "It's being able to shop at 11:30 at night in your bunny slippers."
Could a solution be for everyone to go to the local bookstore in pajamas and bunny slippers?
Rich Fahle, the editor of the Borders.com Web site, said the answer was sort of.
While Mr. Fahle said that e-commerce was a vital complement to the 290 Borders bookstores nationwide, nothing could replace them. "The Web site is just a piece of the puzzle for Borders," he said.

The Restaurant as Leading Economic Indicator

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
IS there life after two-for-one sushi specials?
The owners of Henry's, a new restaurant at Broadway and 105th Street, think so, especially if the area proves prosperous enough to support the relatively upscale 140-seat restaurant they opened two months ago. 
 It is the latest culinary incarnation in a large corner site that has had two others since the early 1980's, and where a bargain Japanese restaurant, Tofu, closed about eight months ago.
The five small shops that had long been there were converted to the jazz club Birdland in 1983. In 1995, Birdland's owners moved the club to Midtown. Then the owners of a chain of Chinese restaurants on Long Island opened Tofu, which offered inexpensive sushi. It drew few customers, and closed in less than two years.
So why open Henry's, where entrees start at around $15, in a neighborhood where the idea of eating out has often been a good $3.50 falafel or some tasty arroz con pollo for $6.75 at one of the inexpensive ethnic restaurants that line Broadway?
Well, the owners have a quick answer: to get an early foothold in what some see as a neighborhood on the cusp of gentrification.
The dozen blocks of Broadway north of 96th street, historically known as Bloomingdale, have long been lined with small groceries and shops. Nearby residents range from working-class Hispanic families, most of whom live east of Broadway, in a neighborhood known as Manhattan Valley, to wealthier residents in the large apartments along Broadway, West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, on the northern fringe of the Upper West Side. The stretch lies between the increasingly prosperous Columbia University area to the north and the Upper West Side to the south.
It is being called SoCo, or South of Columbia, by local real estate brokers, who say the two adjacent neighborhoods are expanding, and predict that the blocks in between will follow a familiar pattern of gentrification seen in neighborhoods like TriBeCa and the East Village.
Marguerite Pearson, an executive vice president for Douglas Elliman, the large real estate broker in Manhattan, called the area one of the city's fastest growing.
"You've got the absolutely gorgeous prewar apartments, and the service businesses are already there," she said. "Families are moving there, because it is just so 'neighborhood.' "
Henry's five owners have focused on that trend. Luigi and Mauro Lusardi and Elio Guaitolini, who own six restaurants on the Upper East Side, joined with Henry Rinehart and Robert Devine, who ran the Lusardis' restaurant, Luke's, at 79th Street and Third Avenue. Mr. Rinehart said the group just had to cultivate a local following. What Henry's provides, he said, is the large gathering place that the "Upper Upper West Side" sorely needed.
"To me this is a no-brainer," he said. "We did our homework. It's ours to fumble."
And there's no confidence like cash. The partners signed a 10-year lease, with a monthly rent of close to $20,000, and have invested more than $1 million in interior work. They have created a warm, old-time feel, from the checkerboard tablecloths to the Frank Lloyd Wright-style wood interior made of Honduran mahogany to the stained glass lamps that hang from the high ceilings. The expansive interior is larger than any other restaurant down to Carmine's on Broadway near 91st Street.
Henry's classic American fare leans toward comfort food. It has a list of 38 wines and serves 14 kinds of beer. Mauro Lusardi maintains that the price range is commensurate with the budgets of local residents, especially newcomers.
"It's a neighborhood that's really being transformed," he said. "It's up and coming. We considered six other areas in Manhattan before choosing this site. We felt we had to get in now, because waiting a year or two, the rent would be much higher."
Faith Hope Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug, a large commercial real estate company, said many large retailers saw Henry's as a test of the spending power of a neighborhood she called "the next big growth area."
"In the past, it was a strip of bodegas," she said. "It had no image and was kind of lost in limbo. Now, you're getting very well-heeled singles and couples moving in."
"You have strong anchors on both sides," she added, "and what was once no man's land is becoming viable for -- and I wish I could give it a new word -- gentrification."
Andrew Albert, executive director of the West Side Chamber of Commerce, compared the area to the stretch of Amsterdam Avenue north of 79th Street, which, by being between two thriving streets, Broadway and Columbus Avenue, became dense with bars and restaurants during the last several years.
"There's always pressure on an area between two prospering neighborhoods," he said, "and people up there are really hungry for a greater choice for places to eat and shop. We hear all the time, 'Why can't this stretch be like the rest of Broadway?' "
It is starting to. Other sophisticated spots have opened nearby. Several doors north of Henry's, in the space that was long Augie's, a jazz bar with cheap beer and a late-night student crowd, a new owner opened Smoke in March. It is a more upscale jazz lounge with red velvet sofas and a cover charge.
A coffee bar that opened last year on 107th Street just west of Broadway recently expanded this year to become the Underground Lounge and Cafe, a campy grotto-style restaurant. Alouette, a French restaurant, opened last year on Broadway between 97th and 98th Streets.
Gothic Cabinet Craft, a furniture maker, opened a large showroom on Broadway near 100th Street in July, and Gristede's supermarket on Broadway near 100th Street recently expanded. Gourmet Garage opened its 4,000-square-foot fine foods store on Broadway north of 96th Street in 1997, after a marketing study showed that the population density, income level and percentage of college graduates were increasing near Broadway above 96th Street.
Along Amsterdam Avenue between 96th and 110th Streets, meanwhile, a spate of new bars and restaurants have opened recently, including Pampa, an Argentinian steak restaurant, near 97th Street.
But John Valenti, who owns Birdland, remains skeptical. He never got the business he hoped for uptown, he said, and he said Henry's might not, either.
"When I first opened, it was tough to walk around there at night," he said. "I thought the gentrification would go above 96th Street the way it did from 86th to 96th, but the traffic was never there like it was down in the 70's and 80's. Also, people up there don't spend big money. If they do, it's to eat downtown." Other disadvantages, he said, include few lunch customers, scant parking, and perceptions. "When people hear 105th Street, they think they're going into no man's land," he said.
Alan Rubin, who has owned RCI Discount Appliances, at Broadway and 98th Street, for 25 years, called business the best it had ever been.
"From 96th Street up has always been way behind, but we're starting to catch up," Mr. Rubin said. "The developments we saw in the West 70's 10 years ago are creeping up here, but there are people who still tend to look at above 96th Street as getting into Harlem. We have more and more young people, or nannies coming in with children. They weren't here 10 years ago. The level of spending and disposable income in this neighborhood is going up all time." But Mr. Rubin said he feared that the influx of chain stores would drive out smaller businesses.
"Commercial rents are doubling and tripling," he said. "Any merchant around here that doesn't have a really strong business and long, low-rent lease is going to be driven out of this area."

When ThisParty Ends, More Will Feel the Pain

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WITH all the excitement of the approaching millennium, it is understandable that a different anniversary has been largely ignored. December was the month, in 1996, when Alan Greenspan made his famous warning about "irrational exuberance."
He was uncertain then whether stock prices had become "unduly escalated." But three years later and 4,800 points higher on the Dow Jones industrial average, doubt is gone. The market is clearly exuberant and irrational. 
 That might not be so terrible if this were 1987 or the mid-1970's, when bubbles burst and stock prices took famous plunges. Fewer shareholders counted so much on their paper wealth in those days, and fewer executives relied so heavily on a rising market to sustain their entrepreneurial spirits.
Maybe the selloff that now seems inevitable will do only passing damage. But the odds of getting off easily this time are fading. The national economy and the market have become too intertwined. "Every optimistic forecast about the economy is based on the premise that stock prices will either go up or change very little," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist. "Not since World War II have we been so dependent on the market."
Economists count the ways. Some items on the list are already well known, the most familiar being the "wealth effect": rising stock prices encourage consumers to spend more and borrow more, activities that almost certainly will come to a halt, shrinking the economy, if the Dow Jones average falls by 30 percent or so and stays down for at least six months.
Even people who don't own stock hear all the glad tidings on the evening news. They see in the rising market a signal that the economy is O.K. and that their jobs are safe, noted Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. So they, too, spend beyond their incomes.
 A MARKET selloff would throw the effect into reverse. The spenders would pull way back. Companies would, too, in response. Job growth would halt; the unemployment rate would rise and incomes would fall. But debt would not, and everyone -- companies and households -- would pull back more in the scramble to pay debts and restore savings that evaporated in the market decline.
"A selloff would bring us the first stock-market-induced recession since before the Second World War," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Still, he does not surrender optimism. Although he anticipates a selloff, he does not forecast a recession. When the downfall comes, Mr. Roach and many others will count on Mr. Greenspan's Federal Reserve to lower interest rates quickly enough and to take other steps to prevent the anticipated chain reaction of belt-tightening from happening.
The potential for damage, however, is spreading in small and perhaps uncontrollable ways. Many corporations, for example, no longer have to add cash to their employee pension funds. Because the funds have invested in a rising stock market, they are fully funded. As long as stocks keep their value, the corporate money that would have been needed for pension contributions augments profits instead, or is invested in new products and equipment, activities that keep the economy humming. If the stock market falls sharply, that money would again have to be channeled into the pension funds to keep them whole.
Grants from foundations would also decline after a selloff, and they finance thousands of projects and considerable research and employment. Grants are geared to a foundation's wealth, and foundations invest heavily in stocks. Grant money has risen in step with the market. A selloff would produce a reversal of this trend.
ON a different level, corporate mergers, particularly those in which one company pays for another with stock, would become more difficult. "We have a sense in this booming stock market that there is no deal we cannot do," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and author.
And then, of course, there is the spreading use of stock options as pay in place of cash, a practice that is marching down the hierarchy to lower ranks of workers. A market fall that lasted for a while would render many of those options worthless. "Obviously, a lot of people will be angry," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, "and some will try to get paid retroactively in cash."
Finally, there are all the flourishing Internet companies. They float new stock and watch it soar in value even as many companies fail to make a profit. The market wealth covers the shortfall. Or it makes possible borrowing and expansion in pursuit of success in a new technology that is vibrant and promising.
Or is it? Is it the technology that kindles the entrepreneurial spirit in the Internet billionaires, or is it the stock market?
Probably both. But we must wait for the market selloff to get a more sober fix on the lasting changes wrought by the Internet, the star technology in the much-proclaimed new economy.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH BRONX;
A Group Named 'We Stay,' A Garden That Must Depart

BYLINE: By DAVID CRITCHELL 

 BODY:
Their apple tree is now bare and the grape and tomato vines have shriveled. But the people who gathered last week in the wooden shanty, or casita, at Rincon Criollo, a community garden on 158th Street and Brook Avenue, were talking about the other fruits of their labors.
"This garden and the culture it represents has inspired me to do better," Samuel Cordero, 29, said. "I've learned about my roots and been able to teach others about them." 
 But Rincon Criollo -- the name means down-home corner -- and other gardens on city-owned lots in the neighborhood will eventually have to make way for residential and commercial development. An urban renewal project called Melrose Commons, financed by city, state and federal agencies and in the works for several years, calls for the redevelopment of 35 blocks in the Melrose neighborhood.
This month a local community group, We Stay/Nos Quedamos, received an $8.2 million federal grant to develop housing for low-income elderly people on 157th Street and Third Avenue. The project is part of the Melrose Commons development. Currently there is a community garden on the site, which is a block away from Rincon Criollo.
Last Thursday, about a dozen gardeners held a small rally at the casita to protest the anticipated loss of their green space. Some said they were disappointed that Nos Quedamos would be shutting down gardens. "Nos Quedamos was formed because they didn't want to move, but now they've become just like the city," said Francine Rogers, who runs a garden on 151st Street and Brook Avenue. "It's their plan now."
But the executive director of Nos Quedamos, Yolanda Garcia said, her group intended to include green space in its project. Yet not every garden could be saved, she said.
"The gardens are very important, and we are planning on open space," Ms. Garcia said. "But the way the city looks at gardens, the bigger lots will have to be converted for housing."
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, who has brought visiting Puerto Rican dignitaries to visit Rincon Criollo in the past, said that although he would be saddened to see it go, housing and community renewal had to take precedence.
"This is a community based-project," Mr. Ferrer said of the Melrose Commons plan. "It was an inclusive and democratic process and in the end will add garden acreage to the area. This is something we should feel comfortable with and sets the pace for the kind of planning we need to do everywhere."
But the local gardeners say that they have had little input in the garden's future. "We have not been consulted, and we don't want to move," Pedro Figueroa, Rincon Criollo's president, said. "You can move the casita, but how do you replace an apple tree or the vines that have been here for so long?" DAVID CRITCHELL

The Body Beautiful, In Diverse Guises

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
THE girls were as young as 8, but already they knew what parts of their bodies they liked and what parts they didn't. They knew the pressures to be "pretty" in a society where the definition of female splendor is whimsical. One era you're in, the next era you're out.
The difference in the little room where the girls sat talking the other day is that they also asked questions. Why is thin beautiful? Who says that yellow hair or big breasts are desirable? What role do ethnic and racial bias play in definitions of beauty? 
 That's the way it goes at the Sista II Sista Freedom School in Bushwick, Brooklyn, run by the Sista II Sista Collective. It meets on Saturdays, with anywhere from 8 to 20 girls or young women in attendance. They talk about their values, they attend workshops on health and sexuality, they write poetry and develop theater projects, they identify issues in their community.
It's a struggling community, under the elevated train tracks, where about 40 percent of the people, who are mostly African-American or Latino, meet the federal definition of poor. The neighborhood has less open space and fewer parks than almost any other in the city.
What it does have, in Sista II Sista, is a place that values matters of the heart and the spirit: the female spirit. The Freedom School, a name that purposely recalls the "freedom summers" of the 60's civil rights struggles, is run out of the office of Make the Road by Walking, a community group that provides legal support to the working poor, the unemployed and the undocumented.
On a recent Saturday, the teenagers who usually come were off taking college entrance exams, so the younger girls, 8 to 13, had the place to themselves. Most were Puerto Rican or Dominican.
The girls watched a music video of "Unpretty" by the group TLC, in which an overweight woman peruses fashion magazines, cutting out photographs of thin women and putting them on her wall before indulging in a frenzy of overeating. A woman is shown lying on an operating table before undergoing plastic surgery; another woman sits with her boyfriend in front of a computer, where he electronically enlarges the breasts of the women's bodies on the screen.
"The girls are getting the message that they're not pretty," said Adjoa Jones de Almeida, a Sista II Sista founder and a discussion leader. "Where are they getting that message?"
"If they don't have no makeup, they're ugly," one girl said.
"The guys want the women their way, with big breasts," another said. "In my opinion, that don't matter."
The discussion then veered into eating disorders and the pressures to look a certain way. People talked about their hair, their behinds, their lips, their breasts.
"I don't like my hair because it turns into an Afro," one girl said.
"My uncle said to my sister: 'You're fat. You're going to explode,' " another said. "My sister said: 'I don't care. I'm the right size for me.' "
The little women jumped with excitement at that bit of sass.
"Why are we talking about all this?" asked Jennifer Calderon, another founder of the school, leading the discussion. "We have to look at why I want to have a flatter stomach or longer nails or different hair. Every time you look at a magazine or a video, think about the images."
The Freedom School, for all the intimacy and spontaneity on display the other day, is the carefully cultivated brainchild of four young women who looked around and saw many programs for young Latino and African-American men, but few for women. Not to mention few images reflecting women like them who are doing transforming things with their lives, from raising their families to doing research on women's lives.
Indeed, the four women who brought the sisters together reflect the energy and beauty of countless African-American and Latina women who are quietly turning their communities around. They are Nicole Burrowes, a graduate student in history at City University; Ms. Calderon, a writer and a staff member at El Punte, a youth organization; Ms. Jones de Almeida, an English teacher at El Punte; and Paula Rojas, who has been a full-time community organizer since graduating from Smith College in 1992. They are in their 20's. It's all volunteer work, after school and children and full-time jobs to pay the bills.
Now, at year's end, they are hoping to raise enough money to buy their own space and to expand the program, which began in 1996 with eight Saturday sessions. Help comes from foundations, businesses, fund-raising events like poetry readings and, triumphantly, a $50,000 award from the Fund for the City of New York, which rewards outstanding community groups.
"It was a different vision from most programs that deal with youths as a social service model or a crisis state that young people are in," Ms. Jones de Almeida said.
"People are always putting women of color into categories," Ms. Burrowes said. "Here, they can just be."

HEADLINE: THEN/NOW: REFLECTIONS ON THE MILLENIUM;
A New Way of Living With Nature

 BODY:
A century that will be remembered for material and scientific progress may also be remembered for something more modest -- as a moment when mankind, realizing that the earth's resources were not finite and perhaps seeking expiation for years of predatory behavior, struck a truce with nature. For the first time since the dawn of the industrial age there was, at least in the West and certainly in America, a rough armistice between the forces of economic growth and the forces of preservation.
The big question on the eve of the next century is whether this armistice will hold. The earth's six billion people will grow to nine billion by 2050, creating new pressures on natural resources, food and habitation. There is also the related question of whether what can loosely be called the environmental ethic, now largely confined to the industrialized world, can be extended to poorer nations that believe it is their turn to industrialize. 
 America, for example, seems to have settled on a policy of preserving its national forests and adding incrementally to its protected wilderness. By contrast, countries like Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia are chewing up their forests at a ferocious clip. Similarly, the industrialized West is actively seeking alternatives to the carbon-based fuels that are contributing to potentially disruptive changes in the earth's climate. Yet unless the big developing countries like India and China do likewise, what the West does will make very little difference.
Still, it is worth celebrating the attitudinal changes in this country that have cast nature, once seen as an unruly force needing discipline, in a more congenial light. Early in this century, for example, federal sharpshooters hunted wolves for bounty. Today, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service is orchestrating the wolf's revival. Sixty-five years ago the Hoover Dam, rising 70 stories above the bed of the Colorado River, was hailed as the greatest engineering feat in American history. Today, dams are increasingly seen as enemies of the natural order and are actually being dismantled. Only 30 years ago the Hudson River, once among America's most majestic waterways, was little more than a 350-mile sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to Manhattan, choked with untreated municipal waste, industrial chemicals and agricultural runoff. Today, the Hudson pulses with life.
Wolves, dams, wilderness, forests, lakes, rivers, estuaries -- all are seen differently now than they were less than 50 years ago. Of course if reparations were to be made at all, the century now ending was surely the proper time to make them. For it was not until the 20th century that we began to develop the technology that enabled us to destroy nature on a truly grand scale -- the implacable machinery that in a heartbeat (measured in millennial time) could foul the air, clear-cut the forests and strip-mine the oceans.
It was thus fitting that this same century would eventually produce a citizens' revolt against environmental degradation. This revolt -- symbolized by the first Earth Day in 1970, and defined by the creation of an astonishing body of environmental laws -- not only gave the nation the tools with which to heal itself but conferred upon ordinary citizens the indispensable right to take even the government to court if it failed to carry out these laws.
There are many who believe that the technology that got us into trouble will get us out -- that fuel cells will replace the internal combustion engine, that microbes will dispose of the waste stream. But of course technology is neutral. What will matter in the future is what has always mattered, namely the values and political will of those at the controls. The truth is, people can accomplish mighty acts of repair. If they can destroy the Everglades with levees and canals, as they did in the 1940's, they can help save the Everglades by replumbing it. If they can decimate the world's swordfish with factory ships, they can replenish the swordfish by keeping those ships in port.
Therein lies one answer to the environmental pessimists who believe that the world is past recovery, that the battle to preserve open spaces and biodiversity is already lost because there are simply too many people coveting too much land and demanding too many resources. What they overlook is that we are not at the same point on the learning curve that we were 70 or even 30 years ago. Having discovered that we can actually change the way nature operates, we have also discovered that with this power comes a sacred obligation to restore what we once nearly ruined.

Asia Moves In on the Big Ditch

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
EVER since Balboa sighted the Pacific Ocean from a hill here in 1513, this has been one of the world's great geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may have changed, as the colonial rivalry of Spain and England gave way in the 1800's to a struggle to build the Panama Canal that pitted France against the United States, but the link between control of the isthmus and dominance in world trade has remained constant.
Now, with the United States having formally handed the canal over to Panama last week, a new phase of that Great Game is beginning. This time it is the trading powers of East Asia who are emerging as players -- reflecting the waterway's diminishing importance to American commerce and its growing strategic value to export-dependent economies on the far side of the Pacific. 
 Before the canal was built, a United States emerging as a world power envisioned it as the best way to get people and goods between its Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and to unify a new two-ocean Navy. But today, not only are aircraft carriers too big to fit through the Canal (and missile submarines normally too secretive to use it), but American companies increasingly prefer overland routes or air freight for shipping goods between their two coasts.
For Asians shipping exports across two oceans, however, the canal is now indispensable. The United States remains its largest user, but the big trading nations of Asia are catching up fast. China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are all in the top ten, and a typical cargo nowadays is likely to be soybeans from Brazil or oil from Venezuela on their way to East Asia in exchange for automobiles or electronic goods destined for the Colon Free Trade Zone here.
The result has been a conspicuous burst of Asian investment here. Taiwanese and Korean consortiums are building separate industrial parks, and a pair of Chinese shipping tycoons with competing political loyalties are now solidly installed in the ports that command both approaches to the canal: Chang Yung-Fa, a Taiwan loyalist, and his Evergreen Maritime Corporation in Colon at the Caribbean entrance and Li Ka-shing of Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., who is cozy with Beijing, in Balboa at the Pacific entrance.
"Panamanians have an easier time relating to U.S. businessmen than Chinese or Japanese because culturally they feel more at ease with Americans," said Roberto Eisenmann, a prominent business leader here who advises President Mireya Moscoso. "But the governments of Asia have been much more aggressive than the United States" in seeking opportunities here.
In Washington, only the conservative Republicans who opposed the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, and who now fear that the People's Liberation Army is sneaking in as the Southern Command moves out, seem interested in Panama these days. Former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger warned this month that China is seeking "a foothold in one of the world's three major chokepoints," while the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, fears that "U.S. naval ships will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be denied passage through the canal." Supporters of the turnover counter that such a focus on the military ignores the fact that the United States is the only country with a treaty right to intervene should such an unlikely scenario occur.
More interestingly, perhaps, a narrow emphasis on the military plays down the underlying mercantile factor; it is, after all, by expanding its economy that China has the best chance of becoming a global power in the next few decades, rather than by challenging the United States militarily in the Western Hemisphere.
Perhaps the most significant contest developing here, according to Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former vice president of Panama, is "an intense competition between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China to advance a broad array of interests" that are fundamentally political and economic.
"I think the Chinese have learned the lesson of 19th-century England, which understood that it had influence in the Mediterranean to the extent that it commanded the entrance and exit" at Gibraltar and Suez, he added. "China and Taiwan are already competing in the South China Sea, and now both are seeking a presence at the exit on the other side of the Pacific."
Of course, power and influence today can be exercised in a more subtle manner than by establishing colonies or sending in the fleet, as the British so often did. Neither Chinese state is in a position -- or even appears to want -- to supplant America's role as protector of the canal. So their rivalry has centered on the commercial facilities in and around the canal and on penetrating Latin American markets.
Japan, too, is bidding for influence and profit here. It has underwritten a feasibility study for construction of new canal locks, and is offering to finance a new bridge on extraordinarily generous terms.
YET neither Panama, which abolished its armed forces following the American invasion to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega 10 years ago, nor the Asians can guarantee the security of the canal. That has historically been an American responsibility -- just as it is America that guarantees that the sea lanes remain open in Asia. But defending the canal is a role that has changed enormously in the last century, if only because the nature of war has changed.
Panamanians say there is virtually no possibility of building a foolproof military shield these days, a point American military planners concede privately.
Flying over the canal in a helicopter with Nicolas Ardito Barletta, the director of the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, the Panamanian government agency that oversees the former Panama Canal Zone, and looking down on the network of dams and locks that hold back the man-made Gatun and Madden Lakes, the waterway's vulnerability in the missile age is evident. If they were to be blown up, "the canal would be shut down for two years," Mr. Barletta acknowledged. That is why, he added, "the best guarantee for the canal is its neutrality."
These days that solution may be as attractive to the United States as it is to Asian users of the canal. But it begs another question: the instability in Latin American countries that are neighbors of the canal, and the fear that terrorism or sabotage there could spill over.
Outfits like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are not likely to be restrained by any declared neutrality. As if to underline their capacity to make trouble, that group last week overran the Colombian Navy base closest to Panama. There have also been incursions by Colombian guerrillas and paramilitary death squads into Panama's Darien province, and Mr. Eisenmann said Panamanians "have to be very cautious" about how they respond, lest they come under foreign pressure to revive a national military that has always proved corrupt and repressive.
At the canal, the favorite buzzword of its new masters these days is "diversification." Amid the profusion of new Hyundai cranes and Mitsubishi locomotives as modernization of the canal is planned, it is not clear whether the United States will emerge as first among equals or something less.
"We owe a lot to the United States," Ricardo Martinelli, the Panamanian government's minister of canal affairs, said in an interview. " We'd like American companies to offer the best terms. But we are living in a globalized world that is very competitive. That's the new reality, so welcome to the jungle."

The Sounds of Silence

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THAT deafening silence you hear is the sound of presidential hopefuls debating whether government should intervene in the wage-etting process to help people afford a better life. Today, it seems, everyone agrees that the market does this best.
In the past, American politicians have split, often rancorously, over the issue. Still more profoundly, they were divided over tax cuts and social programs such as welfare, food stamps, child care, education and health insurance. Now there is broad agreement that whatever the specifics, government should limit itself to help families get along until the market finally raises their incomes. 
 President Clinton came into office in 1993 in the old style: primed to use government to raise workers' wages. With the country still struggling to shake off the effects of a recession, he proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage as well as billions on public works to raise the demand for workers. A presidential commission was also set up to study ways to make unions more effective.
In time, however, the public works spending was dropped in favor of deficit reduction. The union commission's recommendations were shelved, and the 90-cent increase in the minimum wage that Congress did approve in 1996 brought the minimum to only $5.15 today. That leaves it well short of its peak in 1968, when its worth was $7.49 an hour in today's dollars.
Since the Reagan years, a gradual metamorphosis has taken place. It appears to be culminating in the current presidential campaign, in which Republican and Democratic candidates alike bow to the efficiencies of the markets, even while acknowledging that income inequality remains a problem.
Wage-setting and labor power, once deeply divisive election year issues, are barely mentioned. The only question is what is the right tax incentive or social program when the markets require a helping hand.
"Where conservatives and liberals might differ, and it is a nuance difference, is in how each of us would tear down the obstacles to getting ahead," said Lawrence B. Lindsay of the American Enterprise Institute, who is George W. Bush's chief economic adviser.
Mr. Lindsay notes that Republicans emphasize tax cuts, which are intended to increase the incentive to work and to hasten the day that a worker takes home adequate pay for a materially decent life . Both sides favor the earned income tax credit, a tax rebate. And while the Democrats endorse a variety of social programs, including food stamps and subsidies for child care, health insurance, education and job training, they are careful to avoid any suggestion that they are interfering in the workings of the marketplace.
"I think the beauty of the earned income tax credit is that it raises living standards and incentives to work," said Gene Sperling, director of President Clinton's National Economic Council and a top adviser to Vice President AlGore. These programs, he explained, avoid "the kind of constraints on markets that in Europe has hurt the dynamism and job growth."
One reason for this convergence between Democrats and Republicans is the remarkable strength of the American economy, which has boomed since the 1996 election, while the more interventionist economies of Europe and Japan have floundered. Moreover, in 1996, wages finally began to rise faster than inflation, across the board, the first time that has happened since the early 1970's -- although well-to-do Americans have pulled further ahead of low-income families.
THIS inequality has hardly escaped notice, and no candidate has been more outspoken on the subject than Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination. But he, too, stays within the free market framework.
"Bill feels that open markets are a strength of the American economy, but he has also indicated that someone who works year-round, full-time should not end up being poor," said Marcia Aronoff, who advises Mr. Bradley on economics issues.
Mr. Bradley'ssolution, like Mr. Gore's, is social programs, including national health insurance and an expansion of the earned income tax credit, which now provides up to $5,000 a year for 17 million families earning between $9,000 and $30,500.
The Democratic candidates would raise the minimum wage again, but modestly, along the lines proposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who tried unsuccessfully to win passage this fall of an increase in the minimum to $6.15 an hour over two years -- still well short of the old peak.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley propose a similar modest increase in the minimum wage. And Mr. Sperling says that $1 over two years strikes a balance between "higher wages for low income people and potential harm to job growth."
Mr. Bradley would go a few steps further, banning striker replacement, for example, giving unions more power to organize workers and denying government contracts to companies that violate labor law. But those proposals, set forth in a mid-August speech, lack details. "He has not proposed specific remedies," Ms. Aronoff said. "He is open at this point to a variety of ideas."
The market-oriented approach to wage setting has the support of most mainstream economists, who argue, among other things, that government intervention discourages companies from hiring unskilled workers and puts the increased wage cost disproportionately on companies that hire the unskilled.
Business, by and large, seconds this view, arguing that tax cuts and social programs are preferable to higher mandated wages, which come directly out of their pockets.
But this view is by no means universally accepted. Some economists believe that the market demand for workers is only part of the reason for the rise in low-end wages in recent years. Small as it was, the 1996 increase in the minimum wage also nudged up hourly wages at the low end of the pay scale.
Today the federal minimum wage is so low that several states have increased their minimums since the mid-1990's, and more than 40 city and county governments have passed "living wage" ordinances. These in effect are minimums, often $7 an hour or more, imposed on companies that do business with local governments. Less job turnover and more worker efficiency help to offset the cost, some studies have found.
All this is fodder for an old-style campaign debate over wages and labor power in the months ahead. That is certainly the hope of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed Mr. Gore. David Smith, director of public policy for the union, said, "We continue to be disappointed that there is not more broad public attention, in the campaign discourse or the public discourse, about the problems of low wage workers and slow wage growth."
Mr. Smith's disappointment may last through November.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Ayes of Texas;
If There's a Lone Star in the State, It Isn't the Governor

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH of Texas likes to remind voters and his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination that he runs one of the largest states in the country, a state so vast that if it were a country -- it once was one -- it would rank as the 11th largest economy in the world.
Bragging, of course, is a favorite sport in Texas, especially if the bragging is about Texas, but Mr. Bush's oft-repeated boast has a serious purpose. 
 In a race in which both his intellect and his experience have come under attack, Mr. Bush is reminding voters of two things: that he alone among the Republican contenders holds executive office, and that governing Texas is a big job, not unlike governing the nation.
Yet for all its mystique and undisputed national stature, Texas actually has one of the weakest gubernatorial offices in the country, a legacy of a Reconstruction-era constitution that was written to curb executive power.
According to political scientists, Texas stands anywhere from the bottom third to dead last among the 50 states, when ranked by the constitutional powers granted its governor.
"The imagined office is much greater than the real office," said Richard Murray, a political science professor at the University of Houston.
The result is a quirky paradox: the job offers a bully pulpit with national reach, yet it has fewer institutional powers than, say, the governor of Maryland.
The Texas governor has no formal cabinet because those positions are held by elected officials with their own political bases. The governor controls appointments to powerful state regulatory boards, but often the appointments are staggered from previous administrations.
And the governor is far less influential in the writing and administering of the budget, which is dominated by the Legislature and the lieutenant governor, compared to governors like Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey and George E. Pataki in New York. (The New York governor's office is considered the most powerful in the nation.)
Unlike New York, where governors have risen to the presidency (Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt), tried and failed (Al Smith and Nelson Rockefeller), or thought about it a good bit (Mario Cuomo), the Texas job has not served as springboard, at least not yet.
John Connally, regarded as the state's most successful modern governor, sought the Republican presidential nomination but lost badly. The state's two presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush, did their apprentice work in Washington, not Austin.
The job's inherent restrictions have always made it hard for even an ambitious Texas governor to accomplish the sort of big things that can launch a presidential run.
Mr. Connally managed to pass sweeping reforms and improvements to the state's higher education system in 1965. But he benefited from flush times and widespread public sympathy (his arm was in a sling from injuries he suffered while riding with John F. Kennedy on the day he was assassinated).
Governor Mark White later passed reforms to public schools, but with significant help from Ross Perot, who spent untold amounts of money lobbying for the measure.
What, then, of George W. Bush?
Does a weak office mean that Mr. Bush has been a weak governor?
Few academics or lawmakers in Texas would argue that.
In fact, the nature of the office has in many ways helped shape what some observers regard as the split personality of Mr. Bush's style of governing.
Upon taking office in 1995, Mr. Bush seemed to understand that he could succeed only with the goodwill of the Legislature.
He established a chummy, back-slapping tone, paying unexpected courtesy calls to flattered legislators in both parties and ingratiating himself with the two leading Democrats -- Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and House Speaker Pete Laney.
"It seems to be more of a lovefest with Bush," said State Representative Steven Wolens of Dallas, one of many Democratic legislators who speaks warmly of the governor. "He is very, very accessible. And he is pal-sy."
The result was that the 1995 Legislative session was regarded as a ringing success for the new governor.
He had set out four broad issues during the campaign -- juvenile justice, welfare reform, tort reform and education -- and legislation was enacted on all four.
None of it represented seismic change, and some observers complained that Mr. Bush hadn't led so much as jumped, in Clintonesque fashion, in front of a parade that was already underway.
In fact, all four issues were popular with voters and in the legislative pipeline before his election. But Mr. Bush was seen as effective.
"You have to coerce, cajole and convince these people to do what you want to do," said Mr. Bush's close friend, State Senator David Sibley, a Republican from Waco, in explaining the influence exerted by the governor.
Two years later, emboldened by his popularity and eager to burnish his legacy and his presidential ambitions, Mr. Bush proposed a sweeping overhaul of the state's unwieldy tax structure. Doing so might have ranked Mr. Bush with John Connally, who is credited with significantly improving the state's system of higher education.
But Mr. Bush failed.
His plan promised to lower property taxes and stabilize school funding while raising sales taxes, but an alternative bill was passed with the governor's blessing, only to die in the Senate at the hands of his fellow Republicans.
Mr. Bush did win a $1 billion tax cut that many regarded as a consolation prize.
Back in 1995, Mr. Bush was taking the Legislature where it was already heading. But his tax plan in 1997 represented a political risk for lawmakers, and he could not muster the support to get the deal done.
More important, in the eyes of some observers he failed to effectively use his bully pulpit -- perhaps the greatest tool of his weak office -- to rally public opinion.
Mr. Bush could have spoken out for his program before it was killed in the Senate, said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas.
"That would have been the point where he could have gone public and mobilized the public, and he chose not to," Mr. Buchanan said. Others credited the governor for taking a huge political gamble, even if he did fail.
Political observers were interested to see which Mr. Bush would greet the 1999 legislative session: The more cautious, if more successful, governor of 1995 or the bolder, if less successful, model of 1997.
There was no clear answer; Mr. Bush was widely regarded as playing defense as friendly lawmakers killed any bills that might present potential embarrassments during the presidential campaign.
The lessons that Mr. Bush has taken from his office seem mixed. Legislators describe him as flexible and hardly an ideologue. Several lawmakers, including Democrats, credited the governor for projecting a genuine sense of non-partisanship in his dealings with legislators.
Whether this talent is transferable to the presidency is uncertain. President Jimmy Carter's problems with the Georgia Legislature during his years as governor there seem now to have foreshadowed his later struggles with Congress.
President Clinton, however, had apparently learned the art of massaging legislative egos as governor of Arkansas, yet his relationship with Congress has often been poisonous.
"Does the ability to reach across party lines and work with people translate to Washington?" asked State Representative Paul Sadler, an influential East Texas Democrat. "The answer is, 'I don't know.' "
But others said Mr. Bush's collegial approach does not always work for a leader, even a popular leader, as seen in his tax failure.
"His approach has kept him from being bold because it's an approach that depends on the goodwill and friendship of others," Mr. Buchanan said. "It means not stepping on toes."

Saddam Does Vegas

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Because of rising oil demand from Asia, and the OPEC cartel's limiting of its production, the oil market has been very tight for the past six months. In this tight market, Saddam Hussein's Iraq became the enormously powerful swing producer -- the only country willing and able to suddenly turn on or off its oil tap. When Saddam was pumping his two million barrels a day, prices stayed steady or fell. But if he suddenly stopped, oil prices could skyrocket. On Nov. 23 Saddam suddenly stopped, sending prices soaring. He said he was doing this in protest of continuing U.N. sanctions. Don't believe it. Here's my guess at what Saddam and his oil minister were really saying to each other:
Saddam: So, how did our strategy work out? 
 Oil Minister: Great Leader, it worked like a charm. Last March OPEC agreed on production cuts in order to soak up world oil inventories and tighten up the market. After all those years of OPEC countries' cheating on their production, they actually did cut back. Just as we expected, that pushed prices up, from about $10 to $20 a barrel, and made our swing production that much more important. In July and August we started buying oil futures through our front companies in Europe. We went long on oil futures at an average of $20 a barrel. Over the months we bought 100 million barrels of futures. Then when you suddenly stopped our production in November, and the price went to $27, we picked up $7 a barrel. That's $700 million, Great Leader, in just a few weeks. That's almost as good as buying Internet stocks.
Saddam: And you were ready when I moved last week?
Oil Minister: Of course, Great Leader! As soon as you told me your plan to tell the U.N. by mid-December that you would resume pumping oil for food, I liquidated our oil futures at the top of the market and locked in our profits before the price fell. All the money's been sent to your Beirut bank account -- which is now The Mother of All Accounts. When will the Americans ever figure out how you've been funding yourself?
Saddam: And did you take care of our Chinese friends?
Oil Minister: Just as you instructed, Great Leader. We tipped them off early to our plan. It is hysterically funny for me to read the oil newsletters. They've all been asking why it was that the Chinese oil companies suddenly started buying up all the North Sea oil they could get their hands on in early November. The oil experts don't have a clue it was because the Chinese were in on our plan.
Saddam: You know the Americans keep thinking that Alan Greenspan is the Master of the Universe. But he's not. I am. I have the power to shoot oil prices up or down any time I want. I can create a lot of inflation and maybe even force Greenspan to raise interest rates. That wouldn't be good for the U.S. stock markets. The Pentagon can bomb me, but I can bomb the Nasdaq. They may discover I've got them over a barrel -- hah! Get it? Over a barrel!
Oil Minister: Great Leader, you are so funny. Speaking of jokes, how will you handle the Syrians cozying up to the Israelis and Americans?
Saddam: The Americans think they can isolate me by pulling the Syrians to their side and then by having the U.N. Security Council vote for their imperialist resolution that suspends the economic sanctions on Iraq -- provided I allow U.N. arms inspectors back here. But I don't want U.N. snoops here again, if I can help it. That may mean my people will have to go hungry some more, but hunger is good. It means they have less energy to focus on me.
The Americans should note that the French, Russians and Chinese all abstained from their U.N. resolution. That's because they look at the Syrian capitulation as another sign that the Americans want to run the whole Middle East. France, Russia and China believe that by supporting Iraq they can prevent U.S. hegemony.
There's a bet going on out here. Assad, Arafat, Mubarak, King Abdullah, they're all betting on the old order and the new emperor -- Emperor Uncle Sam. Me, I'm betting that after all these leaders go, a new Arab generation will come of age that will want a new order and will turn to me, Saddam Hussein, King of Kings, to kick out the Americans and regain their independence. I'm flush with cash right now, so, you wanna bet?

HEADLINE: Snake River Study Avoids Decision on Dams

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Saying the scientific evidence was not conclusive, federal officials have released a long-awaited study but have made no decision on whether to breach four Snake River dams to help restore salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.
The study of ways to change dam operations on the lower Snake River to help the salmon was released on Friday in Portland, Ore., by the Army Corps of Engineers. It included a recommendation from another federal agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, that the dams be breached. 
A spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service, Joan Jewett, said the agency's recommendation did not consider the economic and social effects of breaching the Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite dams.
Officials have emphasized that the debate was not just about dams and that the region must consider several steps to help the endangered fish.
Government agencies plan hearings early next year on what might be the best options for restoring Columbia River Basin salmon and steelhead trout.

HEADLINE: Living in a Van, Trying to Move Up

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Kathleen Gray bought the van brand new in 1978. It took half a year of waiting tables to make the $1,300 down payment. But it was well worth it. A Volkswagen pop-top camper!
The day she drove it home, she spread her sleeping bag in the cab, popped open the roof and lay under the built-in tent, daydreaming of a life on the road. 
 That life on the road did not work out as planned. Yet now, with its engine as loud as a helicopter when it agrees to work, the musty green van is more precious than ever. Every morning when Ms. Gray leaves for work, she worries that the van will be gone when she gets back. And then where would she be? The van is her home.
She and her boyfriend, David Aquino, began living in the van almost two years ago. Before the van became home, the couple lived for three months in a tent in an encampment at Golden Gate Park. Before that, both unemployed, they had been evicted from the house where Mr. Aquino grew up. Before that seems like a long time ago.
How Ms. Gray became homeless is a complicated story. But in one crucial respect, Ms. Gray's case is like those of many homeless people she meets: She got in a bind and had no way to get out of it. No money. No help.
Even now, six months into working two part-time jobs that together pay her nearly $1,200 a month, she can not say when she will be able to stop using a ratty blanket for a bed or a pickle jar for a toilet. Not with landlords asking for three months' rent up front, her boyfriend still not working and past-due bills waiting to attach themselves to her paycheck.
It is especially hard to be homeless in these days of giddy prosperity. For Ms. Gray, it is like having her nose pressed against the glass of a big party where money flutters in the air like confetti. San Francisco, flush with Silicon Valley professionals, has become so expensive that a six-figure income is considered middle-class, and basic items like a gallon of regular gas ($1.60) cost more than anywhere else in the country.
Ms. Gray has never been rich. Her parents divorced when she was 12. In her senior year of high school, she abandoned plans for college to support herself and her mother, who had cancer.
But she never thought she would have to count pennies at 44, in the prime of life. People she meets who are not homeless are always surprised to learn that she is; she defies the stereotype.
The Census Bureau survey of homeless people, released this month, showed that most were ill, physically or mentally. Ms. Gray is healthy. She does not drink or use illegal drugs. She does not come from welfare poverty. She is not a single mother.
Until three years ago, when she quit a job as a concessions manager at a Renaissance fair in Marin County to attend a school for prospective travel industry employees, she had worked nonstop since graduating from high school in Orange County.
Until she had to do it herself, she says, she always looked at the people living on the streets with something like revulsion.
"Now I know it's a lot harder to get out of the fix than to get in it," she said with a laugh, her usual punctuation, as she stopped at an Anderson's supermarket the other day on her way to work. By 7 every morning, after a round of catch with Kaya, a pit-bull mix she and Mr. Aquino adopted last year, they arrive at the supermarket to wash up. Then they buy the breakfast they can afford: large coffees, light and sweet.
Sometimes, Ms. Gray has no good answer when people ask why she does not go somewhere easier to live.
Living in a vehicle is illegal in San Francisco. Even in a desolate, wind-whipped neighborhood hard by the ocean, the police regularly shine lights into the van in the middle of the night. Once, when the van was towed for a parking violation, it took several days and $700 of scrounged and borrowed money to get it back.
Inside, the van is as dark and crowded as a storage closet. Good clothes, like his pin-striped interview suit and her pink down jacket, hang on a rod. Clean clothes are piled in his and hers stacks. Laundry sits in plastic grocery bags. Kaya's water and food dishes are by the driver's seat. Jars used as portable urinals are discretely lined up on the floor by a stack of boxes.
Ms. Gray, who is tall and broad-shouldered, with a long red braid, a curtain of bangs and wire-rimmed glasses, often laughs, loudly, at her daily tribulations. "We have to use a bathroom where we can find one," she said, laughing, making a beeline for a veterans' hospital near a park where they exercise Kaya.
"It's Ramen noodles for a week," she will say, laughing if she splurges on a $5 lunch.
"The police call me a habitual, known offender for sleeping in the van," she says, laughing. "And it's true: I sleep every night."
On weekdays, she works at the Coalition on Homelessness, a nonprofit advocacy organization. On weekends, she helps run showers for homeless people at the Mission High School. Her job perks include invitations to church potlucks and one long hot shower a week.
No one notices if her hair needs washing or she wears the same turquoise T-shirt two days in a row.
She and the short, bushy-haired Mr. Aquino often borrow the coalition's van, which they use to push Ms. Gray's van from one street to the next when it refuses to run.
They met playing darts at a pub. At the time Mr. Aquino, who will be 46 this month, had recently left an 11-year job as a sorter for the Postal Service. He says he quit in anger over a $20,000 bill he received for interest and penalties on child support (for a daughter, now in her 20's), which he thought he had paid.
Three months after they met, after a falling out with her roommate, Ms. Gray moved in with Mr. Aquino, who was living with his grandfather. Divorced from his daughter's mother, he had vowed he would never marry again, but Ms. Gray said, "We were going to."
But her wanderlust, whetted by six years as a waitress and bartender in Maui (where she bought her van), was not satisfied. She enrolled in the travel school, hoping for a job on a cruise ship. "It had this highfalutin title for what I wanted," she said. "Destination management."
Within months, Mr. Aquino's grandfather died. The house became the property of Mr. Aquino's estranged father and uncle, who evicted the couple so they could sell it. Neither Ms. Gray, with her savings gone and credit cards at their limits, nor Mr. Aquino, with his debts, were in a position to land on their feet.
"Well, of course, I wouldn't have quit my job if I knew all this was going to happen," Mr. Aquino said. "People just have no idea how hard it is to get out of the hole of homelessness. You spend your days surviving. You don't have room for much else."
Ms. Gray is convinced that if she and Mr. Aquino had been getting along at the time his grandfather died, they could have fought the eviction. Instead, they were busy fighting each other. It was so consuming, she said, that she dropped out of travel school, twice. She had Mr. Aquino arrested for assault after he broke a telephone on her head. A judge ordered him to attend an anger-management class.
Mr. Aquino prefers not to discuss that period. One day, when they were retracing their descent to the streets, Ms. Gray, laughing, said, "Well, things got really hairy when I had David arrested."
Mr. Aquino took his baseball cap off, tapped her on the head with it and said, "Hey, you stop that."
The day they were evicted, Ms. Gray invited Mr. Aquino to stay with her in her van until he found somewhere else. Throughout their ordeals, they have never separated.
She says she tried to leave, alone, before they were evicted. With both parents gone and her two brothers (one a minister in Oregon, the other a computer programmer in Southern California), out of touch, she called an old friend of her mother's and asked to borrow $5,000. The friend said she could not spare it.
These days, Ms. Gray and Mr. Aquino get along fairly well. Their dog is their therapy, Mr. Aquino says.
But they disagree dramatically over how to improve their situation.
Ms. Gray says it is best to take any job to begin repairing their broken credit. Mr. Aquino says it is not worth getting a job that pays less than $10 an hour, because it would be impossible to save money making less. He still receives $345 a month as part of a city program that tries to steer assistance recipients into solid jobs. (He once cleaned buses for his stipend.) He says he hopes to become a truck driver.
While Ms. Gray is still not used to being homeless, she says her worst moment occurred at the beginning, when she and Mr. Aquino were living in Golden Gate Park. (Ms. Gray's van was in a friend's driveway in Marin County, refusing to run). Ms. Gray had just started workfare two days a week for the Parks and Recreation Department for $345 a month. One day, the parks department was ordered to sweep all the homeless camps from the park. Ms. Gray, as part of the crew, was forced to dump her own meager possessions.
"I remember at the time, thinking well, I was guilty," she said. "I was living in the park, Now, I see things so differently. With these sweeps, the city was -- and is -- systematically destroying people's personal property. Blankets, prescription medicine, glasses, documents. And I watched as bosses looked the other way while workfare workers were allowed to keep -- to steal -- things."
She and 10 other homeless people sued the city in small claims court for the illegal destruction of their property and won. She received $500 in damages.
Lately she has been worried about how to help a quadriplegic homeless woman in her 30's. The woman spends nights on the ground, crawling to her chair in the mornings. By the end of the week, when Ms. Gray helps the woman take a shower, her body and clothes are soaked in feces and urine.
"I think two things when I see her," Ms. Gray said one morning in the van. "First, I think, How can we allow this to happen?
"Then," she said, letting her head fall back against a tattered window curtain, "I think, Boy, am I lucky. I am just so lucky."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Straining to Keep a Place That They Can Call Home

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
When Constance B., 62, moved into her studio apartment in the Fordham section of the Bronx 19 years ago, she was a freelance writer and English tutor. Since then, she has lost her sight and suffered kidney disease as a result of acute diabetes. And she fears she may well lose her apartment because of rent increases.
"It's a struggle, because I'm on a fixed income," she said. "Every two years my lease expires, and I have to pay the rent increase. Every two years my rent increases, but my income stays the same." 
 In July, Constance's rent rose to $438 a month from the $420 a month in the previous lease. In May, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, paid $1,000 of Constance's back rent, and she was able to pay $677 of the arrears herself.
As the New York economy continues to thrive, land values and rent are soaring, but the boom is leaving behind those living on a fixed income, or those who are temporarily out of work.
In addition to the economy, there are demographic reasons for the costly rental market, said Michael H. Schill, director of the New York University School of Law's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. The city's housing supply, historically tight, is being squeezed even more as the population grows in certain neighborhoods.
"It's a simple case of supply and demand," he said. "You have an increase in demand, and you have a relatively stagnant supply, so what you have is skyrocketing prices."
"The housing shortage in New York is really quite severe," he said. "Approximately a quarter of the city's renters pay over half their incomes in rent, which is a tremendous rent burden."
Mr. Schill said that many New Yorkers are in that situation, but the problem is especially acute for the poor.
"The problems of affordability affect renters across the income spectrum, but they are particularly concentrated among the very poor," he said.
With circumstances so dire, the charities that benefit from the Neediest Cases Fund often have to step in with assistance. That can mean supplying the money for people like Constance, who are on fixed incomes and facing higher rents; aiding families that have been forced from their homes by fires or other catastrophes find new quarters; or helping a family move when one parent leaves, taking much of the household's income.
 
THE RENT
Rescued From Brink Of Homelessness
Constance, who asked that her full name not be used, lives on $587 a month in Supplemental Security Income, and receives $127 a month in food stamps. Her biggest expense is rent.
About five years ago, she lost her sight. More recently, her kidneys began to fail. "When you have diabetes, first the eyes go, then the kidneys," she said.
"Blindness has not destroyed me, because I would not let it," she said. "My memory has increased, my hearing has increased. It wasn't so tragic coming to me in later years. Dialysis has changed my life more than anything else."
Each week, Constance has three four-hour dialysis treatments, a process in which her blood is cleaned by a machine. "That doesn't allow much time to do anything," she said. "The day after dialysis you're usually very weak and drained."
Because she was never in top health, Constance said, she was not able to hold a 9-to-5 job that could have given her a pension. She worked for many years as a freelance writer, she said, and she tutored students in English at her home. For now, she is scraping by.
Constance said she might find more affordable housing, but is afraid to move to a new neighborhood. "If I went into a new neighborhood, I wouldn't know where anything is, I wouldn't know where the street ends," she said. "After 20 years I know all the means of transportation. When I go out, people look out for me, but in a new neighborhood no one would know me. My neighbors know me here; I know their telephones so I can call them if I'm in distress. So I struggle to pay my rent."
Constance's is just one of 451 households the federation was able to assist by Dec. 1 this year with checks for back rent or security deposits for new apartments, said Judy Milone, the federation's director of client services. She said that most of the people the federation helped were able to pay their rent over the long term, but fell behind for a month or so because they had lost their jobs or had to pay medical expenses.
Chelita Coleman, 58, like many people who have been helped by the federation, had worked her whole life when she was laid off from her job as a legal secretary and fell behind on her rent.
In the aftermath of the layoff, she took computer courses to enhance her resume. But after eight months without a job, she found she was unable to pay the $426 rent on her one-bedroom apartment in a Mitchell-Lama building near Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, and she fell further and further behind.
"It was mind-boggling to think: 'Where am I going to go? What am I going to do? How am I going to pack all my stuff up?' " she recalled. But before she could be evicted, she called the federation, which reviewed her case and issued her landlord a check for $521.
Ms. Coleman now works as the transcripts secretary at Yeshiva University, and with her annual salary of $22,500, she can now manage her rent, she said.
"Requests for diversion from homelessness is the major need that we see," said Megan McLaughlin, executive director of the federation. "The overwhelming majority of the direct cash assistance goes to people who need money to prevent homelessness.
"As we're pushing people to work, we have to look at the relationship between income and rent," she said. "There are people working full time that cannot keep up with their rent, eat, and take care of the basic human requirements."
Ms. Milone said the federation had helped more families stay in their homes with each year, as donations to the Neediest Cases Fund have gone up. Still, the federation had enough money to help only about 13 percent of the 3,366 households that asked for assistance.
The federation is forced to set priorities. "For rental assistance, we need know why they're behind with their rent to begin with," Ms. Milone said. "It has to be something reasonable and something they can document. We also need to see that they have sufficient income right now to pay their future rent."
As important as housing is in itself, a housing crisis can lead to untold related problems, Ms. McLaughlin said.
"When families are disrupted, schooling is a problem, health care is a problem," she said. "You cannot conduct a job search properly without an address and a phone number, let alone plan for an interview."
 
THE FIRE
Children Are Saved, But a Home Is Lost
But being unable to pay the rent is not only way that people can become homeless. A fire can have the same effect, only more suddenly.
Randy Dillard's first thought as he stood in his underwear in front of his Harlem apartment building on the night of July 15 was of his children. He had just been burned out of his apartment, and he recalled thinking, "What am I going to do with these five kids?"
Randy Dillard was already struggling to raise his five children, one of whom is autistic and one of whom is blind in one eye, even before the fire, which destroyed his two-and-a-half-room, seventh-floor apartment on Morningside Avenue.
Mr. Dillard was able to rescue all five of his children as the apartment burned, but he lost everything he owned.
The fire, which was caused by a malfunctioning electrical socket, destroyed the family's furniture and clothes, photographs and a wooden plaque that Mr. Dillard's mildly autistic son, Nathan Taylor, received for doing well in school.
But Mr. Dillard said he had not given much thought to the things lost in the fire, because he spent most of his time trying to find a new apartment that he can afford, while hoping to avoid public housing projects.
Lacking fire insurance, he and his children were placed in a homeless shelter in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, but Mr. Dillard did not like it there. Not only did his children face an hourlong commute to their school in Harlem, but they were treated roughly by the young people in the neighborhood.
Mr. Dillard, who is separated from his wife, left his job as a construction worker in 1994 to raise his children full time. After about a year, he exhausted his savings and had to turn to public assistance for help. He now must feed and clothe his children, Nathan, Romeo and Joseph Taylor, 11, 10 and 8, and Randy Dillard Jr., 9, and Lynn Dillard, 2, with the money he receives from welfare, a check for $150 every two weeks, and a $523 Supplemental Security Income check for Nathan Taylor once a month.
"I stretch it, I squeeze it," he said, but he has also received help from the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven charities supported by Neediest Cases Fund.
"The main thing is that they eat a lot, and she grows out of stuff as soon as she gets it," he said, looking at his 2-year-old daughter as she worked on a pencil drawing.
Before worrying about paying the rent, Mr. Dillard struggles just to give necessities like food and clothing to his children. The Children's Aid Society gave Lynn $100 worth of summer clothing that she desperately needed. The society has also given Mr. Dillard money for Christmas presents for his children, and it paid for a bed and chest of drawers, bed linens and socks.
After the fire, Mr. Dillard made sure that three of his children remained at the same school so that at least one thing in their lives would remain constant.
After that, by placing telephone calls to City Hall, he was able to win a rarely granted transfer from one housing shelter to another. The family now lives in a room at a shelter in northern Harlem, and Mr. Dillard is grateful that he can live there for now.
"We've got a roof over our heads -- it's not our roof, but at least we have our lives," he said.
At the new shelter, Mr. Dillard's children are much closer to their school, P.S. 180 on West 120th Street, than they had been in Brooklyn -- just a half-hour ride on the M7 bus.
Mr. Dillard's children said they were eager to leave the new shelter despite its proximity to the school. "They got rats and mice in the place," said Joseph. "And there's bad kids there. You know they're bad kids, because bad kids light the garbage on fire."
Mr. Dillard was hoping to become a chef, but the fire dashed his plans for the time being, forcing him to focus instead on finding a place to live other than the shelter.
The housing placement office at the shelter has placed Mr. Dillard on a waiting list for an apartment, but he said he was not sure if an offer of housing would come in five months or tomorrow, or if the offer will be acceptable, given his wariness of public housing.
"If they place me to a project, if I turn it down, I go all the way to the back of the list," he said.
The Children's Aid Society is focused on providing stability to the Dillard family, and when Mr. Dillard eventually finds a new place to live, the society will be there to help him furnish it. "When they find a house, if they need beds and a dresser, the only way we can help them is with New York Times money," said Mary Hutson, the social worker who works with Mr. Dillard.
 
THE CALL FOR HELP
Selling Off Treasures To Keep Apartment
 Jerry Leff, 62, lives in an apartment in Rego Park, Queens. In his 25 years there, his rent has risen to more than 70 percent of his income.
When he was 50, Mr. Leff was laid off as a magazine art director after the stock market downturn of 1987. Worried that he was too old to get a new job in his field, he lost confidence. He eventually began working as a clerk at a bingo hall and as a cook at a center for disabled children. He worked 10 more years, until his arthritis became too painful for him to continue.
At the bingo parlor, Mr. Leff cleaned the floor and wiped tables and moved chairs from place to place. "The years at the bingo hall killed my legs," he said.
Now Mr. Leff, who walks with a cane, stays in his rent-regulated apartment most of the time. Paying the $713 month rent and his other expenses is a constant challenge.
And with the tight rental market, it is unlikely that he could find a less expensive apartment, said his social worker, Karen Norden. Then there are his health concerns and the cost of moving.
Three times since 1996, Mr. Leff has gone to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, another one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, for help in paying his back rent. The three well-timed checks amounted to $2,000.
"If Jerry had been evicted, I don't think he could even afford a furnished room," Ms. Norden said. "I think he would probably end up in the street or in a nursing home."
Mr. Leff receives $871 a month in Social Security Disability Income, and $127 each month in food stamps. And because of a state program called Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption, his rent will remain the same, while his disability income will increase slightly as the years go by, Ms. Norden said. She expects that he will not need help with his rent in the future.
Earlier this year, before he was helped the second time, in October, Mr. Leff wanted Ms. Norden to think everything was fine, so he told her that he was keeping up with his rent. But at the time he selling off possessions that were dear to him: his extensive watch collection, his series of first-edition Sherlock Holmes novels, and some of his furniture, including a love seat, a chair and two bureaus.
Finally, after his cat, Wilson, died, he realized he had to turn to the social welfare agency for help. Crying, he called Ms. Norden and told her that he had been lying when he said he was getting by.
"I hate to feel that I can't support myself," Mr. Leff said. "But it's the truth. I fell on hard times."
Mr. Leff said he wished his arthritis would allow him to return to his last job, as a Marshall's sales representative, which paid slightly more than minimum wage. "It just felt good to be working," he said.

HEADLINE: Experts Wonder if Crime Drop Is Near End

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
The overall crime rate in New York City declined again this year, but a rise in homicides and several other factors have led some criminologists to question whether the decade-long descent is about to bottom out.
Through Dec. 12, crime has fallen by 8 percent over last year, police statistics show. But during that same period, the homicide rate, which is often viewed as a bellwether for larger trends in crime, surged by 8 percent. It was the first increase in any major crime category in the city in eight years. 
 Although crime dropped last year in every one of the city's 76 police precincts, 4 of them showed increases this year, as local burglary or robbery rates began to rebound. In one neighborhood, the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, the number of major crimes grew by 18 percent.
Many criminologists believe that crime trends are reliably cyclical, and several predicted that New York, given the patterns in its history, was at the end of the downturn.
"I am leaning toward the conclusion that we have reached bottom," said James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. "The years of double-digit declines may be over."
New York's police officials, whose efforts have helped push crime to 30-year lows, rejected any suggestion that the tide was turning. They said they had battled such skepticism and pessimism since the early 1990's, when many people kept insisting that a safer city was a pipe dream long after the crime rate had begun to plunge.
Although the homicide rate rose this year, the officials said, 158 American cities still rank above New York in crimes reported per capita, including tourist destinations like Orlando, Fla. And, they said, the broad pattern of decreases in other offenses is evidence that the rise in homicides is an aberration, not a portent.
For example, robberies fell by 9 percent and assaults declined by 10 percent this year. Overall, crime remains down 55 percent compared with the rate six years ago, a statistic that many credit with fueling New York's booming popularity with tourists.
"People every year keep saying, 'It's bottomed out. It's over,' " said Edward T. Norris, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for operations. "But we still find areas where we can improve on. I don't know when we will bottom out, but I don't think we have hit the bottom yet."
Nationally, crime is now dropping even faster than it is in New York. Overall, crime was down 10 percent nationwide for the first six months of this year, the latest period for which comparative data is available, according to the Department of Justice, compared with 7.7 percent in New York City. Crime in New York State declined by 9 percent during the same six-month period.
Similarly, homicides are still down nationally, by 13 percent, although they were up slightly in cities with populations greater than one million, like New York. Although criminologists cautioned against making sweeping predictions from a year's worth of data, some suggested that New York's small rise in homicides might foretell a national trend.
"The big cities led the way when the numbers went down, and they also may be leading the way as the numbers plateau," Mr. Fox said.
But several other criminologists said they shared the Police Department's optimism, largely because of a continuing decline in auto theft in the city, which fell by 10 percent this year and is considered a very reliable indicator. "Auto theft is reported well because the insurance company won't pay you unless you file a police report," said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private organization.
Experts also noted that the social forces that drove the crime wave of the late 1980's -- a stagnant economy and a raging epidemic of drug use that lured many unemployed young men into the violence of the narcotics trade -- have not resurfaced.
But other criminologists said that even without such social accelerants, crime in the city has historically spiraled up and down in fairly regular cycles. In the last three decades, for example, the crime rate has peaked in 1972, 1979 and 1990, and then slumped for several years before rising again, said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist who teaches at Columbia University.
"If we are not at the bottom now, we are likely to hit the bottom very soon," Mr. Fagan said. "You can't have unending crime increases or decreases, and the past is the best predictor of the future."
In neighborhoods where crime has rebounded, it is often the sight of resurgent street-corner drug traffic, not any statistical abstraction, that has local leaders concerned. In the Seventh Precinct, for example, which covers the Lower East Side, serious crime is up 8 percent, including a 16 percent rise in robberies and a 26 percent increase in burglaries. City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez said tenant groups began noticing an increase in street-corner drug sales about 18 months ago.
"We think there is a connection between this activity and the rise in burglaries and the robberies," she said. "There is no question to me."
Predicting patterns becomes particularly difficult when the period being studied is already somewhat unusual, as the last nine years have been. Seldom has crime in the city declined as sharply as it has in the past few years, criminologists said.
"Look at how much difficulty economists have with the stock market," said Eric Monkkonen, a historian of crime who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles. "And this is much more complicated than the stock market."
Mr. Monkkonen, who is writing a book about murder in New York City, said that the last time crime dropped so precipitously in the city was in 1931, when New York was reeling from the Depression. There were 562 homicides that year, only 17 percent fewer than the number projected for this year. By 1943, when the nation and its young men were fully engaged in World War II, the number of homicides had dropped to 208.
This year, overall crime has declined in every borough, as well as in the subway system and in public housing. Citywide, rapes went down by 16 percent and burglaries declined by 13 percent. Shooting incidents increased by less than 1 percent, even though gun arrests were down by 14 percent.
Certain places grew noticeably safer, like Central Park, where overall crime declined by 30 percent, including a 22 percent drop in robberies and a 52 percent drop in assaults. Crime also dropped dramatically in the 33rd Precinct, which covers much of Washington Heights, where there was a 30 percent drop in assaults.
But the homicide rate rose in both of those places and across much of the city for reasons police officials are still exploring. Officials estimate the homicide count will rise to 680 by year's end, compared with 633 last year, although the number is still nowhere near the toll in 1990, when the city suffered through a record 2,245 homicides.
Commissioner Norris said the homicide rate appeared to have been driven up by an increase in gang activity, a surge in domestic violence and a downturn in aggressiveness by the police after the shooting of Amadou Diallo, which provoked criticism that too many officers were brutish on patrol. The department has tried to address these concerns with initiatives, like expanding domestic violence units in some precincts and forcing more officers to work weekends, when much of the alcohol-related domestic abuse occurs, the commissioner said.
As a result of the initiatives, officials said, the homicide rate has slowed dramatically since June, when homicides were running 15 percent ahead of last year's tally. For the second half of the year, homicides increased by 2 percent.
Several criminologists said one factor that could lead to an increase in crime in New York was the anticipated growth over the next few years in a crime-prone population, young men 15 to 24 years old. To analysts who believe that demographic trends have as much to do with crime patterns as police work, the New York City decline has always been partly explained by a drop in the number of teenagers and young males during the last eight years.
Police officials resist this notion that somehow their efforts -- a crackdown on quality-of-life offenses, a commitment to gun seizures, a re-emphasis on intelligence-gathering and neighborhood drug initiatives -- played second fiddle to the dictates of a particular population decline.
"We take a lot of credit for most of the decline," Mr. Norris said. "As it goes up, I think we would take a lot of the criticism. But we are confident that we can reduce further and certainly maintain the gains we've enjoyed."

HEADLINE: Six Years in the Making, a Reconstructed Metro-North Station Opens in Harlem

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

 BODY:
Ruby Parra of the Bronx remembers having to stand under an umbrella as she waited to buy tickets inside the decrepit 125th Street Metro-North station.
"It used to be bad. I tried to stay away from it," she said of the station, which reopened yesterday after six years of reconstruction. The leaking roof has been fixed, the paint on the 1897 building is fresh, but historically accurate, there are refurbished bathrooms and a new elevator, and a heated waiting area overlooks the tracks. 
 Maria Mosca of Manhattan, who was waiting for a train to Katonah, said the station used to be a wreck. "It's just been a pleasure this morning to sit here and look around," she said, relaxing on the waiting room's restored original oak benches.
In the midst of exuberant economic growth along East and West 125th Streets, the station, at Park Avenue, is a small piece of the new Harlem renaissance, made more of steel and concrete than art and poetry.
It is tucked under the tracks above Park Avenue, barely a block from where a Pathmark supermarket opened recently and a movie theater is expected to be built soon, and just a few blocks from Harlem U.S.A., a shopping center under construction at Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th Street.
Inside the station, the trim is done in a hearty green, suitably Victorian, selected after research into paint samples of the era. The solid oak tongue-and-groove paneling imitates the original, which dripping water had ruined. Textured quarry tile provides traction underfoot, and a new stairway design lets people move more easily between tracks. At the station, 20-foot-wide steel and concrete platforms replaced 16-foot-wide ones made of timber and asphalt. Six-inch-thick concrete slabs, molded to look like cedar bark, deflect sound that used to reach the street. Aluminum relief sculptures along the bridge over 125th Street, by a New York artist, Terry Adkins, borrow Sphinx motifs from Aaron Douglas, an artist from the Harlem Renaissance.
The Federal Transit Administration paid for 80 percent of the $148 million project, with the state paying the balance. About 90 percent of the cost was not for the station, but for reconstruction of the century-old, mile-long viaduct carrying the tracks from 110th to 131st Streets.
The route through the area has a long history. The tracks extended north to Harlem at street level in 1837, and by 1860 trains struck a person or an animal almost every week, according to news reports of the time. The tracks were then lowered below street level north of 116th Street.
After a navigable connection was cut from the Hudson River to the Harlem River in the 1890's, allowing boats from upstate to travel down the East Side, the railroad bridge across the Harlem River needed to be raised, so the steel viaduct was built.
It now carries 650 trains a day. To reconstruct it, workers had to replace half of its steel girders. They used 6,000 tons of steel and 10,000 cubic yards of concrete. Under the viaduct, at the cross streets, lighting has been improved.
Poor drainage damaged both the station and the viaduct. Often, puddles would cause drips from one rainstorm to another, leaking brown drops of water onto people on the street below. "It was like Chinese water torture," said Walter Sewell, the project manager for Metro-North.
David Givens, chairman of Community Board 11, welcomed the end of the project. "I'm certainly happy that it's finally over, after numerous years of inconvenience," he said. "We are excited by it. The renovated station certainly adds a jewel in our crown here in East Harlem."
He said he hoped more passengers would get off at the Harlem station and take the subway south from 125th Street, avoiding the crowds at Grand Central Terminal.
Joseph Roberts, an employee of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, said the new station may attract passengers seeking a nonstop ride from 125th Street to Grand Central, for as low as $3.25.
Speaking of the project's planners, he said, "With everything else that's happening in Harlem, they had great foresight."
Sue Glass, who lives in upper Manhattan, was looking forward to trying out the elevator. "This is so much better, to use the elevator to get up, when you have arthritis in your knees, like I do," she said.
Near her, a woman in a fur coat headed to the tracks with her small black-and-white dog, which was wearing a fur-trimmed jacket. A man with a scarf in Burberry tartan hoisted monogrammed leather luggage, and 3-year-old Chloe Campbell waited with her grandmother for a train to Beacon. She pronounced the station beautiful, announced that she speaks English, and lodged one complaint, about a dark television monitor hanging from the ceiling.
"Where's the TV at?" she asked.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Cleveland's Long Road Finally Leads to Finley

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Cleveland Indians traveled a long and treacherous road to sign Chuck Finley. It took them over the ruts and potholes of four free-agent markets and an endless number of talks aimed at generating the right trades. They were left behind in the wake of the movement of pitchers like Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez, Orlando Hernandez and Randy Johnson.
Before signing Finley last week, the Indians had struck out in their pursuit of a string of top-line starting pitchers in the past four years. The only one they succeeded in obtaining was Jack McDowell, whom they signed as a free agent in December 1995, and then he blew out his arm after one season. 
 "It's been a combination of things," John Hart, the Indians' industrious general manager, said. "Some of it is economics, some of it that there were more buyers than players. We just haven't been able to land the guys we wanted."
The Indians wanted Clemens when he was a free agent following the 1996 season. They competed for him with the Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays. The offers were similar. Clemens said at the time he wanted to play for a team that had a chance to go to the World Series. The Indians went in 1997, the Yankees in '98; Clemens, however, signed with the Blue Jays.
That same winter the Indians also pursued Alex Fernandez and thought they had him. But at the last minute his wife convinced him to play in Miami, their hometown, and the Indians lost him, too.
After the 1997 season, the Indians renewed their efforts to get a top-notch starting pitcher. They discussed a trade with Montreal for Martinez, but the Expos accepted an offer from the Boston Red Sox. The Indians then negotiated with a trio of free agents, Wilson Alvarez, Darryl Kile and Andy Benes, but other teams offered far more than they wanted to pay.
Straying off the beaten path, they looked at another kind of free agent that winter, the Cuban defector known as El Duque. They were one of two or three finalists, but the Indians did not feel they had enough information to warrant the four-year $6.6 million contract the Yankees offered him. Hernandez became just another one who got away.
But the one who really got away was Randy Johnson. It was the day of the 1998 trading deadline, and the Seattle Mariners were ready to trade Johnson, who was three months from free agency. The Indians, thinking they were among the front-runners, were envisioning Johnson at the head of their rotation, pitching against the Yankees in the playoffs.
Only the Houston Astros swooped in at the last minute and snatched Johnson out of the Indians' rotation and placed him neatly into theirs.
"If you look at our club traditionally," Hart said, "we've either developed players or made major trades. Our forays into the free-agent market haven't been big, except for Robby Alomar last year."
Acquiring Johnson would have been a major trade. That the Indians did not get him was a major disappointment. When he became a free agent after he pitched for the Astros in the postseason, the Indians did not make a competitive offer for him. Nor did they for Kevin Brown, although they liked the thought of having him. But then, no one made a competitive offer for Brown. The Los Angeles Dodgers gave him $40 million more than his next highest offer.
Moving back to the trade route last winter, the Indians tried again to get Clemens but lost out again, this time to the Yankees. Then last July they made another deadline stab at bolstering their corps of starters, trying for Finley and Scott Erickson of Baltimore. Neither was traded.
Last month Andy Ashby was traded, by the San Diego Padres to the Philadelphia Phillies. The Indians tried for him, too, but they did not want to relinquish the prospects the Padres wanted.
It was their desire to hold on to their prospects that prompted them to pay more to sign Finley for what will turn out to be $25 million for three years, bringing an end to their four years of failure.
"We were fortunate to land him," Hart said. "I thought we were out of it at the winter meetings. We were reluctant to go beyond where we were. But as we examined our club, we kept coming back to the feeling that Chuck was the guy."
It also became apparent to Hart at the meetings last week that he was not going to be able to trade for a pitcher. The Indians have been one of the best teams in the American League for the past six seasons. But their experience in the opening round of October's playoffs was embarrassing.
Finding themselves short of starters, the Indians used two on three days' rest instead of on the usual four. Bartolo Colon and Charles Nagy lasted a total of four innings as the Indians squandered a two-games-to-one lead against the Red Sox.
Finley gives the Cleveland rotation a stronger look, though how much stronger they will have to see.
"We're not advertising him as Randy Johnson or Pedro Martinez," Hart said. But at least the Indians have Finley, the proverbial bird in hand who is worth the two who never made it to the Indians.
 
A Man for the No. 7 Train
Does Todd Zeile like New York?
"I have always wanted the opportunity to play in New York City," the Mets' new first baseman said. "I've always loved the opportunity to play there when it's been against the Mets or the Yankees. I've been there three different times in playoff atmosphere against the Yankees. In the world of sports there's no place that compares to New York City for an athlete."
But does he really like New York?
"I have teammates who are afraid to go out of the hotel when they get to the city," he said. "I've always loved the city. I think there's so much to do. I have children I'd love to expose to the culture. I have great interest in the city as a whole outside of the game of baseball."
Did he, like some of those teammates, ever just stay in the hotel?
"Absolutely not," he said. "My representatives have been there a number of years now, so I've been able to see the city and the personality of the city for much more than what I initially saw there. Julianne, my wife, who was involved in gymnastics" -- she was Julianne McNamara, 1984 Olympic gold medalist -- "traveled extensively since she was young. She helped introduce me to different things about the city. I figured if she had no fear of the city and there was so much out there to see and experience, I should do it. I grew to love it. Every time there was an opportunity to go to New York City, I couldn't wait, and I often had my family join me there."
Doesn't he even mind the dreaded news media the city features?
"I know that media scrutiny is a great part of what people are afraid of in that city," he said, "but I think if you're honest, if you tell it like it is, if you don't run from your responsibilities, what's the problem? The key to this is stand up and be honest with the people who try to interpret what you do and why. I welcome the challenge. If you can have success there, it's a different feeling than anywhere else, at least in athletics."
 
The Ethics Dodgers
Once upon a time the Los Angeles Dodgers portrayed themselves as the epitome of a well-run, highly efficient, purest-of-pure organization. It was only a fairy tale, it seems.
The Dodgers are not the only organization that has signed Latin players illegally; some others have even been caught. But the Dodgers were nabbed having scouted players in Cuba and spiriting them out of the off-limits island, then lying about where they discovered them, and now they have been caught with a gun that spews so much smoke the city had to declare a smog alert.
Not only did the Dodgers sign Adrian Beltre, their young third baseman from the Dominican Republic, a year before he became legal age at 16, but they kept obviously altered documents in their files for the commissioner's office to find as proof of their illegal behavior.
Commissioner Bud Selig is expected to rule on the matter tomorrow, and he may allow the Dodgers to keep Beltre while issuing a heavy fine and other disciplinary action. And he may extend the foreign-signing ban imposed on the club in the Cuban matter, which was supposed to end next Friday.
But if he allows the Dodgers to keep Beltre, thus avoiding an expensive free-agent pursuit among several clubs, he will almost certainly trigger a grievance from the players association.
"Our current inclination is to file if they don't grant him free agency," said Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, "but I want to read the opinion. It may have something in it. But it's going to have to be a very persuasive opinion for us not to file."

HEADLINE: St. Barnabas Won't Renew City Contract

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
St. Barnabas Hospital, which won a coveted contract almost three years ago to manage Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, one of the city's public hospitals, has decided not to renew the contract when it expires in June, executives from both sides said yesterday.
St. Barnabas won the contract in 1997 by promising the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation that it would cut costs and improve the medical staff at Lincoln, which has one of the country's busiest emergency rooms and serves a mostly-poor patient base in the south Bronx. The relationship quickly became tense as St. Barnabas dismissed many senior doctors. 
 In the last year, the corporation has pressured St. Barnabas to improve the care at Lincoln Hospital, particularly in its emergency room, which the federal government had cited for deficiencies. And last month, the chief of Lincoln's obstetrics-gynecology department, who was hired by St. Barnabas, resigned.
The Health and Hospitals Corporation contracts with medical centers around the city to provide doctors for many of its hospitals. Since 1995, the corporation has tied its fees for these services to performance. The Lincoln contract paid about $94 million for three years, but could have gone as high as $102 million. St. Barnabas also has a $500 million contract with the city to provide medical services to prisoners at Rikers Island.
St. Barnabas's president, Dr. Ronald Gade, has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing efficiency by using fewer doctors and other staff members and pressing for shorter hospital stays. Union officials, competitors and many doctors have argued that this has eroded the quality of care, especially in the case of the prisoners. When the contract with Lincoln expired this summer, St. Barnabas was to have been offered a one-year extension, said the corporation's president, Dr. Luis Marcos, but on Dec. 14 he received a letter from St. Barnabas's lawyers saying that they would decline to renew it, in the interest of both parties.
"We were brought in to organize the medical staff at Lincoln," Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Dr. Gade, said yesterday. "We feel our mission is accomplished."
Dr. Marcos said yesterday: "I agree with St. Barnabas that this is in the interest of both parties. This gives H.H.C. the chance to move ahead to a higher level by working more directly with physicians. I don't expect any difficulty in the transition."

Iowa's Invisible Man Casts a Long Shadow

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Dec. 18

 BODY:
For months, Senator John McCain has been insisting that he will not participate in Iowa's first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses next month. He says he has only limited resources for his presidential quest and that in the early going he will concentrate on New Hampshire, South Carolina and Arizona.
He has no organization in Iowa, has run no ads and has been in the state only twice this year, once in April to hold a Congressional hearing on air fares (hardly a campaign appearance) and again last Monday to participate in a debate with the other Republican contenders (it was televised nationally, not just in Iowa). 
 So, as he says, he is not running in Iowa.
And yet he is here.
Despite his physical absence from the state, he was running a strong third in one recent Iowa poll, closing fast on Steve Forbes, who is spending a fortune, literally, to hang on to the No. 2 spot as he chases the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Further, reports of Mr. McCain's campaigning in other states show up daily in Iowa newspapers and on Iowa television, and McCain bumper stickers and placards can be spotted here and there. Periodically, too, there have been reports that calls have been made around the state on his behalf, though there is no evidence that he sanctioned them.
And then there was that closing remark in Monday's debate after Mr. McCain had pinned a boondoggle lable on the federal energy program that subsidizes production of ethanol, a fuel additive made from corn, a lot of it Iowa corn.
In what was almost an aside, but not quite, he called for a "hardy band of brave souls" to turn out and vote for him on caucus night, Jan. 24.
What's going on here?
A delicate political dance, as many Iowa political pros see it.
The way they analyze the senator's acts and words, he is trying to set up a win-win situation in which he keeps his profile as high as possible in Iowa, but at the same time does not become so involved in the state that he raises undue expectations about how he will fare on caucus night.
Or, as Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University, put it the other day, if Mr. McCain should finish in the top three in the caucuses without genuinely competing, he would be entitled to "some bragging rights" on the eve of the next crucial nominating test, the New Hampshire primary.
But why the head-on McCain attack on ethanol in the nation's leading corn-producing state?
"Two plausible reasons," says David Yepsen of The Des Moines Register, the dean of the state's political reporters. "One, agriculture accounts for just 20 percent of the new, much-diversified Iowa economy. Two, the Iowa vote is now more diverse too, and a maverick reformer like McCain could have a certain appeal here, as elsewhere around the country."
One thing more:
He'll be back shortly for another debate.

Israel and Syria Agree On January Peace Talks

After co-existing uneasily for 50 years in a state of war and the last 4 years in cold silence, Israel and Syria have agreed to agree. President Clinton announced that the two countries would begin intensive and accelerated peace talks Jan. 3 at a site near Washington, to be determined.
"Over the past 48 hours, Israel and Syria have taken critical steps in the journey toward peace," Mr. Clinton said at the White House, flanked by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria. "The journey will be a difficult one. But with courage and perseverance on both sides, the result will be deeply rewarding to the people of Israel and to the people of Syria." 
 No deadline was set for reaching agreement on issues that include borders, security, terrorism, water rights and economic relations.

HEADLINE: C. Vann Woodward, Historian Who Wrote Extensively About the South, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
C. Vann Woodward, whose gifts of scholarship, storytelling and social conscience combined to produce some of the most readable and respected histories of the South, died on Friday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 91 years old.
Mr. Woodward regarded himself as an old-fashioned storyteller who was as interested in the literature and culture of the South as he was in its turbulent economics and politics of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
 He took to heart the lessons of literature. He conceded that his interest in Southern writers would lead to accusations that he was nothing more than "a chronicler with a weakness for history-with-a-purpose and . . . the still graver charge of being a historian, dedicated to fact, who is inspired by fiction."
He had little use for historians who produced tomes that lacked the grace he found in literature. "History as currently written is bland, banal or philistine" and "often morally obtuse, ethically archaic and intellectually insipid," he told the American Historical Association in 1970, as he completed a term as its president.
He argued that history should not be confused with the natural sciences and was not comfortable with it being regarded as a social science. He thought of it as an art form rooted in scholarship. He saw history as a field where "the main excitement of the adventure comes in the writing."
"The historian-detective," he said, "does not really know how it will all turn out until he reads what he has written."
Mr. Woodward said he found much truth in Willie Stark, the central figure in Robert Penn Warren's novel "All The King's Men," and he found it too in such characters from William Faulkner's fiction as Lucas Beauchamp, Sam Fathers, Joe Christmas, Dilsey, Charles Bon, Jim Bond and the Snopeses.
Mr. Woodward's most famous work, "The Strange Career of Jim Crow" (1955), became a best seller and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the "historical bible of the civil rights movement." Some critics regarded it as the single most influential book ever written on relations between the races in the United States. The book documented that segregation, as expressed by Jim Crow laws, did not appear until well after the end of the slavery, at the beginning of the 20th century.
Mr. Woodward also wrote a biography called "Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel," which concerned itself with a man not so far removed from Willie Stark. Tom Watson, who lived from 1856 to 1922, was a Congressman from Georgia in the late 19th century and the quintessential Negrophobe, representing what Mr. Woodward called "the most ignorant, bigoted and reactionary forces in American life."
The book was first published in 1938, then republished in 1955. Critics credited it with dispelling some myths about the Southern populists who thrived after Reconstruction and demonstrating that the standard image of the South, as portrayed in most books -- somewhere between "Gone With the Wind" and the Uncle Remus stories -- was not to be taken seriously.
Another noteworthy book was "Origins of the New South" (1951), in which Mr. Woodward detailed the negotiations that took place been Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans after the presidential election of 1876, in which an electoral crisis occurred and Rutherford B. Hayes was eventually declared the winner. Southerners agreed to his being seated as the nation's 19th president only after he agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, where they had been since the end of the Civil War.
Although sharply critical of segregation and of the Southerners who believed in it, Mr. Woodward nevertheless loved the South and gloated in the 1960's when racial problems erupted in the North, resulting in riots and the burning of neighborhoods in certain cities. "It was time those bastards up North had their time," he said.
"Probably no scholar contributed more toward the civil rights movement than he did," said the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian William S. McFeely, who was a student of Mr. Woodward's at Yale University in the 1960's. "Though he lived more of his life out of the South than in it, he remained Southern, and he remained loyal to the South. He always defended it; he just wanted to rid it of its worst problem, its racism."
Sheldon Hackney, a former president of Tulane University and the University of Pennsylvania and another former student of Mr. Woodward's, called him "the most admired historian of my lifetime."
"Even more than for his mammoth contributions to understanding American race relations and the history of the South, or for his graceful prose and subtle thought, Vann Woodward will be remembered for being the model of intellectual integrity," Mr. Hackney said.
Comer Vann Woodward was born Nov. 13, 1908, in Vanndale, Ark., the descendant of a clan that in the years before the Civil War had been a major slave-owning family. His mother was the former Bessie Vann, whose family had come to Arkansas generations before from the Carolinas via Tennessee. They created the village of Vanndale (population 300), which contained a motley collection of Confederate veterans, former slaves, tenants, sharecroppers, a generous supply of creditors who preyed on farmers who were down on their luck, and quite a number of Negrophobes. "The Faulknerian repertoire was all represented," Mr. Woodward would later recall.
His father, Hugh Alison Woodward, was a public school administrator in Arkansas who later ran a small college in Georgia. The family, according to Mr. Woodward, was of "modest status."
Mr. Woodward spent the first 10 years of his life in Vanndale, then moved with his family to Morrilton, about 50 miles north of Little Rock. Among his most vivid memories there were of a Ku Klux Klan gathering at the Methodist church, after which the Klansmen, in full regalia, left a donation with an obliging minister. But no less vivid was his memory of Charles Hillman Brough, a former governor of Arkansas who denounced lynchings, and of his uncle Comer McDonald Woodward, who also spoke out against racism.
Mr. Woodward went to public school in Morrilton, where he was something of an outsider. To win acceptance, he went out for the football team. He did not like the game very much but played it well.
In 1924, after his graduation from high school, he enrolled in Henderson-Brown College in Arkadelphia, Ark., a small institution run by Methodists. It was there that he suffered one of his rare intellectual defeats. He thought that he should concentrate in the laboratory sciences but he failed chemistry. He did rather well, however, in expository writing.
Within two years he tired of Arkadelphia and transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, in part because his uncle Comer Woodward had become dean of students. Emory bored him almost as much as had Henderson-Brown. He took a history course and found it so bad that he decided he would take no more history courses as an undergraduate.
He liked Atlanta, however, because it provided him with an opportunity to meet black intellectuals, among them John Hope Franklin, an educator, and J. Saunders Redding, an actor, dramatist and essayist.
By the time he received his Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1930, Mr. Woodward had become a social activist determined to reform the South. He wanted it to be understood, but mostly he wanted it to change. He began teaching freshman English at Georgia Tech and reviewing books for The Atlanta Journal.
He had seen New York City once as an undergraduate. But now he decided to go there and study. In 1931 he enrolled at Columbia University and signed up as a candidate for a master's in sociology. After what he described as "two full and shattering days," he transferred to political science "in desperation." He still had no degree in history.
While in New York he met Langston Hughes, whose poetry he admired, and got to know the principals of the Harlem Renaissance. At one point, he thought he might write his thesis on W. E. B. Du Bois. But according to Mr. Woodward, Mr. Du Bois heard his Southern accent and backed off.
In the early 1930's he vacationed in Europe and visited Paris, Moscow and Berlin. A Communist took him to a section of Berlin where he could see the plight of workers, Mr. Woodward recalled, and he gaped and said, "My God, man, they've got electric lights and running water." They were much better off, he thought, than the sharecroppers he knew in Arkansas and Georgia.
Back in Atlanta and teaching at Georgia Tech in 1932, he involved himself in the case of Angelo Herndon, a young black Communist who was accused of inciting an insurrection. Mr. Woodward raised money for Mr. Herndon, but soon found himself without a teaching job. He long maintained that he lost his job because of a budget cut, but others saw his dismissal as punishment for his sympathy for Mr. Herndon.
Mr. Woodward earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of North Carolina in 1937. Before World War II, he taught briefly at the University of Florida and the University of Virginia. During the war, he served as a lieutenant in the Navy. His war experience led to the publication of "The Battle of Leyte Gulf" in 1947.
From 1947 to 1961 Mr. Woodward taught at Johns Hopkins University, and in 1961 he became Sterling Professor of History at Yale, a position he kept until his retirement in 1977. Over the years, he also lectured at the University of London and at Oxford University.
Among his other books was "The Burden of Southern History" (1960). He also edited many books, including "Mary Chesnut's Civil War," which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1982. There were also numerous articles for the American Historical Review, Johns Hopkins magazine, the American Scholar, The New York Times Magazine and other publications.
Mr. Woodward's wife, the former Glenn Boyd MacLeod, and their son, Peter, predeceased him. No immediate family members survive.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
What the New Paradigm Can't Begin to Explain

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week.
E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LITTLE can be said to change the minds of investors who believe in the so-called new paradigm, the idea that today's stocks, for a variety of reasons, should not be judged by historical valuation standards. The believers generally ignore the skeptics, who gamely point out that ignorance of such valuations in the past has almost always been cause for regret.
But the believers' reaction is hardly surprising. Indeed, a historical argument is hardly relevant to people who think that history itself is no longer relevant. "This time is different," they often say. 
 Anyone aiming to convert the paradigmistas, then, must do so without referring to the historical norms of market valuation. Nor should the argument be based on the recent performance of stocks. After all, it is impossible to know whether the recent gains in the overall market are a result of the new paradigm or of extreme market overvaluation.
But some assumptions underlying the new paradigm can be tested -- at least in how they should affect the relative operating performance of small-capitalization value stocks and large-cap growth stocks.
The 1990's notwithstanding, small-cap stocks have historically outperformed the large caps, and value stocks have outperformed growth. But adherents of the new paradigm contend that the market's leadership has changed permanently. Because of technological advances and the economies of scale of a global marketplace, the reasoning goes, small-cap value stocks should no longer be expected to lead the market; only the very largest companies with the biggest investments in technology will survive and thrive in the new millennium -- the very growth companies that, indeed, have led the market higher over the past few years.
But if the theory is correct, one would expect that large-cap growth companies would have enjoyed extraordinary gains in operating performance in recent years, both in absolute terms and relative to small-cap value stocks.
Those ideas were tested recently by three finance professors -- Louis K. C. Chan and Josef Lakonishok of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Jason Karceski of the University of Florida. They focused particularly on the period since the end of 1995, when stocks became grossly overvalued by almost all historical valuation measures. They found that the new paradigm was an almost complete failure in describing the recent operating performances of public American companies.
Sales growth is but one example. From the end of 1995 through 1998, sales of large-cap growth companies grew just 6 percent a year, on average. That is not only lower than their historical rate of 10.3 percent a year -- from 1970 through 1998 -- but also lower than the 12.7 percent rate for small-cap value companies over the same three years.
A SIMILAR story emerges for operating income before depreciation. For large-cap growth companies, this line item grew 9.6 percent, annualized, over that period, lower than their historical rate of 10.6 percent and far below the 16.6 percent annual rate for small-cap value companies over the same three years.
The data on net income is only slightly more encouraging for new-paradigm believers. Before extraordinary items, profits at large growth companies grew 11 percent, annualized, over the test period -- higher than the historical growth rate of 9.6 percent. Yet the growth was much slower than the 22 percent annual rate for small-cap value companies.
So if you are looking for evidence of a new paradigm at work, the professors' study furnishes none. The conclusion is inescapable: This time is not different.
While advocates of the new paradigm come in varying degrees of orthodoxy, this should give all of them reason to pause. Rather than representing a brand-new world, the recent outsized gains of large-cap growth stocks simply reflect overvaluation -- which the market will correct in due course.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Slower Growth at Dell Leaves Sour Taste

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
IS Dell Computer a value stock for the new economy? Perhaps.
Not so long ago, many people on Wall Street called Dell a niche player, one whose growth would sputter once it saturated the base of customers who want to buy a personal computer through a toll-free phone number. Now, with the Dell sales running at $27 billion a year, investors are not calling it that anymore. But there is still much doubt about the sustainability of Dell's growth, which is one reason that its stock has languished all year. 
 Dell shares, a mainstay of the 1990's bull market, took a pounding in February, when some analysts predicted that the company's revenue growth would slow. And it turned out the rate had declined, to 38 percent for the quarter ending Jan. 31, from 56 percent, on average, over the previous two years. It has since recovered a bit, to 41 percent in the most recent quarter, ended Oct. 29.
The message to investors, however, was clear: No one should expect a company of Dell's size to keep growing at 50 percent indefinitely. And shareholders have not forgiven the slip. Dell shares, now at $45.5625, are 17 percent below their 52-week high.
Even with that decline, it is difficult to find anybody who questions Dell's strategy or faults its execution. Many people believe that the company could be the world's largest maker of PC's within the next year or two, as it continues to take market share away from Compaq Computer and I.B.M. It has been the No. 1 supplier of PC's in the United States for the last two quarters. And with the introduction this month of the WebPC, a PC geared to the retail consumer, Dell is finally attacking the home market.
Dell's direct-sales model is well-known: The company builds each PC to order and sells it directly to consumers, by telephone, the Web or, for big corporate customers, through a field sales force. There is little money tied up in inventory and no dealer markups, allowing it to undercut rivals on price. By keeping the barest of component inventories itself, Dell minimizes working capital and maximizes return on that capital. It has a negative cash conversion cycle, meaning that it is paid for finished goods before it pays suppliers for parts.
I.B.M., Compaq and Hewlett-Packard have taken steps to mimic Dell's business model and have made some headway at trimming inventories and costs. But they cannot duplicate Dell's model without cutting off their dealers, which they fear to do.
All of this leads some investors to say that Dell stock simply doesn't deserve the punishment it has suffered. "We're starting to believe that the assumptions people have made about revenue growth slowing down could be wrong," said Randy Befumo, an analyst with the Legg Mason Value Trust, a $14 billion mutual fund and a longtime Dell shareholder. "It's not that they increase revenue growth, because the law of large numbers does eventually apply, but most likely they can sustain the current growth rate much longer than people expect." About 4.6 percent of the fund is invested in Dell shares.
Mr. Befumo said that he believed the growth of the Internet would spur sales of servers and other PC-related products, and that Dell would have many chances to gain market share in these categories and overseas. "The market will consolidate around the most efficient player, and that's Dell," he said. "There's no reason Dell can't have 50 percent market share."
Dell has a 15 percent share in the United States and 7 percent overseas, he said.
CHARLES WOLF, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said Dell shares had underperformed for reasons divorced from fundamentals. "Momentum investors pulled out of the name," he said, referring to Dell stock. "They were very big in the name prior to the February announcement, but once that momentum is broken for any reason, they jump ship. The reality is, except for a little blip in the October quarter due to memory pricing, which I ignore, they have delivered every quarter."
Mr. Wolf said that Dell's competitive advantage over I.B.M. and Compaq appeared to be widening, and that the company was exploiting the Internet more effectively than other PC makers, not only to sell its products but also to maintain relationships with customers. He noted that Dell's price-to-earnings multiple for next year was under 45, just slightly above its earnings growth rate of about 40 percent, while many technology stocks trade for two or three times growth. If Dell's stock-price appreciation matched his expected earnings growth rate of 40 percent in 2000, shares would hit $63.7875 in the next 12 months. "Last week, I lifted it to my No. 1 pick for 2000," he added.
It is still possible, however, to admire Dell's model but not the stock. Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns rates Dell "attractive," a level below a "buy" rating. "Dell uses the Internet, but they don't run the Internet the way Sun does," Mr. Neff said, referring to Sun Microsystems. "Sun sells to the core of the Internet. There's a higher focus on companies that own technology, whereas Dell's competitive advantage has a lot to do with supply chain leverage."
Daniel Kunstler at J. P. Morgan is also waiting for a reason to lift his rating on Dell from "market perform." He said Dell had lifted expectations by describing the slowdown for the January quarter as a one-time event, though it has since become apparent that it was not. "The opportunity for them to really exceed numbers on revenues or earnings is not what it used to be," he said. "It's not that the business model has become deficient. It has not. But there's little perceived potential for upside surprises."

HEADLINE: A Standoff at the Corner Store

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: SUNBURY, Pa.

 BODY:
IN the 1920's, with their corner stores thriving, Harry and Sigmund Weis decided to build neighboring houses on choice land in this small Susquehanna Valley city. The brick homes, one colonial and one Tudor, bordered the riverbank and looked out to the gently sloping Appalachian Mountains. The two brothers shared a garage; their young children -- a son and a daughter for each -- ran back and forth across the driveway when they played in their front yards.
Over the decades, the Weises transformed their small markets into a modern supermarket chain. By owning their own trucks and warehouses, keeping out labor unions and staunchly refusing to take on debt, the brothers, and later their sons, created the most profitable grocery company in the country, with margins four or five times those of their competitors. 
 Quietly, the Weises became one of the wealthiest families in the United States, slowly expanding their central Pennsylvania chain as far as upstate New York and the Virginia suburbs of Washington -- and popping into the public eye only when they appeared on Forbes magazine's annual list of the richest Americans.
Just as Harry's and Sigmund's father had bequeathed his corner store to them, they handed the business down to their sons, Robert and Sigfried Weis (pronounced "wise"). Although Weis Markets Inc. went public in 1965, the family kept control, retaining about four-fifths of the shares. There was little intrigue and a lot of profit.
But in the last few years, profits have been stagnant, and in the last month, intrigue has inevitably developed. Like the Binghams, the Hunts, the Kochs and so many business families before them, the Weises are now locked in an intense fight for control of the company that has given them their fortunes. The two sides of the family that were once divided by only a driveway are now split over one of the central questions in today's economy: Can a small company, even one with a long history of success, prosper in an era of consolidation?
That the debate is taking place at Weis, which has achieved almost legendary status in its industry, illustrates just how difficult it is for family businesses to survive from one generation to the next.
Sigmund's descendants, with one eye on the fast-expanding Wal-Mart Stores and the other on grocery behemoths like Royal Ahold N.V. that have arisen from the consolidation spree of the 1990's, want to look into selling the company. Led by Janet L. Weis, the 80-year-old widow of Sigmund's son, Sigfried, they are mounting a proxy fight for two additional board seats, which would give them four of the seven.
Mrs. Weis, her three daughters and their husbands, who own a 41 percent stake, see declining margins and a company stock that, before the feud burst into the open, was worth less than it was in 1987. They worry that the company risks a long, slow decline if it stays independent. "The handwriting is really on the wall," Mrs. Weis said. On Friday, shares of the 200-store chain closed at $41.25, up 18 percent in the last three weeks amid investors' hopes for a sale.
But Harry's family, which now runs the business after decades behind the scenes, has no intention of surrendering to its cousins or to its larger rivals. Led by Robert Weis, Harry's 80-year-old son, they say the current competition is similar to earlier threats, when better capitalized supermarkets entered but failed to crack their mid-Atlantic markets. Weis Markets still has above-average margins.
"They are reading the facts wrong," said Robert Weis, a soft-spoken man who still has a full head of gray hair. Mr. Weis, who with his three children and his sister, also owns a 41 percent stake in the company worth $700 million. He hadserved as deputy to Sigfried, Janet Weis's husband, for more than 30 years and took over the chairman's slot in 1995. Sigfried's family no longer has anyone in management, and Robert's family has offered to buy out its cousins' share.
THE battle has many trappings of a takeover struggle. Sigmund's and Sigfried's family has hired Salomon Smith Barney and Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a New York law firm, to advise them on how to lobby shareholders, oust the current board and put the company up for sale. Harry's and Robert's family has retained Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, another Manhattan-based law firm.
The dispute, meanwhile, has split the Susquehanna Valley, where hospital wings, arts centers and major buildings at two universities, Bucknell and Susquehanna, bear the Weis name. And it has chilled friendships among the principal players, who used to play golf together and still routinely eat lunch at the same restaurant, though not the same table.
But this is also a family feud with a twist. So far, it is nearly bereft of nastiness. Neither side doubts the other's motive, only their conclusion. Over the last month, Janet Weis and her allies have publicly praised the way Robert Weis and his deputies have managed the company, even as she seeks to oust him. "Everyone respects the job they're doing," said Joseph I. Goldstein, Mrs. Weis's son-in-law and a member of the board.
Rather than trade allegations, the two sides share a sense of melancholy that they are locked in a public squabble likely to end up humiliating one branch of the family.
"When I first thought about this, it was sad," said Michael Morris Apfelbaum, a lifelong family friend and, as a lawyer overseeing some of the stock, the second dissident board member. "But when you cut out the emotion from it, you have to realize this is the way of capitalism. You have to be big to survive in the economy today. That's just the way of the world."
At least it's what the debate is about.
THE Weises have been merchants in these parts since shortly after the Civil War, when Sigfried Weis immigrated from Austria and made his way to central Pennsylvania. To earn a living, he walked from farmhouse to farmhouse in the lush fields of the Susquehanna Valley -- less than 100 miles from where the Battle of Gettysburg had raged just a few years before -- selling jewelry and other goods. Soon, he opened a general store in Selinsgrove, a town across the river from here, and he married a local woman; they would have two sons. When the boys grew up, Sigfried Weis hung up a sign: "S. Weis & Sons."
After his death in 1907, the sons -- Sigmund and Harry -- opened a new store in Sunbury, the county seat, focused on groceries. It was the start of a furious expansion that lasted nearly 30 years and did not end until the Depression, when they had more than 100 outlets.
Already, a division of labor was emerging that would last for almost a century. Sigmund, the more outgoing brother, was the marketer who decided which national brands the stores should sell. Harry, a lawyer, scouted real estate, picking where the next Weis Pure Foods would go, family members say.
The success of the shops enabled the brothers to build their neighboring houses on Front Street, just a few blocks from Sunbury's main square and their first store.
The Depression, however, prompted shoppers to look for more bargains and helped usher in the era of self-service supermarkets. In 1937, Sigmund and Harry Weis started closing many of their stores to create a smaller chain of larger stores.
Weis Markets, which owned more of its stores and more of its equipment than competitors did, thrived. It sold an unusually large number of private-label products. And it fought bitterly to keep unions from organizing its workers, many of whom were part-timers without benefits.
In fact, in a 1965 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to take the company public, virtually the only problem that the family noted was a yearlong strike by meat-department employees starting in the summer of 1963. Five years later, the company and a food workers' union fought all the way to the Supreme Court in a landmark case over whether a shopping mall was a public place where the union, covered by First Amendment speech protection, could try to organize. (The union won in court, but Weis has defeated every effort to organize the company's employees, including one by the Teamsters this year.)
In the mid-1960's, the company achieved operating margins of more than 8 percent. Weis was the envy of the grocery industry, where margins of 2 or 3 percent were much more common. When Weis Markets Inc. went public in 1965, the shares made their debut at $21. Each side of the family was suddenly worth more than $20 million.
By then, both Sigmund and Harry Weis had died, and their sons were running the business. Sigfried -- Sigmund's son, named for the family patriarch -- was four years older than Robert, and they had followed similar paths. As children, both worked behind the counter at some of the original Weis Pure Foods stores. Both served in the Army. Both attended Yale.
It was during college that Sigfried Weis met his future wife, Janet. He was a freshman and she was a 15-year-old who lived in the nearby town of Hamden, Conn. He did not win her over immediately. "It was one of those back-and-forth things," she said this month at her home, grinning between puffs on a thin cigarette. Eventually, after they were married at the Carlyle Hotel in New York, she followed him back to Pennsylvania.
Sigfried became president of the company in 1961 without much debate, family members say. He was older than Robert, who became his deputy. Robert ran the company's finances and, like his father, chose sites for new stores, and the two cousins remained in those jobs for more than 30 years.
They had lunch together most days and lived in the same neighborhood, separated only by an alley.
BUT by all accounts, Sigfried and Robert Weis were not as close as their daily proximity suggested. They were business partners, not best friends.
"We were different, but we were friendly," Robert said.
"We just moved in different circles," Janet Weis said.
Like his father, Sigfried was the more social of the two. He and Janet belonged to the country-club crowd and gave their money to large institutions, like a regional hospital. Robert and his wife, Patricia, gave to the small hospital in Sunbury.
Differences in the ages of the two couples' children pushed them further apart. The three daughters of Sigfried and Janet were all at least 10 years older than the two daughters and son of Robert and Patricia. The next generation -- second cousins who shared a last name and a fortune and grew up only yards away from each other -- still do not know each other well. There was never a blow-up, both sides say. The two families simply drifted apart.
That estrangement, particularly in the context of the strong stock market, is dangerous, said John Messervey, president of the National Family Business Council, an Illinois consulting firm that, among other things, runs retreats where wealthy families can get to know one another better. Many families, Mr. Messervey said, "are scared they're never going to see a market this good again." For the Weises in the 1970's and 80's, there seemed to be little reason for worry. Operating margins never fell below 7 percent and, as late as 1987, were above 9 percent. Weis Markets, a 1982 headline in Forbes magazine said, "makes one-third of what Safeway does -- on only 5 percent of Safeway's sales." The same year, the grandsons of the Austrian peddler appeared on the magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
In 1998, the year after the Weises fell off the Forbes list, a squat, enormous distributor center began rising just off of Interstate 99 in western Pennsylvania. When completed, it covered more than 800,000 square feet, and it bore the corporate name that strikes fear into virtually every other retailer in the country: Wal-Mart.
There could be no doubt about the building's purpose. Like a massing of troops at an enemy's border, its size was an announcement that an unstoppable invasion was about to begin. Wal-Mart was bringing supercenters, stores that sell everything from milk and bananas to slacks and tires and are three times the size of modern supermarkets, to Pennsylvania.
Supercenters, the first of which opened in 1988, had already transformed the $420 billion-a-year grocery business. To respond to Wal-Mart's efficient distribution network and its money-saving clout with suppliers, supermarket executives were rapidly consolidating one of the few remaining large regional businesses in the United States. Their aim was to cut costs and gain the kind of power over manufacturers that Wal-Mart has.
The five biggest chains now take in 40 cents of every dollar that Americans spend at the supermarket, up from 20 cents in 1993, according to the Food Institute, a trade group in Fair Lawn, N.J.
For Weis Markets, the changes were coming at a bad time. It had been facing tough competition from Giant Foods of Carlisle, Pa., which had expanded in the area during the late 80's and early 90's. By 1996, Giant had actually overtaken Weis in central Pennsylvania with an 18 percent market share, according to Food Trade News, a publication that tracks grocery sales in the mid-Atlantic states. At the same time, inflation was almost nonexistent, leaving grocers little room to raise prices.
Weis's legendary operating margins paid the price. From their high of 9.2 percent in 1987, they fell to 5.5 percent in 1993 and just 4.1 percent last year. Operating margins for the rest of the industry are now 3 percent. The company posted net income of $83.7 million last year on $1.87 billion in sales, about $3 million less than it earned in 1989 on $1.24 billion in sales.
THOSE numbers -- along with the specter of Wal-Mart and the new grocery giants -- are at the core of the argument of Sigfried Weis's family. The chain still has many strengths, like its $400 million in cash, its milk and ice cream plants and its brand's reputation. But the company should act quickly, the family says, to determine whether it should participate in the current consolidation wave.
"Companies rise and fall, and we want to make sure this company keeps rising," said Mr. Goldstein, a director who is a partner at Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in Washington.
For their part, Robert Weis and the president of the company, Norman Rich, say that is precisely what it has been doing for the past few years. In 1995, when Robert took over from an ailing Sigfried, the company began a capital investment push even more aggressive than the one undertaken by Sigmund and Harry Weis in the 1920's. In the last four years, the company has spent $374 million to build 35 large new markets and to remodel 51 others.
The expansion has helped increase revenue by 7.5 percent through the first three quarters of 1999. The company, meanwhile, has begun working with a cooperative of smaller chains, cutting deals with manufacturers similar to the discounts the bigger companies can negotiate, Mr. Rich said.
The proof of Weis's relative strength can be seen in its stock, they added. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 29, just before the proxy fight began, the company's stock fell only 8 percent versus 35 percent for the Standard & Poor's supermarket industry index.
The disparity, Harry Weis's descendants say, undercuts their cousins' main point: that a small chain can no longer hold its own. "Back in 1928, Safeway Stores came with the same story and tried to buy our company," Robert Weis said last week, speaking softly while sitting in the company's modest boardroom here. "Fortunately, we said no."
One afternoon after Thanksgiving, however, the phone rang in the office of Mr. Rich, Weis's president. A native of New York City whose gregariousness stands in contrast to the Weis family's reserve, Mr. Rich had joined Weis Markets in 1964 as a food scientist and climbed up the ranks, reaching his current position in 1994, He runs daily operations and reports to Robert Weis, the chairman. (The company has never used the title of chief executive.)
The phone call, Mr. Rich recalled, came from Mr. Apfelbaum, the director, who said, "Norm, can you come down to my office?" Mr. Apfelbaum said it was an emergency. His father, Sidney Apfelbaum, who oversees a trust that owns Weis stock, and Mr. Goldstein, Mrs. Weis's son-in-law, were also there.
Mr. Rich drove to the law offices of Apfelbaum, Apfelbaum & Apfelbaum, in a converted house off the town square. The three men waiting for him said they believed Weis Markets should seriously investigate selling itself and that they wanted to install directors who agreed.
The proxy fight, and family feud, had begun.
THE decision had come slowly for the dissidents, over a series of informal discussions among themselves and during the occasional cocktail hours that Mr. Apfelbaum and Mrs. Weis have together at her house, a four-bedroom Tudor on 14 acres across the Susquehanna River from Sunbury.
Eventually, Mr. Apfelbaum, whose father grew up playing pool with Robert Weis on the third floor of his Front Street house, and Mr. Goldstein, a former associate director of enforcement at the S.E.C., decided they had to act.
Sigfried's family has asked that the company hold a shareholder vote by Feb. 7, citing company bylaws, on whether to replace the board. Since each family controls 41 percent of the votes, the resolution would need the approval of more than half of the 18 percent of investors who are not family members.
Most outsiders consider the dissidents to be the favorites; in recent years, shareholders have tended to choose whatever path is most likely to bolster a stock price immediately. Salomon argues that the company could fetch $45 to $55 a share. Charles M. LaLoggia, a Rochester fund manager who publishes an investment newsletter, said he thinks the company would sell for at least $45 a share and maybe up to $90, given its strong balance sheet and recent valuations for other chains.
Investors would be unlikely to turn down a deal in that range. "As far as the dissidents work for all the shareholders, they're our guys," said Martin J. Whitman, who runs a $1.5 billion fund that has owned Weis stock since the early 1990's.
But a vote would probably be close. About three-fifths of the independent investors, representing 11 percent of the company's stock, are individuals, Mr. Rich said. They are more likely to focus on the company's long record of paying strong dividends, he added.
Mr. Rich and Robert Weis will also argue that the company would not fetch a fair price now, because many potential suitors are trading near 52-week lows. Albertson's and Kroger, for example, are busy integrating the chains they have already bought, and their recent earnings disappointments show they have a ways to go. "A lot of the retailers have got their hands full right now," said Mark Husson, a supermarket analyst at Merrill Lynch.
FOR the company, the stakes are obviously high. But they seem almost as high for the region and the two Weis families. The chain employs 19,000 people, and its higher-paying, middle-management jobs would be most vulnerable in a takeover. Those positions are concentrated in central Pennsylvania, a coal and agricultural region that has suffered economically over the last three decades.
"The average person thinks this just can't be good," David L. Persing, the mayor of Sunbury since 1989, said of the dispute. "It might be good for stockholders, but I don't think it will be good for this area."
None of the Weises, or their allies on either side, are likely to emerge from the fight worse off financially. But the dispute has already had personal costs. It has effectively ended the friendship of Mr. Apfelbaum's and Mr. Rich, who still see each other at Tedd's Landing, a local restaurant where both have lunch. Only last summer, Mr. Apfelbaum said, the two men smoked cigars together at 4 a.m. at the W Hotel on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, just hours after Mr. Rich's son had been married.
Janet Weis, meanwhile, has chosen to spend part of her 81st year fighting a public battle over the company her late husband ran for 35 years, a company she helped build by tasting samples of new products and telling her husband which labels looked right. "It's been all of my life," Mrs. Weis said.
The dispute has been most difficult for Robert Weis, said people who know him, though he is reluctant to discuss his personal feelings. As he nears retirement and grooms his 32-year-old son, Jonathan, to succeed him, the family of his longtime boss is trying to depose him. "People's conditions in life change. Their needs change. Their desires change," the older Mr. Weis said, explaining what he sees as the reasons for the fight.
"I guess every time you have a partner, you have a problem," he added, "maybe not with the partner, but with the next generation."

Long-Stay Hotels Cater To Families

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
WHILE most extended-stay hotels, whether in cities or suburbs, cater primarily to business travelers, many are more than happy to extend their hospitality to families hoping to escape the noisy hordes of contractors who have invaded their real home for a renovation or redecoration project.
"Basically, what we offer is a home away from home," said Jennifer Coleman, marketing services manager for Manhattan East Suite Hotels."We're a very family-oriented company. Kids and dogs are fine with us." 
 Manhattan East. which has 10 all-suite hotels scattered around Midtown, is one of a growing number of companies offering extended-stay lodgings that include all the amenities an individual or family needs to feel at home.
Most of the all-suite hotels in the chain, said Ms. Coleman, have various-sized suites to accommodate families of most sizes. The company's 300- to 400-square-foot studio suites, for example, contain an oversized sleeping room with a dining or sitting area and kitchen facilities. The two-bedroom suites, on the other hand, range in size from 700 to 950 square feet and contain a living room, separate bedrooms and a fully appointed kitchen. In between are "junior" and one-bedroom suites that range from 400 to 650 square feet, including kitchen facilities.
Ms. Coleman explained that while the nightly rates at Manhattan East hotels range from $164 for a guest room to $725 for the most expensive two-bedroom suite, most accommodations range from $200 to $300. Reduced rates are available for stays of more than 30 days.
"The extended-stay rates are negotiated rates that depend on the total length of stay," she said, adding that her company's most "family-friendly" building was the Surrey Hotel on 76th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues.
One of the main draws of extended-stay facilities, particularly for families, is their ability to provide -- quite literally -- soup to nuts services for their guests.
"Yes, we do offer grocery-shopping services," said Gordon Lambourne, a vice president of Marriott International, the Washington-based hotel chain that pioneered the extended-stay concept with its Residence Inn Hotels.
"The first thing people have to know about our extended-stay facilities is the concept of the descending rate," Mr. Lambourne said. "That means that the longer you stay, the less you pay." Generally speaking, he said, rates for the company's Residence Inn suites in the New York City area start at about $99 a night for the smaller units.
"Most of our suites have a sitting area, a separate bedroom, and a fully equipped kitchen with a stove, microwave, full-sized refrigerator and all the china, silverware and glassware you need," Mr. Lambourne said. "Some even have working fireplaces."
And unlike some extended-stay hotels, he said, Marriott does not have a minimum-stay requirement. "The average stay is probably five nights to two weeks," Mr. Lambourne said.
Another company that has extended-stay lodging is Extended StayAmerica, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "For us, seven nights or more are considered an extended stay," said Monique Damiano, a spokeswoman for the company. "And at our hotels, there's no need to negotiate with the hotel manager over your room rate. Guests pay the same rate as their neighbor in similarly sized rooms or suites."
Ms. Damiano explained that each of the company's hotel brands offered different types of room arrangements and services. For example, she said, Extended StayAmerica's Crossland Economy Studios are generally 227 square feet in size and furnished with a double bed, kitchenette, refrigerator-freezer, two-burner stove, a microwave and all necessary utensils and tableware. Rates for such rooms range from $159 to $199 a week.
The company's Extended StayAmerica Efficiency Studios hotel brand, which are about 300 square feet and similarly furnished, range from $199 to $299 a week.
And the company's StudioPlus Deluxe Studios hotel brand, Ms. Damiano said, has suites of about 425 square feet, generally with separate living, sleeping and eating areas and a pull-out sleeper sofa. The rates for those units, she said, range $299 to $399 a week.
"To keep our rates affordable, our hotels don't have restaurants, bars, meeting spaces or little plastic shoe-shine kits in the rooms," Ms. Damiano said. "But they do have all the things you need for a comfortable stay."
She added that while guests might request daily housekeeping services, extended-stay guests can generally save money by using housekeeping services just once a week. In addition, she said, all of the company's hotels offer on-premises, coin-operated guest laundry rooms, free local phone calls and a room wired with a dedicated computer data port.
For those who prefer the ambiance of a real Manhattan apartment while their own apartment is being torn asunder, there is a company in Manhattan that rents out one- and two-bedroom apartments at rates that are, in some cases, less than what it would cost to rent a similarly sized unfurnished Manhattan apartment on the open market.
"We don't have all the services of a hotel, but when people see our rates, they're usually willing to make their own beds," said Elizabeth Calogero, a spokeswoman for A Hospitality Company, a Manhattan-based company that owns about 150 apartments that it rents out to extended-stay guests.
"Our flagship property is the Hospitality House," Ms. Calogero said, referring to the 36-unit building the company owns on 49th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues. Apartments in the building, which start at $99 a night for a small studio, have all the necessary furniture and furnishings, including a fully-equipped kitchen.
Apartments in other buildings scattered throughout Manhattan, she said, range from small studios to large, two-bedroom units, all similarly furnished. Rates in those buildings range from $99 to $325 a night or, for stays of 30 days or more, from $1,950 to $5,750 a month.
"We obviously prefer longer corporate stays," Ms. Calogero said. "But our two-bedroom apartments sleep six people comfortably, so we're family-friendly, too."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA: TALKING THE FUTURE WITH: Robert W. Taylor;
An Internet Pioneer Ponders the Next Revolution

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Internet has many fathers, but few deserve the label more than Robert W. Taylor.
In 1966, as a director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office, Mr. Taylor came up with the idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. After authorizing money for research to develop a nationwide computer network, Mr. Taylor wrote a white paper in 1968, a year before the network was created, with another ARPA research director, J. C. R. Licklider. The paper, "The Computer as a Communications Device," was one of the first clear statements about the potential of a computer network. 
 Even before coming to ARPA, Mr. Taylor saw the computer's potential as an interactive device. As a research manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he arranged financing for Douglas C. Engelbart, a young researcher who used the money at what was then called the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International, to invent the computer mouse.
At ARPA, Mr. Taylor's office continued financing Mr. Engelbart's Augment research group, which pioneered many of the most important ideas in today's computer industry. It was Mr. Taylor who financed Mr. Engelbart's legendary demonstration of advanced computer technologies -- including the mouse, windows, hypertext, networking and teleconferencing -- at the 1968 Joint Fall Computer Conference in San Francisco. The demonstration left many of the nation's best computer scientists, then living in a world of punch cards and paper tape, in awe.
Mr. Taylor's contributions did not end there. After leaving ARPA and spending a year at the University of Utah, he was hired to direct the newly formed computer systems laboratory at Xerox's brand-new Palo Alto Research Center. From that laboratory and several others at PARC came the personal computer, computer networking, desktop publishing, laser printers, the graphical user interface and modern word processing.
Mr. Taylor, who never profited personally from the commercial Internet boom, is now retired at 67 and lives in Woodside, Calif. In a recent interview, he reviewed these pivotal events in the computer industry and looked to what the future might hold.
Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. -- What led to your ideas about computer networking?
A. -- I discovered computers in the 1950's, and the whole business of punching holes in cards turned me off. I really wasn't interested in computers from the beginning as an arithmetic engine. What struck me about them really came home when I read J. C. R. Licklider's 1960 "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper. I said, "Yeah! Now we're talking!"
Q. -- How did you come across that article?
A. -- It appeared in an I.E.E.E. Transactions journal that I subscribed to. I was working as a systems engineer at the Martin Company at the time. That's when the power of interactive computing dawned on me. I had other reasons to pay attention to Licklider. I did my thesis on psycho-acoustics and Licklider was world famous in that field, before he started to play around with computers.
Q. -- How did you meet Licklider?
A. -- NASA had approached me to become a program manager in 1961 to look after research areas including flight displays and manned flight-control systems. I told them they needed an area called simulation technology because we were going to have to make huge investments in simulation, and they liked that idea. In late 1962, Licklider moved to ARPA and started this computer research program. I was at NASA and he was at the Pentagon. I had been supporting Doug Engelbart's work.
Q. -- This led to the mouse?
A. -- Yes. You know, it's quite funny -- several years ago NASA began looking for spinoffs that their research had led to in the civilian economy and they never realized that the mouse was developed under a NASA contract. But Licklider, shortly after he took over at ARPA, organized an informal committee of people in the government who were supporting computer research. He invited me to come over and join the committee. I walked into his office and right away he started talking to me about my thesis. It blew me completely away. How would he know anything about my thesis? I was a no-name nobody graduate student. He wowed me from Day 1.
Q. -- What did you set out to do at ARPA?
A. -- I began to think that if I was going to do this for a while, I wanted to find some particular program to measure my performance by. I wanted to put a nail on the wall or whatever the proper metaphor is. I wanted to make a difference. We had in my office three terminals to three different programs that ARPA was supporting. One was to the Systems Development Corporation in Santa Monica. There was another terminal to the Genie Project at U.C. Berkeley. The third terminal was to the C.T.S.S. project that later became the Multics project at M.I.T. We hadn't had these terminals very long. But I had already seen a very interesting thing. As these three time-sharing projects came alive and they collected users around their respective campuses, the only users they had were local users because there was no network to speak of. All communications were local except to ARPA.
Q. -- What did you discover?
A. -- The thing that really struck me about this evolution was how these three systems caused communities to get built. People who didn't know one another previously would now find themselves using the same system. Because the systems allowed you to share files, you could find that so-and-so was interested in such-and-such and he had some data about it. You could contact him by e-mail and, lo and behold, you would have a whole new relationship.
Q. -- Were these first communities built around mailing lists?
A. -- Well, you had a directory, so you knew how to send them e-mail, but you might only know 2 or 3 people, and you would meet 20 or 30 through the computer. It wasn't a static medium. It was a dynamic medium. And that gave it a lot of power.
Q. -- It was all about community?
A. -- There was one other trigger that turned me to the ARPAnet. For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of user commands. So if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C. and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley or M.I.T. about this, I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said, oh, man, it's obvious what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go where you have interactive computing. That idea is the ARPAnet.
Q. -- When did you get the idea?
A. -- I decided to do that in late 1965. In February of 1966, I was officially the head of the Information Processing Techniques Office. So I went to see Charlie Herzfeld, who was the head of ARPA, and laid the idea on him. The first funding came that month. He liked the idea immediately, and he took a million dollars out of the ballistic missile defense budget and put it into my budget right then and there.
Q. -- Was the idea an immediate success?
A. -- I had to go around and talk to our contractors to see if I could get their cooperation -- and some of them were enthusiastic, and some of them saw it as an infringement on their computing facilities. They said, "I don't want to share my computing cycles with some guy across the country. I don't have enough cycles as it is. Now you're going to build something that allows people to come in and use my machine?" That took a while to bring people together.
Q. -- Did you see right away that this would have an impact broader than just a small group of military-funded researchers?
A. -- Oh, yeah, sure. It was obvious to some of us that interactive computing was here to stay. And by the late 60's, the personal computer was obvious as well. By the time I went to Xerox in 1970, I tried to get the guys to build the Alto one of the first experimental personal computers and they built it two years later, but that's a whole other story.
Q. -- Was there one shared vision?
A. -- The model that some people were pushing in those days for how this was going to spread was that there were going to be gigantic computer utilities. This was the power utility model. I never bought that. By the late 60's, Moore's Law was pretty obvious. It was just a matter of time before you could afford to put a computer on everyone's desk. That was what I came to Xerox to do.
Q. -- How did you arrive at Xerox?
A. -- I left ARPA in late 1969 after I knew that the ARPAnet was up and running, and I went to Utah for what turned out to be only a year. When I was in Utah, I got a call from George Pake, a physicist who was setting up Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. I had the impression that he just wanted to pick my brain. There was no discussion of a job. He told me that Xerox was going to have a research lab here in Palo Alto and part of it was going to be devoted to computer research. The research group was going to develop technologies that would be used at S.D.S., a computer company that Xerox had recently purchased. I said, "Oh, that's too bad." He said, "What do you mean?" "Well, you won't be able to get anyone who's any good to come work here because there's absolutely no respect for S.D.S. among the best computer folks." They were floored. They said, "What do you think we ought to do?" I replied, "You ought to computerize the office; everything that happens in the office can be put on the computer."
Q. -- If the personal computer has been the foundation for the Internet, where will the next major burst of innovation come from?
A. -- Broadband networks. If you take real-time video and audio and you couple them, and you imagine some kind of a chair that's connected to this system that you sit in and fly around wherever you want to go . . . .
Q. -- How will we use these new technologies?
A. -- You'll also be able to wear -- maybe not in my lifetime but certainly reasonably soon -- an unobtrusive device that will record in full color and sound everything that you see or point your head at, or, depending on how many of them you have, everything that's around you. And share it. Every waking and sleeping moment in your life will be recorded. And you will be able to store and retrieve it and do what you will with it.
Q. -- How will that change the world?
A. -- I don't know, but it will. There are obviously implications for privacy that will have to be worked through. I'm actually more concerned about nearer-term issues. I want the Internet to become a right, not a privilege. I think we need a driver's license to allow you to use the Internet, much like you drive on the road today. If you misbehave on the road, you get your license taken away.
Q. -- Do you have a sense of what the future will look like from a computer network point of view?
A. -- I can't help much about the future, I'm afraid. I was a bad predictor of the future 30 years ago. I was sure that from the early 1970's, all the pieces were there at Xerox and at ARPA to put the Internet in the state by the early '80's that it is in today. It was all there. It was physically there. But it didn't happen for years.

Playing a Cultural Serenade to Cuba

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

DATELINE: HAVANA, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Mighty America gives Cuba a lesson in can-do efficiency? Think again. The Milwaukee Symphony's weekend adventures on this embargoed island became a drama with several happy endings, but the opening acts were tortured indeed. If things went wrong, don't blame Havana, whose officials were like benevolent spectators to a chain reaction of self-induced mishaps.
The good news should come first: a morning concert on Friday for radiant and clamoring children and an evening event for equally rapt adults and young musicians, both at the newly restored 800-seat Teatro Amadeo Roldan. Perhaps concerts should be judged not simply on how well the participants play but on how musicians and audience members are joined. The expressions on listeners' faces at both concerts told a story of intense pleasure. The whispering was almost welcome, for these were people excitedly exchanging observations on the orchestration of Bernstein's "West Side Story" Suite, or the octave technique of Eduardus Halim in Liszt's E-flat Piano Concerto. 
 The trip had been brewing for two years, inspired by a softening of cultural barriers between two countries and preceded by the visit of a youth orchestra from New England the year before. The idea of providing top symphonic entertainment to the Cuban people was always present, but board members accompanying their charges made no pretense of the Milwaukee's major mission: to provide an international splash of publicity for a reputable American orchestra with a relatively low profile. The symphony had long been scheduled for a concert at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach, Fla., and so Cuba became a scheduled 45-minute jump by air charter. Red tape was penetrated, voluminous visas assembled, and bravely on Thursday the planes set off, one of them at least.
The other, carrying the orchestra's larger instruments, sat quiescent in Miami, victim of malfunction. Hours later a replacement plane, laboriously reloaded, took off for Havana, but it lacked the revised paperwork and bore tail numbers unknown to Cuban air-traffic control, which denied the newcomer air space and strongly suggested it return to where it came from. Properly documented but its contents still not cleared by customs, Milwaukee's musical cargo arrived toward midnight and spent the night within the spartan confines of the Jose Marti International Airport.
This proved something of a problem for the evening's scheduled open rehearsal. Musicians, already dazed by a two-hour-plus flight delay and relaxed by the wondrously green tequila drinks passed out at a welcoming lunch (by that time dinner), showed up onstage without enough instruments but at least capable of some self-described "meet and greet" with assembled Havanans.
By 10:30 on Friday morning, the youth concert's scheduled starting time, the instruments were approaching, but had not arrived. It was agreed that rather than examining double basses, bass drums and mallet percussion instruments at the airport, a customs officer would ride shotgun and tick off items as they came off a truck into the stage entrance. The panoramic view was fascinating: children streaming in by the front entrance; large musical devices being manhandled in the same direction around the corner. No one seemed to mind the hour-and-15-minute delay, punctuality being perhaps more a North American than a Caribbean imperative.
There was plenty to do during the wait. If Havana itself is battered, its children are up to date. Shining and well-groomed in their red pinafores, yellow skirts and gleaming white blouses, they seemed genuinely thrilled by the 500 individual letters from Milwaukee schoolchildren. Happily armed with the orchestra's elaborate program books, they besieged backbench violists and bassists, who may have been signing autographs for the first time in their lives. Across the street from the theater, one violinist stood and played, ringed by eager 8-year-olds in red.
Inside, his colleagues, some gastrically devastated by an unwise trip to a restaurant across the street from the wonderful old Hotel Nacional, summoned their faculties, accompanied the splendid narrator Hector Quintero in Prokofiev's "Pedro y el Lobo" ("Peter and the Wolf" to you), and ripped handsomely through the Bernstein, whose Latin influences were not lost on these listeners.
Afterward the National Cuba Youth Symphony sat onstage and briefly played. Its director, Anarelys Garriga Sosa, said the players, ages 8 to 14, were drawn from schools around the country. Many of their music teachers had come from Soviet-bloc countries or were trained in them. The economic tribulations in Cuba since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been well documented but extend also to a lack of school instruments in working order. On the other hand, Diana Haskell, the Milwaukee's acting principal clarinetist, reported that her brief session with two colleagues from the National Orchestra of Cuba showed musicians well trained and equipped.
"They play with a wonderful, soulful style and their instruments may be better than mine," she said.
The National Orchestra, about 60 full-time musicians, is fed by lesser municipal orchestras and plays about 25 times a year, said two young players, Carelys Carreras Camporredondo, 23, and her teacher, Antonio Dorta Lazo, 29.
Despite its breathtaking dilapidation, Havana is a city of enormous charm. Parks, beautifully vegetated, are everywhere. Some restoration is taking place. Streets are as clean as can be expected given the peeling paint, broken windows and shedding plaster. Old mansions -- many are like palaces -- retain a crumbling grandeur. Cars a half-century old cruise the streets, giving the sense of a time warp. Uniformed police are seen everywhere and assuredly many more are unseen.
With a sweet patience, people in battalions crowd bus stops waiting for the next "camel," an elongated split-level vehicle carried on a flatbed truck and said to accommodate 250. This is a deeply troubled country, but there is an evident pride in Cuba's independent stance and a wistful friendliness toward America that does not exclude anger over the dispute surrounding Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee whose presence in the United States is being debated after he survived a ocean journey to Florida that took the lives of his mother and 10 others. The dollar is the currency of choice, preferably fives and tens.
Friday night's concert was touching, the program beginning with Liszt and ending again with "West Side Story." Horn players quelled their overactive stomachs and roared out the great horn passages of Strauss's "Don Juan." Three encores included Gershwin's "Cuban Overture." The Milwaukee's strings showed a European soulfulness and a corresponding European mushiness in ensemble. In American repertory, however, the orchestra turned very American, with a confident bite given to Bernstein's constant meter changes. Whether to attribute the fuzzy moments to collective exhaustion is hard to decide, but the orchestra seemed very well led by its conductor, Andreas Delfs, 40, a sound musician with precise conductorial control.
The Milwaukeans are home by now, basking I am sure in their city's approval and the heavy attention of international television crews. They must also be totally exhausted. Their tour seems to have been planned with the thought of everything going right. It didn't. Rarely in music will so much good and bad have been so tightly packed into two and a half days.

Butting Their Heads Against Religion and Men

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: MINNA, Nigeria

 BODY:
The sun was setting behind the Niger Queens' goalkeeper, casting its blinding rays on the dusty soccer field in this parched corner of West Africa. Then out of a jumble of flying legs and arms, she emerged from a cloud of dust, charging ahead with the ball. Spectators roared.
Her name is Amina Bala, officially No. 9 on the Niger Queens and unofficially the team's star forward. At 15, Amina hopes one day to join the Nigerian women's soccer team -- "inshallah," she said, God willing. But she is already a pioneer of sorts: a player in women's soccer, or female football, as it is known in Nigeria. 
 "I will score soon," said Amina at halftime, when the match was goalless. As the crowd watched, some sucked on sugar canes that a man was selling out of a wheelbarrow.
Nigerian men have long dominated soccer in Africa, and many of them rank among the highest-paid players in Europe. Soccer is such an integral part of life that when Lagos, the commercial capital, was closed to traffic on election day, boys swarmed the streets, alleys, highways and bridges, turning the city of eight million into a giant soccer field.
Despite the strong showing last summer by the Nigerian women's team in the World Cup competition in the United States, girls have long been discouraged in Nigeria and elsewhere on the continent from taking part in sports. Soccer in particular -- a sport associated here not with minivans and a desirable voting group, but with the barefoot poor -- was an activity from which daughters were kept away.
Feelings against soccer are strongest here in Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. The national women's team, the Super Falcons, came into existence in 1991 and is made up mostly of women from the Christian south. It was only in 1997 that Niger State, here in Nigeria's savanna region, gained its own team -- and lost its first match to the more experienced Jegede Babes of Lagos.
"Here in the north, it is very difficult for parents to let their daughters come out and play due to the culture of the area," said Dalandi Unmar, the soft-spoken coach of the Niger Queens, before the match in Minna, the state capital. "They think football will expose their daughters to immorality."
The worries expressed most often, Mr. Unmar said, are that the sport requires their daughters to wear revealing shorts or that playing might injure them -- specifically that it might make them infertile by harming their wombs.
The coach scouts schools and football fields for talent, mostly daughters of farmers and civil servants, but his job does not end there. "Then we have to visit their homes to plead with the parents," he said.
He said that the father of one of his stars abruptly forbade her to play after she went away for a tournament. "So I went to his house," the coach said. "But each time, they said he's not around. He's not around. But I could see he was around. So we lost her."
The raised eyebrows are not limited to Muslim players from the north, however. Promise Nwagboso, 15, a Christian from the south who was taking part in the tournament here, said her coach had found her playing on the streets with boys and asked to see her parents. Her parents consented, she said.
"But some people tried to discourage me that I was involved in a man's sport," Promise said. "But I told them that playing football will not affect my femininity."
Since 1995, Sa'adatu Kolo, the leader of the Female Football Development Committee of Niger State, has been visiting schools and villages to calm parents' fears over women's soccer. Mrs. Kolo played football in the late 1970's thanks to an open-minded coach at her school, and she said she has been in love with the sport since then. Mrs. Kolo has become chaperone and mother figure to the Niger Queens, the one to summon a player who is lingering after a match to talk to a boy.
"The parents see me, a Muslim woman and mother, and find it easier to give their daughters to me," she said. "But sometimes, even me -- I'm not finding it easy because of my religion and upbringing. Why should I be asking parents for their daughters?"
And yet, especially since the publicity surrounding the Super Falcons' strong performance in the United States, it has become easier to persuade parents of soccer's potential material benefits. About 35 new players have come out for the team in recent months. But the Niger Queens are still finding it hard to attract sponsors.
"And how many women of economic substance do we have?" she said. "And how many of them understand the benefits of female football?"
One woman of unchallenged economic substance was, in fact, sponsoring the current tournament here. She is Maryam Babangida, whose husband, Ibrahim, was the military leader of Nigeria from 1985 to 1993 and was the reputed mastermind behind half of Nigeria's coups -- nicknamed "Evil Genius" by the press. General Babangida is a native son of Minna and a resident here again in retirement.
Mrs. Babangida failed to appear at any of the matches last year during the first Maryam Babangida Female Football Tournament, and she was a no-show so far this year -- so it remained unclear why she had chosen to become a sponsor.
Did she see the benefits of female football? Did any of her own daughters play? Or was it to acknowledge, with a wink, her husband's legendary political footwork, which earned him another enduring nickname: Maradona, after the Argentine soccer star.
Whatever the reason, the tournament brought teams from all over the country as well as complaints familiar to most women athletes in the world. Women's soccer now has 34 teams in the top two divisions. But male players earn on average between $50 to $70 a month, plus bonuses for victories. The young women earned only bonuses.
"Sometimes we get match bonuses of 5,000 naira to be shared among 20 of us," said Bose Adejumo, 20, who played for the Niger Queens, mentioning a sum of about $50.
Still, girls like Amina, the star forward, whom townsfolk here had watched playing soccer with boys on the streets for years, continued to make bold predictions. Would the Nigerian women's team, which advanced to the quarter finals last time, win the next World Cup?
"Of course," Amina said, unabashed that her earlier prediction about scoring had yet to come true.
The match ended with no goals. But the crowd, especially the young women, seemed riveted to the end.
"I pray we shall win tonight," said Salamutu Ali, 19, standing on the side. "This is my team."
At first, Ms. Ali, from a Muslim family in the north, denied that she played soccer. She softened after a while, leaning back against a white car, her left hand resting on the trunk. Yes, she played soccer and one day -- "by the grace of God" -- she would do so for the Super Falcons.
The sun's dying rays illuminated the field. The temperature had cooled abruptly. The sugar cane salesman's wheelbarrow was nearly empty. Local boys were kicking around a ball.
A boy kicked the ball in Ms. Ali's direction.
"Play! Play! Play!" the boy yelled at her.
She sprang toward the ball and with a kick sent it soaring into the air.

HEADLINE: In Suffolk, Shelter Rules Force Two Into Foster Care

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
On Dec. 7, in the office of the Suffolk County Department of Social Services in Coram, two caseworkers and four guards took Billy and Dillon Engesser, ages 8 and 4, into foster care. Officially, their mother, Eve Engesser, who is unemployed and homeless, became the first parent in the county to lose custody of her children as a direct result of regulations that make work and other welfare rules a condition of shelter.
County officials say they are only following state regulations aimed at pushing homeless families to self-sufficiency -- regulations that the Giuliani administration wants to enforce in New York City. The rules call for children to be placed in foster care if they are considered at imminent risk of harm when their parents are ejected from a homeless shelter for violating work requirements and other rules. 
 The Rev. Ralph B. Wright, minister of the Yaphank Presbyterian Church, where the Engessers were parishioners before they became homeless, called the result "outrageous." He said he had driven the family to the social services office himself in the belief that he had brokered an alternative to foster care during the four-month period when the boys' 22-year-old mother is barred from shelter, a penalty imposed after she missed a workfare appointment.
"The children were crying, the mother was crying, the grandmother was going into hysterics," Mr. Wright recalled.
Dennis Nowak, spokesman for Suffolk County's Department of Social Services, declined to discuss details of the case on the ground of confidentiality. "It's not for us to determine whether or not the rules are appropriate," he said. "If we were to do otherwise, it would be to go against state regulations."
Family Court officials also cited confidentiality in declining to discuss a hearing on the case held on Tuesday. But Mr. Wright, who participated, said county lawyers acknowledged that there had been no child abuse or neglect. And the minister said that the judge, Jeffrey Arlen Spinner, who is to determine today how Christmas visitation will be handled, said the children would be returned the moment their mother found a home. The problem is that even an Internet search has turned up nothing for the $650 to $700 rent allowance set by the county.
Mr. Wright had told the children they would be placed in temporary housing with their grandparents, Edward Engesser, a disabled Air Force veteran, and Barbara Engesser, a diabetic recovering from surgery, who had emerged from the hospital into homelessness themselves just as their daughter and her two sons were being ejected from the shelter. Instead, caseworkers abruptly revealed that they had decided the grandparents were too disabled, he said.
A tight real estate market heightens more fundamental tensions at the heart of the case. On one side are tough shelter and welfare rules aimed at making parents better providers. On the other is the thrust of a century of child welfare law and psychology, that children should not be removed from loving parents because of poverty.
These issues are central in legal challenges to the regulations, which make homeless shelters subject to the same system of eligibility screenings, job searches and work assignments necessary to get welfare.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is appealing recent orders by two state court judges temporarily halting enforcement of the regulations in the city, where a 1989 court ruling, upheld on appeal, declared that children cannot be taken into foster care for lack of housing, and that services and housing subsidies should be used instead.
A class-action lawsuit based on that case is expected to be filed shortly in Suffolk County, where the rules have been enforced since 1996 and about half a dozen families are now expelled each month. Families are warned that unless they have a plan for the children, child protective services will be summoned. But until now, no children had been removed because parents typically said they had housing, and the county did not check. But recent media attention highlighted families who were actually sleeping on floors or in cars with their children.
County officials maintain that ejection is only a last resort to discipline those who refuse to work for their shelter, or who disobey other rules despite ample help. But the case of Eve Engesser, who was 13 when Billy was born and left school in 10th grade, illustrates the more complicated picture of cumulative missteps that can no longer be rectified, rather than a refusal to work. She said she misunderstood a letter to appear at the county's Department of Labor, believing she was already complying because she attended the Employment Readiness Program in the same building. The missed appointment led to ejection because she had two other welfare sanctions before she became homeless.
One, she said, resulted when she missed high school equivalency classes because Billy was sick. Another dated from Dillon's infancy, when she was summoned for a work assignment, only to be sent home by a supervisor who told her she was exempt, she said, then penalized for not going.
"This is a world with legalisms that would make the Pharisees look like saints," said Mr. Wright, who moonlights as a tax accountant. "They set these people up to fail, and then they sanction them when they do fail. So they're punishing the children for the failure of the mother."
Billy's father has not been in the picture for years. Also 13 when his son was born, he has yet to pay $400 a month in child support recently ordered by a court. Dillon's father just lost an effort to contest his paternity.
Since the boys were were placed in foster care on Dec. 7 -- at a cost of $810 a month -- they have been allowed to see their mother only once, for two hours, in a county office in Ronkonkoma. Billy, a third grader, has not been in school since his removal.
"They kept saying, 'Mommy, how much time do we have left?' and 'Mommy, I don't want you to go,' " the boys' mother said through tears after the visit. She wept again as she searched through the plastic bags that now hold the family's belongings in an unheated building behind the Yaphank church.
The jumble of toys, clothing and memorabilia included Dillon's first footprints, the valentines the children made her last year and the Power Ranger figure that Dillon has carried to bed with him since babyhood. Because their removal was unexpected, Mr. Wright said, the boys went into foster care with only the clothes on their backs.
As the minister drove her through Yaphank, an almost rural corner of eastern Long Island, Ms. Engesser wistfully pointed out the house where the whole family used to live in a $703-a-month attic apartment. After the house was sold, she said, they made a disastrous attempt to relocate to Florida. Unable to find affordable housing on their return, she and the boys entered the HELP-Suffolk shelter in Bellport, where 76 families live in apartmentlike units. They were ejected on county orders on Dec. 2.
"We believe it's a tragedy that this family has been separated," said Richard Motta, president of HELP-USA, the nonprofit parent agency.
After the ejection, Ms. Engesser's father spent his $863 veteran's check to house the family in a motel for four nights. Now the grandparents have been placed by the county in another motel, and could be kicked out for letting their daughter sleep there, Mr. Wright said. But her mother needs her care, and she has nowhere else to go.
"It's a nightmare that someone can come and take your own flesh and blood," the grandmother cried. "Why? Because we're poor."

HEADLINE: Minority Growth Slips at Top Private Schools

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
With anticipation and some foreboding, Alberto Monegro rides a bus every morning from the working-class brown brick apartment hulks of the Bedford Park neighborhood in the Bronx to the expansive lawns and mansions of Riverdale.
There, on an 18-acre neo-Gothic campus that resembles a small college, he is a junior at the private Fieldston School, one of the city's elite. It is his third year, yet he still wonders at times if he belongs. 
 A native of the Dominican Republic, Alberto has found few other Spanish-speaking students at Fieldston. He is floored by the affluence: the sport utility vehicles that pull up to the long drive off Manhattan College Parkway, the jewelry worn by some students, the laptops toted by others.
"It is," he says, "disorienting."
Alberto's experience is not unique. His journey -- physical and emotional -- from his familiar neighborhood to an enclave of power and wealth is made daily by scores of minority students. And while it is a triumphant voyage, it is a confounding one, and the number of those making it is stalling. In fact, despite three decades of intensive recruitment, and with the city's nonwhite population continuing to expand, the growth in the minority share of the elite schools is flattening. Officials at many of the schools say they are worried.
"It's a funny time," said Randolph Carter, director of diversity for the National Association of Independent Schools, who fields calls constantly from schools across the country struggling with the issue. "Right now the economy is booming. The schools are raising more money. They have longer waiting lists. But on the other side I see a fluctuation in enrollment of children of color. There is certainly a paucity of teachers of color in the classrooms and in the administrative office. It is the best of times and really hard times."
Among schools in New York City, there is a fear they have hit a recruitment wall. Many schools, including Fieldston, Brearley, Spence and Friends Seminary, have entered into serious bouts of soul-searching over their attitudes toward race, ethnicity and class. Committees, task forces and less formal gatherings have emerged. Books like "Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?" (Basic Books, 1997) by Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist, have become required reading among staff members. Student forums on the topic abound, and several schools have hired multicultural affairs coordinators.
"Clearly, the American dream or ideal that we base diversity under has not been fulfilled, yet it still nags at our conscience enough to keep trying to make it workable," said Richard Eldridge, the director of Friends Seminary.
Minority parents and students say that while it is clear that the schools offer a top education, it is a painfully difficult decision whether or not to attend these schools.
Frances Sadler, a black parent who lives in Riverdale, said she was torn about sending her son to middle school at Fieldston, despite its reputation for progressivism and tolerance. She recalled her own discomfort as one of only a dozen or so black students at Barnard College in 1968.
"I did not want that experience for him," Ms. Sadler said. She added, nonetheless, that sending her son was the right decision, that he was happy and had done well at Fieldston. Yet she could not help worrying about a racial tinge when he was disciplined.
Indeed, many students say the price of admission is sometimes discomfort on campus. Many minority students say they find themselves in the spotlight, singled out for class discussions on race, sought out unnaturally for trophy friendships by white students, and constantly the subject of speculation over whether they are qualified or taking the spot of others more deserving.
So minority parents often choose other options, including parochial schools and a move to the suburbs.
This year, Priscilla M. Winn Barlow, the head of Brearley, said she was jolted when not one of the five black children accepted for kindergarten this fall enrolled. Transportation concerns, as well as the dearth of minority students in the lower grades were cited as main factors.
Some black parents of Brearley students were not shocked.
"You have to change what's in there before you can bring people in," said Donna Givens, an African-American parent there. "What is the community about now? What kind of bias awareness training do we have? We need to look at things like that, not just the numbers."
Mrs. Givens said that until Brearley took a number of steps, including hiring more minority faculty members and reassessing its curriculum, it would be difficult to attract minority families.
Dr. Winn Barlow did not disagree but expressed concern about going overboard or falling victim to political correctness.
Some minority parents and people who have worked in private schools view such responses with suspicion. They dismiss the soul-searching at the schools as largely artificial, saying the institutions are so bound by tradition, so wary of significant change -- and so focused on keeping their clientele happy -- that little should be expected.
In fact, as tuition at top schools soars to just under $20,000 a year, headmasters say that complaints have grown, primarily from white, affluent parents, regarding the amount of money devoted to minority-oriented scholarships, even though the percentage of tuition revenue spent on financial aid has remained steady, averaging about 13 percent. Many such parents labor under the mistaken impression that virtually all minority students are on full scholarship or were admitted under lower standards, the headmasters add.
Moreover, many white parents worry that places at selective colleges that might go to their children will go instead to minority competitors.
"The first thing you need to understand is the history of private education is one of exclusion, not inclusion," said Augustus Trowbridge, the retired founder of Manhattan Country School, a well-regarded private school that opened in 1966 on the Upper East Side with cultural diversity as its underpinning. "Private education is, for right or wrong, designed to bring people together who share common philosophies. Private education has had to catch up with a redefinition of its purpose."
Private education, of course, is not alone in this, but reflective of a broader national pattern, with many whites feeling their efforts have gone underappreciated and many blacks feeling patronized.
The road to self-reflection, never smooth at any institution, has included some awkward missteps at New York's private schools. Earlier this year, for example, Fieldston seriously considered a plan to cluster minority students in classes so that none would face isolation and alienation. The proposal, which was killed, ended up angering people across the board, some of whom sensed whiffs of segregation while others suspected an end run around more aggressive recruitment.
What cannot be denied is that the schools have made much progress in the last few decades and are, as a group, more integrated than most of the region's better suburban public schools and even many city public schools, which are now have a high concentration of minority students, a function of the demographics of the areas they serve.
Responding to the ferment of the civil rights movement, many schools in the 1960's and early 1970's began recruiting minority students, primarily those who were black and Hispanic, because they were considered the most economically and socially disadvantaged, Mr. Trowbridge said. Such recruitment was seen as an act of social responsibility.
In 1970, minority enrollment at the city's most coveted private schools was about 11 percent, according to the schools' reports to the state. Since then, thanks mainly to the rise of recruiting organizations like Prep for Prep, A Better Chance, the Albert G. Oliver Program and Early Steps, minority enrollment has increased to about 21 percent, though the percentage tends to be lower in the elementary grades and higher in high school.
But the pace of growth has slowed -- in 1990, minority enrollment was 19 percent -- and its racial makeup has shifted. Asian-Americans' share of the enrollment has risen steadily while that of black and Hispanic students has not.
Blacks still represent the largest percentage of minority students among the city's elite private schools -- 8.6 percent -- but that may not last. Asians are at 7.5 percent and Hispanic students at 4.8. At a number of major schools, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders account for the largest proportion of minority students. (The state does not include a biracial category, though administrators say its numbers are significant.)
A growing concern is that many black and Hispanic families are going elsewhere. Even when they can afford the steep tuition, many opt for specialized public schools or parochial schools, or simply move to the suburbs, where public schools have a better reputation, said Frederick C. Calder, executive director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, an advocacy group.
Justine Stamen, a former private school administrator who began a program this year called the Teak Fellowship to prepare 22 gifted minority students for the top public and private high schools, said none of the families initially expressed interest in the private schools.
Jason Lewis, an African-American student at Brooklyn Technical High School, one of the four top public specialized high schools in the city that require passing a standardized test for admission, said he hardly gave a thought to private schools. He had flipped through several brochures for them but found Tech, where 38 percent of the students are black and 18 percent Hispanic, to be equal or superior. And it was free.
"Maybe a private school would be an option if I hadn't gotten into a specialized high school," he said.
Perhaps the overriding source of anxiety for minority students in private schools is just what role they play on campus. Are they there for white students to learn about differences, or vice versa, or both? Black parents have the dual fear that their children will not be accepted by the majority and that if they are, they will lose any grounding in their own culture and origins.
Corey Manning, an African-American who is now a freshman at Howard University, said he had often felt misunderstood at Fieldston.
"Because of my face and the way I talk and the way I dress, I am deemed as lazy," said Mr. Manning, dressed one evening in a Fubu T-shirt, baggy jeans and a black headband. "Because I am not jumping around here with a smile, I am an angry black male. Why is that?"
Kamau Romero, a black senior at Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said that over all, he felt happy at the school, though at times he felt singled out for his race.
During a class discussion of the book "Black Like Me," which deals with prejudice toward black men, a teacher paused to ask, "What are some black stereotypes, Kamau?"
"He put me on the spot in the middle of class," Mr. Romero said.
As Hugo Mahabir, the director of multicultural affairs at Fieldston, reflected on the difficulties at Fieldston and other schools, he spoke for many: "I think there is a degree of honesty and reflection that feels very authentic. But it's easy to make a rhetorical commitment to diversity. It's harder to put that in practice."
As for Alberto Monegro, he has made peace of a sort with Fieldston, which he believes has put him on the path to realizing his dream of becoming a doctor. While he once would have been reluctant to recommend the school to a friend, he would do so now, with a qualification.
"I would recommend it," he said, "if they can handle it."

HEADLINE: A Focused Role for the I.M.F.

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers proposed last week that the International Monetary Fund begin to move away from making long-term loans to developing countries and focus instead on one key mission: lending to countries in temporary financial crisis. That sensible proposal will attract bipartisan support in a Congress that has grown increasingly hostile to the fund's perceived failures in Russia, Brazil and elsewhere.
Indeed, Mr. Summers knows that a Congressionally appointed commission will soon propose trimming fund missions along the lines he suggests. The commission, led by Prof. Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, has tentatively decided to recommend eliminating the fund's programs to promote development in poor countries -- a responsibility it thinks should be solely the World Bank's. The commission would also eliminate fund programs that promote the transition of the former Soviet Union to markets. Mr. Summers's speech not only pre-empts the commission's recommendations, but also helps insulate Vice President Al Gore from Republican criticism of the fund's failed bailout of Russia, which was undertaken with the Clinton Administration's vigorous support. 
 Some countries wind up borrowing from the fund for 30 or 40 years with no decisive results. Many of these countries, Mr. Summers points out, could tap private capital markets instead.
Yet Mr. Summers's speech did not go nearly as far as critics of the fund would have liked. He suggested that the fund continue to lend to the poorest countries to combat poverty, thus watering down his call for narrowing its mission. He embraced the tools by which the fund currently lends money during crises whereas Mr. Meltzer says his commission will propose major improvements.
Mr. Summers disappointed some critics by issuing only a half-hearted call for the fund to lend to distressed countries even when they owe money to foreign banks. Many economists object to the fund's current practice of requiring that banks be paid in full before the fund steps in -- guaranteeing that the banks walk away unscathed while workers suffer the full brunt of economic collapse.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the fund was the only international financial institution willing and able to help the former Communist countries move to markets, but its ability to sway the destiny of these economies is quickly receding. The World Bank is better positioned to fight poverty in poor countries that cannot attract private capital. That leaves emergency lending as the one mission the fund is best equipped to handle. Mr. Summers does not go that far. But he has at least put the United States in position to start shoving the fund in that direction.

HEADLINE: Repackaging The Big Box;
Despite Zoning Rules and Hostility, Superstores Thrive in Crowded City

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Three years ago, the City Council defeated a plan by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that would have made it easier for warehouse-style superstores to come into the city. Undeterred, national chain stores said this setback would not stop them from entering the lucrative New York market.
And it hasn't. Since 1996, about 40 superstores with well-known names like Kmart, Home Depot and Target have sprouted in New York, and more are expected as retailers pursue additional sites. The stores have fashioned themselves for the New York City market: to get around zoning restrictions, some of the chains have squeezed into much smaller spaces than they are accustomed to occupying, while others have taken advantage of loopholes in zoning regulations -- for example, by putting most of their floor space in a basement. 
 With New York being the last frontier for such stores, often called big boxes, plans to build more often evoke passionate opposition, especially in the city's more densely populated areas. But there is little doubt that the stores are catching on with many New York consumers. Chains like Target and Kmart say their New York City stores are among their top performers.
Earlier this month, Home Depot, the giant home improvement chain, which has six stores in the city and is about to open one in Rego Park, Queens, filed a building permit application for yet another store in College Point, Queens, not far from its 20th Avenue store, said Jesse Masyr, a zoning lawyer who represents Home Depot.
Last month, Kmart opened a store on Bruckner Boulevard, and Target plans to take over the site of a former Stern's in Elmhurst.
Now Costco, the chain famous for its warehouse-style stores that sell industrial-size containers of laundry detergent and 36-roll packages of toilet paper, is setting its sights on the middle of Manhattan, planning to open what would in effect become the largest supermarket in the city. The company recently had to scrap plans to build another supermarket, on 14th Street, but a shopping center in East Harlem that would house both a Home Depot and a Costco recently made it through the zoning review process.
Queens, especially, is dotted with so many superstores that Tom and Bonita Klein of Long Island City say they have stopped driving to Nassau County to do their shopping.
Instead, they make weekly trips to Home Depot on Northern Boulevard, spend about $300 a month on staples at B. J.'s Wholesale Club in College Point and often pop into the neighboring Target store to pick up toys for their two children. "They have good prices and a good selection," said Mr. Klein. The Kleins patronize small stores only for produce and other perishable items.
Dorothy Berkowitz, of Flushing, said she is tired of jammed Manhattan department stores. "For something special," she said as she pushed a cart down the Target store's wide aisles, "I'd go to Manhasset or into the city, but for everyday -- for pants, sweaters, sheets and pillowcases -- this is fine."
Some Manhattan residents are also fans of superstores. Debra Engel, who lives on the Upper East Side, said that when she entertains, she drives across the Queensborough Bridge to the sprawling Costco in Long Island City. But she said she did not do her regular shopping at the wholesale club. "I don't have much storage," she said.
It may seem as if the national retailers are descending on the city at a breathtaking rate -- Costco already has three stores in the city -- but Giuliani administration officials maintain that the pace is not quick enough, and they contend that the number of new stores in New York falls short of the number needed to compensate for the retail jobs lost in the last recession. From 1989 through 1993, the city lost 39,200 retail jobs; by the end of 1998 it had regained 22,400, according to the State Department of Labor. (Some of this job loss has been offset in the restaurant industry, where 27,300 jobs have been created since 1993.)
And, administration officials say, the existing zoning regulations -- drawn up in 1974 in a failed effort to keep industries and lure new ones into manufacturing areas -- make no sense because they restrict only certain categories of retailing. Thus, movie multiplexes, Home Depots and other giant retail outlets that were not envisioned when the zoning regulations were changed are proliferating while badly needed supermarkets are not.
"The increase in retail activity has been nowhere near as significant as it would have been had our plan been approved," said Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission. "By every measure, our retail economy underperforms, especially in the categories that we restrict."
City Council members, however, deny that they hindered the development of superstores. "The argument was that these stores could not come here without changing the law," said Walter L. McCaffrey, the chairman of the City Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee. "That's obviously not the case."
Under Mayor Giuliani's unsuccessful plan, any store up to 200,000 square feet -- bigger than three football fields -- would have been able to open in one of these manufacturing areas without a zoning exception. Based on calculations of how many dollars city residents were spending outside the city, administration officials said that abolishing the zoning restrictions could have resulted in as many as 57 additional stores.
A major concern for opponents of the mayor's plan was the effect superstores would have on smaller retail businesses. But so far, no one can be sure what the impact has been.
In Queens, for example, many people worried that the new superstores on Northern Boulevard would destroy the shopping strip on Astoria's Steinway Street.
But Tony Barsamian, the chairman of the Steinway Street Business Improvement District, which represents 300 stores, said his members have been able to compete effectively because they offer more personal service. "We don't begrudge the big boxes," Mr. Barsamian said. "We wish them well as long as we can get our share of the pie."
Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough president, said the Home Depot in Flushing has had a ripple effect, bringing contracting and home decorating businesses into the neighborhood. "I've heard that there has been an impact on the smaller hardware stores," she said. "But on balance, it's been great for consumers."
Some merchants in Brooklyn take issue with that notion. "The vast majority of people are complaining that their business is not what it used to be," said Peter Morisi, a pasta wholesaler who said he closed his retail shop, the Macaroni Store, at Fifth Avenue and 18th Street, in 1997, in part because of the competition from the new Costco in Sunset Park.
According to Giuliani administration officials, the inconsistencies in the zoning rules are hardest on the supermarket chains, which lack the resources of the national retailers.
But Harvey Gutman, a spokesman for Pathmark, which is building or has opened eight stores in the city since 1996 and also has its eye on 14th Street, said that supermarkets can find ways to surmount the New York regulatory hurdles.
"Supermarket chains that are fixed in their view of what a store should look like -- the parking always outside the door, receiving always in the center to the rear -- are going to be disappointed," he said. "Those willing to be flexible and creative will find a way to get stores built."
In seeking a larger presence in Manhattan, Costco is trying to be both. The store it hopes to open between 55th and 56th Streets on 10th Avenue would be based on a new model called Costco Fresh, specializing in food. Though relatively small at 70,000 square feet (the Long Island City store is 130,000 square feet), it would be the largest supermarket in Manhattan -- about seven times the size of an independent supermarket. There would be no parking.
Costco is also bidding on a city-owned site on Orchard Street, said Jeffrey H. Brotman, the company's chairman.
Some of Costco's plans are meeting fierce resistance from community groups and elected officials in some of the city's most politically active neighborhoods. Although Mr. Brotman denies it, neighborhood opposition is widely believed to have forced Costco out of a development that will replace the 14th Street Armory near Sixth Avenue. Now Costco plans to re-evaluate an earlier proposal for a store at 10th Avenue and 23rd Street that was shelved because it did not conform to Chelsea's new zoning plan, Mr. Brotman said.
Opponents say the stores would bring thousands of cars and trucks to their neighborhoods and are not needed in Manhattan, where most people lack cars and storage.
They also fault Costco for its $40 annual membership fee, saying it is out of reach for many residents, and for its refusal to accept food stamps or the electronic debit cards that welfare recipients use. Leaders of unions that represent supermarket employees have joined the fight because workers in newer Costco stores are not unionized.
Mr. Brotman has pledged to limit truck deliveries, curtail noise and offer memberships to any New York resident, not just those who work for large companies or belong to large organizations like labor unions.
Most of the opposition to Costco is being fanned by competing supermarkets and labor unions, Mr. Brotman said. "We're not coming to Manhattan because we want to fail," he said. "We don't think that in these neighborhoods that the majority of people don't want us. We think that most people do want us."

HEADLINE: Using Gene Tests to Customize Medical Treatment

SERIES: TAILOR-MADE MEDICINE: First of two articles

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
Warren Wegele is on the front line of a medical revolution.
After doing a simple blood test recently, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center told Mr. Wegele, a 65-year-old former salesman for air compressor companies, that he had inherited a tiny alteration in one of his genes. A certain chemical unit out of the string of three billion that make up the mass of DNA in his cells is different from the norm. 
 The alteration -- found in 5 percent of the population -- would normally be of no more medical significance to Mr. Wegele (pronounced WEG-lee) than his black hair or burly physique. But it translated into a potential medical catastrophe for Mr. Wegele when he became ill with congestive heart failure, a disease in which the heart muscle no longer contracts vigorously. On average, patients with the condition live 5 years after they become ill; some live 10 years or more.
But people with anomalies like Mr. Wegele's altered gene, doctors told him, usually live only one to two years. For these people, the drugs used to treat the disease may be of little help.
"I don't accept it," Mr. Wegele said of the bad news doctors gave him about his gene, which directs heart cells to make a crucial protein. After all, he argued, as he lay in his hospital bed, "I've never really gotten ill, and I've always recovered from everything instantly."
But Mr. Wegele's former vigor was beside the point. Clearly ill, he had spent weeks in the hospital, growing sicker by the day, waiting for a heart to become available for a transplant -- the only way, his doctors said, to save his life.
The revolutionary new genetics that predicted Mr. Wegele's dire circumstances is not about genes that confer generally good health or health that is generally poor. Instead, it is about a collection of common single-molecule variations in genetic material that are normally no more important than having curly or straight hair or brown or blue eyes, but might be revealing when people become ill.
Scientists believe humans have hundreds of thousands of these genetic variations, and drug companies are avidly searching for them, convinced that they can use collections of them to identify patients who will benefit from drugs, patients who will not, and patients who will suffer troubling side effects.
Eventually, they say, this research will lead them into an era of tailor-made medicine.
So far, testing for such genetic variants is being done only at a few medical centers as part of experimental trials. Experts predict a gradual increase in such testing as the roster of variations is compiled and research accelerates. They predict that the first personalized drug prescriptions will appear in a few years and many more will roll out over the next two decades.
At first, the advanced genetic testing will probably be used for refining drugs for the more common diseases like asthma, arthritis, heart disease, high blood pressure and migraines. Eventually, experts say, it could be applied to virtually any drug for any disease.
Drug prices could increase, some drug company executives say, but they add that drugs will be so much more effective that they will be worth more to patients.
Of course, optimistic predictions of scientists and drug companies can go awry, and until the revolution in pharmacology takes place, it is hard to know if the glowing predictions are accurate. So far, only a relatively few genetic variants have been found and only a small number of these have been shown to have medical consequences.
In Mr. Wegele's case, there was no good drug to slow his disease. But that did not mean he had not been helped. Based on their data from a continuing study that now includes about 500 patients with congestive heart failure, doctors at the University of Cincinnati hospital said that the only long-term hope for people with Mr. Wegele's genetic variant was a heart transplant.
"We test everyone who has congestive heart failure," said Dr. Stephen Liggett, a lung specialist and molecular geneticist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, who discovered the genetic variant and its effects on congestive heart failure. Dr. Liggett said it was his opinion that those who had the genetic variation, like Mr. Wegele, "should be put on the transplant list early and they should have more aggressive drug therapy."
On Dec. 9, Mr. Wegele received a new heart. A week later, Dr. Liggett said, Mr. Wegele was well enough to be sent home.
 
The Scientists
From Impossible Task To Reasonable Goal
Five years ago, when he was giving a technical talk to scientists, Dr. Eric Lander had a eureka moment. Dr. Lander, who is director of the Center for Genome Research at the Whitehead Institute in Boston, had assumed that it would be hopeless to even dream of finding the common variants in human genes. Gene alterations -- single chemical changes -- occur by accident, at random. Those with an immediate effect on health or fertility would be retained or eliminated by evolution.
The other alterations would be neutral -- they would ordinarily make no difference to the person -- and so they would slowly become common as they were passed from generation to generation.
With about 100,000 human genes and six billion people on earth, the number of common variations could be enormous. But, Dr. Lander realized, the human race numbered just 10,000 to 100,000 people as recently as 7,000 generations ago and a population that small would have only a modest number of common genetic variants, perhaps a few hundred thousand.
"There hasn't been enough time for the common variants to build up," Dr. Lander said. For each gene, there might be two, or three, common variations at one or two positions in the gene sequence, not hundreds.
"It becomes a finite problem," Dr. Lander said. "It is within reach."
That insight converted him into one of the pioneers in the search for genetic variants that can predict individual differences in responses to illness and responses to drugs, a field known as pharmacogenetics.
Around the same time Dr. Lander was realizing that each gene might have just a few variants, Dr. Liggett, then a researcher at Duke University, was starting to see what such variants might mean for patients.
Dr. Liggett was intrigued by one particular gene, the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene. It directs cells to make a protein that helps relax muscles in the airways of the lungs and contract muscles in the heart. Drugs for asthma attach themselves to the protein, setting off a cascade of biochemical events inside the cells that makes the airways dilate. Drugs for congestive heart failure also attach themselves to the protein, this time making heart muscles contract.
In studies with cells grown in the laboratory, Dr. Liggett discovered that the gene that codes for production of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor protein seemed exquisitely tuned by its structure. A change in just a single chemical along the gene's length could make the protein work slightly better, or slightly worse.
The next step was to find out if this could occur in humans.
Dr. Liggett and his colleagues recruited 100 healthy people and began deciphering the chemical sequence of each person's beta adrenergic receptor gene. After 18 months, he got his answer. There were three different variants of the gene. All three worked fine.
Nonetheless, Dr. Liggett's mind raced. Maybe this was why some people respond better than others to asthma drugs. Maybe it was why some people taking asthma drugs quickly become resistant to them and others did not. Maybe it was also tied to the way patients with congestive heart failure responded to drugs.
"A lot of people told me that what we had found was unimportant," Dr. Liggett said. "They were wrong."
Last year, in a paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigations, Dr. Liggett and his colleagues showed how the genetic variants affected disease prognosis in congestive heart failure. Reporting on tests of 259 patients who had come to the University of Cincinnati to be evaluated for possible heart transplants, the researchers found that those with one particular beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene variant did far worse than those with another. A third group was in the middle.
Within 100 days after they arrived at the hospital, about 60 percent of the patients with an isoleucine amino acid at position 164 in the protein chain were dead or required a heart transplant. That is the variant that Mr. Wegele has.
Patients with a different amino acid, threonine, at position 164, had a much better outcome. About 95 percent of them were alive after 100 days without having had a heart transplant, and half were still alive 900 days after they first arrived at the hospital.
Other changes in the gene appear to be important in asthma.
In a recent small study conducted at the University of Tennessee at Memphis, Dr. Julie A. Johnson, Dr. John J. Lima and their colleagues found that asthma patients who inherited from both parents the amino acid arginine in position 16 of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor protein responded best to the popular asthma drug albuterol. The drug increased the amount of air they could expel from their lungs by 18 percent. Those who inherited from either parent the chemical glycine in that position had just a 4.9 percent increase in the air they expelled.
"We've always known that some people respond better to albuterol," Dr. Liggett said. "But we've never known why."
Now the challenge is to tailor drug treatments to help those who have genetic variants that spell a poor prognosis.
"That," said Dr. Liggett, "is the key to pharmacogenetics."
 
The Drug Companies
First-Time Step In Joint Research
Hidden in the rolling countryside near Hopewell, N.J., in a cluster of brick buildings once owned by Mobil Oil is Bristol-Myers Squibb's budding center of pharmacogenomics research. There, in echoing offices still under construction, Dr. Elliott Sigal makes bold plans to expand his staff and investments in what he believes will be the future of the drug industry.
When executives like Dr. Sigal look at the pharmaceutical industry, they groan. One out of 7,500 compounds that looks promising in the laboratory actually gets to the market. Only 3 out of 10 that are marketed make any money for the company.
"Our attrition rate is a plague for the industry," Dr. Sigal said, referring to the many drugs that fail.
Typically, said Dr. Sigal, who is Bristol-Myer's senior vice president for early discovery and applied technology, major drug companies introduce one innovative drug into the market each year -- if they are lucky. For many drugs, he added, only half of the patients who take them respond.
Some drugs are worse than that. People with conditions like high blood pressure, for example, often find themselves trying one drug after another before they find a medication that works for them.
Other drugs are rarely used because they cause side effects in a small proportion of patients.
For example, a drug like Glaxo Wellcome's Lamictal, which is used to treat epilepsy, can cause itching and rashes. It can only be used by patients whose doctors are willing to start with a small dose and gradually increase it over a period of months, watching to see if a rash develops.
"When most general practitioners see that a drug needs dose escalation, they use something else," said Dr. Allen Roses, a neurologist who is vice president worldwide and director of genetics at Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. "But it's a great drug."
Dr. Roses and others emphasize that if genetic variants could be used to identify who would respond to a drug and who would have side effects, the benefits for companies and patients would be obvious. Companies could sell more drugs, more efficiently, by marketing them to those who would be helped. And patients would get drugs that worked for them.
For companies like Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as Pfizer, the path is clear. Last April, they and seven other large drug companies joined forces with the Wellcome Trust, a medical research charity, and several leading academic centers, to compare human DNA segments and find the places where variations occur. The companies will use these variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and pronounced "snips," to try to develop the precisely targeted drugs of the future. Their goal is to identify 300,000 such landmarks along the human DNA within two years and make the results public.
On Nov. 21, the group, called the SNP Consortium, published on the Internet its first group of SNP's, identifying 2,279 of them and describing their precise sites on human chromosomes.
But more is involved than just finding SNP's. Companies are also worried about the bottom line: How much will it cost to find these alterations in genes?
Today, it costs $150 or more to identify each of a person's S.N.P.'s, said Dr. B. Michael Silber, who directs pharmacogenetics research at Pfizer. The goal, he said, is to get the price down to pennies, which he called feasible.
Even a man who describes himself as "leading the way in caution" is convinced that SNP analyses will become cheap enough to be useful. Dr. Paul Spence, the executive director of biotechnology for Searle, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto, said that before he committed himself to SNP analyses, he actually sat down with pen and paper and worked out the economics. Like Dr. Spence, he concluded that cost would not be an obstacle for long.
As for Dr. Roses of Glaxo Wellcome, as early as September of 1997, he persuaded his company to begin storing DNA samples from every patient in most of its drug studies. The idea is that when the SNP's are found, the company can go back and ask: What patterns of these molecular markers correlate with what sort of drug responses? If one pattern is associated with a drug's efficacy and another with bad side effects, the company would consider marketing the drug only to those with the pattern that predicts a good response.
To protect patients' privacy, Dr. Roses said, their names and identifying features are not stored with their DNA.
Glaxo Wellcome plans to enter the pharmacogenetics market with a drug that is already on the market, offering patients a SNP test before they take the drug to see if they are likely to respond. Then the company plans to move on and use the SNP profiles as part of drug development. In a few years, drug company executives predict, SNP tests will be available for several drugs and several diseases. Eventually, most drugs will be sold with a SNP test, companies say.
Companies expect to use a "SNP chip" for testing. It is a device that can be used to scan a sample of DNA for specific genetic sequences or anomalies.
In the future, drug company executives predict, SNP research will reward them with hundreds of new drugs, including many that will be unlike any on the market today. With that in mind, Dr. Sigal said, his company has a new business goal. Rather than settling for the current pattern of one entirely new drug on the market each year, the company aims to have three.
"Many companies see this as the way of the future." Dr. Sigal said.
 
The Ethics
Discriminatory Risks In Genetic Testing
Mention genes and diseases to many ethicists and they will see a dark side to a bright future. Will people be getting information about their medical conditions that they would rather not know? Can their privacy be protected?
Few are more acutely aware of these problems than Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the federal effort to map the human genes. From its inception, the genome project has had ethicists as consultants, and it has had to answer piercing questions about the consequences of unveiling what could be intimate genetic information.
While Dr. Collins is excited by the prospect of pharmacogenetics, he sees situations in which it could raise privacy problems. Knowing if someone will respond to a drug, or have a side effect, can tell something about that person's susceptibility to disease.
For example, scientists recently reported that a SNP pattern in a cholesterol-metabolizing gene determined who would respond to the cholesterol lowering drug pravastatin. But the people who respond to pravastatin are also the ones who will have the worst prognosis if they do not get their cholesterol levels down. Insurers might use that genetic information to deny or limit coverage.
"You won't be able to separate the reason you did the test from the response to it," Dr. Collins said.
The solution, he added, is to pass effective laws to prevent genetic discrimination. And, he said, "We are pretty close to seeing that come to pass."
Although genetics always gives rise to ethical concerns, the debate over pharmacogenetics has so far been muted, with even some longtime critics of genetic testing saying that they think it will be a blessing to doctors and patients.
"I'm all for the research," said Dr. Michael Kaback, a geneticist at the University of California in San Diego, who has often criticized genetic testing. "I think it's great."
His main concern, he said, is that companies will promise too much too soon, turning the public bitter and cynical. "Then a whiplash occurs and you end up curtailing progress," Dr. Kaback said.
Dr. Roses noted that the pharmacogenetics approach might not provide people with information about disease susceptibility or their medical futures. While a genetic variant may make a difference in whether a person with asthma, for example, responds to albuterol, it does not have any bearing on whether that person will get asthma in the first place.
The genetic variant is predicting individual physiological responses to drug molecules, not the biochemical processes that caused the disease being treated. And when SNP patterns are analyzed together, as a sort of DNA bar code, they will predict drug responses without revealing anything about the actual genes on which the SNP's occur.
Bartha Maria Knoppers, a law professor at the University of Montreal, who is chairwoman of the international ethics committee of the Human Genome Organization, an international organization of scientists who are working on finding the sequence of the human genome, said she thinks that the benefits of the new approach are overwhelming.
"People will probably look with some suspicion on claims that this will ultimately be beneficial because it is in our cultural milieu to say 'Oh, another marketing ploy,"' Ms. Knoppers said.
But "I think that, provided we proceed with caution, that it can be very beneficial," she added. "There are drugs that don't work for many people, there are drugs that are dangerous. I would think that making drugs more therapeutic and safer surely is an ethical goal."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Hunt for Red Menaces

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the swift collapse of communism's Evil Empire, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is still darkly wary of Marxist influence in the nooks and crannies of the city.
The mayor's latest encounter with the Red Menace came as he faced down the threatened strike from the Transport Workers Union and its dissident faction, the New Directions Caucus. 
 "There are people who want to cause anarchy," the mayor warned at a City Hall news conference last week after a tentative agreement was announced. "I know a week ago I said that Marxism unfortunately is still alive in parts of New York City even in the latter part of this century, even though it's been disgraced all over the world."
Mr. Giuliani's vigilance in this matter has sometimes been overlooked in the hurly-burly of daily governance, but a review of his public statements shows that he has discerned a sinister Marxist tinge to a wide variety of enemies, from the paradoxically well-organized anarchists who sacked a Starbucks in Seattle to the gardeners who plant flowers in the city's vacant lots.
"The remarks of one of the leaders of New Directions is a perfect example of what I'm talking about, where he advocated taking away profits from business as being one of the really good side benefits of having a strike," Mr. Giuliani said. "I think he said he would take away the profit orgy of Christmas from businesses."
He was apparently referring to Tim Schermerhorn, a leader of the New Directions Caucus, who said, in threatening a strike: "The real powers that be in the city -- business -- is planning an orgy of profit-making. They're not going to rake it in if the trains aren't running."
That, the mayor said, "means taking jobs away from people. It means seeing unemployment go up. It means really hurting people who need the most help. And it's a true misunderstanding of what America is all about. That comes from the influence of Marxism, and if you need any better indication of it, it was said at a Marxist study group.
"So philosophy is important. It has done a tremendous amount of good things to help people, and the isms and ideologies of this century have cost an awful lot of human lives," the mayor concluded.
Mr. Giuliani expanded his horizon to foreign affairs last week, bearding Fidel Castro, that stubborn Communist holdout, by urging asylum for Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old found clutching an inner tube off Florida after his mother and stepfather drowned fleeing Cuba. There was even consideration at City Hall, later dropped, of inviting him to the New Year's Eve celebration.
"I think unfortunately and tragically Castro has become a romanticized figure in America," Mr. Giuliani said.
When the nonprofit Parks Council said that the growing reliance on private fund-raising for maintenance and repairs meant that greenswards in wealthy areas -- like Central Park -- got better services than those in poorer neighborhoods, Mr. Giuliani was not fooled by the composition of the 90-year-old council, which is made up of prominent blue bloods and even a top fund-raiser for George W. Bush.
"That's the rich-and-the-poor knee-jerk reaction," the mayor said. "It probably comes out of spending some time in school in the 40's or 50's studying Marxism or something."
The council's position "comes out of a very, very extreme radical political outlook on the world in which you were taught to look at things that way, and you just see them that way no matter what the facts are," Mr. Giuliani said in October.
Earlier this year, the mayor tried to sell developers more than 100 city-owned lots that neighborhood groups had transformed from garbage-strewn wrecks into flowering mini-parks, declaring, "This is a free-market economy; welcome to the era after communism." Protesters dressed as ladybugs and plants descended on City Hall, including a man in sunflower garb who took up a perch in a ginkgo tree. The dispute was resolved only by last-minute divine intervention, in the person of Bette Midler, who bought some of the most endangered lots.
More recently, he said at a gathering of big capitalists, er, business leaders, that the unruly demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle indicated "the remaining damage that Marxism has done to the thinking of people." He added, "You know we have it in the city and the influence that it's had on universities and thinking and the idea of class warfare."
The mayor explained later, at a City Hall news conference, that his remarks at the "21" Club, the famous gathering spot of the ruling class, oops, the rich and powerful, were meant to examine "the whole notion of class warfare, which really comes out of the teaching of Karl Marx, trying to divide people into different classes." He did not elaborate on his reference to the city's universities.
Mayor Giuliani has said he intends to deliver a speech for the new millennium in which he will discuss "the influence of isms and ideology on the kind of violence we've had in this century. Just because we're in the latter part of the century doesn't mean the perversions of those philosophies don't affect it."
Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Trailing Calamity Jane, Hoping to Find What's True

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
Kathleen Chalfant can do almost no wrong. If she wasn't already a star after playing a Mormon mom, a rabbi and Ethel Rosenberg in the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Angels in America," she became one last year, winning every Off Broadway acting award in sight as the dying poetry professor in the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Wit." Now her devotees will follow her to "True History and Real Adventures," which opened last night at the Vineyard Theater, and they are bound to be disappointed, not in Ms. Chalfant, who delights every time she steps onstage, but in what surrounds her.
What could Sybille Pearson have been thinking when she wrote this scattered, seemingly aimless play? A play with occasional music, in fact, but the music, by Mel Marvin, seems simply intrusive most of the time. It's a bad sign when the interviews the playwright and the director give about a work are more moving than the work itself. 
 "True History and Real Adventures" (a deadly title, although a meaningful one, once you've analyzed the themes) begins in 1893. On the surface it is about a young Scottish woman who sees a play about Calamity Jane, becomes obsessed with her and eventually meets her, after traveling America with a band of equally young, ambitious, slightly dishonest fellow immigrants with plans and problems of their own.
What Ms. Pearson means this to comment on, she says, is the theater's ability to tell truth through lies. Michael Mayer, the director (whose recent noteworthy work has included "Side Man" and "A View From the Bridge"), says the play's lesson is the need to claim ownership of your own history. Calamity, of course, may not have done everything she was said to do, and her young fan ends up becoming a celebrity herself, complete with legendary incidents that never happened and a fringed western pantsuit that would have looked at home on the Grand Ole Opry in the 1950's.
Ms. Pearson also means to point out the similarities between the 1890's and the 1990's and finds a couple of amusing examples. At one point, a character explains President William McKinley's trickle-down theory of economics. And out West, the young immigrants go into business selling a miracle tonic (mostly cocaine), which they promote as the 19th-century equivalent of Viagra. The townsfolk fall all over one another to buy it. The sales team, it is presumed, leaves town before the customers learn about cocaine's long-term effects on virility.
But over all, the play is trying to say too many things without a unifying insight. Several times, prejudice against the two major black characters is powerfully demonstrated and forcefully discussed. (A black man is shot dead for dancing with a white woman, although she was the one who initiated the dance; a black woman learns about the promise of the A.M.E. Zion Church.) Trouble is, the racial theme is quickly abandoned each time, having thrown the play off balance and left passions unresolved.
Angela Goethals, whose career as a child actress brought her such varied credits as the Roundabout Theater's "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun" and a television sitcom about an adolescent tennis pro ("Phenom"), is lovely as the central character, Margaret Mackenzie. Margaret changes her name to Pearl Hart, but unfortunately for Ms. Goethals, the character is missing a soul.
Ms. Chalfant, who is billed as Calamity Jane, isn't seen as that character until near the end of the play, but she does wonderful things with a series of other characters, most of which she plays for one scene only. She even manages to put on a mustache, a top hat and a German accent and play the cakewalk-dancing Count of Glumbowitz with gender-irrelevant charm and believability. The rest of the cast members, many of them so young they are literally members of the class of '99, show lots of promise but have good moments and bad.
In the end they're all lost in a story with a message that the script isn't articulate enough or focused enough to convey. When young Margaret sees the play about Calamity's exploits, she goes backstage, hoping to meet her new heroine. But Margaret's naivete comes across as just that, the case of a girl who buys a theater ticket but doesn't understand the concept of acting and make-believe, not as a metaphor for the blurring of fiction and reality.
Sometimes Ms. Pearson seems to intend the entire play as a sort of warning against a collective American egotism, going into a new century overconfidently. That may have been the mind-set in 1899, but a hundred years later instant Internet millionaires are just about the only Americans in that mood. Most of the rest of us can't seem to look ahead much farther than Jan. 1, when we'll learn whether our computers still work. "True History and Real Adventures" continues through Jan. 2.

 CORRECTION:
A theater review yesterday about "True History and Real Adventures," which opened Sunday night at the Vineyard Theater, misidentified the company for a previous appearance by Angela Goethals, who plays the central character. "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun" was a 1992 production of Lincoln Center Theater, not the Roundabout.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY: FLASHBACK;
Of Crooks and Cons, Scandals and Schemes

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, a Swedish sociologist named Malin Akerstrom, in her book "Crooks and Squares," examined the remarkable similarities between the personality traits of career criminals and those of successful entrepreneurs. Her findings prompted another prominent scholar to reflect that such criminals "have learned the lessons of capitalism too well." 
 The past century is certainly rich in scandals that bear out that conclusion. Indeed, some of the century's greatest scoundrels - Charles Ponzi, Ivar Krueger, Robert Vesco - were originally assumed by their victims to be brilliant capitalists.
 A few of the century's scandals led to social reforms, while others imply revealed new fault lines in the economic landscape. Some involved colorful characters worthy of a story by Damon Runyon or Tom Wolfe, and others were dull, faceless tales of stupidly bad behavior. But taken together, they offer the dot-com generation a timely reminder of what can go wrong.
 Following are some of the most significant scandlas of the century:
 
A SMELL FROM THE JUNGLE
 It is rare novelist who can claim to have almost single-handedly altered business history. One writer with a valid claim to that distinction is Upton Sinclair, who based his 1906 novel "The Jungle" on his investigations into unsanitary conditions in the meat-packing industry. The disgusting disclosures prodded Congress to adopt laws requiring Federal inspection of meat-packing houses, and led - despite intense business opposition - to a broader Government role in ensuring the safety of consumer goods.
 
THE ORIGINAL PONZI SCHEME
 In 1919, a dapper Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi established the Old Colony Foreign Exchange Company, with offices in Boston and New York. He promised investors a suspiciously high return, 50 percent ormore, on foreign postal coupons, which he claimed could be purchased abroad at a discount and resold in America at a premium. Prosecutors soon found he simple used the money taken in from late comers to pay the promised dividends to earlier investors. For decades, con artists had called this technique the "Peter-to-Paul" swindle; from Mr. Ponzi's time on, it would be known as a "Ponzi scheme."
 
THE SWEDISH MATCH KING
 Some of the smartest investment bankers in America were taken in by the elegant Ivar Kruegar, a Swedish entrepreneur whose supposed wealth was fed by a monopoly on the kitchen-match business in various European countries. In fact, he was running an elaborate fraud involving dubious accounting and forged assets. Facing exposure at last, Mr. Krueger shot himself in his Paris apartment in March 1932, and his empire collapsed on his creditors and investors. It was one of the first great international swindles of the century.
 
HOW THE MIGHTY FALL
 Few business leaders commanded more respect in 1930 than Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange and brother of a partner in the House of Morgan. By 1935, he embodied Wall Street's implacable resistance to the New Deal's market regulations. But in March 1938, he pleaded guilty to charges that he had stolen money, both from his own customers and from a stock exchange fund set up to benefit the widows and orphans of members. As he served his time in a Federal prison in Ossining, NY., Wall Street's resistance to the reform efforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission began to disintegrate.
 
A BIG PRICE--FIXING SCANDAL
 In early 1960, a dozen manufacturers, including General Electric and Westinghouse, were indicted on Fedeal charges that they had conspired for years to fix prices and rig government bidding for several types of electrical equipment. The elaborate conspiracy, which one writer said lacked only sinister music to qualify as a full-fldged spy movie, cost the Government and other industrial customers million so of dollars. The charges and subsequent guilty pleas shocked American consumers and led the courts to impose some of the stiffest antitrust penalties that American business had faced up until that day.
 
THE CORNFELD CONNECTION
 In the late 1950's, a gifted American salesman named Bernie Cornfeld built a foreign mututal fund empire known as Investors Overseas Service,s based outside Geneva and held together by dubious sales practices throughout the world and the questionable use of fund assets.
 When I.O.S. began to falter in 1970, its board dismissed Mr. Cornfeld and brought in an entrepreneur, Robert Vesco, perhaps the only man who couldmake Mr. Cornfeld seem sober and prudent. Accused by prosecutors of completing the looting of the company, Mr. Vesco fled in 1972 to various Caribbean havens, but was later jailed in Cuba on unrelated fraud charges. Although the crimes occurred abroad, the twin scandals smudged the reputation of the American mutual fund industry.
 
PROGRAMMED FOR CRIME
 The computer was already starting to reshpae American business in the second half of the century; with the Equity Funding scandal, it began to reshape American swindles. This once high-flying mutual fund and insurance conglomerate used phony computer records to make it appear that business was booming. In fact, the company was a fraud that collapsed in April 1973 after a controversial analyst named Raymond L. Dirks learned of the scheme and alerted his clients to it. Regulators accused Mr. Dirks of trading on inside infomration, but the United States Surpreme Court exonerated him on the ground that he had not been seeking personal profit.
 
A BUST IN THE OIL PATCH
 After the 1973 Arab oil embargo few Americans could imagine that energy prices would ever tumble. So nobody raised an eyebrow when, in early 1976, some new high-living managers began to transform the tiny suburban Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City into an agressive oil and gas lender. Behind a boom-town facade, they routinely made new inflated loans to bail out earlier inflated loans - a Ponzi-like shuffle that ended with the bank's collapse in July 1982.
 Two major banks, the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company and Seattle First National Bank, had purchased some of the bank's dubious loans and were nearly destroyed as a result. Penn Square depositors whose accounts exceeded Federal insurance limits lost millions, shaking public confidence in Federal banking oversight.
 
'THE GREED DECADE' ON TRIAL
 On Wall Street, they still call it "Boesky Day" - Nov. 14, 1986, when Federal prosecutors disclosed that Ivan F. Boesky, a trader who had speculated hand-somely on the takeover deals of the decade, would plead guilty to insider-trading violations and testify about them is deeds of others. The most famous defendant he named was Michael R. Milken, whose transformation of the brokerage firm Drexel Burnham Lambert into a bottomless war chest for corporate raiders had ignited a national debate over junk bonds and hostile takeovers. In 1990, with Drexel itself in bankruptcy, Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to a handful of securities law violations, for which he served two years in prison and paid a record fine of $1 billion.
 
THE FALL OF LINCOLN SAVINGS
 It cost American taxpayers $3.4 billion to bail out Lincoln Savings and Loan in 1989. Lincon, which was run by Charles H. Keating Jr., was one of hundreds of savings institutions to fall in the late 1980's as misguided Federal legislation, inadequate regulatory supervision and old-fashioned fraud and greed combined to undermine an entire industry. Mr. Keating, who came to symbolize what Americans ruefully called the "S. & L. crisis," pleaded guilty in April - after years of legal wrangling - to four counts of fraud in connection with Lincon's collapse.
 
BRINGING DOWN BARINGS
 It seemed impossible that one young corrupt trader, Nicholas W. Leeson, could single-handedly destroy Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain. But in 1995 that is what happened. While working for the bank as an options trader in Singapore, Mr. Leeson embarked on a secret trading spree that left the bank facing fatal losses of roughly $1.3 billion. Mr. Lesson spent more than three years in a Singapore prison before being released in Uly, at age 32, suffering from colon cancer. His crime awakened older bankers and regulators to the risks posed by the esoteric financial products that were traded by their young computer-savvy employees - but that knowledge came too late to save the 233-year-old British bank, which was taken over by a Dutch financial group.
 
A NASDAQ CENSURE
 It began quietly, with an academic study in 1994 that questioned why traders on the Nasdaq market always seemed to sell every share of stock for at least 25 cents more than they had paid for it. Why not 12.5 cents? Guided by the study, class-action lawyers promptly sued the nation's top brokerage firms, accusing them of illegally conspiring to fix the prices of Nasdaq stocks.
 The lawsuits produced a historic $1 billion settlement and led regulators to censure Nasdaq's parent, the National Association of Securitie sDealers, in 1996 for inadequately regulating the marketplace. As a result, Nasdaq prices became fairer and more visible to public investors - but Nasdaq itself is still scrambling to adjus to the leaner profits and tougher competition that followed.

Poor Judgement, Bad Breaks, Big Blunders

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
It has been a century of success for American business. General Motors grew to be the world's largest car company, Coca-Cola became unbiquitous around the globe, with McDonald's not far behind, and Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse may be known to far more people than any president ever has been. Microsoft, although not yet 25, is already the world's most valuable enterprise. 
 But there were still plenty of missteps over the past 100 years, even by the most successful companies. Some failed to pursue new opportunities and were left to stare jealously as upstarts surpassed them. Sometimes changes looked good to experts, but outraged customers. Company founders underestimated the value of what they had created and sold out before the real wealth arrived.
 What follows, in chronological order, are 12 of the biggest business launders of the past 100 years. It would not be a stretch to bet that similar mistakes will be made in the next century as well.
 
CARNEGIE TAKES BONDS
 When Andrew Carnegie agreed to sel lhis Carnegie Steel in 1901 to the steel trust being assembled by J.P. Morgan - the United States Steel Corporation - he was convinced that the shares being sold to investors in the new company were ridiculously overvalued and sure to fall in price. So Mr. Carnegie demanded, and got, his $250 million payment in 5 percent bonds, thus assuring him a more than ample income for the rest of his life. But he was supplanted by John D. Rockefeller as the nation's wealthiest person. Had he taken the stock instead, he almost certainly would have maintained his status.
 
SEARS SELLS OUT
Richard Warren Sears, one of two founders of Sears, Roebuck, took on Julius Rosenwald as partner after Alvah C. Roebuck left in 1895. But Mr. Sears and Mr. Rosenwald quarreled over how to run the company. Among other things, Mr. Rosenwald insisted that Sears stop selling something called a "Heidelberg Belt," an electrified device that was said to cure a variety of ailments, including impotence, for only $12.
 After Mr. Rosenwald insisted on cutting expenditures in the face of a recession, Mr. Sears quit in 1908. For five years, he held onto his stock, but in 1913 he sold. As a result, his heirs - Mr. Sears died just one year later - were left to watch the company's phenomenal growth from the sidelines.
 
WARD'S PULLS BACK
 As World War II neared its end in 1945, the conventional economic forecast for the United States was gloomy. Perhaps all those soon-to-be-unemployed soliders would plunge the country back into depression; certainly a recession would arrive as the government drastically reduced its spending.
 Sewell Avery, the presidetn of Montgomery Ward and a man known for strong beliefs (he had been arrested by soldiers for deying government edicts to recognize a union during the war), believed the forecast and husbanded cash for the inevitable downturn. Sears, Roebuck, meanwhile, borrowed money to build in the expanding suburbs. Sears' bet proved right as World War II had produced a lot of savings and pent-up demand. Montogmery Ward would never recover from its error.
 
A JOURNAL DROPS STOCKS
 Coming out of World War II, the two largest business newspapers in the United State - The Journal of Commerce and The Wall Street Journal - were neck-and-neck in circulation and influence. Then The Journal of Commerce decided in 1951 to drop stock tables, which it felt were of relatively little interest and costly to produce, and to concentrate on narrow business areas. The Wall Street Journal took off from there, aided in part by a growing public interest in the stockmarket, and it now has a circulation of 1.75 million. Today's Journal of Commerce circulation? About 17,000.
 
RAILROADS' NARROW TRACK
 For the first half of the century, the railroads were the undisputed masters of national transportation. But since they though tof themselves as railroads rather than transportation companies, they never tried to expand into either trucking or airlines at a time when their capital could have given them the edge. In mid-century, many of the rails went through bankruptcy reorganization, and it was decades before they began to make good money through intermodal service- the shipping of goods by a combination of rail and trucks.
 
PEROT'S $60 MILLION LOSS
 Few culture clashes in the world of business have been greater than the one set up when Ross Perot, the Texas-base founder of Electronic Data Systems, was induced in 1970 to come to the rescue of Francis I. duPont & Company, a wall Street firm with a great past and a struggling present.
 Lured by the opportunity to save the company while building the business of the E.D.S. unit that provided record-keeping services for brokerage firms, Mr. Perot yielded to the entreaties, which included pressure form Nixon administration officials worried about the effect a Wall Street bankruptcy would have on public confidence.
What he saw appalled him. Mr. Perot could not believe how badly Wall Street ran its operations; Wall street executives were equally appalled by theinterloper they considered a hick from Texas. Mr. Perot was left holding the bag when duPont's successor firm, duPont Walston, collapsed in 1974. He lost at least $60 million in the fiasco.
 
A BONDED FAILURE
 John R. Bunting, the chief executive of the First Pennsylvania Corporation, the owner of Philadelphia's biggest - and thenation's oldest - bank, putmore than $1 billion of the bank's money into Treasury bonds in 1976, and thus proved that you can go broke lending to a borrower with perfect credit.
 Having suffered losses on real estate loans, Mr.Bunting turned to Treasuries yielding 8 percent. But interest rates rose to previously unthinkable levels, sneidng the valueof the bonds down and causing huge losses as the bank paid more interest to depositors than it was earning on the bonds. Eventually, it had to be baled out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank survived, but its shareholders suffered. Eventually, it was acquired by another bank.
 
SCHLITZ IS PENNY WISE
 In the eaqrly 1970's, Schlitz was the nation's No. 2 beer company, behind Anheuser-Busch. Trying to improve profits, the company changed its brewing process to cut production time to 4 days from 12 and cut costs with a variety of additives.
 When that did not scare off customers, it made one more change, adding a new ingredient known as Chill-grade to prolong the beer's shelf life. Unfortunately, that interacted with a foam stabilizer the company ahd added earlier, making the beer look milky. And that led to a huge recall in 1976 that destroyed the brand's image. Schlitz became a minor player.
 
AMAX SPURNS A SUITOR
 At the height of the oil boom, Chevron looked around for somewhere to spend its windfall profits and settled on Amax, a metals company whose share price had risen on talk that all natural resources would be in short supply. Amax fought off the 1981 bid, calling it too low, and Chevron backed off. Shareholders who could have enjoyed the gains from the sale instead watched Amax's share price collapse as natural resource values plunged in the 1980's. Eventually, Amax merged into Cyprus-Amax and spun off its gold-mining operations to shareholders, who got far less than they could have had in a marriage with Chevron.
 
I.B.M. FAILS TO THINK
 When I.B.M. entered the personal computer arena in 1981, it immediately set the standard for what had been a fragmented market. That led to monopoly profits for the company that controlled the standard - but that was not I.B.M. It was Microsoft, the upstart that developed and owned the computer's operating system. The failure of I.B.M. - which was known for the THINK signs posted throughout its plants - to secure any ownership interest in Mircrosoft or its operating system may have been the most costly mistake ever made by a major American company.
 
RECIPE FOR DISASTER
 Coca-Cola was the most popular soft dirnk int he wordl by a wide margin in the mid-1980's when the company decided to conduct taste tests. Those showed that most people liked a sweeter taste, one more like that of Pepsi-Cola, the company's prime competitor. So in 1985 the company scratched the old formula and, with much fanfare, introduced a new one. So confident was Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman ofCoca-Cola, of the test results that he called the decision "one of the easiest we have ever made." Alas, most ofCoke's fervently loyal customers did not agree. Only three months later, the company yielded to consumer outrage and brought back the old formula. The new one was supposed to stay around, but it eventually vanished. Coke went on to prosper again, but the New Coke humilation remains vivid to those who endured it.
 
AT&T MISDIALS
 AT&T's attempt to become a major player in the computer business with its $7.4 billion takeover of NCR in 1991 wins the award as worst big merger of the century. NCR faltered under AT&T's control as expected synergies proved envanescent. Five years - and billions of dollars in losses - after the take over was completed, AT&T washed its hands of NCR by spinning it off to its shareholders.
 But AT&T did not merit the dishonor without competition. Other really bad deals include Xerox's 1969 purchase of Scientific Data Systems (a $1 billion investment that ultimately proved worthless); Mobil's 1974 takeover of Montgomery Ward (which lost money until the company was finally sold to a leveraged buyout firm in 1988, nine years before it field for bankruptcy); Sony's 1989 acquisition of Columbia Pictures (which Sony still owns, a few billion in losses later), and Quaker Oats' 1994 purchase of Snapple for $1.7 billion (which the cereal company sold for $300 million in 1997).

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: A CENTURY OF BUSINESS;
From the Princes of Capitalism to the Bread Lines, How Fortunes Fared

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the richest of them all?
 There is no doubt that the wealthiest American as the century ends is William H. Gates III, the Microsoft chairman and chief executive. His net worth - as estimated by Forbes Magazine in October - was $85 billion, although it fluctuates daily as Microsoft's stock price rises or falls.
 
 But how does that compare with the wealth of John D. Rockefeller, who in 1913 at age 74 was worth $900 million, just after the government forced the breakup of the Standard Oil company he had created? One way to adjust the figure would be to apply changes in the Consumer Price Index. Do that, and it works out to around $15 billion in 1999 dollars.
 But that greatly understates the economic status Rockefeller actually held. The method used here was developed by Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther for their book "The Wealthy 100," published by Citadel Press i 1996. It is baed on estimates of each man's wealth as a proportion to the gross national product in his era. By that measure, Rockefeller had an economic clout that would be equal to about $212 billion now, making him more than twice as rich as Mr. Gates. (Of course, Mr. Gates is only 44 years old, so he has time to catch up.) Andrew Carnegie, the steel haron who died in 1919, also tops Mr.Gates.
 In fact, using the gross national product figures to adjust wealth, only two living Americans besides Mr.Gates were able to crack the top 16 for the century. They are Paul Allen, at No. 7, and Warren Buffett, at No. 13. Mr. Allen had the good fortune to be Mr. Gate's partner in founding Microsoft. Mr. Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway into a giant insurance and investment company.
 Similarly, the value of American companies has grown exponentially. In 1925, reports the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, only AT&T had a market value of $1 billion.
 A quarter-century later, in 1950, four companies were worthmore than $2 billion. Even in 1975, a value of $6.3 billion was enough to put Texaco in the top 10.
 Now, however, there are Internet startups that have meagers revenues but sport market values in the billions. VA Linux Systems, which went public this month with revenues of less than $50 million in its history, had a market value above $8 billion the first day it traded. Microsoft, the company that made Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen rich, is now valued at almost $600 billion. The tenth-largest company based in the United States, SBC Communications, is worth $175 billion. AT&T, having been broken up in 1984, is no No. 11, at $171.7 billion. FLOYD NORRIS

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA: The Economy Transformed, Bit by Bit;
Businesses and Society Confront the Inescapable Challenges of High Technology and the Internet

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In 1995, Bill Gates of Microsoft wrote an impassioned memo to his lieutenants stirring them to confront the challenge of "The Internet Tidal Wave." That wave hit corporate America as a whole in 1999, when companies large and small recognized that the impact of the Internet would not be confined merely to Silicon Valley or to the proliferating dot-com start-ups.
"Every business now knows that it faces the opportunity and threat of being transformed by the Internet, and this was the year that happened," said Daniel Yergin, a business consultant and author. 
 The Internet has also become a powerful symbol of society's expectations about the future -- a future of fast-moving, disruptive technology that is shifting the terrain not only in business, but also in politics and culture.
The truth, of course, is that it is probably too early to judge whether an Internet revolution is truly under way. Historians say the Internet should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological step than a leap forward.
Still, whether labeled a revolution or an evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to become greater and greater. When people speak of the "Internet economy," they do not really mean that Internet businesses themselves suddenly loom so large in the nation's $9 trillion economy. They are talking of a technology and a pattern of business behavior that feels like the future.
The Internet is seen as a technology of borderless free markets. It is a global network with open technology standards, not owned or controlled by a single company or nation. And it is magic on Wall Street these days, driving the shares of many Internet companies to astronomical heights.
Because it is such a low-cost communications technology, the Internet holds the promise of drastically reducing transactions costs. This opens the door to what Michael Porter of Harvard's business school has called "atomistic competition," as market forces and entrepreneurial ways are driven further down toward the individual level. Organizational bureaucracies of every kind -- corporate, government and union -- suddenly look vulnerable to the Internet's decentralizing powers.
Even the power of nation states, already eroding, seems at risk. Mr. Yergin, the co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of "The Commanding Heights," a history of the rise of the global marketplace, observed: "Nothing so symbolizes globalization as the Internet, a technology with the power to leap across the geographic borders of nation-states and across time zones."
Prediction tends to be a humbling, hit-or-miss endeavor even for the gifted or lucky. In the late 1960's, for example, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer, predicted that by 2000 a vast electronic "global library" would be developed -- and the Internet and the World Wide Web could arguably qualify as one. Then again, Sir Arthur also predicted that the planets would be colonized by next year.
But technologists, economists and futurists say that some questions are worth asking when thinking about how the Internet economy might evolve over the next few years. What was the mixture of technology and policy decisions that created today's Internet? What key technology and policy issues are likely to affect the Internet over the next few years? And, finally, since the future is usually the past with a twist, what can be learned from earlier technology-driven transitions?
The Internet has been embraced by libertarian free-marketers as the embodiment of their values, but, to be sure, it began with government financing. Yet liberals who point to the Internet to support a pro-government stance -- at least in any conventional sense -- are ignoring certain facts. The early money for the Internet -- as well as for pioneering research in computer graphics and speech recognition software -- came from an elite, the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency. Its money came from the military's largess, and ARPA's leaders spent it pretty much as they pleased with little accountability. From the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, the agency's leaders displayed an uncanny knack for backing long-term winners in technology.
For two decades, the Internet was developed gradually in the distinctive milieu of the nation's research centers by scientists who believed in the free sharing of information and in open technology standards. The next major policy pronouncement about the Internet did not come until 1997, when the Clinton administration released its "Framework for Global Electronic Commerce." Written by Ira C. Magaziner, a senior White House adviser, the report called for a market-driven Internet. "Business models must evolve rapidly to keep pace with the breakneck speed of change in the technology," the report said. "Government attempts to regulate are likely to be outmoded by the time they are finally enacted."
So the pattern of policy to date: shrewd government seeding of research followed by benign neglect. But as the Internet increasingly becomes a main thoroughfare of commerce, a host of new policy issues loom -- how to deal with taxation, privacy, security and international trade in a global networked economy.
"The Internet has given us the greatest rate of return on a public infrastructure investment ever," said Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "And it has flourished because we have not yet taxed or regulated it to death -- though those are live issues."
Technologically, the Internet is almost an economy unto itself -- a network, yes, but also a complex and interacting set of technologies. Today's Internet is a result of a torrid pace of improvement in recent years in computer networks, processing power, data storage, software, display technology and user interfaces like the Web browser.
The sheer firepower of computers, experts say, is certain to race ahead to startling effect over the next few years. Data storage technology, for example, is advancing at a particularly rapid rate. By 2003, personal computers may well come with terabyte hard drives, which are roughly 100 times the capacity on new PC's today, featuring about 10 gigabytes on average. A terabyte drive would be able to hold every conversation that even the chattiest person has had in a lifetime. Think of a supercomputer on every desktop, in terms of giving individuals the ability to mine personal or business information.
In every field of academic and scientific research, computing will increasingly be used for simulation and analysis. The real payoff from the Human Genome Project, for example, will come not from identifying the complete DNA sequence, but from understanding how these complex proteins work. Such knowledge, medical experts say, will be the basis for everything from developing personally tailored drugs to discovering new ways to treat disease. The main tool for stalking that breakthrough knowledge is computational biology -- microbiological simulations run on powerful computers.
The real technical challenge to the Internet economy will not come from any shortcoming in raw computing power, but from the difficulty of building up the global network to meet demand. The next-generation vision of the Internet is of a high-speed global network to which billions of devices are connected, from TV set-top boxes and hand-held computers to refrigerators and washing machines that would be able to do everything from optimizing fuel use to requesting a repair call automatically online.
But that kind of global nervous system of commerce and communication will require far more than adding computers and laying more wire. The Internet, after all, was originally designed as a computerized "party line" for a small community of researchers -- who knew and trusted each other -- to send e-mail. And network complexity can increase exponentially -- that is, a network with 200 million users is far more than twice as complex as one with 100 million because each user, each computer and each line of code can interact with others in the network in unpredictable ways, just as in a biological organism.
A presidential advisory group of leading computer scientists concluded earlier this year that new research, fresh approaches and more government money were needed to cope with the problem. "Scaling the Internet to handle the expected growth over time is a major challenge," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of the Internet division at I.B.M. and a member of the group. "And the current infrastructure can't scale up."
The group's report to the White House warned that there would be "catastrophic failures" in the computer networks that increasingly support the nation's defense and economy, unless those networks were retooled.
Still, Mr. Wladawsky-Berger predicts that the technical challenge can be overcome, provided the government and industry make the needed research investments. "It should not be a showstopper," he said.
Indeed, given the track record of success in computing, the visceral optimism of the technologists seems justified. "Sure there are some tough problems, but it'll work," said Rick Rashid, head of research at Microsoft. "We can do it. We always have. In information technology, that is the way it's always worked."
That information technology is delivering a problem-solving payoff has been an article of faith in the corporate world for years, far more so than among economists. Business investment in computer hardware and software is running at $380 billion a year, up steadily from the annual rate of $110 billion five years ago. And corporate America is expected to keep increasing such spending.. By the end of 2001, Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm in St. Louis, projects that business investment in computer hardware and software will be running at a yearly rate of $513 billion.
Economists expect the nation's extraordinary growth to continue next year, though at a somewhat slower pace. The consensus among the 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey is that the economy will expand 3.9 percent this year, with inflation at 1.4 percent. For 2000, the consensus is growth of 3.2 percent and inflation of 1.7 percent. In February, the economy should set the record for the longest expansion, surpassing the 106-month record set in the 1960's.
Just what impact information technology has had on the economy's uncommon run of growth, productivity gains and low inflation is a subject of heated debate within the economics profession. It is probably too early to tell, but Mr. Litan of Brookings, who is leading a yearlong study on the issue, sponsored by the Internet Policy Institute, said, "My instinct is whatever we find the economic impact to be, it will be a lot greater five years from now."
The sense of being at the start of a business and economic transformation, of course, has fueled the Internet start-up fever. It seems a speculative bubble, but such periods of investment mania foster a rapid pace of business experimentation. Thomas Eisenmann, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, notes that from 1900 to 1925 there were more than 3,300 automobile start-ups in America turning out cars of many types -- some sporting three wheels, some six; one model featuring a shiplike tiller for steering; others trying electricity or steam as power sources.
"We'll see the same kind of winnowing in e-commerce," Mr. Eisenmann said. "Some will succeed, but most will fail. We'll repeat the past again, only faster."
For established companies, the Internet challenge is to adapt to an accelerated technological shift. That was precisely the quandary Mr. Gates was sketching out in his 1995 memo: Microsoft was threatened by the rise of Internet software; yet if it scrambled, he wrote, the company could benefit from the Internet. The speed of Microsoft's response is regarded as an exceptional case of a big company's moving nimbly to change course, but the tactics it used became the subject of the government's sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft.
The Internet's openness, low-cost use and speed are its distinctive features. The telegraph, historians note, had many of the same qualities -- it was an electronic network that transformed many business practices and was a new medium of informal communication for many. Yet the telegraph was expensive in contrast to the Internet. Sending a message was a household budgeting decision; firing off an e-mail message today is not. "The Internet is the telegraph for the rest of us," noted Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future.
The speed at which the Internet is spreading across the globe, pushing both the tools and values of high technology onto people, could prompt a backlash. Peter Schwartz, a leading futurist and business consultant, is a technology optimist. Along with Peter Leyden and Joel Hyatt, he wrote, "The Long Boom: A Vision for the Coming Age of Prosperity."
Yet Mr. Schwartz, while predicting that the pace of technological change will not slow, adds that the willingness of people to accept new technology could reverse sharply if companies and governments do not make the right policy choices.
The Internet economy carries the potential for creating "a deep divide between those who have the skills to prosper and those who don't," he said.
"That's why education policy is so important," he added.
The social tolerance for technology, Mr. Schwartz added, could also cool. The advance of nuclear power in the United States, he said, came to a standstill because the public fears after the Three Mile Island accident were not allayed. The recent resistance to genetically altered foods and the protests in Seattle over the World Trade Organization's global influence on environmental and labor protections, he said, are warning signs.
"An inadequate appreciation of either the losers in this new economy or of the people with legitimate concerns could be real problems," Mr. Schwartz said. "If you don't address those groups early on, it will come back to bite you."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: AN EPITAPH FOR THE 20th CENTURY;
A Time of Energy And Enterprise And E-Everything

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
When eight well-known executives were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last 100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet.
"Before this century, science did not matter to the average person," said Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, the world's largest nonbank financial services company. "In this century, science is changing our lives fundamentally." 
 But as much as these business leaders, who hailed from entertainment and financial services and industry, praised the huge advances in technology over the last 100 years, they expressed concern about how technology could be used and the double-edged nature of change.
The dark side of the passing century was hinted at by the comic creator Stan Lee's rendition of Mongorr, a despot eager to infiltrate our world to take advantage of the new technology. But, in as epic terms as any battle waged between superheroes, Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, also talked about the stark contrasts of the last 100 years: the huge advances made and the devastation wrought by the ability of people to hurt one another. "Human nature has remained a constant," he concluded.
Many of the executives were also quick to note the substantial divide that exists between those who have benefited from the prosperity of the last 100 years and those who have not. "The haves and have-nots are getting further apart," said Lawrence A. Bossidy, the chairman of Honeywell, the industrial giant created by the recent merger of Honeywell, the maker of electronic controls, and AlliedSignal, a diversified manufacturer.
As the chairman of Stan Lee Media, a publicly held company based in Encino, Calif., Mr. Lee is participating directly in the revolution being created by the Internet. "I've been in comics, radio, television, animation, movies and now the Internet," said Mr. Lee, who is one of the people responsible for such memorable superheroes as Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and plans to bring a new generation of different superheroes and villains to the Internet in short animated episodes.
Television and the Internet, in particular, have achieved enormous global reach, Mr. Lee says. People who once lived in isolation are exposed as never before to what is going on in the rest of the world. "There are no hicks anymore," he said.
But Mr. Lee is genuinely worried about how this technology is used. Like Mongorr, one of Mr. Lee's new characters, there are those who may use the Internet to harness hatred. "I'm hoping that the closer we come together, the more that will fade away," he said.
When Mr. Bossidy of Honeywell thinks about the 20th century, he ticks off the numerous advances in electronics: the cathode ray tube in televisions, the microchip and the various iterations of computers that allow work to be done rapidly, leading to huge improvements in productivity.
The advances in medicine -- the cure of diseases like scarlet fever and new treatments for heart disease and cancer -- are also striking, Mr. Bossidy said. "People feel better; they don't just live longer," he said.
But the role of the corporation has also undergone significant change, he argued, as companies have become much more efficient. "Corporations used to be run exclusively by dictators," said Mr. Bossidy, who spent more than three decades at General Electric before joining AlliedSignal, where he became chief executive in 1991. "Now you have to lead and be prepared to serve," he said, and employees have the freedom to contribute.
Increasingly, governments and other organizations will rely on a corporate model to improve how they operate, according to Mr. Bossidy. He also believes that companies will be asked more and more to address social issues like education, not in privatizing them but in marshaling resources.
But Mr. Bossidy was wary of trying to guess what other innovations the next century might bring. Just as few foresaw the Internet, "most of the changes in the 21st century will not be predicted," he argued.
Mr. Rubin, who is as well known on Wall Street as he is in Washington, takes an even-handed approach in assessing the century. Once a top official at Goldman Sachs, he is now the chairman of the executive committee of the board for Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company. "It has been a period of tremendous advance," Mr. Rubin said, noting how much of the global population has benefited from technology. But he is quick to point out the last century's episodes of war and violence as well as the use of technology for mass destruction.
Globalization has also remarkably changed how we live, he noted. "I think we are far more interdependent today than we were 100 years ago," economically, environmentally and geopolitically, Mr. Rubin said. He, too, is concerned about the gulf between those who are enjoying this century's tremendous prosperity and those who are not but understand what they are missing.
The challenge, he said, will be to see how the tension between sovereignty and the growing global interdependence is handled, and he believes the United States must decide what role it should play. "There is a tremendous struggle between those who believe that the U.S. should play a major leadership role and those who believe in some fashion that we should turn inward and turn our back," he said.
David H. Komansky, the chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Company, takes a strikingly more optimistic view. "Be bullish," he argued, not about financial markets but in viewing the strides made in the past 100 years. Despite world wars, the Great Depression and other economic turbulence, there have been significant improvements in the standard of living, medicine and technology, he said.
"I think we are on the doorstep of a truly global life style that will benefit every person in every part of the world," Mr. Komansky said.
The power of instant communication -- the ability to make a telephone call anywhere in the world or tune into CNN to see minute-by-minute broadcasts of war -- has created a world that is linked almost in real time, Mr. Komansky said.
Globalization, he argued, has transformed businesses like Merrill Lynch, which two decades ago was primarily a domestic firm. Today, more than a third of its business is conducted outside the United States, and Merrill employs 65,000 people in 44 countries. Managing the huge variety of people from different ethnic backgrounds becomes more of a challenge, he said.
"I think the phenomenon of globalization is in its very early days," Mr. Komansky predicted. But he said he was confident that civilization would continue to make great progress. "The future is much brighter than the past," he said.
The head of Fannie Mae, the country's largest provider of home-mortgage financing, Mr. Raines is keenly aware of how much more accessible capital -- in the form of mortgages, credit cards and loans -- is today than it was before a variety of government programs created in the aftermath of the Great Depression to help homeowners, farmers and small businesses.
Then, "the Government was involved in pushing capital out into the economy and making it much more available to the individual," Mr. Raines said.
While the private sector has taken over much of that role -- and Fannie Mae is now a publicly held company -- the continuing spread of capital has helped create "a huge wealth effect" in the United States, according to Mr. Raines.
But Mr. Raines, the first black chief executive of one of the nation's largest 100 corporations, also spoke of the "century-long effort" to promote equality and "integrate black America into society." Corporate America has also taken part in that effort, he said, and he pointed to the advancement of several black executives within the last few years. "Ten years ago, you couldn't think about it," he said.
Mr. Raines also talked about those who have been left behind in what is known as the wealth gap. "The democratization of wealth has not been complete," he said, and he voiced concern that the nation could lose its commitment to that goal during the next 100 years.
Michael D. Eisner, the chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, was reluctant to pontificate, but he, too, emphasized the transforming power of technology. The 20th century "has been a triumph for human expression," he said. Communication has been transformed, he said, from what was once largely face to face to something that is now both instant and universal for people around the globe. No matter how effective books and other printed forms of expression were in creating change, the widespread adoption of television and the Internet has fundamentally changed how we express ourselves, he said.
While the next century may see advances that make such communication even more efficient and ubiquitous, it cannot make communication faster, Mr. Eisner noted. "You can't go faster than instant," he said.
Mr. Eisner, who suggested that philosophers and psychiatrists were more adept at thinking about the implications of this change, shied away from predicting where this instant human expression, allowing anyone to say anything to nearly anyone else, would lead. Either global democracy or totalitarianism could result, he said.
Martha Stewart, the entrepreneur whose sense of style led to the creation of her own media and merchandising empire, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, worries that we are already witnessing the drawbacks of the new speed at which we conduct our lives. While she applauded the advances of the 20th century in technology, science and medicine, "advancement in the study of the humanities, in art and in cultural endeavors, seems to have been less progressive, especially in the second half of this century," she argued.
The result of the widespread adoption of the telephone, faxes, e-mail messages and computers has been the inability to think creatively, Ms. Stewart said. Answering e-mail has taken the place of writing a great novel. Her own life has been consumed by the Internet, she said, and technology has allowed her to do any number of jobs at once. "It's insane," she laughed, but she said she was also saddened by the widespread implications of this speed.
She is also concerned about the social impact of the technology, which she described as taking away physical contact, from seeing someone directly or talking to them on the telephone. "It is much more introverted living," she said.
What she hopes is that the next century will provide more time for people to reflect. As people get used to the technology, they may learn to dominate it. And she hopes that we remain sensitive to the challenge of making technology accessible to all, although she is confident that will happen. "Computers are going to be cheap," she said. "Everyone is going to have them."
As the chairman and chief executive of America Online, one of the best-known providers of access to the Web, Stephen M. Case enjoys a key vantage point on the development of the Internet. The proliferation of telephones and cars, the television, the computer and the Internet created an increasingly mobile society, Mr. Case said. Businesses were opened up, and people could be on the move without losing all ties to family and friends. "Suddenly, anything was possible," Mr. Case said.
The result, according to Mr. Case, has been the American century. "It was a time of unprecedented opportunity," he argued, as technology, coupled with the spread of democracy and the relative prosperity and security of this period, allowed people to explore new areas.
"Technology was a real driver because it created not just whole new industries, but it has also reshaped our lives," Mr. Case said.
But he acknowledged that the challenge faced by society is in making sure everyone has access. "It is not about dropping computers" into places where people have difficulty taking advantage of the technology, he said, but about developing an integrated approach to making sure they have the tools and wherewithal to use the computers.
Mr. Case believes, however, that the Internet journey is only beginning and that there is much to learn yet about how it will affect this country and the world. "I do think the next century is going to be the Internet century," he said, and the next decade or two will be defined by the changes wrought by the new medium. The Internet has the ability to transform all aspects of what we do to gather information, shop, communicate or be entertained.
"It is very, very empowering," he said.

Engineering the Nation's Longest Expansion

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In his nearly half-century as an economist, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has watched the nature of the American economy change fundamentally.
"The quintessential manifestations of America's industrial might earlier this century -- large steel mills, auto assembly plants, petrochemical complexes and skyscrapers -- have been replaced by a gross domestic product that has been downsized as ideas have replaced physical bulk and effort as creators of value," Mr. Greenspan said in a recent speech. 
 "Today, economic value is best symbolized by exceedingly complex, miniaturized integrated circuits and the ideas, the software, that utilize them," he said. "Most of what we currently perceive as value and wealth is intellectual and impalpable."
Given the continued importance of basic industry to the economy, Mr. Greenspan may have overstated his case a bit. But there is little doubt that sweeping technology-driven shifts are under way in the structure and operation of the economy and that they are forcing Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve to rethink their approach to monetary policy.
In some ways, the Fed policy makers face problems at the beginning of the new decade that generations of their predecessors would have welcomed.
Having forced inflation down to quite manageable levels, they have the luxury of debating whether it is better to allow prices to rise slightly each year, or whether they should aim for absolute price stability.
But with unemployment hovering near 30-year lows, they have been forced to re-examine the assumption that a strong economy will inevitably generate inflation if joblessness falls below a certain level. With traditional forecasting models no longer terribly reliable, they face considerable uncertainties as they try to predict the economy's course.
There is mounting evidence that productivity -- the single most important determinant of the economy's growth potential -- is benefiting from huge investments in technology and is surging at a rate that would allow the economy to retain substantial momentum without igniting inflation.
But no one is certain how long the surge will continue. Likewise, it is anyone's guess whether the booming stock market is a reflection of and contributor to the economy's improved long-term prospects or a bubble that will end in tears.
It is also unclear whether the length of the current expansion -- barring an unforeseen collapse it will become the longest in the nation's history in February at 8 years and 11 months -- means that the business cycle has been tamed or simply that the United States is benefiting from a remarkable string of good luck.
The Fed faces these challenges from a position of relative strength. Thanks to his success in taming inflation and his flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing economy, Mr. Greenspan has tremendous credibility and leeway among investors and political leaders. With both Democrats and Republicans pledging to maintain fiscal discipline, monetary policy is becoming even more important in managing the economy. The Fed's independence from the government of the day and its focus on inflation-fighting have become the standard for central banks around the world, which constantly look to Mr. Greenspan for their cues.
Central banks, led by the Fed, "now find themselves in a position of power and responsibility unrivaled in their history," said Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England. "A commitment to price stability is now seen as the key to achieving broader economic stability."
Mr. Greenspan still has his critics. Farmers, beset by commodity prices that are low or falling, contend there is little justification for higher interest rates.
Some manufacturers say Mr. Greenspan does not seem to understand how little power they have to raise prices or to appreciate fully how technology and global competition are driving them to become more efficient. And many liberal economists contend Mr. Greenspan seems to have forgotten that the Fed's mandate includes a commitment to achieving full employment.
Over the next year, Mr. Greenspan is likely to face some particularly difficult choices. If the economy continues to defy predictions that it will slow to a sustainable pace, he may feel forced to follow this year's three quarter-point rate increases with additional tightening. Fed policy makers meet tomorrow but are not expected to raise rates then, given their current neutral policy stance. That puts further action off until 2000, an election year, which could create tremendous political pressure on the Fed.
Mr. Greenspan, who will turn 74 in March, has proved willing and able to take the heat when necessary, and so far he has given no indication that he is tired of the job, which he has held more than 12 years. President Clinton seems almost certain to nominate him to a fourth term next year, providing continuity in monetary policy whatever the outcome of the presidential election.
Even so, policy makers in Washington are already speculating about a post-Greenspan Fed. Assuming Mr. Greenspan serves only one more term, the next president would get to choose his successor, a selection that could carry tremendous economic and political significance.
It is too early to think in terms of Mr. Greenspan's legacy. Still, his constant re-examination of assumptions about how the economy works and his focus on technology as a transforming force have already changed the approach to their jobs of officials at the Fed and at other central banks.
"I believe that if central banks are to retain their central position in economic policy making, they must face up to the intellectual and technological challenges that lie ahead," Mr. King recently told a gathering of central bankers, including Mr. Greenspan. "Unless they do so, popularity will turn to disillusion."

As Nature of Money Changes, Will the Dollar Remain Supreme?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Money is a funny thing. Everyone knows what it is. But money is something that can change a lot over time.
A century ago, there was little question about what money was. It was gold, period. Or, to be a little more exact, it included national currencies like dollars and pounds, but only to the extent they were convertible into gold. There was but one real money. 
 Now there are dozens and dozens of national currencies, none of them tied to gold. But there is a hierarchy of currencies that in practice significantly reduces the real number. That hierarchy is based not on relative value, which can and does fluctuate, but on their function in the world economy. The United States dollar is clearly No. 1.
At the same time, the nature of money is changing. With no anchor in precious metals, the task of maintaining the value of currencies has fallen to central banks, few of which even existed in 1900. It was the central banks -- most notably the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bundesbank in Germany -- that were given credit for slaying the inflation dragon in the 1980's, leading to what might be called the cult of the central banker.
The big questions for the international monetary system in the 21st century will revolve around those points: Will the dollar maintain its supremacy, or will the euro, and perhaps even the Japanese yen, gain comparable status? How will other countries manage the value of their currencies? And, perhaps most important, will central bankers maintain their power and prestige, or will they stumble and take the blame for some economic problem?
The current supremacy of the dollar does not reflect a brilliant record as a store of value. If one uses consumer price inflation as a measure, a 1999 dollar is worth about a nickel in 1900 money. Measured against gold, the dollar is down 93 percent.
Instead, the dollar's primacy reflects the United States's role as the world's largest economy, with capital markets that lead the world. The dollar is the most likely currency to be held as official reserves by other countries. It is the main currency of international lending. Companies from Brazil to Indonesia owe dollars, not reais or rupiahs. When the real and rupiah were devalued in the crises of the late 1990's, local companies that had thought they were in good shape found themselves in financial difficulty.
The euro, the currency of 11 European countries, was created in part to challenge the dollar's supremacy. Its first year has not been a smooth one, and the value of the currency has fallen. But the euro's use in international borrowing has risen.
Some major economies, such as Britain and Japan, can easily keep floating exchange rates with the dollar and the euro, in part because those countries have capital markets that can allow companies to borrow in local currencies.
But for many other currencies, the options are not so clear. Until the Asian currency crisis, many countries opted for a sort of nonbinding fixed rate. Their currencies were tied to the dollar, sometimes with a planned gradual depreciation.
The Asian crisis, however, saw many such currencies plunge in value and led to a growing consensus that countries must choose one of two options. They can choose freely floating exchange rates that rise or fall against other currencies moved by market forces, a plan that gives governments maximum flexibility but can make it hard for businesses to plan their affairs. Alternatively, they can adopt an absolute fixed rate versus a major currency.
That has meant proposals in Latin America for "dollarization," in which the local currency is simply replaced by the dollar. At the extreme, that could lead to the entire hemisphere, and perhaps much of the rest of the world as well, adopting the dollar. Such a policy would give Latin American businesses the ability to borrow at relatively low dollar interest rates, with confidence that devaluation would not devastate them.
The downside to that arrangement for other countries is that the Federal Reserve, in designing its monetary policy, is unlikely to take into account the effect a given policy might have on a foreign country that has dollarized but whose economy is not moving in tandem with Washington.
The role of central banks is the other major issue. A century ago, there were only 18 central banks, 16 of them in Europe, plus Japan and Indonesia. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913.
Now there are 172 central banks, and more and more of them claim some degree of independence from national governments. The European Central Bank represents a new degree of independence since no one government appoints all its members.
The claim for such independence rests largely on the success of tight monetary policies in quelling inflation in the 1980's.
The role of the European Central Bank might prove to be the most controversial of the next decade. While one can argue that the economies of the euro zone, from Naples to Helsinki, are no more diverse than those of the United States, from Boston to Birmingham, this country has a political unity to go along with a common currency. It has much greater labor mobility, aided to no small extent by a common language, and it has a more developed system to allow fiscal transfers -- via welfare and unemployment benefits -- from prosperous regions to struggling ones.
All that means that the challenges confronting the European Central Bank in bad times could be of a different order of magnitude than those that confront the Fed, simply because the nonmonetary means of stabilization are less developed. It is conceivable that a prolonged economic downturn could lead one European country or another to elect a government that blamed the central bank and wanted out of the euro, thereby precipitating a crisis since no exit from the euro is supposed to be possible.
The European Central Bank is not, of course, the only one that could end up being vilified if economies went bad. The most important question for the future of the international monetary system may be what would happen if faith in central banks were damaged so badly that alternative ways of managing currency values were sought. Some think that gold would make a comeback, as the only real money. Alternatively, a currency's value might be tied to a basket of commodities.
One central banker, Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has even suggested that new computer technologies might end up making it possible for financiers effectively to bypass government-created money, creating their own relative values through trading. The unit of account, he said, might be a commodity standard, leaving central banks out of the equation.
If that were to happen, he said in a speech last summer, "central banks would lose their ability to influence monetary policy" and "the successors to Bill Gates would have put the successors to Alan Greenspan out of business."

CENTURY HIGHLIGHTS

 BODY:

1904: MORGAN MERGER WRECKED
The railroad combination that J. P. Morgan fashioned in 1901 with James Hill and Edward Harriman into the Northern Securities Company was declared illegal by the United States Supreme Court under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. 

1911: STANDARD OIL BROKEN UP
The Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in a ruling seen as a victory for big business because only "unreasonable" restraints of trade were found illegal. Rockefeller ended up with big stakes in the spun-off companies and his wealth only grew.
 
1913: INCOME TAX ADOPTED
Only people with an income of $2,500 or higher would be taxed -- at a rate of 1 percent -- under the income tax plan introduced by President Woodrow Wilson to enable the government to reduce tariffs on imported goods.
 
1920: MORGAN MERGER UPHELD
The U.S. Steel Corporation, formed by J. P. Morgan in 1901, may have had the power to control the steel trade but, because it did not exercise that power, it was not an illegal monopoly, the Supreme Court ruled.
 
1939: PAN AM FLIES TO EUROPE
A pontoon plane took the first passengers across the Atlantic in 22 hours for $375 each way, flying from Port Washington, N.Y., and landing in Marseille, France, after two stops.
 
1955: TWO UNION FEDERATIONS UNITE
After years of conflict, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations agreed to merge into the A.F.L.-C.I.O, with 15 million members.
 
1959: BIG THREE MAKE SMALL CARS
Pressed by domestic and import rivals, G.M., Ford and Chrysler began selling their own small cars, the Chevy Corvair, Ford Falcon and Plymouth Valiant. Ralph Nader's attack on the Corvair led to auto safety laws in 1966.
1968: HUGE OIL FIND
One of the richest oil fields ever was discovered on Alaska's frigid Arctic Slope. Nine years later, a pipeline was opened to carry the oil to market.
 
1970: RAILROAD GOES BANKRUPT
Failing to meet the challenge from truckers and airlines, the Penn Central filed for bankruptcy protection. Conrail later took over freight service in the Northeast and Congress established Amtrak for passengers.
 
1984: AT&T BREAKS UP
The giant telephone business spun off its local companies, the Baby Bells, after settling government charges that it had abused its monopoly to keep competitors out of the telephone equipment and long-distance markets.
1988: KKR GETS RJR
In history's largest leveraged buyout, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. beat out managers for control of RJR Nabisco with a bid of nearly $25 billion.
 
1998: TOBACCO COMPANIES SETTLE
Ending the largest legal and financial threat to their business, cigarette makers agreed to pay more than $200 billion to settle state lawsuits filed to recover Medicaid money spent treating diseases related to smoking.
 
1998: CITIGROUP FORMED
Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in a $70 billion deal that challenged the Glass-Steagall restrictions on banking. Those limits were overturned by Congress in 1999.
 
1999: OIL GIANTS MERGE
After agreeing to major divestitures, the nation's two largest oil companies, Exxon and Mobil, were combined in a deal valued at $81 billion, making it the largest industrial merger ever.

As Labor Pool Shrinks, A New Supply Is Tapped

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Five years into a booming economy, America is "depleting its pool of available workers" -- a warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply an expanding work force -- and sustain a robust economy -- into the new decade.
This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and potential immigrants. The women are not so noticeable in the statistics; many hold jobs and are counted as employed. But nearly half the women working in the United States today do so only part-time, and millions are gradually stepping up to full-time schedules -- making themselves available eight hours a day instead of five, or five days a week instead of three, or working through July and August instead of dropping out during their children's school vacation. Nearly a million women a year since 1994 have upgraded their status to full-time from part-time work.
The immigrants in question are not so much the uncounted people here illegally, but the men and women still in Canada or Mexico who move across the border when jobs beckon. "You have a construction contract and the work doubles," said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "One of your workers makes a call back home, to his village in Mexico or Guatemala, and within a week a cousin shows up, or a cousin and the cousin's friend."
Tens of millions of people abroad are quickly available for jobs in the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that slipping into America and then working illegally for a year or two is not all that hard.
And suddenly a straitjacket that threatened to strangle a robust economy is not so binding after all. The work force has grown lately by 200,000 jobs a month, but rather than being depleted the pool of people available to fill still more jobs may be growing, or at least holding its own. Few issues in economics are more important than pinning down the size of this pool. A wrong answer could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut off the economic expansion, which started in 1991, gained steam four years ago and in February will become the longest in American history.
"The labor market gets tight, and these people flow in from across the borders, which helps to explain why wages are not rising that much at the low end," said Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas at Austin. "The women, quantitatively, are not a big matter. But they represent a different segment of the population. These are skilled people in many cases, and going full-time leads to" less wage pressure in the middle.
Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and others at the Fed hold in their public pronouncements to a traditional view on the labor supply -- one that suggests the economic expansion must soon be slowed for lack of available workers. When Mr. Greenspan refers, in his speeches and Congressional testimony, to a "depleting pool," he means two groups: those who are unemployed and seeking work and those who are not seeking work but would accept it if jobs they liked came their way. That pool has shrunk to 9.6 million lately from 11.2 million two years ago, Mr. Greenspan notes.
The significance of this calculation is clear. When workers are in short supply, employers tend to raise compensation to get enough people, and then raise prices to cover the higher labor costs. Neither trend has shown up yet. The inflation rate, a big concern at the Fed, is particularly mild. Even so, the Fed's response to a shrinking labor pool has been to raise interest rates, thus slowing the economy and reducing the demand for new workers. The Fed made that point with its last interest-rate increase, in mid-November. "The pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained," the Fed said, in justifying the increase.
There are, of course, already many illegal immigrants working in America or available for work. The Census Bureau puts the number at 5 million or so. The Labor Department -- along with Mr. Greenspan -- includes this calculation in its estimates of how many people are working or available for work. The Census Bureau's estimate undoubtedly falls short of the actual number of illegal immigrants, but the shortfall is not considered big enough at the Fed or the Labor Department to make a difference.
The Immigration Service, though, counts many more heads. "What that 5 million does not include is the significant number of people on our northern and southern borders who come to the United States and work for a year, and return home and then come back," said Robert Bach, the Immigration Service's executive associate commissioner for policy and planning. Crossing the border is not easy, he said, "but there are certainly ample ways to enter the United States without documents or with fraudulent documents or by abusing documents, such as a tourist's visa."
The results are evident even in the official statistics -- the foreign-born hold nearly 12 percent of all jobs, up from about 10 percent in 1995 -- and certainly their numbers are growing in a number of American cities.
Consider Atlanta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Ky., or Indianapolis, where Hispanic immigrants are now well represented in construction work, holding jobs as electricians, plumbers and carpenters. Or visit Malden Mills, a textile maker in Lawrence, Mass., whose best-known brand is Polartec. The company is adding 230 workers by March at wages of about $11 an hour. Most of the existing 2,000 employees are Hispanic immigrants, mainly from the Dominican Republic, already settled in Lawrence, whose population is heavily Hispanic.
"For the first time, we are facing a situation where we might not have as many people already in the Lawrence area as we might need," said Jeff Bowman, the company's marketing director.
Some new applicants are relatives of Malden's Hispanic employees, or immigrants recommended by parish priests. Indeed, immigrants settling in America over the past two decades have created informal networks that facilitate the arrival of new people who, once in the country, have a relative or a friend who gives them lodging and helps them find work. "It is how you get to jobs in Oregon or Minneapolis or New England that makes these networks pivotal," Mr. Shaiken said.
Malden Mills insists on proof that an immigrant is here legally, but even so has had some problems. An applicant must present a Social Security card and a photo I.D., both easily purchased on the street. And catching any falsehood can take the Immigration Service at least a year, often longer, because the Social Security Administration reviews Social Security numbers for accuracy only once a year.
"I have seen Immigration go one or two years before we are notified," said Alan Kraunelis, the company's director of industrial relations. "A lot of times by then, the employee has a lawyer and is trying to get a green card. In some cases you can keep the worker on and in others you cannot. You say this guy is a very good worker, he has excellent attendance, we have trained him in a skill, and for the most part, unless the worker has a problem back in his homeland, Immigration is pretty reasonable."
Or consider Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, representing 300,000 low-wage workers in the United States. "Nationally, 20,000 are probably undocumented workers," said Bruce Raynor, Unite's secretary-treasurer. In Chicago, the proportion is higher, probably one-third, among the 1,500 laundry workers represented by the union, he said.
And the union, in its latest contract, tries to protect them. In addition to specifying wages of $7 to $9 an hour, the contract obligates the employers to bar immigration agents from their plants without search warrants. Just going to court for a warrant alerts undocumented workers, who then can disappear, returning home for a while or reappearing, with fresh documents, at another job.
"I think of what is happening as a floating labor pool that kind of floats back and forth across the border," said Jeffrey Passell, a demographer at the Urban Institute in Washington. "Right now, there is some indication that this floating pool that tends to go back and forth is actually here."
Others are also contributing to the pool of potential workers, postponing the pool's depletion. Older people, for example, are working more years, either postponing retirement or coming back to part-time jobs. Supermarkets and telephone call centers, set up by so many companies to handle orders and customer queries, are recruiting more high school and college students and arranging schedules around their schooling. Blacks are taking jobs in greater numbers, and their unemployment rate has fallen sharply. And the number of people holding two or more jobs has risen by 800,000 since 1994, to 8.1 million.
But apart from immigrants, no group has made a greater contribution than women. The shift from welfare to work plays a role. Many new workers are unmarried mothers with at least one child younger than 3 years old. The percentage of these women now in the labor force -- holding jobs or seeking them -- rose to 65.8 percent last year from only 54.3 percent in 1995.
And across the job spectrum -- from high-skilled work to low-skilled -- the percentage of women shifting to full-time work from part-time rose to 56.4 percent last year from 52.8 percent in 1994. These women are adding millions of hours without changing the number of people employed or the nation's unemployment rate, now 4.1 percent.
The chance to increase family income draws some of the women. So does the aging of the work force; the oldest baby boomers have more time now that their children are young adults. And companies like Manpower, the huge temporary help agency, nudge women into working more hours.
Manpower supplies 25,000 people a day, on average, most of them women, as operators at corporate call centers. The percentage of those women working full time rather than part time is rising, mainly for two reasons, says Jeffrey Joerres, Manpower's chief executive. Some are drawn into longer hours by flexible scheduling, which allows them to work while their children are in school or in the evening when a husband is home. But higher pay is also a lure.
"I don't know where the inflection point is," Mr. Joerres said, "but $1 an hour can make a very big difference at this pay level, and pay for call-center operators has gone up by $1 an hour since the beginning of the year, to $10 an hour."
Does that mean wage pressures have arrived, as Mr. Greenspan fears?
Apparently not, judging by the very mild movement in the Consumer Price Index. Wages might be rising for call-center operators and others, but not by enough to force prices up. The pool of untapped labor is still sufficiently untapped.

Telecommuting to Pick Up as Workers Iron Out Kinks

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
If ever there was a company likely to take to telecommuting, it is AT&T. The huge corporation has thousands of employees around the world. Many perform white-collar tasks that can be accomplished on computers and sent over the Internet. Even the company's bottom line can benefit when its workers dial into the company's network or pick up the phone to call headquarters.
Yet in 1999, five years after AT&T began a formal telecommuting program, the percentage of managers who worked from home at least once each week dropped to 24 percent, from 29 percent in 1998. 
 Nor is AT&T alone.
Across the country, thousands of people who tried working from home part time during the 1990's have returned to the office full time. Many felt disconnected from their colleagues, became frustrated about slow computer hookups or simply grew tired of trying to be a parent and an employee at the same time.
It is enough to make one wonder whether the workplace of the early 21st century will in fact resemble a traditional office much more than was once thought.
Do not be fooled, workplace experts say, contending that in reality this is the lull before the telecommuting storm. Companies and workers alike are working out early kinks and awaiting new technology, they say.
"It is going to transform the workplace," said John A. Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm. Over the next few years, analysts say, flexible work arrangements will force companies to reassess how they use space and cause more people to take part-time jobs or become independent contractors.
As broadband Internet access begins to enter homes in the next year -- the change AT&T says its telecommuters are waiting for -- the office computer will no longer be so much faster than the home PC. And as the cost of videoconferencing equipment continues to fall, the technology will soon be affordable to many more people.
Demographic forces are playing a role, as well. As the number of baby boomers taking care of elderly parents grows, the ability to stay home will become more attractive. The current tight labor markets, meanwhile, are certainly vulnerable to economic cycles, but they are also a product of population trends that will continue through the first few years of the new decade, forcing employers to look for highly skilled workers wherever they can find them.
Forty-three percent of human resource executives recently polled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said that telecommuting would be the most important workplace trend of the 21st century -- ranking it higher than any other subject. And while statistics on the subject are notoriously unreliable, most analysts agree that at least 10 million Americans now telecommute regularly, and that number is not expected to fall.
The hiccups of the last few years are not uncommon when new technology is adopted. Such practices often go through three stages, said John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, which builds much of the networking behind the Internet. First comes an initial excitement; then skepticism that the trend will truly take off; and, finally, widespread acceptance.
Telecommuting is now moving out of the second of those stages, many workplace experts say.
At the start of the 1990's, telecommuting captured workers' imaginations as a way to hold on to their careers and salaries while removing some of the strain of long weeks at the office.
Managers, for their part, realized it could help them cut down on real estate costs and potentially even improve productivity by making workers happier. Often, however, both sides underestimated the ensuing difficulties.
"Too many companies rushed into telecommuting," said Rick Wald, a principal at the human resource consulting firm William M. Mercer who advises companies on flexible benefits. "It really requires training for managers. They need to manage people differently."
That is precisely the lesson that Merrill Lynch & Company, the brokerage firm, learned, and its response offers a glimpse of what telecommuting could become.
In 1994, it started a pilot program but quickly discovered that neither telecommuters nor their bosses were ready for all the questions that arose: How often should a worker check voice mail? Is day care still necessary? Do telecommuters really work full time?
So two years later Merrill Lynch created an elaborate training program for people who wanted to work at home sometimes, said Janice Miholics, a vice president for alternative work arrangements in the private-client technology group. Employees must write a formal proposal to enter the program. Both they and their bosses then sit through a two-hour training session. Finally, the telecommuters spend their first two weeks in transition, dialing into the office from an on-site laboratory, where they are given a laptop, printer and other equipment to take home.
In Mrs. Miholics' division, 350 of the 1,800 workers now telecommute at least once a week. Only one employee has ever stopped telecommuting for a reason other than a job change, she said. "It's allowed us to retain some critical people who otherwise would have left," she said.
Other companies are learning the same lessons. "We're starting to sift out a lot of the failed programs," said Christena Nippert-Eng, a sociologist at the Illinois Institute of Technology who has studied telecommuting. "The programs that exist now are much better."
The next problem will be deciding what to do with the office when it has fewer people in it, workplace experts said. One solution, called hoteling, involves getting rid of permanent offices and instead assigning full-time workers to a new office or cubicle each day, depending on what is available.
Some of the country's largest consulting firms, where employees are often out of the office on assignment, have adopted hoteling and cut down their real estate costs. But it has failed to catch on elsewhere because employees often find it dehumanizing. "When you play with someone's space, you're playing with 8 to 10 to 12 hours of their day," Robin Szumyk, a principal in William M. Mercer's human resources practice, said.
Consider Lisa Hilbish, an account executive in Charlotte, N.C., for Ceridian Employer Services, which sells payroll software to companies. She works from home about twice each week and said it was a benefit that made her more likely to remain in her job. The one complication, however, is that, when she decides to come into the office on short notice, there are often no desks available, and she must work in a room used for employee breaks.
"It's kind of loud," Mrs. Hilbish said. "You don't get as much done."
In response, some companies are building space for specific departments or teams so that workers can feel at home there, even if they are sharing it with colleagues, said Susan L. Boyle, a managing partner at HLW International, a New York workplace consulting firm.
That, however, does not solve the problem of what to do when everybody shows up on the same day. Such questions will loom over the workplace in the next few years as telecommuting becomes more widespread.
"The technology piece will get itself worked out. The security piece will get itself worked out," Ms. Boyle said. "But there's an emotional piece, too."

Health Care Consumers Can Expect Change, and a Shock or Two

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW

 BODY:
Americans who have complaints about the health care system may soon be in luck -- or maybe not. Many health care professionals expect the medical system in the United States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades that many patients will not be able to recognize it.
While such a notion may excite some consumers -- who hasn't fantasized about the death of health maintenance organizations? -- others will no doubt be riled by new procedures that actually provide less medical care and coverage than before. 
 "The one thing that is sure to happen is a lot of change across the whole health care industry," said Dr. David B. Skinner, the chief executive of the New York Presbyterian Hospital. "A better quality system has started, but it is going to take several decades to develop."
Consumers should brace themselves for a few shocks. Many patient advocates and Democratic representatives in Congress would like a government-sponsored health care system, similar to many of those in Europe. But some health providers -- notably the pharmaceutical companies -- snarl at the mention of more government involvement, given the likelihood of a federally mandated reduction in drug prices.
"The insurance of last resort is the government," said Joseph Zammit-Lucia, the chief executive of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy in New York, which advises drug companies. "But you never know what insurance you may be able to buy in the future."
Even if health care in the United States remains in private hands, change will be dramatic. One of the biggest changes during the next 10 to 20 years is expected to be the increasing role of the patient in choosing his or her treatment. Instead of relying only on their doctors' advice, consumers will also use medical information from the Internet and prescription-drug ad campaigns.
"Currently, health care is professional-driven," Mr. Zammit-Lucia said. "But with the Internet and consumer ad campaigns, I will know about as much about my illness as the doctor does. I'll use him as a professional adviser, similar to how I use a financial planner now."
Patients will also get their medications in new ways. Health experts are confident that drugs will routinely be bought through the Internet, including treatments for serious conditions. Pharmacists, long the prime instructors of how medications should be taken, will dole out more advice in cyberspace, especially as consumers become brand loyal to their health care Web sites.
Medications are also likely to change. Scientists predict that hospital-bound treatments like chemotherapy may eventually be administered as pills that can be taken at home. Patients will also have more choices about how they take their medications, such as through injection, patch, nasal spray or inhaler.
"It's realistic to believe that cancer will become a chronic illness," said Dr. Scot Remick, head of clinical trials at the University Hospitals of Cleveland. "We're not curing all cancers yet, but patients will be able to live longer with a good quality of life."
The increasingly enormous amount of medical knowledge will also change patients' visits to their doctors. Using models of a person's gene structure, scientists will soon be able to tell which infants can be expected to develop certain illnesses -- including some cancers and diabetes -- and what medicines have little risk of side effects.
Doctors say that breakthroughs in genomic technology will allow consumers to know what diseases they are likely to get and what measures to take to prevent them. Yet patient advocates worry that the insurers may use genomic information to deny or limit coverage.
"In a brave new world, it is frighteningly realistic to imagine an insurance industry that knows more than it should about the lifestyle and family history of every American," said Diane Archer, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy group in New York. "Through health profiling, an insurer can refuse affordable coverage to everyone with a perceived health risk."
Dr. Charles M. Cutler, chief medical officer of the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group representing managed care companies, said that insurers would use genetic information not to deny coverage but to provide better care. He noted that some illnesses can be diagnosed now during pregnancy, but insurers have still provided coverage to these infants.
That's hardly the last of a consumer's worries. During the next 20 years, Americans will have to deal with increasingly large and powerful health care organizations. Almost all of them will demand higher prices.
The consolidation that has swept the drug industry -- with Pfizer and American Home Products battling now to acquire Warner-Lambert, and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals of Britain buying the Swedish drug giant Astra last year -- will continue until there are a handful of companies, each with 10 percent of the global market, double their current share. Only five companies currently have more than a 4 percent share of the worldwide pharmaceutical market, according to I.M.S. Health, an industry consultant. Cambridge Pharma forecasts that, as a result of more costly technology, drug prices will increase to 30 percent of medical expenditures in the United States during the next 20 years from 10 percent at present.
"Consumers are going to have to pay for routine drugs out of their own pockets" as insurers scramble to control costs, predicted Mr. Zammit-Lucia, citing generic painkillers as an example. "What will happen is that insurance will only pay for what is not affordable."
By most accounts, H.M.O.'s will not live long into the next century, but many health care experts are not sure what type of insurance will take their place. Everyone agrees that traditional indemnity plans are history, even though consumers are demanding an unrestricted choice of doctors.
"The problem with managed care is that it became so intrusive in the relationship between patient and doctor," said Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, president of the American Medical Association. "The H.M.O.'s were spending more money than they were saving. We have to find a method to provide appropriate care. But that may not mean all the care the patient wants."
One thing on which health care experts agree is that the insurers of the next two decades will be substantially larger than any of the entities that have preceded them. Several doctors predicted that H.M.O.'s would eventually be replaced by large hospital systems, with local clinics and hospices, that contract with employers to provide medical insurance and treatment.

In the Works: Drugs Tailored to Individual Patients

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
For several years, the big quest in biotechnology has been to determine the complete sequence of human DNA, the genetic code of life. Now, however, that task is nearing completion, and the biotechnology industry is facing an even tougher job -- deciphering that code so that new drugs and diagnostic tests can be developed.
The coming post-sequencing era will bring huge changes to the industry. The causes and mechanisms of various diseases that now defy treatment will become known so that drugs can be developed much more precisely. Drug discovery will rely as much on software and databases of genetic information as it will on test tubes and white mice. 
 Perhaps the most important change could be a shift from the "one drug fits all" approach to treatments tailored to individual patients based on their genetic profiles.
"With the genome being completed, I think we're literally going to move from statistical-based medicine, where we're thinking about entire populations, to personalized medicine," said Kenneth J. Conway, president of Millennium Predictive Medicine, a majority-owned subsidiary of Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Mass. "I think we're going to look back 10 years from now and think of medicine as being in the dark ages."
Of course, many of the predictions made by biotechnology executives in the past proved overly optimistic. Still, as the biotechnology industry nears its 25th birthday in 2001 -- dating from the formation of Genentech in 1976 -- it has finally started to bring to market the promised treasure trove of drugs. Biotechnology companies now have about 300 drugs in advanced stages in clinical trials, according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group.
One of the hottest approaches now, for instance, is monoclonal antibodies, which are proteins that can zero in on a disease-causing agent and neutralize it. These were first developed in the 1970's, but only in the last few years have companies succeeded in making effective drugs from them, such as Reopro from Centocor, which fights blood clotting, and Herceptin from Genentech, for breast cancer.
In the next few years, many other antibodies are expected to reach the market, including one from Genentech for asthma and allergies. Imclone Systems is working on one for head and neck cancers. IDEC Pharmaceuticals and Coulter Pharmaceutical are each hoping to sell the first antibodies linked to radioactive isotopes, which would allow radiation to be directed specifically to tumors, with less harm to healthy tissue.
Other drugs besides antibodies, of course, will continue to be developed. One that is expected to be approved soon is Visudyne from QLT Phototherapeutics, which would be the first drug for age-related macular degeneration, a deterioration of the retina that is the leading cause of near blindness in the elderly.
But the biggest opportunities and challenges are expected to come from genomics, the study of the human genetic code. The Human Genome Project, sponsored by the federal government, is expected to finish the "rough draft" of the genome by spring and to be completed in 2003. Private efforts by such companies as Celera Genomics and Incyte Pharmaceuticals are also racing ahead.
The full sequence consists of about three billion chemical bases, amid which are 100,000 or more genes that code for the production of particular proteins, which actually carry out functions in the body. But unless scientists can determine the functions of the genes and proteins and how they work together, the sequence alone is just an enormous overload of information.
"Knowing the gene sequence in many ways tells you where to start looking, but not much more," said James M. Gower, president and chief executive of Rigel Inc., a South San Francisco start-up involved in what many consider the new thing -- functional genomics, which figures out the functions of genes.
A related discipline that could see growth in the next few years is so-called proteomics, which is the study of proteins. And, since the human mind alone cannot keep track of billions of bases and thousands of genes, companies are springing up in the new field of bio-informatics, the melding of computer science and life science.
As the mechanisms of the body are better discovered, biotechnology companies will be better able to develop drugs based on knowledge of how the body functions than by trying random chemicals to see what works.
"The whole drug-discovery business is now a biology-based business and not a chemistry-based business," said Richard A. van den Broek, biotechnology analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, an investment bank. "It's been a chemical business for 50 years."
Progress should be made on diseases for which there is little understanding or treatment, including neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and autoimmune diseases like lupus.
William A. Haseltine, chairman and chief executive of Human Genome Sciences Inc. in Rockville, Md., said genes and growth factors are already starting to be used to grow new blood vessels and, in the more distant future, it will be possible to grow entire new organs.
One approach to trying to determine gene function is to learn which genes are turned on in different types of cells, such as those turned on in cancer cells compared with normal cells. This has opened up opportunities for companies selling tiny chips that can quickly analyze thousands of genes at a time.
Similarly, companies are now racing to figure out genetic differences among people. Differences of a single base -- known as a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP (pronounced "snip") -- can determine eye color or make the difference between health and illness.
Such information could lead to personalized and preventive medicine. People found to be susceptible to a disease might take a regimen of pills or change their diet to prevent it. And medicines will be tailored to each individual, a discipline called pharmacogenomics.
"Snips will make a quantum leap toward patient-specific medicine," said G. Steven Burrill, chief executive of Burrill & Company, a San Francisco merchant bank that specializes in biotechnology.
A precursor is Herceptin, the Genentech drug for breast cancer. It works in only 25 percent to 30 percent of cases, those in which the breast tumors produce unusually large amounts of a protein known as Her2. Patients are tested beforehand to see if they qualify.
Millennium plans to introduce a genetic test next year that will predict whether melanoma, a skin cancer, will spread through the body. Patients whose tumors will not spread might be spared chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
Personalized medicine will change the economics of the business, with fewer blockbuster drugs. "There will be a lot of fragmentation in the market," said Jeffrey Casdin, chief executive of Casdin Capital Partners, a biotechnology investment fund. He said, however, that since personalized drugs would be more effective and would have fewer side effects than mass market drugs, they would fetch higher prices.
Genetic profiling of patients raises privacy issues. Should, for instance, a person's susceptibility to a disease be used by insurance companies to raise premiums or by employers in hiring decisions?
That is just one of the ethical and political issues likely to confront the biotechnology industry in the next decade. A huge backlash has already developed against bioengineered crops. There are controversies over cloning and the use of stem cells -- the progenitors of all other cells in the body -- that can come from aborted fetuses or from embryos made in fertility clinics.
Yet another issue could be a budding backlash against rising drug prices, which are commanding an ever-growing percentage of total health care spending. Some drugs offered by biotechnology companies can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year, though companies argue that drugs can save money over all by reducing the need for operations and hospital stays.
Financially, the biotechnology industry enters the new century in modest shape. A severe shortage of financing that plagued the industry a year ago has abated somewhat, but the industry seems to be stratifying into haves and have-nots.
An index maintained by Burrill & Company of stocks of the biggest biotechnology companies, like Amgen and Biogen, the ones with profits and products, has risen more than 120 percent this year. Burrill found that midsize companies, many with products on the horizon, rose more than 70 percent, but stocks of the smallest companies, many in early stages of development, rose, by comparison, only 30 percent.
Private companies are still having trouble raising venture capital or going public. With a biotechnology company typically taking 10 years to show a profit, Internet companies seem like more attractive investments.
A long-predicted consolidation -- through mergers and, in some cases, bankruptcies -- seemed to begin in earnest in 1999, and that is expected to continue.
"We're still dealing with an industry that has too much capacity," said Peter F. Drake, managing director of Prudential Vector Healthcare Group. There are an estimated 300 publicly traded biotechnology companies and about 1,000 private ones.
Some of the acquisitions of biotech companies in 1999 were made by big drug companies. Johnson & Johnson bought Centocor; Merck bought Sibia Neurosciences, and Warner-Lambert acquired Agouron Pharmaceuticals. The drug companies need new products to continue growth and replace products with expiring patents. And tapping into the technology of biotechnology companies looks like one good way to get them.

Rocky Outlook for Genetically Engineered Crops

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Agribusiness leaders are as confident as ever that the need to feed a growing world population makes it both essential and inevitable that biotechnology will play a central role in 21st-century farming. But for now it looks like the industry may be pulled over by consumers and fined by investors for recklessly speeding toward such a future.
Sales of genetically engineered crops soared in 1999, but a sharp slowdown in growth, if not an actual decline, seems likely in 2000, and even industry optimists are saying it may take several years to get rolling again. Crop surpluses, which undermine farmers' willingness to pay for new technology, trade tensions, and antitrust concerns have all contributed to the uncertain outlook. But the biggest jolt to the visions of the multinational giants that dominate agribusiness have come from a surge in consumer fears about the safety of the novel crops. 
 It has made no difference that regulators and major food companies agreed with the industry that there was scant evidence of any significant human health hazard. Nor has it mattered that most researchers contend that critics have wildly exaggerated evidence that biotechnology is likely to create superweeds or widespread destruction of beneficial insects like Monarch butterflies.
Over the last year, governments and the industry's biggest customers began deciding it was better to retreat than to ignore negative public sentiment. The backlash was strongest in Europe, where supermarket chains took foods containing oil from genetically modified corn and soybeans off their shelves, and regulators tabled applications to plant new genetically altered strains of beets and canola despite the opinions of their own science advisers that the crops were safe.
Some of the biggest drug, food and chemical giants have already retreated from the once popular model of becoming "life sciences" companies with strong footings in every sector affected by biotechnology. Early this month, AstraZeneca P.L.C. of Britain and Novartis A.G. of Switzerland, announced plans to spin off and then merge their agricultural businesses into a new company to be called Syngenta. "We went three steps forward in recent years, but we are now taking two steps back," said Sano M. Shimoda, founder of BioScience Securities, a research firm based in Orinda, Calif., that concentrates on agricultural biotechnology. "I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet."
The biggest business beneficiaries of the biotechnology backlash may be the manufacturers of the traditional agrichemicals that have been losing market share and money while battling to slow the move of farmers to new crops that are devised to work best with just one herbicide or, in some cases, to eliminate the need for certain insecticides. Some chemical giants like DuPont, Dow Chemical and Aventis have major commitments to biotechnology as well, but others, like the struggling American Cyanamid pesticides business of American Home Products, have little to lose from a setback for biotechnology.
One development many foresee for next year is the adoption in many countries -- perhaps even the United States -- of labeling standards for food containing genetically modified products. Opponents of biotechnology predict confidently that labels will lead to widespread rejection of modified products, pointing to recent experience in Europe, where retailers have raced to advertise "G.M.O.-free" products, referring to genetically modified organisms.
But analysts say that outcome depends largely on whether both kinds of products remain on the shelves, and the level of fears about health hazards and pricing. In the United States, they point out, milk produced from cows that have not been injected with Posilac, a bovine growth hormone that Monsanto produces in bacteria, is labeled, but it is usually premium-priced and only a very small percentage of consumers seek it out. Monsanto said that Posilac sales expanded 20 percent this year and that its new production plant under construction in Georgia was expected to begin producing the hormone by the end of next year.
Barring stronger evidence that biotechnology poses major new hazards, analysts and the industry's major players believe that any slowdown or decline this coming year is likely to be reversed. The underlying forces that had made agricultural biotechnology such a hit on Wall Street as recently as last year continue to gather strength. The world's population passed six billion and, although the growth rate is slowing, the demand for rice, wheat and corn, the three mostly widely planted grains, is projected by the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington to increase 40 percent by 2020.
With the acreage of arable land basically unchanged over the last 30 years, there is increasing pressure to use biotechnology to make agriculture more productive. And researchers continue to expand markedly the industry's tools and potential.
Thomas C. Humphrey, president of DuPont's nutrition and health businesses, notes that public and private money is pouring into research on human, animal and plant genetics and into study of their interaction with the environment. "When all that starts to intersect in two or three years, it's going to be incredible," he said.
The most recent breakthrough was a project to alter rice so that it would produce the protein necessary to create vitamin A in its grain. That development is estimated to be five years from commercialization, but it was widely hailed in developing nations as a way to help prevent the deaths of up to three million children annually and eliminate millions of cases of blindness.
"The main risk is that we keep talking and don't move ahead," said Per Pinstrup-Andersen, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute.
"If we create biotech options, farmers will take them if they like it," Mr. Pinstrup-Andersen added.
That sounds logical enough, but one hot question is whether farmers actually have much choice. Industry critics contend that the new technology has become so concentrated in the hands of powerful multinationals that they have the marketing influence with international aid agencies to force some products on farmers.
Critics also say that blown pollen can transfer traits from genetically modified crops to the fields of organic farmers and others that want nothing to do with the technology. They are pressing for much stronger regulation and a very broad interpretation of what kinds of effects might be classified as damages for which corporate sponsors of biotechnology could be sued.
The groundswell of public fears and opposition came too late to have much impact on what was planted this year, but farmers are watching the futures markets for signals about what seed to buy this winter. With a growing number staring at bankruptcy after two years of bumper crops and low prices, farmers are worried about paying higher prices for genetically modified seed and then finding the next harvest difficult to sell because of opposition to such crops.
Monsanto has the most to lose from such fears, especially in soybeans. Nearly half of the United States soybean crop this year was modified to tolerate spraying with Roundup, the company's best-selling weed killer. Analysts predict market declines in the United States for both the modified beans and the company's modified corn (farmers say the latter's ability to generate a pesticide was not worth the cost in many areas this year because of low insect populations). Monsanto says it remains somewhat optimistic that the market for both will continue to grow both at home and abroad, according to Hugh Grant, co-president of the company's agricultural business.
One key to the year will be Brazil, where approval of Roundup-Ready soybeans has been recommended by the Government but tied up in court. Biotechnology critics say that thanks to the ban, Brazil will have higher exports to Europe, but the real world may not provide a clear test. Reports suggest that anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent of the Brazilian crop planted this fall has been grown from Roundup-Ready seed smuggled in from Argentina, where the crop is legal and very popular with farmers.
Such percentages could make it too expensive for Brazil to certify its crops as free from modification, since crops from many farms get mixed together during shipment.
For biotechnology backers, such complications are just one more reason to believe that the past year's turmoil will not derail the industry for long. Safety fears may slow growth, they say, but each year will bring new products that make farming easier or consumer products more appealing.
"The genie is out of the bottle with regard to the technology," said Michael Phillips, executive director for food and agriculture of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a Washington trade group.

Auto Dealers Streamline Operations To Meet the Challenge of the Internet

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: JACKSON, Mich.

 BODY:
When a customer calls Extreme Dodge here, the dealership's caller identification system instantly brings up on a sales representative's computer screen the customer's sales and service record, along with a photo of the customer and her vehicle. For new buyers, sales or finance managers are no longer required to approve each deal, so a sales representative can negotiate a price and arrange a car loan and insurance in just 45 minutes, in contrast to several hours at many dealerships.
Otherwise, much remains the same here as at dealerships across the country. Most customers come in and test-drive the cars before buying one. The prices, although close to factory invoice, are still subject to some negotiation. The dealer, Wesley L. Lutz, is active in the community and tries to sell cars to his friends. And the dealership is sometimes short of popular sport utility vehicles and clogged with unpopular cars, as factories hundreds of miles away keep cranking out whatever their assembly lines are designed to produce, with limited ability to respond swiftly to shifts in market demand. 
 Extreme Dodge is cited by some auto dealers as an example of the industry's future: a computer-using, family-owned business with a lean staff that has earned DaimlerChrysler's top rating of five stars for customer satisfaction. But whether Extreme Dodge really represents the future, or simply a modern version of a century-old way of doing business, is hotly debated within the auto industry. As executives try to envision what automobiles and the auto industry will look like in 2010, the buying process absorbs much of their attention because of rapid changes that are already beginning to take place.
Some industry executives, particularly at the General Motors Corporation and to some extent at the Ford Motor Company, say that many customers no longer have time to visit dealerships or even take test-drives. They contend that in the next few years, millions of Americans will start ordering new cars on the Internet, with a dealer simply showing up at the buyer's home or office to drop off the new vehicle and fill out the paperwork -- and even the paperwork will eventually disappear, too. A decade from now, these executives predict, customers will choose their vehicles on the Internet, specifying options and paint color, submit an electronic order straight to the factory and take delivery in a couple of weeks.
Such predictions are increasingly popular in Detroit, even though the percentage of Internet purchases now is very small. "While today it's less than 1 percent, in 10 years it'll rise to 40 percent, 50 percent; it's going up geometrically," said Mark Hogan, G.M.'s group vice president for electronic commerce.
Some of the most prominent industry analysts share this view. "Consumers will get their information from the Internet, not a salesperson; the salesperson will be just an order taker," said J. David Power III, founder of the J. D. Power & Associates consulting firm.
Yet in Torrance, Calif., where the big Japanese automakers have their North American sales headquarters, a very different vision of the future is taking shape, a future that looks a lot like Extreme Dodge looks today. These executives say that while customers may increasingly check invoice prices and features on the Internet, they will always want to test- drive cars before buying them, and many customers will want to know the dealer or salesman who sells them the car.
James Press, executive vice president for North American sales of the Toyota Motor Corporation, said that the best way to see what a dealership would look like in 2010, is to visit an up-to-date dealership today. "In many ways, it won't be a lot different; the more things change, the more they'll stay the same," he said. "We'll still have people; you'll have relationships; you'll have a place to test-drive a car and a place to have it serviced."
DaimlerChrysler executives tend to agree with the managers at their Japanese competitors rather than with their crosstown rivals in Detroit. They question the feasibility of building huge numbers of cars one at a time, much less delivering them quickly, and they wonder whether customers will be willing to wait once they decide on a model.
The typical customer remains emotional, even impetuous, about car purchases, despite the cost involved, said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's former Chrysler operations. "Once they see it, touch it, feel it, they want it right then," he said.
DaimlerChrysler has created elaborate Web sites for its divisions, but these sites are mainly to provide information and steer customers to their nearest dealership to make purchases.
While there is an industry consensus that customers will rely more on the Internet in the years ahead to gather information about automobiles, nobody knows for sure what those vehicles will look like. Most auto engineers do predict, however, that ever more vehicles will look like combinations of minivans, sport utility vehicles and cars, and will be assembled like cars rather than pickup trucks to improve safety.
Tom Davis, G.M.'s head of global vehicle engineering, said that today's bulky four-wheel-drive systems, which are designed to let motorists extract themselves from swamps or deep snow, are likely to be replaced on many vehicles with lighter, less expensive all-wheel-drive systems. All-wheel-drive systems, which typically do not have so-called transfer cases with very low gears, are just as effective as four-wheel drives for accelerating on slippery roads, although neither helps for braking.
Environmentalists have called for increased use of hybrid engines that rely partly on electricity and partly on gasoline or methanol. Indeed, Honda and Toyota plan to introduce small cars with such systems next year. But in a report in November, the Energy Information Administration predicted that 14.3 million automobiles would be sold in 2010, but only 560,000, or 4 percent, would be hybrids.
Fuel cells, an even cleaner technology that involves combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, will propel only 2,000 or so automobiles sold in 2010, said David Chien, the agency's transportation forecasting team leader. "They'll start making a dent around 2015," he said, adding that automakers were leery of damaging any new technology's reputation by offering it before it had been perfected. "They really don't want to put something out early and blow it."
As hybrid engines and eventually fuel cells do come onto the market, customers are likely to want to test them before buying. Indeed, while Mr. Power predicts that many customers will be willing to buy cars over the Internet someday, his company's research shows that 76 percent of new-car buyers had test-driven automobiles at the dealership where they eventually bought them, down insignificantly from 79 percent in 1996. Many other buyers test-drive a model at one dealership before buying it at another.
Such research heartens dealers like Mr. Lutz, the owner of Extreme Dodge here, 80 miles west of Detroit. By relying heavily on computers, he has cut his sales staff by more than half in the last three years, lowering his costs so he can compete more aggressively with other dealers on price.
But he also contends that, while millions of Americans may now be willing to buy shirts, books and toys over the Internet, they will remain leery of buying $20,000 cars or $30,000 sport utility vehicles that way. He and other dealers here continue to join the boards of community groups and lend used cars free to school athletic teams for out-of-town trips.
"People reciprocate," Mr. Lutz said, "and buy cars from us."

The Real Retail Revolution: It's Wal-Mart, Not the Net

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The trend that is driving so much change in retailing at the dawn of the new century is as obvious to spot as a Mack truck bearing down on your rear bumper.
It is, of course, the Internet. If you believe the hype, the Internet -- which will generate an estimated $20 billion in United States sales this year and is expected to grow by 200 percent to 300 percent a year -- promises nothing short of a revolution that will change how Americans shop forever. 
 Even so, it is not the biggest challenge on the retail highway.
The changes remaking retailing come not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases, but in what they expect their dollars to buy -- which is a lot more than they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes, than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores.
Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer -- famous for wringing every excess penny out of product cost -- is expected to report nearly $143 billion in domestic revenue for fiscal 1999, which will end Jan. 31. That is roughly 7 percent of the United States retail market, according to Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, and seven times all Internet sales combined for this year, as estimated by Forrester Research, the Boston digital consulting firm.
Online retail sales will reach $184 billion in 2004, Forrester predicts, edging closer but still not catching Wal-Mart, which by that year should have $243 billion in revenue domestically, according to Mr. Feiner. He even predicts that Wal-Mart, which sells everything from fresh lettuce to power tools, will produce $1 trillion in revenue worldwide by 2015.
Wal-Mart is, of course, emblematic of a new kind of retailer. Not long ago, consumers on a tight budget expected to sacrifice quality for cost, generally finding mediocre goods in drab environs at the discount chains. But then the discounters remade themselves by offering fashion, brands and great merchandising, all at prices lower than those that rivals, either department stores or independents, could match.
Consider the real revolution: Kmart now offers Martha Stewart 200-thread-count sheets in colors like pewter and eggshell; Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson, has au courant fashion like embroidered jeans and little beaded black purses, and Ikea will customize maple kitchen cabinets.
Consumers of all income levels have quickly become addicted to the new equation of quality and value, and they are handing over market share to chains that provide both -- a trend that is likely to continue. Not only are stock analysts predicting that Wal-Mart will experience staggering growth, but chains like Target, Home Depot, Costco and Kohl's are all expected to expand rapidly, eating up ever-larger chunks of the $2 trillion Americans spend on retail annually.
And it is not just that today's winning merchants will continue to dominate the land masses; it is expected they will use their formidable buying power and brand names to conquer cyberspace as well. Only a year ago, the e-retailers that ran nothing but virtual stores -- like Amazon and Etoys -- were crowing about how their land-based cousins were dinosaurs bound for extinction. Since then, mass merchants -- discounters and specialty stores like Gap Inc. -- have shown the draw of a household name in cyberspace and in some cases catapulted in front of their virtual brethren in Web sales.
Analysts who once predicted that all the online shoppers would flock to the first Web entry into any category of merchandise, like books, now accept that a retailer's tortoise-like thoroughness in the race into cyberspace is not necessarily a bad thing if the company has the financing to outlast early rivals. Wal-Mart, for instance, will not even have introduced its new Web site by this Christmas, but no one is counting it out as an e-retailer in the year 2010.
"Wal-Mart will challenge Amazon for worldwide e-retailing dominance by the year 2005," Burt Flickinger, managing director of Reach Marketing, in Westport, Conn., predicted. "Ultimately, the land-based retailers of size will be able to inflict real pain on their Internet competitors."
This is not to say that some Web-born businesses will not blossom and that the Internet, no matter who is succeeding there, will not have its effects on bricks-and-mortar retailers. It will force them to be better, to entertain, to attract business or to offer a point of view.
"Stores are going to have to be consumers' editors; they have to make big statements on 'this is the fashion,' " Richard Baum, an analyst at CS First Boston, said. "If you go into the store, you will have to know what they think you should be wearing." Already, retailers like American Eagle Outfitters and Ann Taylor excel in such opinionated retail.
Another trend that will intensify as the Internet grows stronger is shopping as family entertainment. Malls across America are putting in entertainment features like Hard Rock Cafes and 20-screen cinemas as fast as they can. But that is just the start.
"People will use shopping as an escape from the technology that will consume their lives," said Laurence C. Siegel, chairman and chief executive of the Mills Corporation, a Virginia-based mall developer that is expanding rapidly. Mr. Siegel is placing big bets on gated attractions to rival the cultural and entertainment venues of the great cities -- Mills, for instance, is exploring partnerships that would let it build concert halls and museums. He sees a future of malls that offer Broadway shows and have community gardens on their rooftops.
While those are pretty grand visions, Mr. Siegel has one even more radical. "Everyone in my business perceives the Internet as a rival," he said. "In five years, the two will be married. The experience of being on the Internet is going to land in the shopping center." He goes on to predict a world of Internet retailers that have actual stores on the concourse that sell actual goods (very pre-Internet). He even forecast the currently unimaginable: "EBay and Amazon are going to have presences in the mall."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY: TALKING THE FUTURE WITH: John S. Reed;
The A.T.M. Prophet Is a Late Convert to the Internet

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
As a young Citicorp executive more than 20 years ago, John S. Reed earned a reputation as a technology guru for his stubborn insistence that automated teller machines -- faceless boxes that spit out money -- would eventually make legions of human bank tellers unnecessary.
After the bank initially lost millions of dollars on his A.T.M. bet, Mr. Reed was vindicated: the gizmos are now as common as corner newsstands. And empty teller windows at many banks attest to the fate of the machines' human counterparts. 
 Mr. Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the country's largest financial services concern and the creation of last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his interest in technology, Mr. Reed admits that the impact and importance of the Internet escaped his attention until recently.
The Internet has now snared the attention of everyone in the banking industry. Companies are rushing to create Internet banking capabilities, either as part of the bank, as in Citigroup's case, or as an entirely separate entity. While no clear leaders have emerged among the banks, Wells Fargo and Bank One have been particularly aggressive competitors.
Mr. Reed said that tackling the challenges of the Internet was now a high priority at Citigroup. Indeed, a job reshuffling in July put Mr. Reed in charge of Citigroup's Internet strategy, while Citigroup's other co-chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, retains most of the other operational duties at the company.
In an interview at his Midtown Manhattan office, Mr. Reed shared his thoughts about the Internet, online financial services and the future of banking.
Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Mr. Reed. -- First of all, this is a revolution. I believe we are living through a sea change. In the next few years, a lot of customers are going to be dealing with their finances over the Internet. Today, about 25 percent of the U.S. population is on the Internet; 75 percent is not. It is growing rapidly. Around the world the numbers are different, but, still, the growth is significant.
Q. -- What regions around the world are growing fastest in Internet usage?
A. -- Japan, Brazil, Singapore are hot spots. The problem right now is, No. 1, the terrestrial competition is pretty good. Sitting down and paying bills with a check, having a checking account and cash machines is pretty easy. So in order to have the Internet be attractive, it has to be better than things that are already pretty effective and efficient.
One of the things that will make a significant difference over time is pricing. Pricing on the Internet will be significantly cheaper. You pay more for terrestrial banking services because of the cost of operating a branch network. The Internet world won't have those costs and, therefore, should be priced more attractively. We need to be able to translate those cost savings to the customer.
Also, there is a difference between being "on the Net" and "of the Net." "On the Net" means someone comes on, they find us, and they find what they're looking for. "Of the Net" means we're embedded in someone else's offering.
Q. -- Why has online stock trading taken off so much more rapidly than online banking?
A. -- If you're happy writing checks and dealing with your bank in the normal way, there is not tremendous motivation to get you onto the Internet. I think one thing that is causing banks to be slow compared to brokers is that banking is a much more complex relationship. In Japan, 20 percent of our customers are coming to us through the Internet or by phone. When they sign up, we send them the forms and they sign. They never see a branch; they never deal with us physically.
The main reason they deal with us is they are looking for the products we offer that are not available from their local Japanese banks. For whatever reason, they are electronically comfortable, and they come in and deal with us. It is an important part of our growth. I think here in the States it will come in time, but it will come when there is a clear price advantage.
We should be able to pay people a lot more for their money. I think we are going to develop a set of people who deal with us differently. They are going to deal with us over the Internet and with cash machines and they will never see a branch. They won't care about a branch. Then the question will be, why did they choose us, and it's going to have to be some sense of "O.K.-ness" with who we are and some degree of the quality of service of the interaction.
I believe that this notion of community is very important in the electronic world. I think the bank will have to establish some kind of community feel. The customer has to enjoy interacting with us, feel good about interacting with us. We are going to have to do a lot of experimenting as to what constitutes that kind of community. Advice is going to turn out to be one of the key issues. I think to a much greater degree than we recognize, people come into the branches of banks because they want to talk to people. That dialogue gives them a sense of how they should manage their lives.
Q. -- Do you think that is broken up demographically -- that younger people may be willing to find their advice in a medium like the Net rather than rely on an adviser in a branch?
A. -- I think that is true. I just don't have the data to support it. I have a feeling most of us are quite ignorant about finance. It's amazing to me -- I have friends who are professors at famous universities who are absolutely naive with regard to money. That's because there isn't any part of the normal education process that teaches you, unless you're raised in a family where your parents talked to you about these things. It's just not a subject you run into.
So I would guess that half of the people who run into difficulties with a credit card never learned the fundamental disciplines of a budget. And it doesn't make any difference how much money you have, whether it's a lot of money or a little money. Actually people with a little money tend to learn a lot more quickly because they get forced by the world to learn how to manage their resources. The good news is I have a feeling that, 30 to 45 years from now, we will have a much better-educated public.
Q. -- Are these things getting increasingly commodified as the consumer is getting more educated?
A. -- If somebody arrived from Mars and you put a Ford and Chevy in front of them, I think they would have a hard time deciding what the difference is. The point is, a car is a car is a car, and big differences are really quite subtle. So from the perspective of a Martian, let's face it, most banks aren't all that different.
Q. -- Will the differences matter in the future?
A. -- It will matter, but we need to form these communities, and we are going to have to be warm and fuzzy and meaningful. Yes, there will be subtle differences with presentation and style and so forth. I was talking to Bob Pitman from America Online. He estimates that 80 percent of the people on the Net are looking for convenience and 20 percent are looking for price. So a feeling of convenience is going to be important. Someone has to know who you are, who they are taking money from and so forth. It isn't as though you can just go in and buy a share of stock with anyone -- you have to set up a relationship. And once you set up the relationship, the likelihood is you'll stick with it. But it is all open space right now.
Q. -- Do you worry about Quicken or AOL getting between you and your customers?
A. -- Yes. I do believe that it will be a revolution. Like all revolutions it will be very easy to get lost. We have not figured it out. You can see the P/E's of these Internet companies, and you say to yourself, "You know what? What the market is saying to you is, 'If you can get your business into the Internet space, it is more valuable.' "
Why is it more valuable? Because your cost of acquiring customers is very small compared to terrestrial stuff. Your cost in serving a customer is almost negligible. If you do want to play, you have to confront the question of "O.K., how do I operate in this space? How do I get from here to there?"
I just spent an extended period meeting with Internet companies. I was probing to see what sort of inner contradictions there were that might bring this all to a screeching halt. I was trying to figure out if this thing is really going anywhere. And I believe it is. Maybe 20 percent of the G.N.P. is highly susceptible to disintermediation by the Internet. That's a lot of money. This will be profound.
Q. -- Who do you worry about the most?
A. -- I don't worry about anybody. The challenge is ours. I admire -- and that's a little different from worry -- AOL. AOL is clearly predominant. I have been in business for a very long time, and there are very few instances where people start from zero and end up with 20 million customers. And they have done precisely that. We did that with our credit cards. Maybe -- and I don't know the facts here -- our friends at Fidelity did that with mutual funds. This idea of being able to gain customers at that speed is more noteworthy than people think.
I am a revolutionary, as you may know, and anytime you give me a fork in the road where the choice is a slow change or a revolution, I will always take the revolution. I am a great believer that that is how changes take place. The Internet is real. It is fundamental. And it is a young person's game.
Q. -- As a manager of this, what are the questions you are not seeing answered that you would like to see answered, or issues explored that are not being explored?
A. -- From my point of view, we have to figure out fundamental economics. We have to worry a lot about privacy, how to treat customers. And we have to get working on some of these expert systems and selling and so forth and so on. We bring some specific knowledge of how our business works, and we are going to have to let people who know a little bit more about the Internet worry about how to do the software.
I don't think this is going to be fun and games. It's going to be quite a big change in the next 10 to 15 years.

Goodbye Cold Calling; Hello Cross-Selling

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
If families continue to sit down together for dinner in the 21st century, they should be able to enjoy their meals with fewer interruptions.
The stream of unsolicited phone calls from sales people and stockbrokers pitching everything from stock tips to credit card insurance should ebb as financial services companies develop more sophisticated ways of selling their products and services, industry executives and consultants say. They see the dreaded "cold call" being replaced with the new industry buzzword, the "cross sell" of services to people who are already customers of another business of a company. 
 In the wake of the historic changes made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation is expected among financial services companies, creating more conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say.
"If history and the experiences in other countries are a guide, the structural changes that will follow will be of great significance," said Jerome Kenney, an executive vice president who plots corporate strategy for Merrill Lynch & Company. "Our own internal forecast is, if you go out five years, there will be very few independent securities firms."
Only the biggest firms on Wall Street, like Merrill, Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, will be able to avoid being gobbled up by commercial banks and insurance companies, industry analysts predict.
Most small and midsize brokerage firms, especially Internet-based trading firms that are competing on price, will be acquired or will fail, said James Punishill, an online financial services analyst at Forrester Research in Boston. Electronic trading with low commissions will remain commonplace, as it has become in the last several years, but it will not be profitable enough to sustain a big business, analysts say.
The new conglomerates that are expected to compete with Citigroup will look more like what Europeans call universal banks, Deutsche Bank of Germany or UBS of Switzerland, for example. They will provide the full spectrum of financial products and services under one roof, or in the case of Citigroup, under one red umbrella.
But once companies pay huge sums to acquire the heft needed to remain competitive in a global market, they will face the challenge of making those acquisitions pay off by selling more products and more types of products to their growing lists of customers, and they will do so in a market that is being redefined by the Internet.
So far, the track record of cross-selling financial services is spotty, at best, and the growth of the Internet adds to the challenge, as new competitors spring up all over the World Wide Web, offering bargain prices.
Some are well-disguised units of traditional players, like Wingspanbank.com, an online bank created by the Bank One Corporation. Bank One's management has taken pains to hide the connection, hoping to lure customers with higher rates on certificates of deposit without cannibalizing the bank's existing business. That strategy is not a proven winner yet, but online banking is just starting to catch on and analysts expect its use to increase rapidly as more online banks appear and customers of traditional banks switch over to the Internet.
Widespread acceptance of the Internet as a medium for researching and shopping for financial services has complicated efforts to cross-sell. Consumers no longer need to rely on banks and brokers for information about financial services and prices.
Insurance companies have succeeded at cross-selling different types of insurance by offering package deals, like selling auto insurance at attractive rates to customers who also buy a homeowner's policy. Citigroup and Merrill also claim to have had success in selling home loans to customers of their brokerage units. But, over all, there is no convincing evidence that people want to keep all their assets in one place or to buy a wide variety of financial products from a single source.
"A lot of these big deals will fail ultimately because they're not generating the top-line growth," said Peter Davis, a financial services consultant with Cambridge Group in Manhattan.
"They have to start cross-selling, and that cross-selling has to occur around an understanding of their customers. Cold calls and statement stuffers won't cut it."
For examples, Mr. Davis pointed to the comparative records of banks that are the products of one or more mergers and those that are not. Both types of banks, he said, sell about 2.1 products, like certificates of deposit, per customer. "There really is no difference in performance," he said.
Once a merged organization cuts out overlapping costs, the only way to make a merger pay off is to increase revenue. So inevitably conglomerates will seek to do so by trying to get their customers to buy more from them or invest more with them.
The problem is that consumers have easy access to lots of information -- some would say, too much -- about purveyors of financial services, their prices and offerings. In the future, they will be more likely to shop around, mostly online, before buying investing or borrowing money and will be less susceptible to unsolicited sales pitches of any kind.
Wall Street is already adapting to the new times. Merrill Lynch; Salomon Smith Barney; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and other big brokerage firms are turning their sales forces away from stock promotion and toward money management. Most firms are concentrating their sales efforts on omnibus accounts that charge an annual fee based on an account's assets, instead of on the number of transactions executed.
In theory, the rise of the fee-based brokerage account will allow the brokers to focus their attention on finding new clients and providing them with advice about how to meet their financial goals. The switch should also make the earnings of brokerage firms more predictable and make their stocks more attractive to investors.
"The traditional broker, we think, is a thing of the past," said Ruediger Adolf, senior vice president at the American Express Company. "The way you can add value, in our belief, is through understanding the goals of an individual customer in a holistic way and developing strategies of how they can get there."
American Express and other financial services companies have accepted that a significant number of investors, not just young people with relatively few assets, want to handle at least some of their financial dealings themselves. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and others have introduced online trading services, with commissions as low as $29.95, to appeal to those people.
That is the same basic price that Charles Schwab charges, but considerably higher than E*trade's low rate of $9.95. American Express undercut them all when it recently started offering free stock trades to customers with big account balances.
Analysts see those moves as an acknowledgment that the execution of stock trades, once a core offering on Wall Street, is fast becoming a commodity. In essence, brokerage firms are saying, "Let us manage your money for a fee, and we'll throw in the stock and bond trades."
Forrester Research predicts that after the price war that is raging among dozens of online brokerage firms, about 75 percent of them will either be acquired or fail within five years. Now that the most aggressive traders have migrated to the Internet, online brokerage firms are all expected to suffer a significant decline in growth, although overall growth of online financial services will accelerate, Forrester predicts.
Mr. Davis says the execution of simple stock trades is just one of many financial services that can be carried out electronically and yield only slim profits; others are basic term life insurance and the brokering of standard home mortgages. Consequently, he said, the livelihoods of thousands of people who now sell those services are threatened by the Internet.
"Most existing players in personal financial services won't be successful online," Mr. Davis said, citing their expensive networks of offices and salespeople.
Brokerage firms have taken to the Internet largely as a defensive measure. They found they were losing too much of their customers' money to firms that offered electronic trading, such as Charles Schwab, E*trade and Fidelity Investments. John L. Steffens, a Merrill Lynch vice chairman, told Merrill brokers recently that customers had moved $9 billion to eight leading online brokers.
"The big thing becomes choice," Mr. Kenney, of Merrill, said. "What had heretofore been a bundled product until Schwab came along is going to be unbundled and offered in multiple forms."
Mr. Kenney said that wealthy people would continue to demand the personal attention of an adviser, or team of advisers, but they would expect many transactions, such as the paying of monthly bills, to be handled automatically. In exchange for a fee that amounts to a slim percentage of the assets they keep at the firm, they will expect sound advice and guidance delivered electronically, over the telephone and, occasionally, in person, he said.
Other customers will purchase one or more of the firm's services a la carte, paying only for research on certain industries or advice on how to allocate their assets. But firms will offer the best value to people who keep at least $100,000 in a fee-based account.
"That is the cutoff everybody is using, and they're not raising the amount," Mr. Kenney said. "Five years from now, it's still going to be $100,000. For a middle-class income plus some assets, there's going to be an extraordinary amount of services available from the best firms for a reasonable amount."

The Airline Industry May Get a Little Smaller So It Can Get Bigger

BYLINE: By MATTHEW WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The next generation of airplanes will be bigger, faster, higher-flying and more comfortable.
But some will also be smaller and might fly at about the same altitude and speed and with the same comfort as airplanes have for the last 20 years. 
 Aviation, which enters its second century in 2003, is still far from a mature industry, and for the next decade it seems likely to move in two directions at once.
One of those is gigantism, a trend that has persisted through 40 years of the jet age, prompted by a belief in economies of scale. Analysts say, however, that it is nearly played out; the only new design still on the drawing board is the Airbus A3XX, which will have about 650 seats on two levels in one configuration and 550 seats, with beds and exercise rooms, in another.
In addition, the ubiquitous Boeing 747, which began flying in 1969 and has from 400 to 550 seats, no longer dominates the skies. The big markets, like the New York-to-London route, that traditionally support the big planes have been hit with competition from smaller planes, like 757's and 767's, flying less heavily traveled routes, say, Pittsburgh to Birmingham, England.
That is the other trend, the movement toward efficient smaller planes for smaller markets, and it might be hitting domestic routes as well; trips that once supported a flight or two a day by a full-sized jetliner that had 130 seats or so are now served by three or four flights of "regional jets" that carry 50 or 70 passengers. The strategy behind the big planes was to sell a few seats at top dollar and give away the rest at anything above cost since an empty seat gives an airline no revenue at all. But some analysts think more airlines will begin making a profit by leaving those seats on the ground and flying a smaller plane with passengers who pay higher fares, ignoring the other travelers, whom airline experts sometimes refer to, slightly condescendingly, as "backpackers."
"Sometimes, less is more," said George W. Hamlin, senior vice president of Global Aviation Associates, a consulting firm here, and an advocate of smaller planes. On a typical medium-haul domestic flight, he said, half the revenue comes from about 20 percent of the passengers, and an airline that could fly only that group would do very well indeed. Already, some new "regional jets" fly long hauls like Chicago to Baltimore; Cincinnati to Bangor, Me.; or Washington to Fort Myers, Fla.
At WP Securities, Wolfgang Demisch, a longtime expert on the economics of aircraft manufacturing, said that with regional jets, "one of the neat things when you have small airplanes that fly direct is you get increased passenger convenience, and you can probably get improved pricing for it."
"The customer," he said, "gets to save time and frequently can do in one jump what might otherwise take two or three."
He called it "the evolution away from mainframe flying, toward almost personal service-type flying."
Boeing rejects the idea that bigger is more costly. Doubling the number of seats does not come close to doubling costs, said Joseph W. Ozimek, Boeing's director for commercial airplane product marketing. "If you fill the airplane the day you bought it, you've bought the wrong airplane," he said. Besides, he said, thousands of airplanes would saturate the air traffic control system; eventually, planes will have to get bigger.
Boeing's approach is to build new big jets that are slightly less than gigantic; it hopes, for example, that the stretch version of its 777 that it is building will be the market's replacement for old 747's.
Big or small, some planes will have a lot more creature comforts. A variety of experts say that JetBlue Airways, a new line that will start operations early in 2000 from Kennedy International Airport in New York, may set the pace. Beginning with Airbus's 162-seat A320's, its planes will have 24-channel live satellite television at each seat. The planes will have a seat pitch, or space between seats, of 32 inches, an inch or two more than the average, and a width of 18.5 inches, an inch more than average. The overhead bins are 80 inches wide instead of 60, recognizing the penchant of business travelers for carrying their bags on board. The airline, which aims to serve markets that the big carriers have not served well, says bin space is about one-quarter greater than on a 737.
Boeing stresses that the 777 has slightly wider seats and aisles than its older planes. Seat pitch is an airline decision, not a decision of Airbus or Boeing, but some analysts see signs that the airlines are beginning to compete on that basis, reversing the trend of minimizing costs, and comforts, too, that began with deregulation in 1978.
The ability to build new and better planes presumes continued health for the industry. For the time being, traffic is galloping ahead, at 643 million passengers in this country last year (although many of them are counted twice as they change planes) and is expected to reach one billion by 2010; as a whole, the industry is profitable. But the government has not been good, historically, at predicting wars and fuel price increases, the two factors that can cut traffic.
But over all, in contrast to certain past decades, the future looks rather boring, a lot like the present. The idea of new supersonic transport planes is dead, at least for the next 5 to 10 years; airlines took options on 70 Concordes in the 1960's but eventually canceled all but 13 of them, and no one sees a market to build more in the near future. The plane is now a quarter-century old. Newer models may fly only marginally faster, say, 85 percent of the speed of sound instead of 80.
There are no futuristic designs, like giant flying-wing planes with no fuselage, on the drawing boards either. For the foreseeable future, passenger planes will have long, cylindrical fuselages sitting atop a single pair of wings, most with engines under the wings, a few with engines attached to the rear of the fuselage, the layouts that were established by the Boeing 720 and 707, which first flew in the early 1950's, and the 727, which entered service in 1965.
"There are no radical planes in the near future," said David Napier, the research director at the Aerospace Industries Association. "They're stretching planes, they're making slightly different models," he said of the airframe builders, "but they're not extreme."
Strikingly, only one plane now in design is not a derivative of something already flying, and that is Airbus's A3XX. (In the airplane construction business, the "X" designates a model whose design is not yet complete.) Airbus has said the plane will cost $11 billion to $12 billion to develop. Earlier this month, the board of the Airbus consortium reiterated that it anticipated that the plane would enter service in 2005 but it postponed several crucial decisions, including where the plane will be built. Boeing officials say Airbus is reducing its estimates for the size of the market for the jumbo airplane.
Darryl Jenkins, an aviation consultant, said, "the planes that we're going to be using for the next 30 years have already been designed, and most of them have been ordered. We basically know what the planes will look like out to 2030; they won't look any different from the ones we have now."

Key Forces for Business Success, Creativity and a Local Touch

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS

 BODY:
For five years now, a klatch of management scholars and forward-looking executives have met at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to ponder a question: What will be tomorrow's model for business success?
Their collective answer goes well beyond the usual suspects, the likes of Dell Computer, Amazon.com, Qualcomm or Priceline -- all commonly hailed as prototypes for the age of the Internet. Instead, this business academy with its dazzling virtuosity in technology seems at pains to reassert that technology is not enough. 
 "Success takes a balance of forces; technology is not always necessary and is almost never sufficient," said Michael S. Scott Morton, professor of management. Dr. Scott Morton has been co-director of M.I.T.'s initiative on Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century, a research project involving a score of scholars and engaging dozens of companies in its deliberations.
A specialist in corporate strategy, Dr. Scott Morton maintains there is less than meets the eye in the Internet land rush. He sees more activity than results from the celebrated Web start-ups. In the long run, he expects "the bigger and longer-lasting impacts" will come from established companies that successfully reinvent themselves in imaginative ways, using technology to enlarge their fundamental business vision and to support an inspired work force.
To be sure, this leaves a great variety of possibilities, and the roughly 200 executives and scholars who met in mid-November for a valedictory summing-up of the five-year inquiry heard a good many of them. Tomorrow's model company might be gigantic, or it might be tiny -- either possibility was seen as entirely consistent with the power of the Internet. Tomorrow's company might be in continuous flux, its operations put together and pulled apart like a Lego toy. The model enterprise might be acutely sensitive to its physical and human environment, or it might be lean and terribly mean, asking no loyalty and offering none.
But within the forest of possibilities, there seemed a consensus on several broad principles:
*Highly decentralized systems will be far more important than they are today. Not a soul took issue with that. A great many companies have concluded that if they are to move quickly and adroitly, as many decisions as possible should be made by those closest to the customer.
*Activities -- not organization charts -- will become the key building blocks in business. As outsourcing and alliances become even more common, basic functions like recruiting or training or sales promotion may be turned over to outside specialists. So product design, an activity, will remain essential, but not necessarily an in-house design department.
*Companies, large or small, will be both global and local. To compete effectively, global giants will require the local touch. And with the borderless Internet, even small businesses will reach customers around the world -- and face global competition, as well.
The M.I.T. covey's most celebrated member is Peter M. Senge, who wrote "The Fifth Discipline" a decade ago and touched off a corporate quest to create the "learning organization." Speaking by video hookup from Paris, Dr. Senge said he now expected "environmental sustainability" to become a cornerstone of corporate strategy. "Waste is an artifact of the industrial age," he declared. "Nature actually has no waste -- none."
One of Dr. Senge's models for tomorrow is Xerox, which designs new copiers for remanufacture, having discovered it can save money in building new copiers by reprocessing parts from old ones. Another is Interface Inc. of Atlanta, the nation's largest maker of commercial carpeting, which has made a signature commitment to "sustainability" through recycling and waste reduction. (Its Web site at www.interfaceinc.com is as lofty and luminous as a New Age greeting card: "More than just a carpet company, we represent peace of mind.")
The idea, one Interface executive wrote, is "to deliver better service and increased value, not more stuff." Its Terratex, Solenium and Deja Vu fabrics and flooring are made from recycled materials. Its ReEntry program reuses or recycles customers' old carpeting. "We guarantee your old carpet won't end up in a landfill, period."
In looking for companies with foresight and imagination, Dr. Scott Morton singled out Schneider National of Green Bay, Wis., the nation's largest full-load trucking company and a pioneer in using Qualcomm satellite technology to direct its fleet.
Schneider has transformed itself from a routine over-the-road hauler to a sophisticated carrier that provides an essential service in today's manufacturing economy. It provides "just in time" parts delivery, guaranteed, come hell or high water, for customers on the nationwide scale of General Motors.
Schneider has also expanded its conception of its business. Through subsidiaries, the company will design, install and run logistics systems for other companies, including owning and operating dedicated fleets. It buys and finances trucks for others, and it matches loads to available trucks for more than 1,000 carriers.
Dr. Scott Morton credits the creativity and courage of Donald J. Schneider, president and chief executive. Mr. Schneider, true to character, credits the company's 17,000 "talented associates."
Thomas W. Malone, a professor of information systems and Dr. Scott Morton's co-director, veered from the more traditional models of his two colleagues and expressed a vision that is drenched in the power of the Internet. But he was less taken with the current fervor over e-commerce than with what he saw as a more profound change, a coming golden age for "microenterprises."
As the communication costs fall to next to nothing, "essentially everyone" can be well enough informed to make good decisions, he said. That power will be a boon to the highly motivated, the creative, the innovative. He expects a vast Internet marketplace in business services to take shape, enabling the smallest businesses to rent the talents and capabilities to compete with the largest companies. Large portions of the business economy will consist of very small enterprises, as few as one to 10 talented people, and that sector will take on the radically decentralized character of the Internet.
Dr. Malone's prototype enterprise is TopsyTail, a tiny Dallas-based company founded a decade ago to produce a plastic hair-styling tool. Relying on a score of vendors, from design firms to injection molders through fulfillment houses, TopsyTail has produced more than $100 million in sales at retail with only three employees (a chief financial officer, a marketing director and a general assistant). Its latest product is a collapsible foam-lined cowboy hat to prevent "hat hair and hot heads."
Its founder, Tomima Edmark, who once sold large systems for I.B.M., says she turned to extreme outsourcing by hunch and by necessity. She champions the technique as an inexpensive, fleet-footed way to bring out a product. "I always felt it would work," she said in an interview, "I needed to ramp up quickly, and I didn't have much money."
Ms. Edmark assembled her network of TopsyTail vendors the old-fashioned way -- by phone, personal contact and trial and error. But her newest venture is more purely Internet: a Web store to sell brands of women's underwear online, starting in February. Outsourced as usual, the site is being built by a New Jersey webmaster.

Out of the Past, The Click and Clack Of Low Technology

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Phonograph records, flypaper, typewriters, windup watches, carbon paper. They are products that most people of a certain age grew up with but that have largely vanished, usually with little notice, from everyday life. Something presumably better has taken their place.
But while they are forgotten by many, they are not gone. 
 At least not entirely. These venerable products, though long past their heyday, live on in tiny niches of the giant United States economy. Indeed, unlike, say, rotary telephones, which linger in numbers large enough to command special treatment by answering machines but are no longer placed in service, they are still produced.
Yes, on the eve of the 21st century there are Americans who go to work each morning to make typewriters -- not, of course, the type your father used in college but the genuine article nonetheless. Some of these machines -- descendants of the first practical typewriters marketed in 1874 by E. Remington & Sons, a gunsmith in Ilion, N.Y. -- find their way to technophobes or slaves to habit, others to consumers who find them irreplaceable for certain tasks.
"We dominate a shrinking market," said Jim Joseph, a spokesman for Lexmark International, a spinoff in Lexington, Ky., from the International Business Machines Corporation that is the nation's last remaining typewriter manufacturer. But while its typewriter business is so small that it does not even rate a mention in the annual report, an undisclosed number of customers fork over $695 for its Wheelwriter 1000 for home and classroom use, or $1,845 for its top-of-the-line Wheelwriter 7000.
For a while, according to Mr. Joseph, typewriters were in persistent demand for addressing envelopes, but the word processor and computer have now largely usurped this function, leaving multipart forms -- themselves under technological siege -- one of the few remaining efficient applications.
But typewriter traditionalists do not need gobs of money as long as they are content with a foreign make, like the $189.95 portable made by Olivetti S.p.A., prominently on display just inside Hammacher Schlemmer's store on East 57th Street and advertised in its catalog. This one, made in Italy, is billed as an "updated classic" boasting automatic paragraph indentation and other refinements.
"There's a lot of people who wouldn't convert" to computerized ways to write, said Simone Williams, a sales clerk.
A company spokeswoman, Sabrina Balthazar, said Hammacher sells dozens of Olivettis each day through its three stores and by catalog and Web site, enough demand to justify stocking them year-round rather than just at Christmas. While some of this year's sales appear to be related to Year 2000 fears of crashing word processors, she added, "We have no plans to stop."
Then there's flypaper, created by a German baker in 1861 who grew tired of shooing insects attacking his strudel, and sometimes still found on America's patios.
"That's still a common item," said Dale Garbutt, a salesman at Barson Hardware, also in Midtown Manhattan, explaining that today's electronic bug-zappers are not fully up to the task. "You'd never catch a mosquito" with them, he said, while the traditional, though unsightly, stuff that results in a lingering death is said to work on all kinds of winged pests.
Christine Morrello, office manager at the Walco-Linck Company, a Rockland County, N.Y., packager of flypaper mostly from Korea, said it still seemed to be popular with people who run horse farms and waterfront restaurants and that on occasion someone will inquire about shipping an order to relatives in South America.
As for mechanical watches, they are actually in the midst of a comeback, even though the Timex Corporation, the nation's No. 1 watch producer, closed its last factory making them, in Waterbury, Conn., three years ago.
Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau, a leading retailer of luxury watches, said sales of mechanical watches began to pick up in the mid-80's, largely coinciding with stock market gains.
The revival also comes in the face of the dispiriting fact that with few if any exceptions, the cheapest of modern quartz watches will keep better time than the most expensive of windups.
Buyers clearly have more than exactitude in mind when buying mechanical watches, however; most are imported from Geneva and other French-speaking parts of Switzerland and are quite expensive, with prices starting at several hundred dollars. One David Yurman mechanical design -- featuring a stainless steel and sterling silver pave diamond case with diamond bezel and sapphire cabochon crown, silver dial and diamond markers -- retails for $14,000 at Tourneau.
Another presumed casualty of the age is carbon paper, which turns out to be as persistent in the market as it is in smearing clothing or hands. A few thousand tons are still produced for purposes ranging from business forms -- it is especially valued in cold climates where its carbonless successor can fail -- to dress patterns to impressions of teeth, for use in in dental offices. Frye Tech of Boca Raton, Fla., has absorbed competitors and is now the biggest maker.
Among the most unlikely of the survivors, perhaps, is the vinyl phonograph record, which, despite the fact that it requires a similarly superseded mechanism to play, remains in demand, especially among disc jockeys.
"Companies make them pretty much to sell to the D.J.'s," said Michael Davis, manager of Academy Records & CD's off lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. "They like to play vinyl because they manipulate the turntable" to pinpoint certain passages. D.J.'s and others also use the old-fashioned record -- only 33 r.p.m.'s are thought to be still manufactured -- to create new musical blends, like acid jazz.
Moreover, contended Blake Lindberg, an Academy salesman, audiophiles often prefer vinyl, still made by companies like Blue Note Records and Analog Productions, to its audiotape and CD successors for sheer quality.
"It's a lot warmer sound," he said. "It's so much fuller. I can hear a lot more."
Still, sales of vinyl records peaked more than 20 years ago, at 344 million units in 1977, and will total only an estimated 2.8 million this year, according to the Record Industry Association of America. Records now account for only one-half of 1 percent of the market for new music, and a whole generation has grown up having never even seen one.
This means they will probably have no clue when the quizmaster asks that standby trivia question from Mom's generation:
How many grooves are there on a record?
Answer: two (one on each side).

Global Economy Dances to Political Tune

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A decade ago, it would have been hard to imagine that at the end of the century the world economy would mix unparalleled American ascendancy with such pervasive global anxiety, or that free-marketeers would be celebrating the triumph of market capitalism while so many around the globe questioned the cost of its victory.
After all, as 1989 came to a close it looked like the end of this century and most of the next would belong to Japan and its neighbors. Instead, the 1990's proved to be Japan's lost decade, and a buoyant Asia's rude awakening about the laws of economic gravity. 
 In 1989, the Berlin Wall had just fallen, and the wrenching economic and political adjustments to freer markets that would follow were just beginning. In retrospect, the predictions about the contours of those adjustments missed the mark: Nations like Poland made the shift much faster than expected, but the early enthusiasm about the speed of Russia's move to a market economy proved wildly optimistic. Instead, 10 years later, the West's billions of aid dollars intended to bolster capitalism in its own image seem to have been largely wasted, though it is unclear that a different strategy would have worked any better.
And who a decade ago could have anticipated the stresses of globalization? How it would tear up the insides of the Nissan worker who told a Japanese newspaper recently that for most of his life he had naively believed that "lifetime employment meant you had a job for life?" Or how a small-town American investor whose closest encounter with Thailand before 1997 had been seeing the film "The King and I" could find her life roiled by a previously unknown relationship between the health of her pension fund and the inability of Thailand's finance ministry to monitor its banks' lending portfolios?
Finally, who would have imagined that in the last weeks of the fading millennium, with American unemployment at record lows and prosperity at record highs, the brewing anxieties of a decade of global change could spill out into a wild scene on the streets of Seattle? Or that seemingly everyone with a grievance about capitalism's worst excesses would seize the opportunity to vent anger at the World Trade Organization, a group most Americans were only vaguely aware existed before the first week of December?
Of course, none of this has evoked much humility in the millennial forecasting business. In the past few months, it seems as if prognosticators worldwide have been turning out impressive-looking charts plotting the life expectancy of the American expansion, or the speed of the Asian recovery, or the future of the euro. (Each such forecaster might find useful a copy of the Congressional Budget Office's 1996 projections for what the budget deficit would look like today, which only missed by about $305 billion.)
The lesson of the 1990's, at home and abroad, is that global politics and global economic fortunes are not only inseparable, but each makes the other almost impossible to predict.
Global economic tensions, however, are easier to scope out than global economic outcomes. And tensions abound, all set to play out over the next few years. Here are a few:
Seattle was just the start. Over the next five years, the backlash against globalization will worsen.
Sure, the protestors who helped derail the world trade talks in late November and early December could not agree among themselves whether to order a latte or a cappuccino. And it is highly unlikely that the extremists in Seattle, those who think the trade organization's officials thunder around in black helicopters, will move to the forefront of the debate. But the mainstream groups that made themselves heard -- the labor unions and the environmentalists, the Ralph Nader followers and those fearful of a loss of national sovereignty -- are starting to articulate their worries far more effectively than ever before. And they have a lot of allies around the world.
Almost any place one lands these days -- Tokyo or Bombay or Brussels -- the complaint is the same: the United States is trying to rig the global trading system to benefit its own, and its own want to own the world. Of course, the Clinton administration wants the Internet to be tariff-free because the biggest beneficiaries will be Microsoft and America Online and the American merchants who are kings of the Web. Of course, there is nothing new in such complaints: Europe has been fretting about American multinationals since the 1960's. But America's emergence as the world's unchallenged military and economic power, and its role as the largest exporter of popular culture, have ignited a new level of passion.
"The question we get from the developing world is, 'What's in this for us?' " Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said as she nursed the wounds of Seattle. "They want to reopen many of the market liberalizations of the past decade, and get more time or a better deal. We hear it every week."
Moreover, the political impetus to use trade to solve the world's other ills seems likely to accelerate. Already the same international community that insisted in 1998 the world would end if Russia were not bailed out is pressing to cut off the I.M.F.'s lending to Moscow to protest Russian tactics in Chechnya. Such choices -- between our moral and political imperatives and our economic sensibilities -- are getting harder every year, around the world. And the drive to link core labor standards and environmental standards to trade agreements will heighten the tension, pitting industrial democracies against developing nations that feel certain the system is being rigged to make it harder for them to get on the road to prosperity by raising exports.
Maybe none of this will ultimately affect global trade, which has risen fifteenfold since 1950. But it could well make international economics the new battlefield.
The digital divide around the world will get a lot worse before it gets any better.
The past five years have seen a sharp three-way split among the players in the global economy. The United States leads the way in the overconnected sweepstakes: Its penetration of personal computers, cell phones and Internet access is at or near the top of the charts, fueling the new economy, if one exists. Europe follows closely, with Japan belatedly kicking into e-gear.
But many countries in the world are still struggling with getting hard-wired phones into houses. They have pockets of high-technology skills, but no infrastructure.
And then comes James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, with the uncomfortable reminder that half the world's six billion people today live on less than $2 a day. Building digital networks is not likely to be their first priority.
On the one hand, this is an enormous economic opportunity; as e-commerce spreads it can insert the poorest nations into the global economy at a faster pace than ever before. But it seems just as likely that the new economy will speed the concentration of wealth in the hands of the richest nations, leaving others farther behind. And even within the wealthiest nations, the access of minorities and the poor to computers and the Internet is lagging greatly, suggesting that the global divide may become increasingly visible at home, too.
Japan is coming back, and China is speeding its transition to a market economy. But scratch beneath the surface and you discover nasty, unresolved battles that will continue for years.
Japan and China are the big bets of the next five years, and the riskiest.
No question there is good news at last from Japan. Foreign investors are finally snapping up Japanese assets and taking the lead (and the blame) in paring down bloated companies and getting rid of excess workers. Consumers are gradually spending again. The world's second-largest economy may soon start acting like it wants to hold on to that standing.
But as always in Japan, just as the news gets better, the political will begins to falter. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, facing re-election, is suddenly pulling back from the toughest economic reforms. "Basically, I do support restructuring," he told the Far Eastern Economic Review recently, "but not the kind of drastic restructuring common in the U.S. and Europe." Translation: No more layoffs on my watch. Still, Japanese cognoscenti whisper reassuringly that the prime minister should be ignored: Japan Inc. is now taking its marching orders from the global marketplace, even though politicians cannot admit that the old Japanese model is dead.
That is hard to believe. The next 5 or 10 years will be a constant battle between market reformers and government interventionists. If the market reformers win, it will be largely because the government has run out of cash to keep priming the pump. But the rest of the world is watching, because if Japan can resist American-style capitalism, there is hope they can, too.
China is an even more complex case. Its agreement to make vast openings in its market in return for entry into the World Trade Organization is the start of a battle, not the end of one. It will pit entrenched industries that want to fight the opening against government officials, led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who contend that only competition will whip China's most inefficient industries into shape. But it will also pit the government against itself. Mr. Zhu is betting that the Communist party can open the economy without losing control over the political system. After all, Singapore did. But Singapore is a very, very small place.
The United States Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, told the Trilateral Commission early in the year that the fate of the world economy depended on the fate of the American economy, that the fate of the American economy depended on the fate of the stock market and that the fate of the American stock market depended on a small handful of stocks that are trading at remarkable premiums.
He was just being flip, right?
Mr. Summers said soon after his comments were reported that he had been speaking off the record; that his view, as conveyed by people at the meeting, was greatly oversimplified, and that, as treasury secretary, he did not speculate about markets.
Even if Mr. Summers's view was oversimplified, he is clearly worried that some market segments have outpaced the strong United States economic fundamentals, like low unemployment, high productivity and continued growth, that he is always talking about. But listen to him carefully, and it seems as if the new big risk to the global economy may actually be close to home.

CENTURY HIGHLIGHTS

 BODY:

1919: A WARNING FROM KEYNES
In "The Economic Consequences of the Peace," John Maynard Keynes warned of the disaster that would follow from forcing Germany to pay huge reparations to Britain and France, which would then be expected to repay huge American loans. Politicians ignored him, but they shouldn't have.
 
1923: WHEELBARROWS OF CASH
Inflation of a type never seen in an industrialized country hit Germany. In little more than a year, a dollar's exchange rate went from 2,000 marks to 4.2 trillion marks. Wheelbarrows of cash were needed to buy a loaf of bread.
 
1931: BYE, BYE GOLD
Britain tried to erase wartime inflation in 1925 by returning to the gold standard at the pound's prewar value, but that created an overvalued currency that damaged its trade position. When the Depression arrived, it abandoned the gold standard and devalued the pound.
 
1944: BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM
Meeting at a New Hampshire resort, world leaders mapped out the postwar monetary system that anchored other currencies to the dollar, and the dollar to gold. Urged by Lord Keynes, the World Bank was also created.
 
1964: EURODOLLARS CREATED
Worried about a declining balance of international payments, the United States enacted an Interest Equalization Tax. That led to the Eurodollar market, which allowed companies to circumvent American tax laws.
 
1971: FLOATING CURRENCIES
President Richard M. Nixon, fearful that foreign central banks might convert dollars to gold, removed the last vestige of the dollar's linkage to gold, ending the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and allowing currencies to float.
 
1973: THE OIL RECESSION
Furious over American aid to Israel in the Arab-Israeli war, Arab oil producers imposed a boycott of oil shipments and discovered they had more market power than they dreamed. Oil prices soared, and severe recessions arrived in many countries.
 
1982: THIRD WORLD DEBT CRISIS
Many nations became heavily indebted in the 1970's. In the early 1980's, Mexico was unable to refinance its debt, and that set off a crisis that affected most of Latin America and for a time damaged the health of big bank lenders.
 
1989: JAPAN PEAKS
Japan was the wonder of the world in the 1980's. But then stock and land price bubbles burst, and the nation entered a long period of retrenchment.
 
1997: THAI TRAUMA
Thailand became the first Asian "tiger" to suffer a currency collapse, leaving its financial system in tatters. South Korea and Indonesia followed.
 
1998: RUSSIA DEFAULTS
Even when Russia could not find rubles to pay its miners, foreign investors were willing to lend dollars. When Russia defaulted on some loans, it briefly traumatized investors worldwide.
 
1999: EUROPEAN CURRENCY
Eleven European countries, from Italy to Finland, joined their currencies into one, the euro. In its first year, the euro became an important unit of trade and investment but lost value against the dollar.
 
1999: UPRISING OVER TRADE
President Clinton hoped to showcase American leadership on free trade, but protesters disrupted the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, charging that W.T.O. rulings undermined health, labor and environmental protections around the world.

European Union's Tough but Relentless Drive to Expand

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Europe enters the new year and the new millennium on a mission of staggering scale: an expansion of the European Union by 13 countries and some 170 million people.
In the decade since Communism collapsed, the European Union has made huge progress toward becoming a truly single market. Almost all trade barriers among its 15 member nations have been abolished. Citizens of any member country can live and work in any other. At the start of this year, 11 of the 15 countries adopted the euro as a common currency. 
 But integration has not been easy. France and Germany feuded endlessly during negotiations over the euro, which still has not been adopted by Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece. The new currency slumped relentlessly vis-a-vis the United States dollar, declining from $1.18 after its introduction on Jan. 4 to just above parity with the dollar by mid-December.
As a result of the transparency of the euro, as well as the elimination of the trade barriers, price competition within Europe has become brutal. And hostile corporate takeovers, until recently almost unthinkable outside Britain, have become common in France, Italy and Germany.
The path ahead could be even more grueling now as the union juggles issues of expanding membership.
Six countries -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Slovenia and Estonia -- are already in membership negotiations with the European Union, and some could be admitted as early as 2003.
Six other wildly diverse countries are about to start negotiations, a process likely to last at least a decade. These countries are: the central European nations of Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania; the tiny Baltic nations of Latvia and Lithuania, and the island nation of Malta.
But the biggest breakthrough was Turkey, which the European Union invited earlier this month to become a candidate for membership. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, while acknowledging that difficulties lay ahead, said, "The acceptance of our candidacy on equal terms is a great success for Turkey."
The country has been a part of the NATO military alliance for years but was repeatedly shunned by the European Union because of its territorial feud with Greece and its human rights record.
Turkey, with 63 million people, still faces a long path. Membership negotiations will not begin until it resolves its disputes with Greece, and to become a member, it must also abandon the death penalty, even as a Turkish court is seeking to impose it on the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the project that would expand the union beyond its current members; besides Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece and Sweden, they are Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. If all 13 countries under discussion become members, the European Union would constitute the world's biggest and most diversified free trade zone.
Europe's common market would encompass nearly 500 million people and extend to the borders of Russia. It would unite Europe's wealthiest nations with some of its poorest. It would bring jolting new competition to farmers in both Western and Central Europe.
And even if some nations do not make the cut -- and it would be years before any adopted the euro -- the idea of "Europe" is likely to be stretched in strange ways.
Poland, with 40 million people and a long history with the West, is likely to be one of the first countries to become a new member.
Other front-runners include Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation that was part of the Soviet Union, and Slovenia, a prosperous Adriatic enclave that managed to break away from Yugoslavia.
In principle, the deciding issues are whether a country has adopted the institutions and laws to support both democracy and an open market economy.
In practice, the aspiring members will have to adopt a panoply of detailed laws governing trade, social issues and democratic institutions. That is often easier for smaller countries, which explains why a comparatively obscure nation like Slovenia, with two million people, may well be among the first new members.
The European Union's requirements, broken down into 32 "chapters," include laws protecting investors and creditors; environmental regulations; timetables for closing Soviet-era nuclear plants, and the reduction of agricultural subsidies. To be eligible many countries must still establish the courts and regulatory agencies needed to enforce the rule of law in a credible fashion.
There is a clear financial impact from all this. Countries on the fast track generally pay lower interest rates when they sell bonds on the international market because foreign investors perceive those countries as safer. Indeed, bond investors are already speculating on which countries will be allowed to adopt the euro as their currency.
The lure of Europe's single market has also sped the transition of more statist and Stalinist regimes toward market economics. Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria have all elected Western-style politicians in the last several years, and all have pushed heavily to impose the changes required for admission to the union.
A report by the European Commission in October concluded that Bulgaria had made big strides toward opening its markets, including those in telecommunications and media, as well as in setting up an effective civil service and court system. Romania and Slovakia, pariahs just three years ago, are now winning praise as well.
To be sure, the acceleration of market-oriented changes has increased political tension. Poland has been one of Central Europe's major success stories. By sticking firmly to a course of privatization and expanded trade with Western Europe, Poland was barely grazed by last year's economic collapse in Russia.
Yet anxiety about the European Union is rising sharply, mainly among Poland's farmers, coal miners and shipyard workers who stand to lose from reduced government subsidies and heightened competition. Recent surveys indicate that support for membership in the European Union has slipped to about 55 percent of the Polish population today from 80 percent in 1990.
Many Poles also fear that Germans will buy their land as soon as they get the chance. In negotiations with the European Union earlier this year, the Polish Government demanded that foreign land purchases be restricted for 18 years after the nation joined the union.
The anxiety flows in both directions. Germany, which borders Poland and the Czech Republic and has high unemployment, is pushing for long "transition periods" before Central European workers receive full rights to work in the West.
In a departure from its past approach, the European Union is now pursuing "flexible" targets for admitting nations, allowing countries to join when they are ready, rather than in big waves.
Most experts believe that expansion is all but inevitable. More than two-thirds of exports from Poland and Hungary already go to the European Union, as do more than half the exports from most other formerly Communist "candidate" countries.
And although the embrace of market economics is generally weaker the farther east one travels, all the candidate countries seem to be shifting toward such policies.
"Both sides profit from enlargement," said Andreas Polkowski, an economic analyst at the Hamburg Institute for Economic Research. "Under the pressure of globalization, these countries have to change regardless of whether they enter the European Union. Those that want to become members have merely accelerated the process."

Asia Watchers Now Looking At Economies of U.S. and Japan

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Southeast Asia's battered economies have bounced back this year, and the most serious concern in the year 2000, economists say, will not be the region's enduring banking mess but the possibility that things could unexpectedly turn ugly in the United States or Japan.
Demand for exports -- together with high personal savings, low interest rates and government deficit spending -- have restored stable economic growth to the region. To be sure, many of the politically painful prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund and other foreign diagnosticians have been rejected, leaving the region's financial system nearly paralyzed. 
 Whether the region's growth continues, economists say, depends largely on whether Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve System, can continue to steer the American economy in for a soft landing and whether the Japanese government can preserve its own flickering economic recovery. The answer to both questions, most economists predict, is yes.
"It's very hard to tell a negative story," said David Fernandez, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company.
This happy ending to Asia's financial crisis may confound those expecting a clear-cut victory of free markets over crony capitalism, but, it appears, good things can happen to bad economies, if they are small, developing and populated by savers.
This is the tale being told in hindsight: A tsunami of foreign loans and investment set the stage for the 1997-98 financial crisis, swamping a region that had yet to develop the legal and regulatory framework needed to ensure that the money was spent wisely. The wave of funds lifted the region's manufacturing capacity to excess, spilled over into speculative real estate bets and left companies swimming in debt.
When anxious investors pulled the plug in Thailand in mid-1997, local currencies plunged, and all those overseas loans became too expensive for companies or even countries to pay. The I.M.F. came to the rescue and, seeing a Latin America-style situation of overheated economies and out-of-control debt, told the victims to raise interest rates and rein in spending.
What the I.M.F. appears to have overlooked was that, unlike Latin Americans, Asians are big savers. So are their governments: surpluses are common. With austerity, currencies stopped falling, but as interest rates spiraled upward, so did deposit rates and loan payments. Savers saved, debtors defaulted, and banks went under even faster than before.
Reversing course, governments began pushing interest rates down and spending themselves into deficits. With scant demand for loans, banks invested their depositors' money in stocks, fueling a rally that helped take pressure off debtors by raising the value of their assets. Meanwhile, heavy demand for Asian exports, especially electronics, kept money flowing in.
Among the results: current account surpluses, rising credit ratings, and economies that are expected to grow 5 percent on average in 2000, and 5 percent to 6 percent in 2001. "It's a natural bounce," said William Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch. Even Indonesia is emerging from recession, though only just, with a new government lending the kind of stability that could lure back foreign investment.
With exports playing such an important role, however, much depends on what happens outside the region. "If there's a recession in the U.S., all bets are off for Southeast Asia," Manu Bhaskaran, economist with SG Securities, told the World Economic Forum here in October.
Others say Japan's feeble recovery depends too heavily on government spending, posing another threat to Asian exports. "At some point, sooner rather than later, the Japanese government will have to rein in expenditure," Kenneth Pinkes, chief credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, told the forum.
Exports are only a stopgap, however. Ultimately, economists say, Southeast Asia will need to rely on its own consumers to drive growth. While households have survived the crisis in much better shape than companies, and private spending appears to be reviving, consumers will be reluctant to spend more until they are more confident that their lot has improved.
Standing in the way, investors and economists say, is the mire of bad debts preventing Asia's banks from lending to growing companies. While the crisis rendered many debtors unable to pay, the biggest obstacles now, economists say, are "strategic" loan defaults. Borrowers have the money but withhold payment to squeeze a deal from their bankers. Weak bankruptcy laws and old-boy networks shelter big, politically powerful debtors.
Consequently, 45 percent of all loans by Thai banks are still nonperforming. Although the number is falling, the central bank is concerned that banks are reducing their bad-loan portfolios largely by agreeing to defer payments and lower interest rates.
In Indonesia, government efforts to revive the banking sector have foundered over a political corruption scandal involving efforts to refinance one ailing commercial bank. In the meantime, not only are billions of dollars in interbank claims frozen, so is at least $38 billion in assets the government needs to sell to pay for its bank bailout.
Consultants and foreign investors complain they have seen little constructive change at all in Malaysia's financial system, which fended off the I.M.F. and pressure for change by locking in its exchange rate and putting controls on the withdrawal of capital, then riding along with the region's recovery. The economy is growing, but investors are still leery of a country that seems determined not to join the increasingly free-flowing global market for capital.
"We're not seeing enough reform," said J. Mark Mobius, president of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund. "We'd like to see investors, particularly foreign investors, treated more fairly."
Some economists contend that such complaints are typical of foreign investors eager to snatch up assets on the cheap, as well as of free-market absolutists who want to see wholesale change in government officials.
"For a lot of people, restructuring means seeing lots of bodies in the streets, and that's just not part of the social contract in these places," said Mr. Fernandez at J. P. Morgan.
It is not fair to say that Asia is not changing, such economists say. The crisis set into motion an inexorable process of change that has already brought the end of a 34-year-old regime in Indonesia and a new Constitution in Thailand.
Others argue that the advent of the information age will make it imperative that Asia catch up to address the increasing power of the small, mobile investor. In Asia, for example, the crisis taught the dangers of overly relying on banks for dispensing credit and highlighted the need for a dynamic market for corporate bonds.
Developing one will require overhauling tax structures and encouraging the growth of derivatives, economists say, not to mention increasing transparency in corporate dealings. So far, Asia has been able to finance its recovery domestically, but foreign investors warn that in the Internet age, even domestic capital can emigrate at the push of a button.
Economists predict that greed will quickly wear down foreign investors' truculence. The region still offers the best possible returns, they say, change or no change. Overseas capital will be back, they say, and Southeast Asia's tiger economies will burn, not as brightly as before the crisis, but brightly nonetheless.

After a Hard Year, Latin America Looks for Better Times

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
On the theory that things cannot get much worse, Latin America is looking to the start of the new decade with anticipation. The last year has been a difficult one, more onerous even than the crisis that followed the Mexican meltdown starting in December 1994: It began with a currency collapse in Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with the numbers now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's large economies struggling to emerge from recession.
"This has been a really lousy year, especially for South America," said Ricardo Hausmann, chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank, the lending agency based in Washington. "We have seen traumatic declines in growth rates for all of Latin America, the result of a collapse both of international capital flows and commodity prices." 
 Indeed, with the exception of oil, prices paid for the primary products that remain the backbone of the continent's exports, notably copper and coffee, dropped to near-record lows in 1999 before recovering slightly at the end of the year. And even with the price of oil climbing -- from less than $7 a barrel for Venezuelan crude in February to more than $23 currently -- the Venezuelan and Ecuadorean economies are expected to have contracted by more than 5 percent, a markedly worse performance than in hard-hit countries not dependent on oil, like Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. Consequently, Latin American governments have faced an increased need to turn to external financing to cover yawning current-account deficits, at the same time that direct investors and lenders have been pulling back from the region.
According to the Inter-American Development Bank, capital flows into Latin America have fallen to $57 billion in 1999, slightly more than half the record $107 billion in 1997. Most of the money that is arriving has gone to the region's two giants: Brazil, which expects to close the year with $25 billion in direct investment, and Mexico.
"Though the catastrophe initially foreseen during the Brazilian crisis in January has not occurred, overall capital flows have been for lesser amounts, more irregular, more costly and for shorter terms," said Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, secretary general of the Economic Commission for Latin America, a United Nations organization based in Santiago, Chile, and known in Spanish as Cepal. "The situation is clearly not yet normalized."
There have been bright spots in this generally dismal picture. During 1999, Mexico grew at about a 4 percent clip, slightly less than 1998's rate but a standout by regional standards, and the Dominican Republic and countries of Central America also registered positive numbers. Not by coincidence, all those economies are more closely linked to the United States -- through the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico's case and a thriving maquila, or assembly, sector in the others -- than their South American counterparts.
"Mexico was the star performer this year and is likely to repeat that role next year, but it has to be considered a special case," said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, director of the Center for the World Economy at the Getulio Vargas Foundation here, Brazil's leading economic research center. "They have corrected some of the serious problems from 1995, and they have also benefited from navigating in the wake of the incredible expansion of the American economy."
Signs are emerging that the worst may be past for South America. Most forecasts for the coming year are predicting combined growth of at least 3 percent, led by increased demand for Latin American commodities and manufactured goods in Europe and East Asia. Inflation has generally been contained, despite pressure on exchange rates, which in the case of Brazil, Chile and Colombia have been made more flexible, and interest rates are dropping.
"I'm very optimistic about 2000 for Latin America, though it is important to stress that what we are going to be seeing is a recovery, not a full-blown expansion," said Walter Molano, director of research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. "The fall has been broken, portfolio inflows should pick up very strongly again next year, and we may see a real expansion begin by 2001."
As always, much depends on Brazil, which has endured two consecutive years of stagnation. Just as Germany is the locomotive for the European Union, Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the world, is the motor for South America, especially for its neighbors and partners in Mercosur, the customs union that includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia and Chile as associate members.
"If market sentiment toward Latin American countries improves and Brazil's competitiveness gains are preserved," a report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded, "strengthening exports, declining interest rates and a payoff from structural reforms undertaken over the past year will underpin a return to positive growth next year and provide impetus for rising expansion in 2001."
For all that to come to fruition, though, regional commerce needs to pick up again. After expanding markedly throughout the first half of the decade, thanks to the emergence of Mercosur and the Andean Pact, trade within South America dipped about 30 percent in 1999, according to Cepal's calculations, as countries sought to contain their imports.
Furthermore, given the Clinton administration's inability to gain sufficient support in Congress to liberalize trade and the fact that an election year is starting in the United States, the 2005 deadline for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas that would stretch from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego seems an increasingly difficult objective. As a result, Latin America's search for alternatives outside the hemisphere seems to be accelerating, and is expected to intensify as a result of the recent failure in Seattle.
Mexico, for instance, has just signed a free trade agreement with the European Union, which has also opened similar talks with Mercosur. "Countries are all of a sudden realizing they need to compete on a global, as opposed to regional, scale," Mr. Molano said. "This is actually healthy because it is what they should have been doing all along."
The political situation throughout the region remains imponderable. After a decade of belt-tightening, voters are demanding results for their sacrifices, and to express their growing impatience and dissatisfaction have elected people like Hugo Chavez, the former paratrooper and coup leader who is now president of Venezuela, or voted heavily for more traditional leftists like Tabare Vazquez of Uruguay or Ricardo Lagos of Chile.
"Chavez is not an aberration" but the harbinger of "a revisionist movement such as we saw earlier in Eastern Europe," warned Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor program at the University of Miami. "Neoliberal reform takes no prisoners, and a lot of these governments have failed to provide a safety net or focus on the tax and regulatory policies necessary to make free market development work and target allocations to those in need."
The region needs more capitalism or opening of markets, he maintains. For that reason, he and other specialists emphasize, Latin American governments need to move ahead on the so-called second generation structural changes that they may be tempted to postpone in the face of political doubts: in tax rates and collections, regulatory policies and accountability in revenue-sharing with states.
"The process of recovery within the region is going to continue to depend on new types of institutional reform," Mr. Langoni, a former president of the Brazilian central bank, said. Indeed, he argues, one reason Brazil has proved so resilient in bouncing back from January's 40 percent currency devaluation, compared to the past, is that "the opening of the economy, with the lowering of tariff rates and the elimination of indexation measures, has helped greatly in absorbing the impact of these exchange-rate crises."
Still, to a larger extent than in advanced industrial regions, Latin America may not be fully the master of its own fate. As the fallout from crises in East Asia and Eastern Europe in recent years has shown, all that would be needed to erase many of the gains expected in 2000 is the appearance of new problems in, say, Indonesia and renewed skittishness among investors.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: MARKETS & INVESTING;
Stocks Forecast Good but Worries Exist

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The upward march of the stock market indexes has become so inexorable in recent years that most strategists no longer weigh whether the market will rise next year. Instead, they speculate on just how much higher it will go.
Ordinarily, this might be cause for alarm since consensus views on stock prices have, in the past, been a harbinger of a major move in the opposite direction. But, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 22 percent so far this year and the Nasdaq index up a blistering 71 percent, these are no ordinary stock market times. Indeed, just as countless investors have fared quite well disregarding traditional measures of valuing a stock based on earnings or cash flow, the fact that many bears seem to have left may not signal anything meaningful either. 
 What market strategists are discussing now is the array of concerns that the stock indexes will shrug off in 2000 as they make their northward climb. The bears may have been burned as the Nasdaq sprinted ahead on the strength of hot technology stocks, but the famed wall of worry still stands.
As usual, there are the wild cards, events strategists point to as possibly upsetting the market. But while some believe that stocks may undergo some turmoil in the first half of the year, maybe even a decline of 10 percent, most strategists are remarkably upbeat about where the major indexes will be at the end of the new century's first year.
"The conditions that lead to significant bear markets are continually accelerating inflation and interest rates, pressure on profit margins and possibly a profit recession," said Christine A. Callies, chief United States market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "And we think the odds are very low of that until sometime in 2002 at the earliest. Really, all we need to start a new bull market that continues for many months is lower interest rates. But we don't see that either, so we think the market is going to churn."
Ms. Callies predicts the agitation will be more up than down, however, because she expects both the economy and corporate profits to be strong in 2000. And as profit momentum rotates through different areas of the market, she expects that a broader group of stocks may respond positively.
Another point of agreement among analysts is that next year, even more than the last, all investors' eyes will be on the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. That is because the Fed has been in a rate-raising mood lately, and investors will be on the lookout for any marked change in this stance.
"This is probably going to be the most difficult year for the Federal Reserve, which will determine the course of the market," said Alan W. Kral, vice president at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen, a money management firm in New York. "We've had a rip-roaring strong equity market built on the back of one of the strongest real economic moves in decades, but there are a number of warning signs out there that, if the Fed chooses to address, could result in some problems."
If, for example, the economy comes in as hot in the first quarter as it has in recent months, the Fed might raise rates again in February, and more drastically, to try to cool things down. Similarly, if any of the closely watched economic data revives inflation fears, rates could ratchet up even without a move by the central bank.
Making this coming year even trickier for the Fed is the fact that any move it feels compelled to make will be politically charged since it is an election year. Moreover, Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman will be up this summer, so if he wants to be renominated, he must please his boss as well as do the right thing.
Promises by leading presidential candidates in the months ahead of the election could also disturb the market. James E. Moltz, vice chairman of International Strategy and Investment, an investment research firm in New York, said: "There are battle lines being drawn on the fiscal front which are very important because we have an economy that is admittedly stretched. If we get into a situation where candidates promise significant expenditures or tax cuts, you run the risk of aggravating inflation not in the year 2000 but further ahead."
James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, unlike most strategists, predicts that the economy will slow in 2000 because of the Fed's recent tightening. As a result, he forecasts that interest rates will fall in mid-year and that the market will respond with gains as it did in 1995. That year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a total return of 37.58 percent.
"I don't think we're looking at those returns, but the character will be similar," he said. "Inflation fears will dissipate, and the economy will slow faster than people expect. Bond yields will drop to around 5 percent, and stocks will go to higher highs on lower rates." Mr. Paulsen says both stocks and bonds will have returns of 10 to 15 percent in 2000.
But do not count on value stocks rebounding, Mr. Paulsen advised. If the economy decelerates and growth becomes harder to find, there will be an even bigger move away from value stocks, cyclical companies and small-capitalization concerns. Investors will focus instead on the same favored growth stocks, expanding perhaps to include electric utilities, which will benefit from lower interest rates.
A common question is what 2000 will bring for investors in technology stocks. With the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 71 percent so far this year, a repeat performance seems unlikely.
L. Keith Mullins, head of emerging growth research at Salomon Smith Barney, forecasts a painful shakeout in some of the smaller technology stocks in the first quarter of the year. And, unlike the sharp decline in Internet stocks last spring, which did not spread to other market sectors, the coming drop, he said, will hurt the major market indexes. When biotechnology stocks tanked in 1992, he pointed out, they dragged unrelated issues down, too, although not so much as the highfliers.
Though the losses will hurt, he said, the shakeout will ultimately be healthy for the overall market, which will rebound. "A lot of people own these stocks but have no idea what they own," Mr. Mullins said. The shakeout would help because it would probably broaden the types of stocks participating in the upswing that he expects would follow.
There will be other headlines in the new year that could have significant impact, said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer, asset allocation, at the Trust Company of the West. "We will see an enormous flood of takeovers in financial services, friendly and hostile," he said. "Wireless will emerge as an important, even dominant, force in data transmission, and drug companies will be a whipping boy for politicians in an election year, and the stocks will reflect it."
Mr. Moltz of International Strategy summed up the investment scene this way: "Someone who is a traditionalist has got to approach the market, with these stretched valuations, with a certain amount of care. But the classic things that would cripple a market -- the Fed overdoing it or the economy really rolling over -- to date are not there. So you approach it with a measure of caution but recognize that the life in the existing trends is still pretty healthy."

Over the last quarter century, the Dow Jones industrial average has had a remarkable run, increasing in value 1,727 percent. But the Nasdaq composite index has been even better, rising by 6,174 percent. In fact if the Dow had risen as much as the Nasdaq, it would stand at nearly 39,000.

The Internet at Adolescence: A Trillion-Dollar Prodigy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Just think what the language would be like without the Internet. Until five or six years ago, "Amazon" was a very long, very big river. "Yahoo" was a favorite expression of delight -- or, to students of Jonathan Swift, a brutish creature. A "web" was for spiders. "Space" was -- well, it was space. "Dot-com," "B2B," "e-commerce," "e-mail." Whaaa?
Consider the economy, and its Net effects. 
 Six years ago, only 90,000 Americans, mostly academics, were wired. Today, 80 million people in this country, and nearly 200 million worldwide, are online. Within two years, those numbers could double.
Online retail sales have risen from nothing to about $20 billion. Business-to-business transactions -- that B2B thing -- have grown to $109 billion. By 2003, Forrester Research estimates, online retail sales will grow to $144 billion, and B2B business e-commerce will jump to $1.3 trillion. (That's just in the United States, folks.)
Finally, there is the stock market. Without the Internet, the initial public offering market would be pretty dead. Without the Internet, a slew of day traders might be otherwise engaged. Without the Internet, the Nasdaq composite index almost certainly would not be up more than 70 percent this year, and price/earnings ratios would make a lot more sense.
So much for the past.
Last month, with about six weeks left in the century, Mary Meeker, head of the Internet research team at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Jeff Camp, who follows Internet data services for the firm, sat down to talk about the future.
Following are excerpts from the conversation:
Q. -- There have been more than 200 Internet initial public offerings this year. Is that pace sustainable in the coming 12 months?
MS. MEEKER -- As long as the economic environment remains robust, and as long as new categories of companies keep coming on, it certainly seems as though it should. I think many people would welcome a slowdown because each crop of companies is riskier than the last one. That said, the aggregate opportunity is quite high for high-risk/high-reward companies.
Q. -- So what sorts of companies will we see? And how have the waves gone so far?
-- Increasingly, there will be new infrastructure plays. Broadband is becoming increasingly real. Providing services to build that business will be another big opportunity. Wireless is another one. And many things are needed to provide for a better user experience across the board. But the B2B theme, general business re-engineering, will continue to be a big theme.
It is also our view that sometime in the next year a traditional company will throw out its traditional business model and become more Internet-like, where it focuses on the long term and gets away with it. To date, no one has had the guts to do it or has done it successfully.
Up to now, we have had an infrastructure wave, including companies like UUnet, PSI and Netccom;, a software wave, with companies like Netscape and Spyglass;, a content wave, with companies like Lycos, Yahoo and Excite, and retail and e-commerce, like CDB Now and Amazon.com.
Each year a new crop of companies in a new category have captured peoples' imaginations and created real businesses and real wealth. Right now we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the business-to-business area. Two years from now people may be focused on something else.
Q. -- Is there any reason to think that business-to-business companies will generate profits faster than retailers like Amazon.com?
MS. MEEKER -- B2B will probably have a shorter ramp-up to profitability compared to an e-commerce company like Amazon, if only because Amazon's ambitions are so vast. And operating losses at these companies will also probably not reach the level of e-commerce companies. Right now it is too early to tell which companies are going to be the big winners on an ongoing basis. One of the reasons it is tough to predict is that many of these new companies are looking at the history of the Internet and asking what lessons can be learned from what has happened in the past. They have their eyes much more wide open and are adapting a lot more quickly than companies in the business-to-commerce area.
I would feel comfortable saying that a year from now we will have a lot more clarity about winners and losers. Often, the biggest threat is not a market threat or a competitive threat, but management error. That is something you can't predict.
Q. -- Which Internet infrastructure companies look promising?
MR. CAMP -- Four companies are worth highlighting: Exodus, which is dominant in the high end of the United States Web hosting market; InterNAP, which provides Internet connectivity services that greatly increase performance and speed of company Web sites; Akamai, a pioneer in the market for intelligent content distribution services; and Verio, the largest Web hosting company to small and medium-sized businesses.
Q. -- If you were constructing an Internet portfolio you could not trade at all for the next five years, which stocks would have to be included?
MS. MEEKER -- America Online, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems.
Q. -- Nearly all of these companies, and a good chunk of their managers, have never lived through a recession. What sort of impact would a downturn have on Internet companies?
MR. CAMP -- If you think B2B, businesses are getting online for cogent economic reasons: It reduces procurement costs; it increases productivity;inventory management and so forth. It is unlikely that a recession would derail that overall trend.
MS. MEEKER -- It could accelerate it.
MR. CAMP. -- It may impact what consumers do, but my guess is that the much larger part of the Internet, which is business-related, is going to be moving along that trend for the reasons I just mentioned.
You can make a decent argument that parts of the Internet are going to be recession-proof. If you are a business going online, you need a Web site, you need Internet access and all the different tools and components that go into it.
Q. -- Despite its rapid growth, the move to the Internet is still in its infancy. Where are we, and how much of a lead does the United States have on the rest of the industrialized world?
MR. CAMP -- It seems as if the Internet is everywhere, but it is really concentrated in the hands of a group of very large companies. Ninety percent of large businesses have a Web site or are doing something on the Web. Ten percent of small businesses do. When you consider that small businesses represent half the gross domestic product in this country and represent 99 percent of all businesses, a large part of the market is not engaged yet.
MS. MEEKER -- In terms of development, Europe is probaby where the United States was in 1995 or 1996. There are a few reasons for this.
First, personal computer penetration isn't as high as it is in the United States. Second, telecommunications availability is more restrictive, and costs are higher. And regional boundaries -- language and other things -- are part of the landscape.
That said, Internet growth is accelerating in those markets. Financial service companies are more aggressive about online banking than they have been here. And wireless Internet connectivity is going to happen faster in Europe than here. That is a big opportunity.
At the moment, though, more than half the usage by European consumers appears to be targeted at American sites. For example, we believe Yahoo is probably the leading Web site in France, Britain and Germany. From a content perspective, the Yahoo and America Online of Europe may be Yahoo and America Online.
Q. -- It sounds as though experience is a great comparative advantage. Is that the case?
MS. MEEKER -- People who wring their hands whenever Amazon's or e-Bay's or Schwab's site crashes should remember that those companies are making mistakes many companies only wish they could make, because they are servicing so much volume. They get smarter and smarter and smarter.
Something on the order of 50 percent of all e-commerce knowledge resides in the brains of Amazon.com employees or Amazon programmers. They know the patterns when an average American or foreigner goes online. That knowledge has helped these companies become so big and to understand how to move into new markets in a very competitive and aggressive way.
I would not want to compete with Microsoft or Netscape or Yahoo, or go toe-to-toe with Amazon.com or e-Bay. The leading companies of today will not be failures because of start-ups. If they fail, it will be because they made a tactical error or one of the other leaders morphs into their business.
Q. -- Speaking of Microsoft, what do you think is going to happen with the antitrust case? Will the company be broken up?
Ms. Meeker -- I think the best thing to happen here is that they settle the case and go forward.
The focus I have had is on whether an adverse ruling will fundamentally change the company's business model. But the things that will fundamentally change Microsoft's business model are already in place.
For them, the bad news is that they will not have the kind of market share on the Internet that they had on the personal computer platform. The good news is that the Internet, whatever it is, is much bigger, and they are in a position where they potentially could have smaller market shares in many markets, so that might not be such a bad thing.

CENTURY HIGHLIGHTS

 BODY:

1907: MORGAN TO THE RESCUE
The end of an economic boom led to the collapse of many banks and a plunging stock market. Calm returned when J. P. Morgan, then at the height of his power, arranged a rescue of the Trust Company of America.
 
1914: WAR CLOSES BIG BOARD
Fearing that prices would plummet, the New York Stock Exchange stopped trading on July 31, after World War I broke out in Europe. When trading resumed in December, prices rose on expectations of war profits. 

1929: THE CRASH
The greatest bull market Wall Street had ever known was amplified by the ability of speculators to borrow 90 percent of the cost of a stock. Tales abounded of small investors striking it rich. It all ended with the Crash of October 1929. The Great Depression followed, and by the time prices hit bottom in 1932, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 89 percent.
 
1934: THE S.E.C. CREATED
In the aftermath of the crash, Congress moved to regulate the stock market and established the Securities and Exchange Commission while putting limits on the amount speculators could borrow to buy stock.
 
1954: A NEW DOW HIGH
Thirty-five years after the 1929 peak of 381.17, the Dow Jones industrial average rose above that and kept on going. It rose 240 percent in the 1950's, to 679.35, making the decade the best ever for the market -- until the 1990's.
 
1966: DOW (ALMOST) HITS 1,000
Amid an air of celebration, the Dow neared 1,000 in early 1966. It closed at 995.14 on Feb. 9 and it twice posted an intraday high of more than 1,000. But it was not to be. Not until 1972 would the Dow manage to end a day higher than 1,000, and not until 1982 would it rise above that level and not turn back.
 
1975: MAY DAY
The competitive landscape of Wall Street was changed forever on May 1 when the S.E.C. ordered an end to fixed commissions. Commissions for institutional investors fell sharply, while those for individuals rose, creating an opportunity for discount brokers.
 
1979: SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE
Determined to halt runaway inflation, Paul A. Volcker announced on Saturday evening, Oct. 6, a monetary policy that drove interest rates to new heights and brought on recessions -- but did tame prices.
 
1980: SILVER THURSDAY
The Hunt brothers of Texas bought huge amounts of silver, confident the price would keep rising. It peaked above $50 an ounce, then slipped a bit. But on March 27, the price collapsed, falling below $11 an ounce and signaling that inflation fears were receding.
 
1987: BLACK MONDAY
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points, or 23 percent, to 1,738.74, on Oct. 19. It was the stock market's worst day ever, but no recession ensued, and by 1989 the Dow was setting new highs. In 1999, the Dow topped 11,000 in May, two months after passing 10,000.
 
1997: A DERIVATIVES NOBEL
The 1997 Nobel economics award went to Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes for devising the options-pricing theory that expanded the use of derivatives. A year later, Long-Term Capital Management, using their economic models in trading, almost went broke.
 
1999: INTERNET FEVER
Never were new issues hotter than in 1999. Nearly 100 new offerings, most Internet related, doubled in price the first day of trading. The champ: VA Linux Systems, which leaped nearly 700 percent the first day.

Trading Will Evolve With or Without Wall Street

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Late one evening, sometime early in the next century, you settle into your lumbar-support leather recliner and tell your wireless voice-activated computer to sign you on to eBay, where you enter the spirited bidding for an antique Nokia cellular telephone, a slightly foxed first edition of "Bridget Jones's Diary" -- and 10,000 shares of United Parcel Service.
Far-fetched? Maybe. But electronic technology is having such an immediate impact on American financial markets that a team of analysts at Lehman Brothers recently suggested that the stock exchange of the future might evolve not from traditional institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, but from e-commerce companies or Internet auction sites. 
 To be sure, that is only one very long-term possibility, the analysts said. And the evolution might work in reverse -- with the Big Board transforming itself into a 24-hour Internet market that could challenge the auction sites of today.
As that speculation suggests, Wall Street is approaching the new millennium the way superstitious pilots approach the Bermuda Triangle -- fearing the worst, hoping for the best but prepared for just about anything.
"The market will be constantly remaking itself," predicted William C. Freund, director of the Pace University Center for the Study of Equity Markets in Manhattan and a former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange. "The model of today is a scene of creative destruction."
Regulators have tried to create an environment that will foster greater innovation and competition in stock trading. A remarkably long-lived bull market has attracted millions of new investors. But the real engine driving market change today is computer technology: cheaper, faster computers connected by high-speed communications lines and guided by innovative software.
This fast-forward evolution has given rise to a host of bargain-priced online brokerage services that, in turn, have produced an awesome increase in the amount of stock trading Americans do each day. Forrester Research estimates that the number of online brokerage accounts, which stood at roughly three million in August 1998, will reach 5.4 million by the end of this year and more than 20 million in the next four years.
Further, trading volume on Nasdaq increased 28 percent annually between 1994 and 1998, on average, while the year-to-year increase on the Big Board during that period was 23 percent, Salomon Smith Barney reported recently. That compares with average annual growth rates of roughly 19 percent on Nasdaq and 13 percent on the Big Board between 1989 and 1993.
But the same technology that has unleashed this tidal wave of fresh business has also helped Wall Street cope with that flood by fostering the birth of more than a dozen computerized trading networks, called electronic communications networks, or more often simply E.C.N.'s, where buy and sell orders can be matched in seconds. In recent months, some E.C.N.'s have started staying open for trading after the traditional stock exchanges have closed, making it even easier for investors to trade.
Some E.C.N.'s now handle enough trading to pose a competitive threat to the Nasdaq market and, to a lesser extent, the New York Stock Exchange. But those markets are not ceding their territory without a fight. Both Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, and Richard Grasso, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, are working on plans to convert their markets into for-profit corporations. They argue that the new ownership structure would allow them to react more quickly and compete more effectively.
And competition among the E.C.N.'s themselves is rising, prompting widespread predictions that only a few of the current crop will survive very long into the new century.
"But it becomes very quickly clear that this is a business that requires scale and yet it's one in which very little distinguishes the different players -- in short, it's a commodity business," said Guy Moszkowski, a brokerage industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
Moreover, each E.C.N. further fragments the market when customers want the broadest, deepest market possible. "So they face an almost self-defeating business challenge," Mr. Moszkowski added.
Yet, new competitors continue to arrive. By summer, Wall Street expects the debut of Primex, an E.C.N. that advertises itself as an "electronic auction market." Its hefty backers -- including Merrill Lynch & Company, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney -- account for more than half the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.
Nor is the stock market the only place where the ground is shaking. The nation's major options exchanges -- the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the American Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange -- are all facing increased electronic competition.
The International Securities Exchange, an electronic options exchange based in Manhattan and sponsored by a group of large brokerage firms including E*Trade and Ameritrade, plans to open its virtual doors in March, if regulators agree. Another electronic rival, backed by the Chicago Stock Exchange and Goldman, Sachs & Company, is on the drawing board.
Regulatory demands for greater public access to the prices at which bonds trade is also likely to push that traditional marketplace toward greater reliance on electronic trading, Mr. Moszkowski said.
The deep, relatively homogeneous markets for Treasury debt will probably be the first to adopt electronic trading broadly, he said, but the corporate and municipal markets will not be far behind. More than a dozen bond trading systems are already operating or are expected to open in the next year or so.
Though European and East Asian markets have been quicker to adopt electronic trading equipment, American markets remain in the forefront of these changes simply because this revolution is being driven largely by the demands of individual investors, who play a much larger role in the American marketplace than they do elsewhere.
Indeed, individuals play a much greater role in American markets than they once did. From the cloudy vantage point of the mid-1970's, the American securities market seemed to be a purely institutional party, with big pension funds and mutual funds pumping in giant orders and elbowing aside the little guy. But last year and into the first half of this year, more than 51 percent of the Big Board's volume consisted of trades of fewer than 10,000 shares apiece.
While some small orders are submitted by large index funds, which constantly adjust their portfolios to reflect the larger market, the growth in small orders also reflects a larger role by individuals, Mr. Moszkowski said.
But as foreign markets catch up, American investors will no doubt push for cheap, fast access to them as well. That will add to the pressure on Wall Street and its regulators to find a way to develop a global electronic market that has adequate regulation, sufficient financial safeguards for all participants and ready access to accurate, comparable information from market to market.
Already, this technological revolution has produced a long "to do" list for regulators. As the new year opens, they must wrestle not only with the competitive and regulatory issues surrounding E.C.N.'s and their traditional stock exchange rivals, but also with some important developments prompted by the new techology.
Most are fairly technical, but one change that individual investors are sure to notice will be the conversion of stock quotes from the traditional fractions into less unwieldy dollars-and-cents prices, a change that is scheduled for next summer. Market experts like Professor Freund expect that this change will put additional pressure on Wall Street profits by reducing spreads, the difference between the prices at which a trader can buy and sell the same stock.
Today, a market maker might buy a stock for $10 a share and sell it for $10 1/16 -- a difference of 6 1/4 cents. With decimal pricing, that gap could shrink to perhaps 5 cents, or even less.
"The conversion can't compare with the Y2K problems, as a technological challenge; this is not like converting to the metric system," Professor Freund said. "But it will change the economics of market making. It will narrow the spreads, and that will put some market makers out of business."
Indeed, for everyone on Wall Street, from the brokerage giants to the newest E.C.N.'s, competing effectively in the new century is going to mean finding the right balance between computers and human beings, according to Mr. Moszkowski, the securities analyst.
"Anything that can be automated must be automated because of the competitive pressures to keep costs low," he said.
The work left for human traders -- using their firms' capital to ease the handling of giant orders from big institutions that will have to pay handsomely for the service -- is going to require far more than routine skills as the difficulty of conducting these trades increases. "Institutional orders will need people much more skillful than ever before," Professor Freund said. "The seat-of-the-pants trader is not going to make it."
Lee Korins, the chief executive of the Security Traders Association in Manhattan, acknowledged that technology was reshaping the life of his members in significant and unpredictable ways. But he cautioned against confusing technology as a means with technology as an end in itself.
"Our markets work so well because we have risk takers in them, not because we have a particular technology," Mr. Korins said. "Electronic systems will do away with certain work experiences. But as long as we make sure the risk taker is included as we go forward, I don't have a big problem with these changes."

It's a Bird! It's a Plane! Yes, and It's Also The Latest I.P.O.!

BYLINE: By JOE QUEENAN; Joe Queenan is a writer in New York whose book "My Goodness" will be published by Hyperion in February.

 BODY:
The successful debuts of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and World Wrestling Federation Entertainment -- enterprises that went public side by side on Oct. 19 this year -- provide indisputable evidence that the stock market has entered a thrilling new era where the old rules do not apply. Twelve years ago on that same date stocks were tanking, but now they are flourishing and everybody wants a piece of the action. Because of this, the early years of the new millennium are sure to bring us initial public offerings far more exotic than any we have witnessed to date.
One reason traditional yardsticks are useless in measuring the prospects of companies like Martha Stewart and the W.W.F. is that each is in the Zeitgeist industry, an enigmatic and very possibly nonexistent segment of the economy where profits are directly pegged not to specific products but to a particular consumer vibe. The Zeitgeist industry may well be the fastest-growing segment of the world economy, a sector that will one day overtake automobiles, drugs and even high technology. 
 Since the industry celebrates a public fascination, it is hardly a coincidence that both Martha Stewart and the wrestling federation are rooted in television, the ultimate arbiter of public taste. So investors should not be surprised when Rosie O'Donnell, mistress of the morning airwaves, goes public with Rosie O'Donnell Living.
Just as Martha Stewart has tapped into the obsessive quest for perfection of the upwardly mobile, Ms. O'Donnell has tapped into the frantic search for adequacy of so many Americans. An adequate stand-up comic herself who has evolved into an adequate actress and a more-than-adequate talk-show host, Ms. O'Donnell is a goddess to her legions of fans. By going public with a company that will market comfort foods, comfortable clothing, functional appliances and a cozy magazine, Ms. O'Donnell should be able to raise billions.
So should @.com. The power of this icon cannot be underestimated. The "@" symbol is perhaps the most vital graphic linchpin of the Internet for without it e-mail messages could not be delivered. Were it mutilated, destroyed, rendered inoperative or even briefly held for ransom, electronic roadkill would litter the Information Highway. Knowing this, the entrepreneurs who take @.com public will be able to use the vast proceeds of their market entry to inflitrate the communications system even more by successfully introducing and copyrighting symbol-words like h@, c@, r@-a-t@-t@ and @mosphere, employing the slogan: "Saving keystrokes each day keeps the ergonomist away."
Not all the I.P.O.'s of the infant millennium, of course, will be rigorously pegged to the amorphous Zeitgeist -- anymore than were this year's roaring successes: Goldman Sachs Group, Delphi Automotive and United Parcel Service. Big offerings like these, along with the ubiquitous dot-coms -- and the biggest success of all, the Internet-related VA Linux Systems -- propelled the I.P.O. market to big bucks, a record volume of $69 billion through mid-December. That's already above the 1996 record of $50 billion, according to Thomson/ Financial Securities Data.
Some new offerings will simply capitalize on any opportunity to attract an ambitious, credulous investing public, whose appetite for I.P.O.'s this decade grew more than fourfold, to $340 billion from $75 billion in the 80's.
Eager investors can be expected, for instance, to snap up Planet United Nations. The U.N. sits on some very valuable Midtown Manhattan real estate and could be a great place to promote a restaurant with the cachet of a sophisticated international clientele. The money it raises would once and for all end the squabbles over nations that have not paid their dues.
Speaking of squabbling nations, with emerging markets once again beating Wall Street, it might behoove the world to brace for an unorthodox I.P.O. or two, like Mujahedeen.com. Traditionally, third world rebels have financed their operations by obtaining covert funds from abroad -- an approach that prevents the insurgency-minded public from directly participating in third world upheaval. In taking Mujahedeen.com public, Afghan guerrillas will generate profits by charging subscribers a monthly rate to watch live Internet footage of clashes in the foothills of Pakistan and allow subscribers to proffer hints on strategy to mujahedeen leaders in interactive chat rooms every evening.
Mujahedeen.com will also offer $65,000 adventure-travel packages to baby boomers who, having found the climb up Mount Everest too old hat, will get their kicks by locking swords in the Hindu Kush.
Speaking of old hat, old is really new in some quarters -- granny glasses are in vogue, and today's close-cropped men could have stepped out of a Jack Webb movie. Recognizing the trend, Irony "R" Us will make a bundle by reintroducing Disco Era bell-bottoms, Nehru jackets, Clark Kent eyeglasses, Day-Glo platform shoes and Louise Brooks hairstyles at the strategic moment. With the funds raised from the I.P.O. of Irony "R" Us, the founders will be able to blanket the nation with a chain of Saturday night restaurants called Trattoria Travolta and a line of Village People casual wear.
As the financial services industry restructures itself, unusual marketing channels will become increasingly popular. That is where the Girl Scouts come in. They are a marketer's dream: Trustworthy, with outstanding brand recognition.
In the past, Girl Scouts have raised money for good causes by selling cookies door to door. In the future, they will earn merit badges for selling annuities, life insurance, emerging-market mutual funds and high-yield bonds door to door.
By going public, the Girl Scouts will not only raise enough money to train young women in the art of financial planning but will also have enough cash left over to get some new uniforms. With their newfound capitalist prowess, after all, the girls will want boardroom apparel.
Speaking of boardrooms, AMEX.com promises to become a real highflier sometime in the next thousand years. Though it may come as a surprise to many, the American Stock Exchange still exists, and, like a bear emerging from hibernation, it may one day become a force to be reckoned with. Like many I.P.O.'s, it will lure investors with the promise of great profits -- the average I.P.O. this year rose 50 percent on opening day, while the average Internet I.P.O. doubled -- and then use the cash raised by going public to attract exciting young companies, build an opulent new headquarters, hire an attention-getting chairman and explain to the public, with the help of a catchy new slogan, what function it serves.
The slogan? "At AMEX, We Make Money the Old-Fashioned Way. We Go Public."

Lower Rates Are Tied to an Economic Slowdown

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Inflation is calm. The Federal Reserve is vigilant. And the federal budget deficit has disappeared. So conditions should be right for long-term interest rates finally to fall decisively below 5 percent, a level they have seen only briefly in the final third of the century about to end.
Maybe. Other factors, like the strong stock market, work against any slippage in rates, and many analysts say that only a significant slowdown in economic growth will push rates down any time soon. But just the fact that this decline can be contemplated shows how much the financial and economic environment has changed over the last few years. 
 The overall Consumer Price Index was up a mild 2.6 percent over the last 12 months through November. While that is above the 1.6 percent in 1998, much of this year's rise has come from a jump in oil prices. The core rate, which excludes food and energy, is up just 2.1 percent through November, down from the 2.4 percent core rate for 1998. All of these are far below the 12.5 percent that the overall Consumer Price Index rose in 1980 when long-term government interest rates topped 13 percent.
The Federal Reserve, which now has 20 years of credible inflation-fighting behind it, is trusted to pounce on any inflationary threat. Even with inflation low this year, the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point three times to slow the economy and take upward pressure off prices.
And with the monetary side of policy secure, the fiscal side has also improved. At least for the time being, the Federal budget has a surplus, which should take some pressure off the government's $5.7 trillion debt.
But even with all that, long-term government interest rates fell below 5 percent only briefly in late 1998 -- and it was panic over the global financial crisis that produced the fall. Money poured into this country as investors sought safety. When foreign markets stabilized, some of that money left, and bond yields in this country rose again.
Now, some forecasters say that even though the conditions for a further rate decline are in place, it will still take a slowdown in the pace of United States economic growth to get long-term interest rates much below their current levels, 6.37 percent for Treasury bonds and 7.59 percent for corporate bonds.
"I don't think we are there yet," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, who is forecasting that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will be around 6 percent in the fourth quarter of next year. "First, we need to see some significant slowing in economic activity."
With a forecast of 3.6 percent growth from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of 2000, he does not expect that, unless "something unpleasant happens."
Such unpleasantness could come in two forms: a stock market crash, which would dampen consumer spending enough to slow growth significantly, or aggressive rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Mr. Steinberg is expecting one quarter-point increase in the Fed's short-term interest rate target as early as February. But three increases, he said, would surely convince investors that the economy was going to slow a lot, bringing interest rates down.
Two factors are combining to make a rate decline less likely, despite the positive environment. One is that real interest rates, which are adjusted for inflation, are high. The other is that higher worker productivity has raised the Fed's speed limit for economic growth. At least for now, the higher real rates and the higher speed limit mean that the demand for capital to invest and to feed a growing economy will keep rates higher.
"Technology investment is driving this," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank, explaining the higher real interest rates. "And the opening up of global opportunities," he added, alluding to the chances for new investment in China if Beijing is able to enter the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Glassman said real long-term rates are now around 4 percent, the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond indexed to inflation.
He is not worried, though, about the higher real interest rates, maintaining that they are positive. "The future looks better and people want to invest," he said. "Higher real rates are a barometer for the outlook for the future." He noted that the current level of real rates is about where they were during the railroad boom in the mid-1800's and at the turn of this century.
Chase is forecasting only a small decline in the rate of economic growth next year, to 3.0 percent, from an estimated 3.8 percent this year. Inflation is expected to remain about 2 percent. And long-term Treasury yields, it expects, will change relatively little, perhaps falling below 6 percent by the end of next year.
Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said the rise in workers' productivity in the 1990's had pushed the Fed's growth speed limit up to a range of 3.5 percent to 4 percent. Fed officials have acknowledged that the limit is higher, but not how much. So analysts can only estimate how much it has been raised from what was thought to be a ceiling of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
Mr. Glassman judges the speed limit to be slightly slower, around 3 percent to 3.5 percent. But any increase is important because it raises the pace at which the Fed thinks the economy can grow without generating worrisome inflationary pressure.
The faster growth allowed with the higher speed limit means there will be more credit demand to fuel this extra growth before the Fed puts on the brakes, all of which suggests that interest rates will have more trouble falling even if inflation remains low.
Mr. Glassman said that inflation expectations were also making it hard for interest rates to come down. Based on surveys of inflation expectations and on the Treasury bonds indexed to inflation, he said, consumers expect inflation to stay at the 2 percent level for some time. Investors still have "the 1970's inflation bug," he said, noting that it takes just a few hints of stronger growth to make people worry again.
So a slowdown is the answer, right now, for lower interest rates. And that means the stock market will probably determine whether interest rates go lower or not.
If stock prices keep rising, consumers are likely to continue spending, as they feel wealthier every day. And that spending would presumably prevent the economy from slowing enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve. That could force a series of Fed rate increases that could lead to a bigger slowdown, especially if the stock market crumbled in the face of higher rates.
And after that, interest rates could fall.

Long Term Appears Turbulent for Oil

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Of all the pressures on the oil industry as the century turns, the one most likely to transform it over the next two decades, industry experts say, will be the fervent campaign to improve the environment.
"If we go 20 years forward, the oil industry at the turn of the 21st century will look like a very antiquated business because the types and use of petroleum products will change dramatically," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. 
 "There is going to be a lot of capital that is going to be made obsolete almost immediately," he said.
Much as it has for the last 100 years, however, oil will dominate the fuel industry as the 21st century begins. Even for the next decade or so the effects of recent underlying trends are likely to be incremental rather than seismic.
"There is nothing surprising out there over the medium term," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "The trends that have been driving and will continue to drive the industry are already in place: consolidation, cost consciousness and technology."
From a public policy perspective, however, "environmental issues will be paramount," he said. And in the longer term, conforming with stricter environmental guidelines will transform the oil industry.
Structural changes are already occurring. Driven by the need to cut costs, 1999 brought the consolidation of four huge companies into two even bigger ones: Amoco's merger with British Petroleum and the combination of Exxon and Mobil. A consolidation wave in the oil services business has been less heralded, but in many respects has been even more sweeping. Among the combinations are Halliburton's takeover of Dresser Industries, Baker Hughes's purchase of Western Atlas, and EVI's purchase of Weatherford Enterra.
A glimpse of the future will be on view next year when Toyota and Honda roll out so-called hybrid automobiles -- cars that combine batteries and electric motors with gasoline or diesel engines. These clean, peppy models can go twice as far as a conventional car on a gallon of gasoline, although analysts say drivers may not rush to buy any new technology until they are sure it works well.
Also on the drawing boards are vehicles powered by a fuel cell and batteries instead of an engine and batteries. Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to form electric current and water, with high efficiency and no pollution. Even if oil prices do not rise, movement toward the fuel cell cars is virtually inevitable, the experts said, although this technology is still being developed and is not expected to take hold until sometime in the second decade.
"U.S. energy policy today is an environmental policy: cleaner fuels and substitution away from conventional oil moving slowly, inevitably toward alternative fuels," Mr. Goldstein said.
Even as they roll out more and more gas-guzzling, high-profit-margin sport utility vehicles, automobile manufacturers have apparently heard the message.
"I don't talk to anyone in the auto industry who doesn't think that fuel cells are the likely fuel-propulsion mechanism in the future," said Paul R. Portney, president of Resources of the Future in Washington. "Whether it is powered by methanol, hydrogen or something else is up in the air, but 20 years from now fuel cells will begin to propel more and more cars. In the interim, you will see hybrid cars."
For now, however, the internal combustion engine will continue to rule. And while it is possible that an oil shortage may develop this winter, experts said that oil would remain plentiful over the longer term.
The doubling in oil prices over the last year has been painful to the pocketbook, but experts point out that it was unrealistic to assume that oil, which cost $13 a barrel or less in 1998, would stay at those lower levels for long.
"We are going to get large chunks of new supply over the next five years," Mr. Verleger said, "particularly if OPEC keeps prices up. It will primarily come out of the sea, like the Caspian oil field."
OPEC, the cartel that controlled oil prices and had a profound influence on the world economy in the 1970's, lost most of its teeth in the 1980's and well into the 1990's. Alternative sources of supply and a global economy that is less dependent on petroleum have curbed its power.
But this year OPEC managed to regain some of its old dominance by adopting -- and adhering -- to a set of strict production quotas during a time of rising demand. The cartel's re-emergence as a major force, however, is likely to be short-lived.
"Oil prices will remain volatile because no ruling group is in charge," said M. A. Adelman, professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Conditions are a lot more competitive than they used to be, and the price is a lot lower. That will continue for some time."
Competition is coming largely from sources of new supply that have been made possible by technological improvements over the last decade. Exploration in some previously unreachable places is now economically viable.
Over the last few years, three technological advances have been particularly important: 3-D seismic exploration techniques, which allow ships trawling over the ocean to locate reserves more precisely; the development of deep-water platforms that allow for exploration at much greater depths, and directional drilling, which slants drill bits out like legs on a mosquito as far as 5 or 10 miles, greatly expanding the territory that can be explored from a single ocean-based platform.
"These technologies, which are being fine-tuned to make them more versatile in various parts of the world, allow for much faster exploration and delivery," said James L. Smith, a professor of economics at the Cox School of Business of Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
As an example, Mr. Smith said that new wells in the North Sea could be in production within 18 months to two years from first discovery. Not so long ago, that same process would have taken as much as seven years, he said.
Although OPEC nations sit on vast proven reserves of oil, the rise in recoverable reserves elsewhere has all but silenced the voices that a quarter-century ago were saying that the world would soon run out of oil.
"There is no chance we will run out of oil in the next 20 years," Mr. Portney, from Resources of the Future, said. "We will stop using oil long before we run out of it. A century from now, when we don't use oil for very much, there will be a ton of it around."

Wireless Industry Looks Beyond Phone

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
Over the last decade, cellular telephones have evolved from oddity to indulgence to everyday accessory. Eighty million Americans now use them. That is not so shabby a track record, but many communications experts now want to move on. They want you to stop talking about wireless phones.
In fact, discuss the future of wireless technology with leading communications executives and the words "phone" and "telephone" may not be used at all. That is because they see the future of wireless technology as having little to do with talking and everything to do with putting the Internet into pockets and purses around the world. 
 To be sure, people's need to talk on the phone will continue to provide the financial lifeblood of the wireless industry. Some wireless executives even see the promises of technological wizardry as overblown. Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of Sprint PCS, one of the nation's biggest wireless phone carriers, predicts that old-fashioned voice transmission will remain the biggest part of the business, with as many as half the nation's phone calls being made without wires by the middle of the next decade.
Nevertheless, in just a few years, the mere wireless phone may very well seem as dated as a rotary dial. The conventional wisdom -- the orthodoxy even -- in the communications business is that in its place will be a new generation of mobile wireless devices that function not only as telephones but also as Internet terminals, radios that can be customized for personal tastes, and perhaps even customized television.
Call it a smart phone, a personal digital assistant or merely a wireless device. New wireless technologies to be deployed over the next few years promise to pump the flow of digital information to hand-held wireless units from trickles to torrents. By 2002, wireless subscribers could have access to as much as a million bits of digital information each second -- just about enough for a television-quality videophone and about 20 times the 56K connection speed supported by today's fastest home modems.
The idea is to unplug the wired world of computers and phone jacks to allow people to communicate and gain access to information when they want, where they want, how they want. In much the same way that computers that link to the Internet have been credited with releasing people from some constraints of time and space, the next generation of wireless technology may release the Internet from computers themselves.
"Now we will be able to focus on getting the individual his or her own information, no matter how they would like to receive it," said Phillip T. Redman, an analyst for the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm based in Boston.
"Wireless offers the ability to extend a user's communications, their entertainment system, their commercial transactions to an anytime, anywhere paradigm," Mr. Redman said. "You no longer are going to be tethered to a computer at home or at work or have to plan your shopping around when you're going to be at the mall. All of these will be targeted to you whenever or wherever you want to use it."
This may all sound a bit familiar, of course. The hype about wireless data services has continued almost unabated for years. But the technology to support futuristic wireless services is beginning to be put into place, so those services now seem set to move beyond e-mail on a phone.
"The wireless industry has been promoting this year being the year of wireless data for the last five or six years now," said Scott Goldman, chief executive of the Wireless Application Protocol Forum, an industry group that has developed systems to deliver Internet services to hand-held devices. "Now, if you poll wireless experts you will find people in concert saying, 'Yes, 2000 is the year.' "
One reason for optimism is that the big companies that make wireless systems -- like Ericsson, Nokia, Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom -- have begun to foster expectations about the data capacities of their products. They have seen start-ups like Neopoint produce revolutionary phones that can link to the Internet.
"The information will be localized, will be personalized and will be timely," said Haroon I. Alvi, director for business development of Nokia's wireless handset operation,
"Imagine you're a soccer parent," he said, "and you spend two to three hours a day taking your kids around town to school, sports events and other sorts of family events. As that soccer parent, you want to know about road conditions, traffic and weather conditions in the vicinity where you're located and at that instant.
"So if you're going to get into your car and take your kids to a soccer match, you may want to look at your phone to see if the venue has been changed. There might be an alert saying, 'We've changed the location because the field was waterlogged.' "
Even e-commerce, the much-vaunted selling of goods over the Internet, could be revolutionized by the next wave of wireless technology, through phones or personal digital assistants, known as P.D.A.'s.
"It's not just important that I can purchase a product through my phone or my P.D.A.," Mr. Redman said. "But my phone or P.D.A. knows where I am, and I can get a deal because there's a special going on near me as I'm driving and I'm alerted to it."
For all the noise around wireless data services, however, voice telephone service will continue to be the fundamental economic driver of the big wireless carriers' business. That is largely because data services may well be priced along the "all you can eat" model of Internet service providers, but phone calls are still likely to be priced minute by minute.
"We're in a technology business, and so people get focused often on the wrong thing," Mr. Sukawaty of Sprint PCS said. "Data is coming, no doubt about it, but the bigger revenue for wireless is that probably 50 percent of the voice traffic is going to go on wireless networks in the next three to five years. Given that it was at 6 or 7 percent two years ago, that's incredible."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 2000: TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA: TALKING THE FUTURE WITH: Robert W. Taylor;
An Internet Pioneer Ponders the Next Revolution

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The Internet has many fathers, but few deserve the label more than Robert W. Taylor.
In 1966, as a director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office, Mr. Taylor came up with the idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. After authorizing money for research to develop a nationwide computer network, Mr. Taylor wrote a white paper in 1968, a year before the network was created, with another ARPA research director, J. C. R. Licklider. The paper, "The Computer as a Communications Device," was one of the first clear statements about the potential of a computer network. 
 Even before coming to ARPA, Mr. Taylor saw the computer's potential as an interactive device. As a research manager at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he arranged financing for Douglas C. Engelbart, a young researcher who used the money at what was then called the Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International, to invent the computer mouse.
At ARPA, Mr. Taylor's office continued financing Mr. Engelbart's Augment research group, which pioneered many of the most important ideas in today's computer industry. It was Mr. Taylor who financed Mr. Engelbart's legendary demonstration of advanced computer technologies -- including the mouse, windows, hypertext, networking and teleconferencing -- at the 1968 Joint Fall Computer Conference in San Francisco. The demonstration left many of the nation's best computer scientists, then living in a world of punch cards and paper tape, in awe.
Mr. Taylor's contributions did not end there. After leaving ARPA and spending a year at the University of Utah, he was hired to direct the newly formed computer systems laboratory at Xerox's brand-new Palo Alto Research Center. From that laboratory and several others at PARC came the personal computer, computer networking, desktop publishing, laser printers, the graphical user interface and modern word processing.
Mr. Taylor, who never profited personally from the commercial Internet boom, is now retired at 67 and lives in Woodside, Calif. In a recent interview, he reviewed these pivotal events in the computer industry and looked to what the future might hold.
Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. -- What led to your ideas about computer networking?
A. -- I discovered computers in the 1950's, and the whole business of punching holes in cards turned me off. I really wasn't interested in computers from the beginning as an arithmetic engine. What struck me about them really came home when I read J. C. R. Licklider's 1960 "Man-Computer Symbiosis" paper. I said, "Yeah! Now we're talking!"
Q. -- How did you come across that article?
A. -- It appeared in an I.E.E.E. Transactions journal that I subscribed to. I was working as a systems engineer at the Martin Company at the time. That's when the power of interactive computing dawned on me. I had other reasons to pay attention to Licklider. I did my thesis on psycho-acoustics and Licklider was world famous in that field, before he started to play around with computers.
Q. -- How did you meet Licklider?
A. -- NASA had approached me to become a program manager in 1961 to look after research areas including flight displays and manned flight-control systems. I told them they needed an area called simulation technology because we were going to have to make huge investments in simulation, and they liked that idea. In late 1962, Licklider moved to ARPA and started this computer research program. I was at NASA and he was at the Pentagon. I had been supporting Doug Engelbart's work.
Q. -- This led to the mouse?
A. -- Yes. You know, it's quite funny -- several years ago NASA began looking for spinoffs that their research had led to in the civilian economy and they never realized that the mouse was developed under a NASA contract. But Licklider, shortly after he took over at ARPA, organized an informal committee of people in the government who were supporting computer research. He invited me to come over and join the committee. I walked into his office and right away he started talking to me about my thesis. It blew me completely away. How would he know anything about my thesis? I was a no-name nobody graduate student. He wowed me from Day 1.
Q. -- What did you set out to do at ARPA?
A. -- I began to think that if I was going to do this for a while, I wanted to find some particular program to measure my performance by. I wanted to put a nail on the wall or whatever the proper metaphor is. I wanted to make a difference. We had in my office three terminals to three different programs that ARPA was supporting. One was to the Systems Development Corporation in Santa Monica. There was another terminal to the Genie Project at U.C. Berkeley. The third terminal was to the C.T.S.S. project that later became the Multics project at M.I.T. We hadn't had these terminals very long. But I had already seen a very interesting thing. As these three time-sharing projects came alive and they collected users around their respective campuses, the only users they had were local users because there was no network to speak of. All communications were local except to ARPA.
Q. -- What did you discover?
A. -- The thing that really struck me about this evolution was how these three systems caused communities to get built. People who didn't know one another previously would now find themselves using the same system. Because the systems allowed you to share files, you could find that so-and-so was interested in such-and-such and he had some data about it. You could contact him by e-mail and, lo and behold, you would have a whole new relationship.
Q. -- Were these first communities built around mailing lists?
A. -- Well, you had a directory, so you knew how to send them e-mail, but you might only know 2 or 3 people, and you would meet 20 or 30 through the computer. It wasn't a static medium. It was a dynamic medium. And that gave it a lot of power.
Q. -- It was all about community?
A. -- There was one other trigger that turned me to the ARPAnet. For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of user commands. So if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C. and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley or M.I.T. about this, I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said, oh, man, it's obvious what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go where you have interactive computing. That idea is the ARPAnet.
Q. -- When did you get the idea?
A. -- I decided to do that in late 1965. In February of 1966, I was officially the head of the Information Processing Techniques Office. So I went to see Charlie Herzfeld, who was the head of ARPA, and laid the idea on him. The first funding came that month. He liked the idea immediately, and he took a million dollars out of the ballistic missile defense budget and put it into my budget right then and there.
Q. -- Was the idea an immediate success?
A. -- I had to go around and talk to our contractors to see if I could get their cooperation -- and some of them were enthusiastic, and some of them saw it as an infringement on their computing facilities. They said, "I don't want to share my computing cycles with some guy across the country. I don't have enough cycles as it is. Now you're going to build something that allows people to come in and use my machine?" That took a while to bring people together.
Q. -- Did you see right away that this would have an impact broader than just a small group of military-funded researchers?
A. -- Oh, yeah, sure. It was obvious to some of us that interactive computing was here to stay. And by the late 60's, the personal computer was obvious as well. By the time I went to Xerox in 1970, I tried to get the guys to build the Alto one of the first experimental personal computers and they built it two years later, but that's a whole other story.
Q. -- Was there one shared vision?
A. -- The model that some people were pushing in those days for how this was going to spread was that there were going to be gigantic computer utilities. This was the power utility model. I never bought that. By the late 60's, Moore's Law was pretty obvious. It was just a matter of time before you could afford to put a computer on everyone's desk. That was what I came to Xerox to do.
Q. -- How did you arrive at Xerox?
A. -- I left ARPA in late 1969 after I knew that the ARPAnet was up and running, and I went to Utah for what turned out to be only a year. When I was in Utah, I got a call from George Pake, a physicist who was setting up Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. I had the impression that he just wanted to pick my brain. There was no discussion of a job. He told me that Xerox was going to have a research lab here in Palo Alto and part of it was going to be devoted to computer research. The research group was going to develop technologies that would be used at S.D.S., a computer company that Xerox had recently purchased. I said, "Oh, that's too bad." He said, "What do you mean?" "Well, you won't be able to get anyone who's any good to come work here because there's absolutely no respect for S.D.S. among the best computer folks." They were floored. They said, "What do you think we ought to do?" I replied, "You ought to computerize the office; everything that happens in the office can be put on the computer."
Q. -- If the personal computer has been the foundation for the Internet, where will the next major burst of innovation come from?
A. -- Broadband networks. If you take real-time video and audio and you couple them, and you imagine some kind of a chair that's connected to this system that you sit in and fly around wherever you want to go . . . .
Q. -- How will we use these new technologies?
A. -- You'll also be able to wear -- maybe not in my lifetime but certainly reasonably soon -- an unobtrusive device that will record in full color and sound everything that you see or point your head at, or, depending on how many of them you have, everything that's around you. And share it. Every waking and sleeping moment in your life will be recorded. And you will be able to store and retrieve it and do what you will with it.
Q. -- How will that change the world?
A. -- I don't know, but it will. There are obviously implications for privacy that will have to be worked through. I'm actually more concerned about nearer-term issues. I want the Internet to become a right, not a privilege. I think we need a driver's license to allow you to use the Internet, much like you drive on the road today. If you misbehave on the road, you get your license taken away.
Q. -- Do you have a sense of what the future will look like from a computer network point of view?
A. -- I can't help much about the future, I'm afraid. I was a bad predictor of the future 30 years ago. I was sure that from the early 1970's, all the pieces were there at Xerox and at ARPA to put the Internet in the state by the early '80's that it is in today. It was all there. It was physically there. But it didn't happen for years.

Patents Considered Vital To Thrive on the Internet

BYLINE: By TERESA RIORDAN

 BODY:
How important will intellectual property be in the new economy?
"Excruciatingly important," said Glover Ferguson, co-director of the electronic commerce program at Andersen Consulting. 
 A case in point is the victory that the online bookseller Amazon.com scored earlier this month when it obtained a preliminary injunction against Barnesandnoble.com. The injunction prevents Barnes & Noble from using the one-click system patented by Amazon that enables repeat online customers to place orders without having to re-enter mailing and credit card information.
"This is going to put some real boulders in the way of the Barnes & Noble checkout line system," said Kevin Rivette, co-author of "Rembrandts in the Attic," a new book from the Harvard Business Press that proselytizes on the power of patents. "The lawsuit also has put everyone else on the Net on notice."
Walter Hanchuk, a partner at the New York law firm of Morgan & Finnegan, concurred, saying the ruling "clearly highlights the importance of intellectual property in all technologies."
Intellectual property, in Mr. Rivette's view, is what is going to separate many winners and losers on the Internet.
"When it's easy to put up a Web site, when it's easy to get financial backing, this is where some of the shakeout is going to happen," he said.
Much attention so far has been paid to the new wave of so-called business-method patents on the Internet. But Mark Lemley, a professor of law at the University of Texas, points out that the scope of what can be patented is growing every day.
"There's a patent on a method for holding a golf putter," Mr. Lemley said. "There's a patent on allocating assets in a divorce settlement. This is a great expansion of patentable subject matter beyond what has traditionally been the technological arts."
Mr. Rivette, who is chief executive of Aurigin Systems, a patent-strategy consulting company, predicted that "one of the biggest things that will occur in the next three to five years is the proliferation of well-funded patent 'factories.' "
Mr. Rivette said he had heard of about half a dozen such enterprises modeled along the lines of Walker Digital, the controversial -- and extremely successful -- patent-incubation venture that gave birth to Priceline.com. The Priceline.com business is based on a patented method for letting prospective customers propose a price for a product or service, with the online order being filled if the seller is willing to sell at that price. The patent is one of 30 received by Walker Digital, which has another 300 patent applications pending.
Like Walker Digital, which maintained a very low profile until it started Priceline.com, these ventures are stealthily amassing patent empires that will become apparent only when they are ready to start businesses, Mr. Rivette said.
Mr. Rivette predicts that the high mortality rate of Internet businesses will create new opportunities for patent expertise.
"It will be just like what happened in the biotech community in the 1980's," he said. "There's going to be opportunity to buy property rights and turn around and sell them to market leaders."
But Mr. Hanchuk, the patent lawyer, expects this sorting-out period to be tumultuous. As patent portfolios fatten and as e-commerce continues its explosive growth, he said, "we will inevitably see a significant increase in patent litigation involving e-commerce."
And the suits may not come only from competitors. Companies that fail to protect their innovations may face lawsuits from shareholders, warns Charles Eldering, president of Telecom Partners Ltd., a company based in New Britain, Pa., that develops strategic patent portfolios for telecommunications and Internet companies.
Mr. Rivette and others predict that within a few years many companies will have the equivalent of a vice president for intellectual property -- not a lawyer who shepherds applications through the patent office, but rather an M.B.A. who thinks strategically about intellectual property.
"We'll see a chief patent strategist or the equivalent in most corporations in the next three years," Mr. Rivette said. "Intellectual property touches too much of the corporation."
The Internet already has become home to a number of online intellectual property bazaars -- sites where companies can swap technology through licensing deals or sell off trademarks, patents or copyrights that the owner does not need but that another company might find valuable.
Among these new sites are www.yet2.com, which uses technology developed by Mr. Rivette's Aurigin Systems; www.pl-x.com, which specializes in technologies developed by universities, and IPnetwork.com, which is weighted toward trademarks and copyrights.
"We will bring in lots of new players," said Christine Hearst Schwarzman, the president of IPnetwork. "I have hundreds and hundreds of companies from places in the world that are chronically underrepresented areas of the licensing world."
And what will patents themselves look like in the future? Mr. Ferguson of Andersen Consulting predicts that -- instead of consisting of text and drawings as they have for more than two centuries -- patents are likely to become mixed-media affairs.
"We're getting into things that are darn difficult to explain in prose," Mr. Ferguson said. "Imagine the most graphical interface possible," he said, referring to computer screens on which users interact with images instead of issuing verbal commands. "It's almost impossible to describe it in text. But as soon as you see the thing, you say, 'Oh, I get it.' There may be a gap in the way we have chosen to memorialize inventions."

The Better to See With
Giant squid, those monsters of the deep, are famous for (among other things) having eyes the size of dinner plates.
Now comes word that another sea creature had eyes that could just as easily have graced a table. A researcher at the University of California Museum of Paleontology and colleagues report that some types of ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles that lived 90 million to 250 million years ago, had eyes up to 10 inches in diameter, rivaling those of the largest giant squid. The ichthyosaur eyes are the largest ever found in a vertebrate. 
 Ichthyosaurs, which ranged in size from about 7 feet to more than 30, had fishlike bodies, including fins and vertical tails. Among the fossils studied, those of a genus called Ophthalmosaurus had the largest eyes for its size, about 9 inches in diameter for a body length of roughly 13 feet.
In general, the larger the eye, the better it can see in low light conditions. The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, estimate that the ophthalmosaurs could probably have detected point light sources (like those from photoluminescent prey) in deep water, and suggest that the creatures dived to depths of close to 2,000 feet.
Supporting the idea that ophthalmosaurs were deep divers, the researchers found evidence in the fossil bones that the reptiles suffered from the bends, which occurs when an animal (or human) dives to great depths and rises too quickly, with the pressure changes causing gas bubbles to expand in tissues.
 
Atomic Clock Watch
Strange things happen during a solar eclipse. Twilight falls, the wind can shift, birds stop singing: it almost seems that time stands still.
Perhaps more than almost. Experiments during some eclipses over the last half century have appeared to show strange things happening to atomic clocks and pendulums, attributed to some unexplained feature of gravity.
A set of experiments during four partial eclipses from 1987 to 1992 was particularly odd: it showed a small but significant accumulated time difference between atomic clocks in the same laboratory, where the gravitational effects, if any, would have been the same.
But a new study by German scientists during August's total solar eclipse in Europe contradicts these previous findings. The experiment used four atomic clocks of three different types, and all were placed in an air-conditioned basement laboratory in Wessling, Germany, with a computer recording their time differences every four seconds between Aug. 3 and 23 (the eclipse occurred on the 11th). The results showed no anomalous changes in the relative rates of the four clocks.
 
Haze Over China
Burning of soft coal to feed its growing economy has made China the world leader in sulfur emissions, and its neighbors are complaining about acid rain caused by all that sulfur. But China's economic progress is causing problems at home in the fields as well.
A NASA-financed study by a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and colleagues shows that heavy haze in China's chief growing regions may be cutting agricultural production by up to one-third.
The aerosol haze, which the researchers say is most likely a result of the burning of coal and other fuels, acts like a filter, absorbing some of the sunlight that would ordinarily be used by plants for photosynthesis.
The researchers, who reported on their work in a recent issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that sunlight was reduced by 5 percent to 30 percent over the roughly 250,000 square miles of hazy areas in China, which include some of the country's most productive farmland.
The scientists also point out that similar haze problems exist in many developing countries.

Santa Aside, Who Believes In Virginia?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
CURIOSITY led to a row house at 115 West 95th Street, where one of the best-known sentiments of this holiday season was born. The idea was to see if anyone knew that Virginia O'Hanlon once lived there, or even had a clue who she was.
It was a foolish mission. Inquiries produced polite shrugs or don't-bother-me clicks of the intercom from the few people living at No. 115. Their reaction should have been anticipated. After all, this is a city of impermanence; collective memory often lasts about as long as sand castles at high tide. 
 Still, one thought that there just might be a plaque or some other indication that, in this house 102 years ago, an 8-year-old girl wrote a letter that produced perhaps this country's most enduring secular affirmation of hope and faith.
Some of her "little friends" at school had said there was no Santa Claus, Virginia O'Hanlon wrote to the editor of The New York Sun. Could they conceivably be right? In what would become America's most famous newspaper editorial, Francis Pharcellus Church of The Sun replied:
"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus."
"He exists," the editorial continued, "as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy."
Cornball? You bet. Irresistible? That, too. Generations of open-hearted Americans have thought so (their numbers including countless newspaper writers who have taken "Yes, Virginia" and pounded it silly, often on the misguided assumption that they were the first to play with that locution).
You would think that a piece of New York writing of such grace and durability deserved formal acknowledgment. Surely, something creative could be figured out by city officials, whose taste in tributes leans more to renaming streets Senor Wences Way and the like.
Given the absence of any public recognition, you can hardly blame the present occupants of No. 115 for drawing a blank. "Yes, Virginia" doesn't always ring a bell with Mr. Claus, either.
"I never heard of her, to tell you the truth, and I've been doing this a long time," said Bob Williams, a sidewalk Santa for 14 years with Volunteers of America, the helping hand to some of New York's neediest.
Mr. Williams, 66, was at his regular post during the weekend, on Fifth Avenue, facing the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. He is something of an expert, he said, on little children and their need to believe.
"But I tell them right up front that I'm not Santa," he said. "I'm Santa's helper, and if they tell me something, I'll pass it on to the big guy. I don't make promises I can't keep."
There is wizardry in that red suit, whether you believe it or not, Mr. Williams added. "When I'm in street clothes, I'm nobody," he said. "But the minute I put on that suit, I'm somebody. It changes everything. Even when I go take a break, I can't really take a break. I get mobbed."
But it's not all magic. To steal from Barbara Basler, formerly of this newspaper, being Santa can be a tough row to ho.
CHILDREN today are more jaded than their older brothers and sisters, Mr. Williams finds. And the grown-ups who stuff cash in Santa's chimney are usually tourists, not New Yorkers, who are too busy rushing through the canyons of Midtown.
"The ones that work in those office buildings there, they don't give," he said. "The ones that don't have it, give it. The ones that have it, they walk right by you."
Sad but true, agreed Linda McNeil, Volunteers of America's director of development and communications. Altogether, the Volunteers' eight sidewalk Santas are likely to collect about $45,000 by Christmas Eve. Even though these are heady days on Wall Street, the figure has held steady for several years, Ms. McNeil said.
In general, she said, "the boom in the economy is not impacting on our fund-raising at all. There are maybe a few donors who find it advantageous to unload some stock on us."
What about all the cyber-generated money floating out there? "The new wealth," Ms. McNeil said, "has not necessarily been trained in philanthropy."
Of course, Santa is about more than money and gifts. Church of The Sun knew that, and said so to Virginia O'Hanlon, who died in 1971.
"How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus!" he wrote. "It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence."

HEADLINE: Russia's New Parliament

 BODY:
Several distinct messages can be drawn from Sunday's parliamentary elections in Russia, some more encouraging than others. Most hearteningly, voters showed a clear preference for centrists, selecting what may turn out to be the first reform-minded Duma majority since the Soviet collapse. But the main centrist party, Unity, allied with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, built its success on jingoistic exploitation of the brutal Russian military campaign in Chechnya. The results were also skewed by the unequal enforcement of election rules, dirty campaign tricks and the crude bias of television stations allied with the Kremlin. These outlets fed Russians a stream of unproven criminal accusations against the two leaders of a rival party, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow.
The allocation of parliamentary seats is still incomplete. But it appears that the Communists just barely remained the largest party. Challenging them closely is Mr. Putin's Unity Party. An allied party of economic reformers did well enough to bring Mr. Putin close to a working majority. When members elected from the liberal Yabloko Party and the Fatherland-All Russia alliance of Mr. Primakov and Mr. Luzhkov are added in, moderates could end up with more than half the total seats. 
 Those gains could help bring economic reform back to life and revive hopes of ratifying nuclear arms control treaties with the United States. But that will require the centrist parties to cooperate on legislative goals even as they prepare to line up behind competing candidates in next summer's presidential elections.
Achieving substantive results from the new parliamentary alignment will largely depend on Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer who has built his popularity mainly on Russian military successes in Chechnya. Mr. Putin's own ideological and political instincts are unclear. Russia's economy has revived somewhat in recent months, but those gains flowed mainly from last year's ruble devaluation and the recent doubling of world oil prices. Continued growth depends on pushing through reforms long stymied by the Communists and their parliamentary allies. The most urgently needed measures are a simplified and enforceable tax system, strengthened legal protections for Russian and foreign investors and a crackdown on corruption.
One of Mr. Putin's strongest opponents for the presidency is likely to be Mr. Primakov, an experienced politician who has coupled promises of strong leadership with a pledge to avoid wrenching economic change. Although Mr. Primakov's party got only about half as many votes as Mr. Putin's this week, the presidential race could be closer. Russia's party system is weak, and sentiment can change swiftly in response to unforeseen events, including possible reverses in Chechnya. What the voters surely deserve is a cleaner campaign than they got this time, with honest media coverage for all sides. Mr. Putin should use his new political strength to assure a fairer presidential race.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Three weddings and a funeral: deals are made and a small specialty agency closes shop.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THREE acquisitions and an agency's closing are making news.
In the largest of the acquisitions, the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, which owns agencies like Draft Worldwide, the Lowe Group and the McCann-Erickson World Group, agreed yesterday to buy NFO Worldwide Inc. in Stamford, Conn., a leading market research company. 
 The stock deal is valued about $580 million.
Interpublic is the world's No. 2 agency company in revenue, at $4.3 billion behind the Omnicom Group, according to the trade publication Advertising Age, and is No. 1 in billings at $37.7 billion. NFO is to operate as a stand-alone autonomous unit of Interpublic, perhaps as part of its Allied Communications Group division.
The acquisition vaults Interpublic into the front ranks of the market research field, which is booming because of the demand for data related to interactive advertising. In fact, NFO describes itself as the single largest provider of Internet-based marketing research.
"We consider market research an area of opportunity," said Sean Orr, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Interpublic.
"Arguably, it was a bit of a hole in our portfolio of service offerings. We're delighted to have that hole closed."
While Interpublic owns some small market research companies, it has not been as large a force in that field as the WPP Group in London, which has assiduously assembled an array of such operations, primarily through acquisitions.
"We wanted a significantly larger presence, ideally globally," said Barry Linsky, senior vice president for planning and business development at Interpublic. "With NFO, we're gaining the size and scope and a terrific brand."
NFO was originally known as National Family Opinion, after a unit that polls consumers through surveys sent out under the name Carol Adams -- an imaginary woman who could be considered the Betty Crocker of market research. NFO, founded in 1946, has about 4,000 employees in 35 countries providing custom and syndicated marketing information to more than 3,000 clients; annual revenue is estimated at more than $425 million.
"It's a great strategic fit between two global leaders," said William E. Lipner, chairman, chief executive and president at NFO, "reaffirming the convergence of advertising agencies and market research firms."
Terms of the deal call for NFO shareholders to receive $26 worth of Interpublic stock for each NFO share they own. On the New York Stock Exchange, NFO stock closed Friday at $14 and closed yesterday at $22.25, up $8.25. Interpublic shares, traded on the same exchange, fell $2.3125 yesterday, to $55.75.
The acquisition was announced as NFO warned that it expected a significant shortfall in earnings during the current quarter, far below the predictions of Wall Street analysts, and would take fourth-quarter after-tax charges of $15 million to $20 million. Interpublic was aware of those developments before making the deal, Mr. Linsky and Mr. Orr said.
The second acquisition involves Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Norwalk, Conn., an Internet advertising agency and Web site creator, which agreed to buy Vivid Studios in San Francisco, a Web site creator and consultant, for $64 million in cash and stock. Modem Media.Poppe Tyson is partly owned by True North Communications.
The acquisition of Vivid, which has about 100 employees, is meant to help Modem Media.Poppe Tyson develop e-commerce sites more efficiently and effectively. It will be the third deal in recent months for Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, whose shares closed yesterday at $64.375, down $1.375, in Nasdaq trading.
The third acquisition involves Powers & Associates in Cincinnati, which agreed to buy another agency there, Sive/Young & Rubicam. Terms were not disclosed.
Sive/Y.& R. has 24 employees working on accounts with billings estimated at $42 million from clients like Frisch's Restaurants, Mercy Health Partners and the United States Playing Card Company. Powers has about 26 employees and clients like American Savings and Loan and the Progressive Insurance Company.
The merged agency will operate under the Powers name, with Charles W. Powers, 62, continuing as president. Michael Kitei, 62, president and chief executive at Sive/ Y.& R., will serve as a consultant.
"The new agency will be a long-held dream come true," Mr. Powers said, referring to his attempt in 1977 to acquire the old Sive agency, only to be outbid by Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York. Sive/Y.& R. remained part of Y.& R. until 1994, when five managers bought 90 percent of the agency. Sive/Y.& R. is being acquired from current management and Y.& R., which is selling its 10 percent stake.
Finally, the agency that is closing, effective immediately, is Mulryan/ Nash, a small New York shop specializing in campaigns aimed at gay and lesbian consumers. Clients included Agouron Pharmaceuticals, part of the Warner-Lambert Company, and Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries.
"There's no one thing" that led to the decision, said Dave Mulryan, president at Mulryan/Nash, adding that he could not comment further.
In a letter addressed to "valued customers, vendors and friends," Mr. Mulryan wrote that "harsh financial circumstances beyond our control" led to the closing. Inquiries were referred to Geron & Corsano, a New York law firm.
"Even though it's a bad situation not typical of other agencies specializing in the gay market," said Sean Strub, chairman of Poz Publishing L.L.C. in New York, 'it's a black mark on the gay market." He estimated that his company was owed about $125,000 for ad space that Mulryan/Nash bought for clients in Poz and Poz en Espanol magazines.
Agouron, which extensively advertises an AIDS drug, Viracept, in publications read by gay men, sent letters to those magazines and newspapers expressing regret over "the unfortunate circumstances of the agency closing." The letter notified the publications that Rivendell Marketing in New York and Westfield, N.J., would take over media duties from Mulryan/Nash.
"We're sorry to see Mulryan/Nash go," said Todd Evans, chief executive at Rivendell, adding that he did not think the agency's difficulties were indicative of the health of the overall market.
"Companies have a commitment to the gay market," said Mr. Evans, who sells ad space in gay and lesbian publications in local markets nationwide. "Our business was up 30 percent this year, and we expect another banner year next year."

HEADLINE: Chief American U.N. Delegate Charts Course for His Month at the Helm

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke's moment has come, and he intends to make the most of it.
With a long and bedeviled nomination process and the battle to pay American dues to the United Nations now behind him, he has one year left as chief American representative here, one year to put his imprint on Washington's relations with the world and perhaps to emerge again as a leading candidate for secretary of state after the next election. 
 Almost four months after taking office here and picking up a cabinet seat at the White House, Mr. Holbrooke called his first major news conference today to talk about his plans for January, a month when he takes on the rotating presidency of the Security Council and can frame much of its agenda. In a word, it will be Africa. Not Iraq, not Kosovo or Bosnia, not North Korea or East Timor.
"It's not just a gimmick," said Mr. Holbrooke, who is an expert on Europe and Asia. Back from his first extended tour of sub-Saharan Africa, he has been plainly shaken by what he saw: the endless implosion of Angola, a pointless war in the Congo and the social and economic devastation wrought by AIDS.
With Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright now focused on the Middle East, and with events in the Balkans and East Timor largely under United Nations or NATO control, Africa looms as the great unfinished business at the century's end. Mr. Holbrooke plans public Security Council sessions on Burundi, Congo and Sierra Leone.
Many diplomats are skeptical. Council debates on Africa have often turned into speechfests that changed nothing.
But Africans and envoys from developing nations elsewhere are welcoming the attention. At the Center for the Global South at American University in Washington, the director, Clovis Maksoud, said that Mr. Holbrooke might strike the right chord with poorer nations, finding a way to line up their support, much of which has been lost in recent years because of fears of unrestrained American power.
Mr. Holbrooke is more willing than most diplomats to openly criticize African leaders and what he sees as slow-motion responses to crises. To underline the folly of neglecting AIDS in many countries, he said he will set aside a day for AIDS in Africa, particularly southern Africa.
"Some people wonder, why hold a Security Council meeting on a health issue?" he said. "There has never been a Security Council meeting on a health issue. The reason is simple. In Africa, in southern Africa, in countries like Namibia and South Africa, Zimbabwe and other countries, AIDS is far more than a health issue. It is jeopardizing the advances that these countries have made."
Mr. Holbrooke will be a relative newcomer to the Security Council, where he is seen only sporadically, and some diplomats wonder if he will have the patience to live by its peculiar rhythms for a month. He is a fierce critic of United Nations procedure, accusing the organization and many of the diplomats assigned to it with being more fascinated with process than principle.
At his news conference today, he took aim at the organization, which he said still needed a lot of reform -- a theme that Congressional Republicans always like to hear. He is impatient with the chain of command and the complex relationships among United Nations agencies. The Security Council and the Secretary General's office are on different wave lengths, he said.
He made his point with an anecdote: the collision of an event he had personally planned -- probably one of many taking place around the United Nations that day -- with a United Nations news conference to release a long-awaited report on mass killings of Muslims in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995.
"On Nov. 15, we had the three Bosnian presidents here, a historic meeting," he said. "In the exact middle of that event, you were summoned to a press conference to release the Srebrenica report. So I called up the Secretariat. I said why did you do that?" He found it hard to believe that United Nations officials claimed not to have known about his visitors. "It happens all the time," he complained.
In the last American presidency of the Security Council of the Clinton era, there will also be some performance diplomacy. Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is one of the most intractable critics of the United Nations, will be invited to sit in on the Council, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is chairman, will hold a hearing in New York, Mr. Holbrooke said. Half a dozen senators and about 30 representatives have already been his guests.
Politically motivated stunts? Well, maybe, a European said. But if this is what it takes to get a better hearing on Capitol Hill, then everybody might enjoy a little American politics.
"Perhaps we didn't do a good enough job on bringing Congress aboard on policy in the past," Mr. Holbrooke said in one of several careful asides hinting that he is not always in line with the administration's handling of foreign policy issues. He was also asked today why so many war criminals in Bosnia are still at large, in part because NATO officers have said it is not their job to pursue them.
"I will not share my thoughts with you on why they're at large," he told a reporter. "I find it very, very difficult. I've long taken the view that they must be brought to justice."
At the American mission to the United Nations, whose somewhat shabby 1950's style attests to congressional stinginess toward diplomacy, Mr. Holbrooke has assembled his own team of trusted colleagues from the past. A tough taskmaster with a gargantuan appetite for work, he provokes either winces and wounded feelings or a loyalty often couched in black humor. One of his top diplomats recalled at his swearing-in that he had worked for Ambassador Holbrooke "for 10 years, between 1994 and 1995."
Mr. Holbrooke plunged into United Nations activity playing from his own strengths. After checking in at the United States mission here only long enough to claim his new office in August, he left for the Balkans. There, he is well known. Mr. Holbrooke, who was ambassador to Germany in the early years of the first Clinton Administration, later wrote the 1995 Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia, and then browbeat and cajoled three distrustful parties -- Croats, Serbs and Bosnian Muslims -- into accepting it.
He is also remembered for having secured a celebrated cease-fire agreement from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia last October, only to see it violated, leading to an American-led bombing campaign this year. Mr. Holbrooke was characteristically blunt under criticism in June in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for having negotiated with the Serbian leader, an indicted war criminal and recipient of much vitriol from Washington.
He criticized the limits of his instructions -- the Clinton Administration did not want to commit itself to ground troops to ensure peace in Kosovo -- and added for good measure that he talks with Mr. Milosevic were hardly fun. "This isn't bridge or tennis," he said.
Back from the Balkans on Labor Day weekend, he stepped off the plane into the maelstrom of the crisis in East Timor following the region's vote for independence. A former assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Mr. Holbrooke was no stranger to the region. Within hours, he renewed as many contacts as he could muster on a holiday, from human rights experts to diplomats in the region. Then he turned his sights on the White House as well as the Security Council to plead for more of an outcry.
A week later, the Indonesians had agreed to international intervention.

INTERNATIONAL A3-22
 
Buoyed by Russia Balloting, Premier Prepares Agenda
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, with a mandate from Russian voters for the war on Chechnya, signaled that he would draw on his popularity to put his stamp on domestic issues. Two parties he endorsed won more than 30 percent of the votes cast in parliamentary elections last weekend, putting him within reach of a working majority. A22
 
Russian troops seized control of an airport on the outskirts of the Chechen capital, Grozny, and sent soldiers into Chechnya's southern mountains to open a new front in the war and cut rebel supply lines, officials and news agencies said. A22 

The Clinton administration asked the Export-Import Bank to delay $500 million in aid to a Russian oil company to protest continued resistance to economic reforms and, more obliquely, to step up pressure to end the Chechnya campaign. A20
 
NATO Arrests Bosnian Serb
Peacekeepers in Bosnia arrested Stanislav Galic, a former Bosnian Serb major general who has been accused of war crimes. He was charged in a sealed indictment issued by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. A14
 
Response to Kosovo Attacks
Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany, commander of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, ordered his soldiers back onto the streets in force, in the face of rising crime and the absence of a strong international police force. A14
 
German Ex-Leader Questioned

Rescue Effort in Venezuela
Military and civil defense units struggled to save survivors of heavy flooding and mudslides that struck the country's Caribbean coast last week. Estimates of the death toll varied widely, reflecting chaotic conditions in the devastated zone. A13
 
Macao Welcomes Troops
Chinese forces streamed into Macao, the new Chinese territory, in a joyful procession that revealed how deeply people yearn for law and order after the gangsterism that stained the last years of Portuguese colonial rule. A5
 
Sri Lanka Leader on the Mend

NATIONAL A24-29
 
Vermont Court Extends Marital Benefits to Gays
The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the state must guarantee the same protections and benefits to gay and lesbian couples that it does to heterosexual married couples. The court ordered the Legislature to legalize gay marriage, which no state has yet done, or adopt a domestic partnership law, which would be the most sweeping in the country. A1
 
Assessing Risk of Terror Attack
Federal authorities have concluded that an Algerian man arrested with bomb components as he tried to enter Washington State last week from Canada represented a serious terrorist threat, but are far from certain about the purpose or target of any possible attack. A24
 
U.S. Deports Six Cubans
Six of seven Cuban inmates involved in a hostage-taking in Louisiana last week were flown back to Cuba over the protests of state prosecutors, who said they should have been tried on kidnapping charges.

Court Faults City on Rule Limiting Sex Businesses
New York State's highest court ruled that the Giuliani administration had overstepped its bounds in trying to shut down pornography businesses, dealing a setback to the mayor's campaign to restrict X-rated bookstores and theaters. The decision did not address the 1995 city zoning law regulating where such businesses could operate but rather a regulation defining an "adult" business. A1

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Scientist at Work profile of Dr. Mark Plotkin was an unfortunately truncated picture of one of the most committed and effective individuals working for indigenous peoples, their cultures and the forests in which they live.
Yes, Mark Plotkin started out as a traditional ethnobotanist working in Suriname and the Amazon seeking indigenous knowledge that could be useful for modern medicine. 
 And, yes, he has ceased that approach. He did that not only because of the problem of low rates of "success" as measured by a drug going to market or because of issues surrounding intellectual property rights for indigenous knowledge but because as much as anyone, he is committed to these people and their cultures. His work has become a full-time effort to help these peoples protect their cultures and their knowledge and simultaneously protect the forests in which they live. That may be distant from his original approach, but it deserves real respect.

HEADLINE: Adviser to U.S. on Microsoft Likes to Avoid the Limelight

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
After 10 minutes with Robert F. Greenhill, a longtime Wall Street deal maker, it is clear why the Justice Department hired him to advise it on its negotiations with Microsoft.
Ask about his 20-year friendship with Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Citigroup and frequent dinner companion, and his answer is a firm "No comment." Question his role in some of this decade's largest corporate takeovers, like Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications or the restructuring of I.B.M., and he says, "I won't talk about that." And when queried about what it was like to run not one, but two, Wall Street firms, he dodges the question: "You don't really want to know, do you?" 
 After 37 years on Wall Street, Mr. Greenhill has joined the rarefied group of investment bankers who command the ear of America's corporate elite. Not only does he have a knack for wooing the most stubborn executives, but he has the drive to get them to the bargaining table. Still, while he delights in his role as matchmaker, he prefers to negotiate far from the eyes of a curious press and public. So it comes as no surprise to those who know him that the Justice Department sought his discretion in studying the financial impact of various proposals to resolve the antitrust case against Microsoft.
Besides, not many people on Wall Street have the stature to give counsel on the most important antitrust action in recent history. Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, needs help sifting through the technological and financial implications of each proposal. And if indeed Microsoft is fractured into pieces, Mr. Klein wants a name-brand executive to defend that decision before Congress.
But of the handful of eligible candidates Mr. Klein approached, who would be willing to do it? Almost every leading investment bank with any technology prowess has either worked with Microsoft or does not want to risk making such a powerful enemy. And smaller boutiques could not afford the task.
"Whoever comes forward has to be credible," said Charles Koob, an antitrust lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York. "Greenhill is credible."
Mr. Greenhill, who now owns a small investment firm, was attracted to the Microsoft assignment, in part, because it was an unusual challenge. And that is in keeping with his driven personality. Mr. Greenhill's recent interest in technology companies comes at an age, 63, when most executives are considering retirement. When he is not piloting one of his three airplanes, including a top-of-the-line jet, between homes in Greenwich, Conn., Maine and Nantucket, he can be found on his satellite phone with clients. (His wife pilots her own single-engine plane.) He took up golf in his late 50's and now boasts a solid 14 handicap. And on vacation, he pushes the limits, too, taking his family canoeing near the Arctic Circle or skiing in untainted wilderness.
But his true passion is negotiating deals. Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's chairman, knows that firsthand. In the spring of 1993, Mr. Greenhill called Mr. Redstone and suggested that they and Martin Davis, then Paramount's chairman, have dinner. Mr. Greenhill knew Mr. Redstone coveted Paramount's assets but after three years of trying had failed to strike a pact with Mr. Davis. Mr. Greenhill knew Mr. Davis well because he had advised on Paramount's unsuccessful $12 billion hostile bid for Time Inc. in 1989.
"I said, 'If you are asking what I think you are, it's not going to happen,' " Mr. Redstone said in a recent interview. "I didn't want to get involved." Still, the two chairmen agreed to meet and, as Mr. Redstone predicted, the ensuing months' negotiations were tortuous. More than once Mr. Greenhill dragged Mr. Redstone to the bargaining table against his will.
"Bob was absolutely persistent," Mr. Redstone said. "A couple of times I said, 'Leave it alone. It's not going to happen.' I even sent a telegram that said, 'Bob, back off.' " But he never did until the deal was done.
Such forcefulness engenders enemies, too. Wall Street executives are loath to criticize Mr. Greenhill publicly, but privately warn that he can wreak havoc. When he left Morgan Stanley in 1993 to become chairman of Smith Barney Shearson, as it was then named, he relentlessly pursued talented financiers at Morgan, angering old colleagues. His abrupt manner has bruised more than a few egos. And his zeal to win at any cost offends even his most avid supporters. "He can be like a bull in a china shop," said one banker who worked with him.
Mr. Greenhill attended Yale University, graduating in 1958. At first he thought of majoring in physics, then philosophy and finally, painting. His senior thesis, he said, was on Van Gogh's theory of color. And in perhaps his first "hostile takeover," he met his wife, Gayle, when she was on a blind date with his college roommate.
After two years in the Navy, he abandoned his paint brushes and headed for Harvard Business School. In 1962, M.B.A. in hand, he moved to New York and joined Morgan Stanley.
From the outset, his career was blessed. In 1970 he became a partner and set to work creating a mergers and acquisitions department that would become a powerhouse. He later ran investment banking and, in 1989, was made a vice chairman. Two years later he was named president.
But Mr. Greenhill's intensity was not suited for the corner office. In March 1993, after a weekend retreat in Utah with clients, Mr. Greenhill was ousted as president. He left the firm soon after, ending a 31-year career, and found refuge with his good friend Mr. Weill, who named him chairman of Smith Barney Shearson, then part of the Travelers Corporation. That job lasted only three years before Mr. Greenhill -- pocketing tens of millions of dollars in the process -- was again asked to step down, former colleagues said, in a management tussle over how the firm was being run. In 1996, he started the boutique Greenhill & Company.
Mr. Greenhill finds it difficult to reflect on his undistinguished career as a manager. But former colleagues say he lacks an innate ability to lead. When asked about it, he becomes unusually still, his hearty laugh silenced. "One of the pleasures of being in a small firm is you can focus on working with clients," he said, noting that he has only six partners now. "Helping clients is the thing I've liked doing all my life."
Mr. Greenhill got a call from Mr. Klein the week before Thanksgiving asking if he was interested in the Microsoft assignment. Executives from Greenhill & Company then met with Justice Department officials to understand exactly what was expected. They were told, said an executive involved in those discussions, that it would be Greenhill & Company's job to analyze the financial impact if Microsoft were ever split up.
Mr. Greenhill has a limited background in technology, although he advised I.B.M. on its restructuring in 1993 and includes Compaq Computer in his stable of clients. "He doesn't necessarily understand all the technology he is dealing with," said one banker who has worked with him.
Mr. Greenhill, too, wanted a well-defined role, which he accepted on Nov. 28. He will not say what his firm is being paid by the Justice Department, but industry executives say it is a flat fee that is "substantially less" than the millions his firm usually commands. So far he has assigned six bankers to the task.
One is Jeffrey Williams, a long-time colleague of Mr. Greenhill who once headed Morgan Stanley's telecommunications and media group and counseled AT&T. Colleagues describe Mr. Williams, a former architect, as technologically astute and detail-oriented, a perfect foil to Mr. Greenhill, whose strength is distilling mountains of research by subordinates into a coherent action plan.
Mr. Greenhill is not shy about worming his way into the action. Michael Levitt, a partner at the leveraged buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and a close friend who worked for Mr. Greenhill at Morgan Stanley and later Smith Barney, recalled the summer of 1997 when Hicks, Muse announced it was buying Lin Television for $1.4 billion. A banker from Morgan Stanley had brought Mr. Levitt the idea, which Mr. Greenhill later asked about. "He didn't call up and say 'What role can we play?' " Mr. Levitt said. "He called up and said he wanted to understand the broadcasting industry and why we were interested in it."
Few bankers can get much mileage from a phone call like that. But Mr. Greenhill called Mr. Levitt later and said Hicks, Muse should line up a partner, like NBC, in case another bidder emerged. Mr. Levitt agreed. So Mr. Greenhill called his Nantucket neighbor, Jack Welch, the chief executive of General Electric, which owns NBC, and set up a lunch at his summer home there for Robert Wright, NBC's chief executive, as well as executives for Hicks, Muse.
It was timely. Raycom Media, an Alabama-based company, offered to pay $1.7 billion for Lin. And the lunch meeting at Mr. Greenhill's led to a partnership between Hicks, Muse and NBC that topped Raycom with its own $1.9 billion offer. "That was Bob using his network of relationships to create opportunities for both of us," Mr. Levitt said.
And he is doing the same thing for his firm by advising the Justice Department. Greenhill & Company is increasingly interested in representing Internet companies, having helped counsel Compaq this year on the sale of its 83 percent stake in AltaVista, a Web search engine, to CMGI, a publicly traded company that invests in Internet ventures. And his involvement in the Microsoft assignment suggests that Mr. Greenhill does not want to lose his edge in the new economy.
"Bob wants to make sure the world knows he's not out of the game," said one executive who has worked with him. But do not ask about it; his answer is predictable.
"I'll play golf with you," Mr. Greenhill said, laughing. "But I won't talk about Microsoft."

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Exceeds Expectations With Record Operating Profit

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company reported record quarterly income of $1.63 billion yesterday, up 86 percent from its operating profit in the period a year earlier and well ahead of analysts' estimates.
In the first look at fourth-quarter results from a major Wall Street securities firm, the company said it earned $2.84 a diluted share. The profit was up from $1.49 a share a year earlier, when its operating income totaled $879 million, and was well ahead of the $1.96 a share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 "It's hard to argue with anything that they posted," said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group. "It's a blowout quarter." Mr. Strauss raised his estimate of Morgan Stanley's earnings 20 percent last month, to $2.10 a share, only to be topped by 35 percent. Yesterday, he raised his estimate for the firm's 2000 earnings to $9.10 from $8.15 a share.
Morgan Stanley also announced that in January it would split its shares 2 for 1 and increase its dividend, before the split, by 67 percent, to 40 cents a share. The firm said it planned to spend up to $1 billion buying back its stock. Its shares rose 93.75 cents, to $128.9375.
Morgan Stanley, like a rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, which reports its earnings today, is riding atop two powerful trends: a boom in new stock offerings, especially by Internet-based companies, and a wave of mergers and acquisitions involving European companies. Morgan Stanley ranks just behind Goldman this year in money raised through initial public offerings and in the value of announced mergers and acquisitions.
"The I.P.O. boom certainly plays an important role in the results of the quarter," said Robert Scott, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer. "We also had a record quarter in M & A with lots of activity in the U.S. and in Europe."
Mr. Scott said high levels of trading, especially stock trading, led to a 36 percent increase in commission revenue, to $786 million from $579 million in a depressed quarter a year earlier. Over all, the firm's profit from its securities businesses more than doubled, to $1.39 billion, in the quarter that ended Nov. 30.
The firm's 43 percent jump in revenue, to $5.66 billion for the quarter, surprised even the firm's management, analysts said. That was clear, they said, from how much the firm's compensation expenses shrunk.
Morgan Stanley set aside almost $1 billion less in employee compensation and benefits last quarter than the quarter before. Mr. Scott said the decrease was a result of the firm's practice of accruing money through the year to pay year-end bonuses. Those bonuses, which account for the bulk of annual pay for investment bankers and traders, will be paid in early January.
Traditionally, Morgan Stanley and its competitors pay about half of their revenues to their employees as salaries, bonuses and benefits. But, Mr. Scott said, Morgan Stanley had such a big year that it needed only 23 percent of this quarter's revenue -- 40 percent of the full year's revenue -- to pay competitive bonuses this year.
"They had such a stupendous year, if they had paid out 49 percent of this year's revenue, it would clearly argue that the business doesn't have economies of scale," said Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Ms. Solotar said the markets gained strength well into December, confounding most industry insiders, who thought investors would pull back in fear of Year 2000 problems. "Even those who weren't bearish thought it would be significantly slower," she said. "But money is still flowing into the markets."
Morgan Stanley's expenses aside from compensation were higher last quarter, Mr. Strauss said. He said some of the increase went toward technology and marketing for the firm's new iChoice online trading operation.
Mr. Scott said it was too soon to gauge the success of iChoice, but he said the firm was pleased that of the online accounts opened since the October introduction, 70 percent were for new customers and only 30 percent were transfers from the firm's traditional brokerage operation.

HEADLINE: Russia Votes, Like It or Not

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The West has long seen the development of democracy in Russia as a check against the Kremlin's military ambitions and a way to bridge the political divide between East and West.
But consider the results of Russia's parliamentary elections: millions went to the polls and demonstrated their support for the war in Chechnya, despite its apparent brutality, by voting for candidates backed by Vladimir V. Putin, the hawkish prime minister closely associated with the war. 
 Western governments, especially the United States, have run into many difficulties in trying to deal with the new Russia: corrupt tycoons, die-hard Communists and an enfeebled president. But now they have found themselves squarely at odds with the Russian public.
The widespread backing for the war -- and Mr. Putin's personal popularity, which soared as the situation in Chechnya got more brutal -- not only reduces the already minuscule chance for a political accommodation in Chechnya. It also suggests a broad shift in Russian public sentiment toward a more nationalist, if pro-capitalist, stance.
"Putin will take this as an endorsement of his policy and wage the war even more fiercely," said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst. "Democracy is not a guarantee against many nasty things."
Certainly, many Russians had reason to be concerned that Chechnya had turned into a lawless region of marauders and kidnappers. The trouble in the Caucasus region began in August when Islamic militants stormed into neighboring Dagestan. Later, apartment houses in Moscow and other Russian cities were blown up by terrorists, acts for which most Russians believe Chechen militants are responsible.
Mr. Putin also benefits from the Russian political psyche that hankers for a strongman: a political leader who can bring the country's disputatious regions to heel, force people to work and ensure that pensions are paid on time.
As a former intelligence chief, untainted by allegations of corruption and relatively new to politics, Mr. Putin seems to fit that bill.
But the way in which the current Chechnya campaign was turned into a major election-year asset, with a largely sympathetic Russian press playing down reports of civilian and military casualties while highlighting the army's heroic advances on the battlefield, was not supposed to be in the democracy lesson book.
In the past, Russian and Soviet military operations were perceived by the West as the adventures of secretive cabals, which the public would oppose if only it could.
When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Western governments assailed the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, and when the Yeltsin government dispatched the Russian Army into Grozny during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, critics blamed a small Kremlin clique.
This time, whether the Chechnya campaign is considered a just fight against terrorism or a politically expedient war that has needlessly endangered civilians, it is different in this respect: many Russians believe that it is necessary and, as in any democratic society, share in the responsibility.
The election returns indicate as much. The Unity Party, which received 23 per cent of the votes cast for political parties, was established by the Kremlin only months ago. What gave it strength was its endorsement by Mr. Putin.
The Union of Right Forces, a pro-capitalist group, also did better than expected, with 9 percent. Led by Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister, it received an enormous boost when Mr. Putin publicly praised its economic program.
Probably few voters knew what the economic program consisted of, but the campaign ads of a smiling Mr. Kiriyenko meeting with Mr. Putin was enough to bring in the votes.
By contrast, the only party that even remotely challenged the wisdom of the war, Yabloko, led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, fared poorly at the polls, garnering only 6 percent.
"There was a chance to change the situation in 1999," Mr. Yavlinsky said ruefully on Sunday night. "But it did not happen. War, it seems, is a narcotic that can drown out all political problems."
The election results present a mixed message for the West. The good news is that the success of Unity and the Union of Right Forces broke the Communists' control of Parliament. That in turn increased the prospects for legislation to encourage investment and reform the tax system.
The bad news is that Russia's economic reformers are no longer the fair-haired boys they used to be, at least in the eyes of the West. To boost their parliamentary fortunes, they talked tougher than Russia's most hard-line generals and turned a deaf ear to the Western officials they once courted.
"Destruction of terrorism in Chechnya is, of course, the basis of continued support for Putin," declared Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Kremlin aide and architect of the Union of Right Forces' strategy.
And much of the Russian public seems to be hostile to Western opinion, at least if the voting results are any guide. But having urged Russia to embrace democracy, Western spokesmen could only applaud the elections -- if not the message they sent regarding the war.
That will not necessarily stop Washington from complaining about Russian policy on Chechnya. But it left officials in Washington groping for a response today.
"It says something about the system in Russia," said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, "where elections are becoming more common, where the turnout is so strong and the democratic institutions, regardless of, you know, what you think of who won and who lost, have become accepted as the norm, and that's a positive."
Asked whether the election results, and their endorsement of the Chechnya policy, would make it harder for the United States to bring pressure to bear on the Kremlin over the war, Mr. Lockhart said: "Well, I don't know. I mean, obviously the domestic political audience may view it different than the international community does."

High Bond Yields Hurt Dow, But Technology Shares Rise
Rising long-term interest rates hurt some segments of the stock market as concerns mounted about what Federal Reserve policy makers might do about interest rates at a meeting today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 6.44 percent from 6.37 percent on Friday. 
 Stocks seen as sensitive to rising interest rates, like financial-services companies, helped to pull down the Dow Jones industrial average by 113.16 points, or 1 percent, to 11,144.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.94 points, to 1,418.09, but demand for technology stocks remained intense, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 30.81 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,783.87, a record.

Putting a Good Face on Profits
The punishment that stocks regularly endure when profits come in shy of forecasts, even by the tiniest amount, has put managements under pressure to deliver upbeat earnings announcements even if the numbers do not support them. The result, according to some Wall Street accounting experts, is that more and more companies are going to extremes to paint a rosy picture of their operations. A1.

I.R.S. Official Accused of Favoritism
The top Internal Revenue Service official in Northern California repeatedly gave wealthy and politically connected taxpayers unwarranted breaks including reduced tax bills, a refund, and deferred payments in 1996 and 1997, the government's former chief tax collector for the district testified. Peter W. Coons, tax collection chief for Northern California from 1995 until he was removed in February 1998, testified at a hearing where he is trying to get his job back under a federal law that protects whistle-blowers. The Internal Revenue Service contends that Mr. Coons was fired for looking at 253 Web sites on his government computer, five of them featuring images of naked women. Mr. Coons says the allegations are a smoke screen to obscure the real reason for his removal. C2.

HEADLINE: In Libel Case, Court Rules 'Public Concern' Is a Factor

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
In a decision that could broaden protection from libel suits, New York's highest court issued a ruling yesterday making it more difficult for people to sue news organizations over articles that disclose details of their private lives provided the articles raise issues of "legitimate public concern."
The unanimous ruling by the State Court of Appeals involved a libel lawsuit filed by Charles Huggins, the former husband of the singer Melba Moore, over a series of articles published in The Daily News in 1993. The articles chronicled the couple's bitter divorce and Ms. Moore's accusation that her husband, who was her manager, had committed "economic spousal abuse" by ruining her career and bankrupting her. 
 Mr. Huggins sued The Daily News and Ms. Moore for $90 million, asserting that her statements were false, his reputation had been destroyed and their divorce was a private matter. Yesterday's ruling focused on what standard Mr. Huggins would have to prove in court to win his libel case.
The case sets a precedent because lower courts had ruled that while Ms. Moore was a public figure, her former husband was not. Under New York law, people deemed public figures must prove that a news organization's account was malicious before a libel suit can proceed, but others must prove only that a news organization was negligent, a lower standard.
In an initial victory for Mr. Huggins, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled in April that the couple's divorce was a private matter and that to win he only needed to prove that The Daily News had been negligent in printing the articles.
But in its unanimous opinion yesterday, the Court of Appeals reversed that ruling. Judge Howard Levine wrote that because the articles raised an issue of public concern -- what Ms. Moore called "the black-on-black crime of economic spousal abuse" -- Mr. Huggins would have to prove in court that the newspaper was "grossly irresponsible" in printing the articles, a far higher standard.
Lawyers for The Daily News and other New York news organizations hailed the decision yesterday. "The net effect of this opinion is that the flow of information in the state will be protected," said Eve Burton, deputy general counsel for The Daily News.
Sixteen news organizations, including The New York Times, The Associated Press, The Dow Jones Company, ABC, NBC and CBS filed legal papers urging the state's highest court to overturn the lower court ruling.
Bradley C. Rosen, the lawyer representing Mr. Huggins, said the ruling would give the news media free reign to report on people's private lives and then claim that the articles raised important social issues.
"This means that the most private aspects of a person's life can be reported on and arguably declared a matter of public concern," he said. "Whether it is a private person's very private divorce or a person getting a jaywalking ticket."
Mr. Rosen said that Mr. Huggins would still go to trial in the case.
Under the State Constitution and a series of rulings by the Court of Appeals, news media in New York generally enjoy far more protection from libel suits than news organizations in other states. Richard N. Winfield, a lawyer for The Associated Press who drafted the joint legal papers filed by the 16 media organizations, said there was concern that the appeals court could have eroded those protections.
But in his opinion, Judge Levine criticized the lower court with strong language. "Absent clear abuse, the courts will not second-guess editorial decisions as to what constitutes matters of genuine public concern," Judge Levine wrote. "The Appellate Division did not accord the deference to editorial judgment our decisions require."

HEADLINE: Playing the Field for Phone Service;
With Many Suitors, Customers Turn Fickle to Get Best Deal

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
Imelda Marcos picking out yet another pair of shoes. Patricia Duff running through five teams of divorce lawyers. Donald Trump and his succession of leggy blondes. In the annals of the fickle, some people are giants.
But alas, even among ordinary mortals, there has never been a shortage of caprice, whether in matters of the heart or the head, or in these modern times, matters close to the ear and the lips. That is to say, telephone service. 
 Every day, countless people jilt their phone companies and then embrace another in a kind of mating ritual that makes marketing executives stare at their ceilings at night. There are usually few warning signs before the split. It's not as if most callers can complain of egregious lapses like being cut off in midsentence.
Instead, after years of being stuck with one or two choices, telephone customers have suddenly become the belles of the ball. They are courted by dozens of phone companies, each dangling enticements like free calling time, frequent-flier miles and even $100 checks that come unsolicited in the mail.
"It's a kind of game that you play," said Ninon Rogers, 27, an actress in Greenwich Village who has switched phone companies five times in five years. "It is worth it because you get the same service for less money -- and sometimes outright cash."
A quick glance at Ms. Rogers's dance card: She signed up with Sprint in 1995, but was lured away by a $100 check from AT&T. In 1997, she bit at MCI's offer of 3,000 frequent-flier miles on Continental Airlines, but then settled again for Sprint because the international rates were lower. Last year, she was wooed back to AT&T with the 10-cents-a-minute plan for domestic calls.
Ms. Rogers is just the sort of disloyal customer who has helped stimulate a fierce competition in the telecommunications industry and drive the cost of phone calls down to just a few pennies per minute. A recent marketing survey of 12,185 households nationwide by J. D. Power & Associates showed that 31 percent switched their long-distance service at least once this year compared with 26 percent in 1997.
"I think the industry has created its own monster because companies keep topping each other," said Kirk Parsons, director of telecommunications accounts at J. D. Power. "Brand loyalty doesn't matter any more; what drives the consumer is cost. The way the rate is going down, in a couple of years, long distance is going to be free."
Well, not quite. But in this freewheeling buyer's market for telephone service, New Yorkers seeking to play the field have never had so many suitors -- or so many tangled offers that seem to promise one thing and turn out to be quite another.
In the past year, AT&T, MCI Worldcom, Sprint and a host of upstart companies have leased local lines from Bell Atlantic and started offering what is basically the same service. They have dangled sign-up bonuses like two free hours every month for six months (AT&T), a three-hour phone card picturing two cuddly polar bears (MCI Worldcom), frequent-flier miles and a $10 credit at Radio Shack stores (Sprint).
And they have pursued new customers in unlikely places. At the New York City Marathon last month, for example, Sprint banners heralded an unlimited local calling plan while workers passed out cellular phones for runners to make free calls. A local competitor, Z-Line, gave out plastic key chains and glossy cards that read, "Rudy. Hillary. Z-Line. New Yorkers love a choice."
The Web site Priceline.com, after letting customers name a price for airline tickets, hotel rooms and groceries, plans to do the same thing early next year for long-distance rates. Customers will be able to buy blocks of time from companies willing to match their bids.
But all these options leave some consumers simply flustered. They complain that calling plans are convoluted and seem to benefit those who scramble for the best deal rather than those who stand by their plan. Slick advertising campaigns sometimes leave crucial details like monthly fees and restrictions on calling times to the fine print.
"People are busy, and the phone companies take advantage," said Cindy McIntyre, publisher of The Frugal Gazette in Newtown, Conn., who advises her readers to call the phone companies every six months for the latest offers.
Even Jules Polonetsky, the commissioner of consumer affairs for New York City, seemed baffled by it all. He spent 45 minutes last month comparing his phone plan with half a dozen others before throwing up his hands. "It's more complicated than applying for a mortgage," Mr. Polonetsky declared, after ending up where he started: with his current company, Excel.
Some people are just looking for a down-to-earth relationship with their phone company, but that is increasingly hard to find. Lawrence Whiteside, 63, a building consultant in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, was nearly persuaded to switch by a letter from AT&T that promised what it called virtually unlimited local calling -- 75 hours a month -- and 7 cents a minute for long-distance calls, all for $24.90 a month. He had to call the company to find out that charges were rounded up to the next minute and that his fax line would cost extra -- pushing the price to $45 a month.
. "I'm looking for simplicity at the same time that I'm trying to save money," Mr. Whiteside said. "I don't want to spend half an hour going through a bill; that's too much like work."
Like Mr. Whiteside, many phone customers stay faithful to the company they know, if only because switching seems like too much trouble. For instance, Judy Langer, 58, a focus-group moderator in Manhattan, routinely ducks calls from telemarketers. "I'm not a comparison shopper," said Ms. Langer, who spends about $50 a month with MCI Worldcom. "It's a relatively minor expense, and we've been satisfied with the quality of service."
But an increasing number of people, either because they have more time, or less money, or both, are on the prowl for better deals. They scour the mail for the latest offers and compare notes with their friends. Several self-styled phone experts have even set up Web sites comparing the various pricing plans.
"Anything that's over $100 -- whether it's the cost of using it over a year or a one-time purchase -- I'm going to spend time on it," said Rich Sayers, an advertising sales manager from Martinez, Calif., who runs 10-10phonerates.com -- a Web site he created in May to compare 10-10 dial-in numbers that charge by the call and do not require monthly fees. The site logged 80,000 visits last month.
Still, some bargain hunters can be downright bashful about their obsession. John Williams, 32, switched from AT&T to MCI Worldcom in October after calculating that he would save $10 a month, or $120 a year. But he hesitates to brag about it for fear that he will sound like a "cheap date."
"You can really save a lot of money, but you have to sweat the details," said Mr. Williams, a computer consultant on the Upper West Side who also admits to clipping coupons. "It sounds ridiculous, I know, but every little bit helps, especially in this city."
Others offer no apologies for their love-'em-and-leave-'em attitude toward phone service.
Arlene Burgos, 27, a lawyer in Manhattan, said she saved hundreds of dollars by switching phone companies every six months in law school, raking in $100 checks and ever-lower rates. "They've never offered the $100 check right away," Ms. Burgos said, "but the more you held out, the more incentives they threw at you."
She recently saw an opportunity when an AT&T telemarketer offered to waive the monthly fee for the 5-cents-a-minute weekend rate if she left MCI. Instead, Ms. Burgos called MCI and asked for the same deal without having to go through the trouble of switching. Her company now mails her a $5 check every month to cover its fee.
"It doesn't hurt to ask," she said. "Your phone company is not going to call you and tell you that other people pay less for the same service."
Lately, Ms. Rogers, the actress, has been quarreling with AT&T over the $4.95 monthly fee for her discount phone rate. When she complains about it, the company removes it from her bill to keep her from leaving. Several months later, the fee will quietly reappear. And then she picks up the phone again.
When the day comes that AT&T refuses to drop the charge, she knows she will have to make good on her threat. "Ultimately, the reason I'd be switching is to switch back to AT&T at a later date," she said.
Spurned companies, Ms. Rogers confided, always offer the best deals.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Investor Is Accused of Fraud Over Azerbaijan Venture

BYLINE: By STEVE LEVINE

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
 An investment promoter who made a fortune from questionable stock dealings in his native Czech Republic years ago has now been accused of fraud in an Azerbaijan venture that has attracted $450 million from foreign investors. Some investors are prominent Americans, including former Senator George J. Mitchell and Leon G. Cooperman, a Wall Street fund manager.
The fraud accusation against Viktor Kozeny was contained in a civil lawsuit filed Friday in London by one of the investors, Marlwood Commercial Inc., a subsidiary of the American International Group, a diversified insurance company. The suit seeks $15 million, the amount of Marlwood's investment. 
 The High Court in London sealed the suit, but some details were disclosed Monday in a routine notification filed with the High Court clerk's office. The filing said there were fraud and breach of duty involving the long-stalled privatization program of Azerbaijan, an oil-rich Caspian Sea nation. 
 The lawsuit asserted that Mr. Kozeny fraudulently convinced investors they could buy, among other properties, part of the extremely valuable Azerbaijan state oil company, a concern that Azeri officials say they never promised to sell. In addition, the lawsuit asserted, Mr. Kozeny grossly inflated the price of privatization ''options'' necessary for bidding on the properties, charging investors $25 apiece when he paid as little as 25 cents apiece.
 In all, the lawsuit said, some of Mr. Kozeny's clients say their investment has plummeted to less than 10 percent of its original value, or a loss exceeding $400 million.
 Richard D'Alessandri, a lawyer for the American International Group, said the company would not comment on its lawsuit, which has also been filed in the Bahamas. Legal action was taken in London and the Bahamas because Mr. Kozeny owns property in those places that plaintiffs could move to seize.
 The group of about 30 American investors also included the real estate billionaire Richard Friedman, who owns a Martha's Vineyard estate where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have vacationed, and Frederick Bourke, chairman of Dooney & Bourke, the handbag company. 
 With $180 million in investments from institutional and other clients, Mr. Cooperman, chairman of New York-based Omega Advisors, is thought to have the greatest exposure to the Azerbaijan venture. Mr. Cooperman is not a party to the suit, though he said in a telephone interview that ''it doesn't mean we can't be down the road.'' 
 Mr. Cooperman said he and Mr. Kozeny were no longer working together. Mr. Cooperman also said he was still trying to persuade the Azerbaijan government to proceed with a significant privatization. The Azerbaijan government recently said it would do so, but would not yet include any part of the state oil company. Diplomats have described the company as a lucrative source of cash in a corrupt government that is unlikely to be sold anytime soon.
 ''Viktor brought us the investment through a friend,'' Mr. Cooperman said. ''We were not happy with his deportment. He became a lightning rod of resentment in the country. So we went our separate way.''
 Some of the Americans have described the Harvard-educated Mr. Kozeny, 36, as a gifted, charismatic salesman. He has attracted as much publicity for his spending binges as his investment promotions, including a 1997 London meal on which he spent $20,000, including $8,000 for a bottle of wine.
 Mr. Kozeny owns a mansion in London and a ski chalet in Aspen, Colo., though he usually lives on the Bahamas island of Lyford Cay. Several attempts to call Mr. Kozeny on Lyford Cay were unsuccessful. His lawyer, Jacqueline Miller, did not return three phone calls to her office in Palm Beach, Fla.
 The Azerbaijan affair bears a resemblance to one earlier this decade involving Mr. Kozeny in the Czech Republic, from which he came to the United States as a teenager. 
 Starting in 1991, Mr. Kozeny went on television and promised enormous returns for Czech citizens who turned over their privatization coupons -- every adult was entitled to them -- to the company he then ran, Harvard Capital and Consulting. 
 About 800,000 Czechs eventually did so. By 1996, Mr. Kozeny had earned a fortune estimated to exceed $200 million, while his clients' investment had plummeted. Some press articles called Mr. Kozeny the Pirate of Prague, a title that endures there.
 A Czech government investigation resulted in a finding of wrongdoing by his company, which was fined and ordered to reimburse $6.8 million of investors' money improperly spent on advertising and consulting fees. Mr. Kozeny was never criminally charged with fraud.
 In 1997, Mr. Kozeny shifted his attention to Azerbaijan. That year in Aspen, Mr. Kozeny was host to a party where, according to several accounts, he delivered an extremely vivid account of a coming windfall in Azerbaijan privatization.
 Mr. Kozeny said he intended to buy the gems of the Azerbaijan economy -- the telecommunications company, the natural gas distribution company and, especially, the state oil company, known by its acronym, Socar. With its refineries, pipelines and oil fields, Socar is said to be worth well into the billions of dollars. Those who heard the pitch told friends, and Mr. Kozeny suddenly had much American investment.
 In Baku, Mr. Kozeny's company, the Minaret Group, rented two floors in the Landmark, one of the most expensive office buildings in the Azerbaijan capital, which was then booming. Although Baku as yet had no stock market, he built a ''trading floor'' of computer banks.
 Mr. Mitchell, who invested an undisclosed sum, appeared in April 1998 as Mr. Kozeny's marquee guest at Minaret's catered grand opening at Baku's premier hotel. Mr. Mitchell's Washington law office said the former senator was traveling today and was unavailable for immediate comment.
 Shortly after the Minaret Group established itself, Azeri officials began delaying the privatization. Earlier this year, Minaret abandoned much of its office space, and condensed its operations into three rooms in the Landmark. Correction: January 13, 200, Thursday
 An article in Business Day on Dec. 22 about Viktor Kozeny, a promoter of a foreign investment fund in Azerbaijan, overstated the wealth of Richard Friedman, an American investor who participated in the fund. Mr. Friedman says he is not a billionaire.

HEADLINE: November Budget Gap Rises to $27 Billion

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The government recorded a $27.6 billion budget deficit in November, surpassing the $16.9 billion shortfall posted for the corresponding month of 1998, when Social Security checks were sent out in late October because Nov. 1 fell on a Sunday.
The Treasury Department said today that November's revenue totaled $121.4 billion while expenditures came to $149 billion. 
 For the first two months of the 2000 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the government is running a deficit of $54 billion.
A budget surplus is still expected for all of the current fiscal year, however. The Clinton administration is predicting a $142.5 billion surplus for the 2000 fiscal year and $168.2 billion in 2001.
For the 1999 fiscal year, the government reported a record surplus of $123.6 billion.
In November, the biggest spending categories were Social Security, $35 billion; Health and Human Services Department programs, $30.5 billion; interest on the public debt, $25.7 billion; and military spending, $21.5 billion.
Government revenue from individual income tax payments in November came to $57.5 billion. So far this fiscal year, individual income tax revenue has totaled $120.9 billion, compared with $111.6 billion for the corresponding 1998 period.
Corporate income tax payments totaled $1.7 billion in November. So far this fiscal year, corporate income tax payments came to $3.8 billion, compared with $5.2 billion for the 1998 period.

HEADLINE: Former Aide To Franco Challenged In Galicia

BYLINE: By AL GOODMAN 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain

 BODY:
Manuel Fraga Iribarne, Francisco Franco's propaganda chief in the 1960's, is the only veteran of the old fascist dictatorship who still holds high elected office in democratic Spain.
Mr. Fraga has been president of his native Galicia in northwest Spain for nearly a decade, but as he turned 77 in November a fierce battle to succeed him was brewing here in the regional capital. 
 On the inside track are conservatives in Spain's governing Popular Party, which Mr. Fraga himself founded in 1989 after repeatedly failing to win election as prime minister after Franco's death in 1975.
On the outside are upstart progressives, who for the first time won control of most of Galicia's big cities last June. They say that despite Mr. Fraga's latter-day democratic credentials, which include helping to write Spain's Constitution of 1978, he rules relatively poor Galicia like a fief.
To all, Mr. Fraga's steely gaze and sly grin send a message not to expect a disappearing act. He shows every indication of seeking a fourth consecutive term in the regional elections due by 2001.
"My succession has come up, logically, because of my age and my years of service," Mr. Fraga told Spain's largest-circulation newspaper, El Pais, recently. "But it has been made clear that my succession is not open."
A top aide, Jesus Parga Lopez, put it more succinctly: "He is his own successor."
And Galicia's fiery opposition leader, Xose Manuel Beiras, is convinced that Mr. Fraga "wants to continue and die with his boots on."
Which may not surprise many people in this rainy, hilly corner of Spain near the Atlantic. Mr. Fraga's staying power recalls other leaders with Galician roots. The region produced Franco, who ran Spain for 36 years, and it was also the birthplace of Fidel Castro's father, who emigrated to Cuba, which his son has run for nearly 41 years.
The Communist Mr. Castro and Mr. Fraga may be ideological opposites but they have celebrated their shared Galician heritage during visits to to each other's territories.
As Galicia's president, roughly equivalent to a United States governor, Mr. Fraga has traveled to 28 nations to promote his region and is sometimes treated like a head of state.
His aides say that these trips, criticized by the opposition, have produced huge gains for Galicia's fishing, agricultural and industrial companies. But Mr. Fraga's economic counselor, Jose Antonio Orza, conceded that his department had never actually calculated the financial benefits.
Mr. Fraga is not the longest-serving of Spain's 17 regional government leaders; his counterparts in Catalonia, Extremadura and New Castile have held office longer. But Mr. Fraga is unique for his link to Franco, whom he served as minister of information and tourism and later as ambassador to Britain.
The Franco connection hampered Mr. Fraga's four bids to become prime minister, and the job of moving the Spanish right toward the political center finally went to his protege, the current prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar.
Mr. Fraga retreated to Galicia, a region of 2.7 million people, and has been elected three times with comfortable majorities. He has presided over increasing prosperity for Galicia at a time when Madrid has given it, and other regions, more home-rule powers in areas like education and health.
"Fraga is incredibly efficient at image-making," said Emilio Perez Tourino, secretary general of Galicia's Socialist Party. "He has been capable of making himself the symbol of this changing Galicia."
But the Socialists and Mr. Beiras's leftist Galician Nationalist Bloc have buried their differences recently to form a joint threat to Mr. Fraga, like pooling their resources to wrest control of the big city halls.
Other potential successors come from within the Popular Party, where analysts say that a longtime Fraga aide, Jose Cuina, heads a faction strong in rural Galicia, while Madrid's conservatives are pushing an aide to Prime Minister Aznar, Mariano Rajoy, who represents the urbane, better-educated Galicians.
Mr. Rajoy, the minister of education and culture, announced in November that the national government would soon invest nearly $1 billion for long-sought railroad improvements in Galicia.
Mr. Rajoy's news conference did not include Mr. Fraga, who was preparing to leave for another overseas trip, to Brazil. But the next day, a new opinion poll said Mr. Fraga was still the best-rated leader in Galicia.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Retail-Office Complex Reflects Groton's Rebound

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
When Michael B. Dunn began putting together a 10-acre parcel off Route 1 in Groton, Conn., in the mid-1980's, his initial thought was to put up a self-storage business. But as the region began to experience a renaissance, he reconsidered his plans.
Today, a $14 million development called the Gateway to Groton is taking shape on the site. An Applebee's restaurant has opened on the corner of Route 1 and Colver Court, an 80-room Hampton Inn is under construction on the front part of the property, and land clearing is under way for a 27,000-square-foot office complex at the rear of the property. 
 The region had been sharply affected by defense cutbacks that had an impact on the Navy's submarine base and related contractors like Electric Boat, but Mr. Dunn noted that it had since recovered.
"Ten years ago, this whole region was entirely dependent on defense, from the submarine base to Electric Boat," he said. "The local economy today is a lot stronger, a lot more diverse."
Some developers in the region are saying commercial property throughout the region is experiencing the "Pfizer effect," for Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant that has its world research headquarters in Groton and is building almost 800,000 square feet of new space in neighboring New London.
Real estate agents say there is considerable interest in retail projects that may benefit from the traffic that the Pfizer development is expected to generate. In addition, office complexes like the 350,000-square-foot Shaw's Cove in New London had vacancy rates as high as 50 percent in the early 1990's, when the defense industry was in decline, and now are fully occupied, with much of the space taken by Pfizer or some of the companies that support it.
"It may be the Pfizer effect, but there are a lot of other things driving the interest in commercial property in that area as well," said James Butler, director of the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Council of Governments and a former Groton town planner. For instance, the rapidly expanding Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos are 20 minutes away, and business at Electric Boat is stabilizing for the first time in a decade.
Kiran C. Parekh, who is developing the Hampton Inn, said there were other benefits to the location of the Gateway to Groton project.
"There are a couple of other big businesses right close by, the Navy base right up Route 12, the Avery Point campus of the University of Connecticut -- all of those are going to be big traffic generators," he said. "We think there was the market for at least 100 rooms, but we couldn't fit that many on the site."
Whatever the reason, Mr. Dunn proposed the right project at the right time, according to those involved.
"That property sat vacant for years and years," said Timothy Londregan of Londregan Real Estate in New London. "It had a history of vacancy, and a reputation that nobody could do anything with it." But when he began marketing the property for a small hotel this year, he said, "we had all the corporate people from a number of the big national chains in here, and there was a lot of interest."
Mr. Butler, the former Groton planner, proposed the name Gateway to Groton because the site is just off Interstate 95 on Route 1, between the town's two main commercial districts, one to the north of the highway, and one to the south.
Mr. Dunn began assembling the property almost 15 years ago, buying several smaller parcels, including some land that had been approved for a shopping center before the developer withdrew from the project, a couple of small residential properties and a former boat sales yard with frontage on Route 1.
"We were worried about the environmental aspects because of lead paint and engine repairs, but we did the analysis and everything was clean," Mr. Dunn said.
He was also busy obtaining the necessary zoning permits, and authorization from the State Traffic Commission to add a traffic light and widen the street in front of the complex.
"We were working on all the approvals at the same time we were marketing the property, and had all the permits in hand by the time everyone came in, so no one was starting from ground zero," Mr. Dunn said. "They all had a running start and were able to get in the ground pretty quickly."
Mr. Londregan said the T. L. Cannon Company in Buffalo was developing the restaurant, "But once we put it under contract to Applebee's, I had a host of restaurant chains tell me that if the deal fell through, they wanted the next chance to develop it."
Stephanie Griffin, a spokeswoman for Cannon, which operates 28 Applebee's restaurants throughout New York and Connecticut, said that the company was looking at a number of Connecticut locations but that the Groton site attracted its interest because of its high traffic counts -- 30,000 cars a day pass by the property -- and its large daytime population of workers at local businesses.
At least one part of the Gateway to Groton is directly linked to the Pfizer development. The Ledge Light Community Federal Credit Union, organized to serve Pfizer employees and their families, has been told that its lease on the Pfizer research campus will not be renewed next year because the space is needed, so it will build new offices in the Gateway project.
Ledge Light will consolidate its customer service office in Groton and its administrative offices in New London into a single location. The credit union hopes to move into the new quarters by next September.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Soars Above 3,900 as Fed Leaves Rates Alone

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Two broad stock market gauges leaped to records yesterday, with the bulk of the gains coming after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged and kept its neutral stance toward future increases.
The gains were particularly pronounced in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which registered its biggest one-day point gain ever. 
 The Nasdaq, which was up early in the session, jumped an additional 30 points after the Fed announced that it was not raising interest rates and that it was remaining neutral about a further increase.
Led by Internet companies like CMGI and Yahoo, the Nasdaq continued to climb, broke through the 3,900 barrier for the first time and closed at 3,911.15, a gain of 127.28, or 3.4 percent. With yesterday's gains, the Nasdaq is now up 78.4 percent for the year.
"We don't have a clue why this is happening, and everyone is amazed by it," said Steven C. Witt, a managing director at Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif., which has about $2.3 billion invested in technology stocks.
"We know there will be a correction at some point, but interest in technology has spread to a much, much broader audience than previously. What is going on is more than momentum investors piling into stocks that have worked in the past."
Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock research firm, echoed those comments.
"This is not a mania, because it is so broad and so deep," he said. "This is more than that, even though I don't know how to classify it."
About a year ago, Mr. Birinyi forecast that the Nasdaq would peak at 2,800 in 1999, a prediction that most on Wall Street viewed as wildly optimistic.
The Fed's decision to stand pat also helped to fuel gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks.
The S.& P. 500 climbed 15.34 points, or 1.1 percent, to a record 1,433.43, led by Microsoft and General Electric, the two largest companies by market value.
The Dow, which was lower early in the day, rallied after the Fed announcement and closed at 11,200.54, up 56.27 points, or 0.5 percent. And the Russell 2000 index had a solid day, gaining 8.60 points, or 1.8 percent, to 475.79.
CMGI, the Internet holding company, and Qualcomm were two of the Nasdaq's biggest stars.
CMGI catapulted 47 13/16, to 270, after Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, initiated coverage with an "accumulate" rating.
And Qualcomm, a phone and semiconductor maker, gained 30 1/16, to 496 7/8. The stock was lifted by optimism that Motorola or Nokia would buy its wireless phone unit.
"People are making a bet that analysts are going to be raising fourth-quarter earnings estimates early next year," said Michael Molnar, a managing director in sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
"Rising interest rates will be the catalyst of a correction, and that will become more and more of an issue in the second quarter. But the prospects for the first quarter are great."

HEADLINE: Central Bank's Statement

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged:
The Federal Open Market Committee made no change today in its target for the federal funds rate. 
 Based on the available evidence, however, the committee remains concerned with the possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth. Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance.
Nonetheless, in light of market uncertainties associated with the century date change, the committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in order to indicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be ensuring a smooth transition into the year 2000. At its next meeting the committee will assess available information on the likely balance of supply and demand, conditions in financial markets, and the possible need for adjustment in the stance of policy to contain inflationary pressures.

HEADLINE: Vermonters Would Keep Lid on Ben & Jerry's Pint

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 17

 BODY:
A poignant cry is rising from many a Vermonter's heart these days, a plaint for local purity in the face of cold cash and the forces of globalization: "Say it ain't so, Ben and Jerry!"
Ever since Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. announced on Dec. 2 that it had received "indications of interest" from potential buyers and was considering them, the entreaties of "Don't sell out!" have sounded from the Statehouse to the Internet to the streets of this lakeside city where the company began in 1978 as a little ice cream shop in a converted gas station. 
 Perhaps no other for-profit company is so known for its green, community-oriented virtue, typified by the 7.5 percent of pre-tax profits it gives away. It would be hard to name another company as symbiotically synonymous with its state. Ben & Jerry's sweet, dappled-and-tie-dyed image helps market Vermont, and vice versa, says Gov. Howard Dean.
"Anywhere I go in the country or the world," said Dr. Dean, who is fighting the possible sale, "When you say, 'I'm from Vermont,' they say 'Ben & Jerry's!' So it really is a signature corporation for the state."
And the state is reacting in its signature utopian way -- with homemade protests and calls to idealism. A street theater group demonstrated outside the Ben & Jerry's shop here last week, offering suggestions including the introduction of new flavors like Chubby Bureaucrat, Funky Money and Two-Faced Swirl. Despite diligent employees' scrubbing, the outside wall of the shop still bears the faint scrawl, "Don't Sell Out Vermont!"
Peter Clavelle, the Progressive mayor of Burlington, went to the protest, as did Representative Bernard Sanders, the independent Congressman whose district includes Burlington. In an interview today, Mr. Clavelle said that "Vermont is not for sale, nor should Ben & Jerry's be."
Part of Vermonters' concern is economic. Ben & Jerry's, Dr. Dean said, buys 300 million tons of milk a year from local dairy farmers at premium prices, and its ice cream factory attracts more visitors than any other tourist site in the state.
Some also see the battle as a last stand by hippie idealism against capitalism.
But Governor Dean, Mayor Clavelle and Representative Sanders painted the current conflict a bit differently. This fight, Dr. Dean said, is about globalization, and the need to keep companies in the hands of Vermonters. As Mr. Clavelle put it, "Folks on Church Street in Burlington should have as much or more control over our economy as those on Wall Street."
One effort to stop the possible sale tries to use Wall Street in the fight. Garret LoPorto, a Web designer based in Massachusetts who has worked for Ben & Jerry's on social projects, is proposing on a new Web site, www.savebenjerry.com, that people who care about preventing the sale buy shares so they can vote against it.
The site warns that "gigantic multinational companies are trying to take advantage of Ben & Jerry's undervalued stock price," and want to "skin the company alive and use its gentle lambskin brand to fool unsuspecting consumers into purchasing their soulless, profit-driven products."
The Web site, Mr. LoPorto said in a telephone interview, is "a way for the board of directors to see that other people care. Ben and Jerry have been doing this for over 20 years now. They're tired. When you're a prizefighter, you need people to cheer you on to keep going."
Amid all this hubbub, Ben (Cohen) and Jerry (Greenfield) have maintained an atypical -- some would say ominous -- silence. Chrystie Heimert, a company spokeswoman, said that neither she nor they would comment on the possible sale.
The only company word since the announcement came when Mr. Cohen, who was asked about the sale in an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, said, "It's my strong personal belief that the only way that the company can actualize its progressive values is to remain independent, so within the bounds of my fiduciary duties as director, I am working hard to find a way to remain independent and return adequate value to the shareholders."
It is that "adequate value" for shareholders that is the rub. The Dec. 2 announcement noted that potential buyers had indicated they would pay significantly more than the company's stock value on the Nasdaq. Industry analysts have been speculating that if the company's board did not sell, it could lay itself open to legal attacks from angry shareholders.
That disturbs Mr. Sanders. "The directors of a company could actually be sued because they are responsive to their employees, to family farmers in our state and to the local economy," he said. "That sounds to me to be quite unacceptable."
Seeking to address just such a situation, the Vermont Legislature recently enacted what is widely referred to as the Ben & Jerry's law. It says that a company can consider factors beyond profit when it is deciding whether to accept an offer. But defenders of Ben & Jerry's worry because the law has not been tested in court.
There has been no official word on which companies are interested in buying Ben & Jerry's, but reports, unconfirmed by the companies, have included the giant Unilever and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. Roncadin, an Italian manufacturer, told Dow Jones Business News recently that it had been interested at first, but when other big players started bidding, the price jumped too high.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield, along with a third director, Jeffrey Furman, control about 46 percent of the voting stock, which gives them effective control. They would thus seem to have the power to reject an offer.
Dr. Dean said he had met with the Ben & Jerry's board to make his pitch for ownership's remaining local. The members heard him out and asked some questions but did not indicate their leanings, he said.
He said he believed this was a time of "deep reflection and deliberation about who they are as a company."
Others close to the company speculate that the board is riven by disagreement, that the founders oppose the sale but others support it, arguing that it needs outside capital to ascend to a new level of growth and competition.
The internal nature of the decision-making has not stopped the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which organized the Burlington rally, from pushing hard against a sale. Dave Rapaport, the group's executive director, said that perhaps the state should consider buying Ben & Jerry's.
Ben & Jerry's officials have announced no deadline for a decision.
Meanwhile, many Vermonters, when asked about a sale, sounded like Krista Reinhart, a forestry graduate student: "I feel like it's selling out, and it's against the initial mission of what we all love about Ben & Jerry's."
Matt Gallagher, an engineer, said, "It would be a shame -- it's an icon." His wife, Emily, also an engineer, agreed.
"It's like it's gotten too big for those two goofy guys to run," Emily Gallagher said.
Many Vermonters are hoping those two goofy guys will come through.
"I believe," Mr. Clavelle said, "that at the end of the day, the good guys will win. This has always been a good-guys story, and it can't end being just another business sucked by money-grubbers."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Slip a Bit More After Monday's Huge Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Government bond yields rose moderately yesterday, continuing the run-up that has taken them to two-year highs even as the Federal Reserve decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged and to keep its stance neutral.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 8/32, to 95 21/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.46 percent, from 6.44 percent on Monday. 
 William A. Hornbarger, fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons, said the bond market's performance on Monday, in which the 30-year bond's price fell 25/32, was the steepest one-day decline since February. He called it an indication the market feared more interest-rate increases by the Fed. The lack of liquidity at year-end has most likely exaggerated the recent weakness.
"It should be noted that the yield spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bond continues to narrow and is currently at 26 basis points," Mr. Hornbarger said; a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. "A more restrictive monetary policy tends to produce a narrower yield spread."
"In terms of this week, the biggest event was obviously today's F.O.M.C. meeting," he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy panel. "Coming into the meeting it was highly unlikely that the Fed would alter monetary policy" so close to the year 2000.
"The street consensus was that the Fed would adopt a tightening bias, which they didn't," Mr. Hornbarger said. "A change in the bias would not have meant that a tightening was a foregone conclusion. It simply would have meant that the Fed views the risks as unbalanced and that they are more likely to tighten than to ease going forward." He noted that the Fed had adopted a tightening bias, favoring higher interest rates, 22 times this decade and tightened after only six of those moves.
"Despite the recent weakness," Mr. Hornbarger said, "we still feel that bonds represent good values at these levels. Discounting the rise in energy prices, inflation remains well in check and there are signs that the interest-rate-sensitive areas of the economy continue to slow. A Fed tightening remains a big worry, but the flattening of the yield curve leads us to believe that further moves won't hurt long-term rates too much.
"At this point one has to look past the immediate impact of tighter policy and at the long-term effects of multiple moves in the federal funds rate."
Mr. Hornbarger said that if the Fed moved again, it would slow the economy and keep inflation in check, which is ultimately good for bonds. "In the near term, we look for yields to continue to hang around recent levels, but we still feel that looking into the first half of 2000, yields will fall from current levels, to under 6 percent."

HEADLINE: Fed Steady on Rates but Doesn't Rule Out Increase in February

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged but warned that it might raise rates early next year to head off inflation if the economy continued to grow at a rapid pace.
The central bank stopped short of adopting a formal policy signaling the likelihood of a future rate increase, saying that it did not want to risk throwing the financial markets off balance in the weeks leading up to the turn of the century given the possibility of fallout from the associated computer software problems. 
 But the Fed's policy-setting committee issued a statement making clear that it was only the potential for Year 2000 disruptions to the markets and the economy that kept it from formally putting investors on notice that a rate increase might come as soon as its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2. And the practical effect of the statement was nearly the same in any case, emphasizing the Fed's willingness to consider a rate increase if the economy continued to run so hot that it generates inflationary pressures.
"The Fed may formally be neutral, but you don't even have to read between the lines to see that they're biased towards tightening policy," said James E. Glassman, an economist at Chase Manhattan in New York. "A new chapter of Fed tightening is certainly on the table for the February and March meetings."
The Fed almost never raises rates in the weeks before Christmas, and given the added concerns over Year 2000 computer problems, analysts had long ago concluded that the central bank would not push rates up today. On Wall Street, investors read the Fed's decision not to adopt a formal bias toward raising rates as good news, sending stock prices higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.27 points, closing at 11,200.54. Bond prices fell, sending up interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percent, to 6.46 percent, its highest level since September 1997.
So far, there is little evidence that inflation might be taking root, despite economic growth this year of about 5 percent, a level that economists once assumed would set off broad-based increases in wages and prices, especially with unemployment as low as it is now -- 4.1 percent in November.
The economy's remarkable performance has led to wholesale re-evaluations among Fed officials and economists generally about the relationship between growth and inflation.
Those who believe the economy is now capable of substantially higher levels of noninflationary growth base their case on the huge investments by American business in computers and other technology and the associated pickup in the growth rate of productivity, or the amount that a worker can produce in an hour.
But in raising its short-term federal funds target rate three times this year, to 5.5 percent -- and through its statement today -- the Fed has stressed that even a more productive economy can bump up against inflationary pressures that needed to be squelched before they can endanger the long expansion.
The Federal Open Market Committee "remains concerned with the possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking into account the remarkable rise in productivity growth," the central bank's statement said.
"Such trends," it continued, "could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance."
The committee said it was nonetheless maintaining its current neutral policy stance to emphasize that its focus in coming weeks "must be ensuring a smooth transition into the year 2000."
At its meeting in February, the statement said, "the committee will assess available information on the likely balance of supply and demand, conditions in the financial markets and the possible need for adjustment in the stance of policy to contain inflationary pressures."
Economists said the economy had retained its considerable momentum as it headed toward 2000. Some of the robust growth may come from companies' stockpiling goods and supplies as a protective measure in case the economy is disrupted by computer problems starting on Jan. 1. But most of it continues to stem from strong consumer demand and a buoyant stock market, heavy levels of business investment and a rebound in many foreign countries.
Many forecasters say the economy is likely to slow next year but not right away and probably not until the Fed pushes the federal funds rate up by at least half a percentage point, to 6 percent.
"I do expect a slowdown, but I don't think it will be sufficient to ward off more Fed tightenings, and I don't think it will be apparent in the first month of the year," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "We'll see at least two more Fed tightenings with the potential for a third if the economy does not slow."
As the prospects grow for a series of rate increases next year, so does the likelihood that the Fed will become a political issue in a presidential election year. But the White House reiterated its support today for Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, whose term expires in June. President Clinton is widely expected to nominate Mr. Greenspan to a fourth four-year term.
"The president believes he has done a good job, has a lot of respect for the job he's done and likes him personally, and when we're ready to announce a decision, we'll announce a decision," Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said today.
But Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are likely to face some difficult decisions about how much leeway to grant the economy, given the absence of inflation, the benefits of low unemployment and robust job creation, and the wealth being created by the stock market.
Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said the Fed might even consider a half-point rate increase in February if domestic demand and the stock market remained strong. The Fed has not raised rates by half a percentage point since February 1995, at the end of a tightening cycle in which the central bank doubled the federal funds rate, to 6 percent, in the course of a year.
Among the problems facing the Fed is that higher rates so far have done little to restrain Wall Street; its continuing rise is seen by most economists as a key driver of consumer confidence and spending.
But there are also indications that even sectors of the economy that traditionally have been most sensitive to rising rates, like housing, have so far remained relatively robust.

HEADLINE: Russia Calls for Action on Arms Treaty

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 21

 BODY:
His domestic base cemented by Sunday's parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin signaled today that he wants to mend relations with the West by calling for ratification of the six-year-old Start II nuclear arms treaty.
Mr. Putin pressed for approval of the accord in a meeting with leaders of the newly elected Parliament, as Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott arrived here for talks on arms control and other issues. 
 The Communist Party, which will hold the largest number of seats in the Parliament, immediately rejected Mr. Putin's proposal. But after a year of East-West estrangement which seemed to have placed the treaty in a political deep freeze, it was notable that Mr. Putin publicly raised the issue at all.
Start II, which calls for the reduction of nuclear stockpiles, has languished in the Parliament since 1993, blocked by Communists and nationalists during dips in United States-Russian relations.
But with the Communists' hold on power seriously weakened by Sunday's election results, ratification now seemed a genuine possibility.
"For the first time, I think it is possible that they will be able to form a legislative majority without the Communists," said Thomas Graham, a former American diplomat who is now a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
With more than 98 percent of all ballots counted, election officials said the Communists had captured 24.3 percent of the popular vote for the new lower house of Parliament, known as the Duma. That is but a whisker above the 23.2 percent that went to a new pro-Kremlin coalition dubbed Unity.
A second pro-Kremlin bloc, the Union of Right Forces, took 8.6 percent, and a third faction, the bloc led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, took 6 percent.
Political analysts said Mr. Putin's government was certain to pick up more support among independent legislators and other smaller factions in the Parliament.
By contrast, the only other major party leaning toward the Communists, the Fatherland-All Russia coalition, won 13.2 percent of the vote, well below its original expectations. Late today leaders of the Fatherland faction said that they would split from All Russia and form their own bloc in the legislature.
Those numbers constitute an indisputable victory for President Boris N. Yeltsin and especially for Mr. Putin, now the runaway favorite to succeed Mr. Yeltsin in elections next summer.
By waging a successful war in Chechnya and projecting an image of competence and strength -- something rare lately in Russian politics -- Mr. Putin became the political star to which many of the pro-Kremlin blocs hitched their wagons in the elections.
More than a few experts wonder whether that diverse mixture of political groups can really be knitted into a workable legislative force, particularly if the war in Chechnya turns sour for the Kremlin or Mr. Putin stumbles.
But at his meeting with parliamentary leaders today, Mr. Putin acted like a man in command. "The nation is pinning great hopes on the new Duma, the more so since there are many problems that need to be solved," he told them. "The composition of the new Duma shows that people want renewal -- not only new faces but also new results, new ideas, new decisions."
Mr. Putin has indicated that he will push for economic reforms of the sort long advocated by Western economists but never fully carried out here.
But ratification of Start II was the most specific issue discussed at today's session, and Mr. Talbott said on arrival here that he was pleased at the "reactivation" of the Russian government's effort.
Mr. Yeltsin and President Bush signed Start II in January 1993. Under its terms, both nations would reduce their nuclear forces to no more than 3,500 warheads by 2003 -- a drastic cut for the United States, which now has nearly 8,000 warheads, and for Russia, with about 6,700.
The Senate has approved the treaty, and the Russian military has supported it, in part because it can no longer afford the huge expense of keeping up a nuclear arsenal.
The Russian Parliament was poised to approve the treaty a year ago, but balked when the United States resumed bombing of Iraq.
The Duma was again prepared to ratify the treaty last spring, but the American-led war against Yugoslavia provoked the Kremlin to cancel that vote.
Mr. Putin's announcement today was not completely unexpected. A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Kremlin has long said privately that it hoped to win approval of Start II after this month's elections, even if relations with Washington were less than optimal.
"It's following through on what they said they'd do," the official said. "I hope it shows some serious willingness to engage in arms control."
"Russia is always for the ratification of the Start II treaty because we believe it is important for the national interests of Russia," said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin. "To promote the process of strategic disarmament would be beneficial to Russia, first of all, and to the United States."
Some serious obstacles still remain, and Mr. Putin noted them today. They include the United States' proposal to abandon the antiballistic missile treaty so that it may build a limited defense against missiles launched by rogue states.
Skeptical military officials in Russia and China argue that the United States' real goal is to build a defense against the shrunken nuclear force that Russia would possess once Start II and future arms-control treaties are implemented.
The Russian Defense Ministry has informally proposed setting up a joint commission to study the nuclear threat posed by unstable or terrorist nations. But the Kremlin has bitterly protested the White House's proposal to change the antiballistic missile treaty, saying it is the foundation of arms control because its assurance of mutual destruction in a war reduces all nations' incentives to build more weapons.
Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the military's foreign affairs department, repeated that today, saying the government is categorically opposed to changing the structure of the arms-control regime.
American officials said Mr. Talbott is likely to discuss Start II and the antiballistic missile treaties during visits this week with Mr. Putin and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, among others.
He is also likely to discuss Russia's political and economic situation and the course of the war in Chechnya, which was entering a crucial stage this week.
President Yeltsin was briefed on the Chechnya war today by the interior minister, Vladimir Rushailo, who later said the government is establishing temporary police departments to restore order in areas under its control.
In Chechnya, Russian troops were said to be locked in a fierce battle with rebels near Serzhen-Yury, about 18 miles south of the capital, Grozny. The village sits at the mouth of a gorge that leads into the Caucasus mountains, where rebels mainitain supply bases and headquarters.
Russian military officials also repeated that they had captured Grozny's civilian airport, but said they had yet to secure the field because it was mined. Last week the army occupied a military airfield just east of Grozny.

HEADLINE: BP Reported in Agreement to Regain Important Siberian Oil Field

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 21

 BODY:
BP Amoco P.L.C., one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, has tentatively reached an agreement with a Russian oil company to resolve a long-running conflict that threatened to destroy the petroleum giant's half-billion-dollar investment in the country, people close to the negotiations said today.
Under the deal, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, BP Amoco would regain authority over a prized Siberian oil field sold in a questionable bankruptcy auction to the Russian company, Tyumen Oil. 
 BP Amoco's dispute with Tyumen has come to symbolize problems that foreign investors have confronted in Russia. If the agreement holds, it would be an important if rare victory for BP Amoco, which had not ruled out the possibility of leaving Russia out of frustration.
It is unclear tonight whether the deal was directly related to broader pressure on Russia from the United States. Earlier today in Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ordered the United States Export-Import Bank to suspend approval of $500 million in loans to Tyumen because of Russia's faltering economic overhaul, corruption and military action in Chechnya. The agency left open the possibility that the loans could be approved later.
Over the last few years, BP Amoco has plowed most of its Russia investment into a 10 percent stake in Sidanko, a onetime oil conglomerate that formerly owned some of the most valuable energy assets in Russia, notably the Chernogorneft field in Siberia. But in the last year, production subsidiaries of Sidanko have been pushed into bankruptcy and sold off under controversial circumstances, essentially leaving the parent company as an empty shell.
Tyumen bought Chernogorneft at a fraction of its value. BP Amoco and others have accused Tyumen, which is nearly half-owned by the Russian government, of tampering with the courts to influence the bankruptcy proceedings and liquidation sales.
Tyumen acknowledges it was interested in acquiring Chernogorneft, but denies using questionable methods.
Under the terms of the expected agreement, Tyumen would return the Chernogorneft oil field to Sidanko, and in return receive an equity stake in Sidanko of 25 percent plus one share, people close to the deal said. BP Amoco, a British-based company with major American assets, would keep the 10 percent stake it owns in Sidanko, but its voting rights would be the same as Tyumen's. Such holdings are known as "blocking stakes," giving both companies seats on the Sidanko board and sufficient leverage to influence the company's business activities.
BP Amoco would also get managerial authority over Sidanko and its subsidiaries, essentially giving it control of the Chernogorneft field.
People close to the talks said it was still possible that the agreement could fall apart. Spokesmen for Tyumen, BP Amoco and Sidanko declined to comment on the situation.
It is also unclear if the acrimony between BP Amoco and Tyumen could be quickly put aside to allow Sidanko to resume functioning properly. But all involved in the talks appear interested in building the Chernogorneft field, situated in northwestern Siberia, more than 1,500 miles east of Moscow, and adjoining other Tyumen property.
Despite the criticism it has endured over the Sidanko dispute, Tyumen Oil is considered a strong company that has worked hard to develop its fields and refineries.
Analysts think that Tyumen's push to refurbish its aging, Soviet-built assets may have been one reason it decided to negotiate a settlement. And the Export-Import Bank loans to Tyumen, whenever approved, would allow the company to overhaul an important refinery and improve production at a major oil field.
Tyumen Oil appears to have agreed to a solution that gives it a stake in Sidanko worth far less than the Chernogorneft field. "Twenty-five percent is too low for giving up Chernogorneft," said Ivan Mazalov, an oil analyst with the brokerage firm Troika Dialog. "Chernogorneft accounts for half the value of Sidanko."
Some people who have followed the BP Amoco-Tyumen struggle said the Russian government might have brought pressure on the rival parties, in light of the damage that has already been done to the country's reputation as a place for investment.
"The fight wasn't just bad for Sidanko," said Dmitri Avdeyev, oil analyst with the United Financial Group, a Moscow brokerage firm. "It was bad for the whole market. And so any fair compromise will help restore sentiment."

Helping Hand Holds Out A Broom

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
GEORGE McDONALD has not been out there with his old comrades protesting the city's policies toward the homeless. He has been doing more pleasant work, like reading the mail at the office of Doe Fund on East 84th Street. Yesterday's contained 215 donations totaling $42,746. The total for the holiday season is more than $1 million.
"You are doing a great job," wrote a woman who enclosed $25. "Wish I were able to give more, but I am on Social Security." Mr. McDonald's favorite was from a boy who drew a picture of what he wants to be when he grows up: a street cleaner in a blue uniform labeled "Ready, Willing and Able." 
 Five years ago, when the Doe Fund started its street-cleaning program, it counted on only 60 donors. "Now we have 22,000 donors," Mr. McDonald said. "The Coalition for the Homeless may not appreciate what we're doing, but the public does."
It's not that the Coalition for the Homeless actively opposes Mr. McDonald's "Ready, Willing and Able" program, which provides shelter, food, social services and paid work to homeless men. Certainly no one opposes the results: more than 900 graduates now have regular jobs and support themselves in their own homes.
But there is an ideological divide between Mr. McDonald and the advocates now battling Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's attempts to impose work requirements in the city's homeless shelters. Mr. McDonald, who is 55, has come a long way since his days as a volunteer with the Coalition for the Homeless in the early 1980's. By his count, he spent 700 straight nights handing out food in Grand Central Terminal.
"Over and over people told me they appreciated the sandwich, but what they really needed was a room and a job to pay for it," Mr. McDonald recalled. "Eventually I thought, well, maybe that's the truth." In 1985, he started the Doe Fund, which was named after a homeless woman found frozen to death that year in Grand Central.
He opened a homeless shelter in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that required men to stay off drugs and work full time. Later, the men began cleaning streets, and Mr. McDonald began operating shelters in Manhattan, Jersey City and Washington, typically for homeless men who are drug addicts with criminal records. According to an independent auditor, 62 percent of the men graduate from the yearlong program to permanent jobs and housing.
"Work works," Mr. McDonald said. "The homeless don't need handouts or elaborate job-training programs. Job training is getting up in the morning, going to work sweeping the street, learning to get along with others, and getting up the next day and doing it again." He faults other groups, especially the one he calls "the Coalition Against the Homeless," for opposing work requirements.
"Why would anyone want to protect someone's right to lie around a shelter doing nothing?" Mr. McDonald said. "The advocates want to give the homeless an unconditional right to shelter and isolate them in government housing and special jobs programs. But what they need is to assume personal responsibility and be brought back into the economic mainstream."
His wife, Harriet Karr-McDonald, the vice president of the Doe Fund, put it more forcefully. "It makes me sick," she said, "to hear these white advocates talking about the homeless population, which is largely minority, as if they were so frail that they can't make it on their own. Well, these black men do not need good white liberals like us to protect them. They need the opportunity to take care of themselves."
THAT is not, of course, the way that the advocates see themselves. "Work is not a bad thing," said Steven Banks, the counsel for the Coalition for the Homeless. "The debate is not about work or no work. The issue is whether or not the government should have the right to throw vulnerable New Yorkers on the streets of the city in the winter, and whether the government should be investing money in permanent housing."
While Mr. McDonald exults at the men who finish his program and find jobs, Mr. Banks worries that some of them still aren't making enough to pay the rent. And what about the ones who drop out, and the ones who wouldn't even consider enrolling? If some people aren't ready to work, should they freeze on the streets?
Those are good questions, and they will be addressed by Mr. Banks when he challenges the city's work requirements in court on Jan. 7. In the meantime, it would not hurt to hear from some of the men in Mr. McDonald's program. Their stories will appear on Saturday.

Bell Atlantic Seen Entering The Long-Distance Market
Bell Atlantic today will become the first of the regional Bell companies allowed into the $80 billion long-distance market, signaling a new era of competition in the communications industry, people close to the decision said.
The announcement, which is expected from the Federal Communications Commission, would allow Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves in New York State. Approval would mark the first time since the breakup of AT&T 15 years ago that millions of consumers would be able to get both local and long-distance phone services from an AT&T offspring. Page A1. 

Ex-Investment Bank Chief Charged
Last spring, the respected investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods mysteriously scrubbed plans for a stock offering -- and refused to say why. The reason became clear yesterday when federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged the firm's former chairman, James J. McDermott Jr., with insider trading in a case in which he was accused of leaking information about potential bank deals to a pornographic movie star. A1.
 
Stocks Surge on Decision by Fed
Two broad stock market gauges leaped to records, with the Nasdaq gaining 127.28 points, its biggest one-day gain ever, to 3,911.15, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbing 15.34 points, to 1,433.43. The Dow Jones industrial average also was higher, closing at 11,200.54, up 56.27 points. The bulk of the gains came after the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates alone. C14.
 
Government bond yields were down moderately but stayed near their two-year highs. The yield on the 30-year issue rose to 6.46 percent from 6.44 percent on Monday. C14.
 
Goldman Sachs Posts Record Profit
Goldman Sachs Group said it posted record profit of $723 million, or $1.48 a diluted share, in its most recent quarter, beating Wall Street's forecasts after suffering a slight loss a year earlier when a financial crisis rippled around the globe. C2.
 
F.T.C. Lets Nuclear Ads Continue
The Federal Trade Commission has agreed that advertisements by the nuclear industry made unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of nuclear power, but the commission said the ads were a form of political speech that would be allowed to continue. C6.
 
Fraud Charged in Azerbaijan Deal
An investment promoter who made a fortune from questionable stock dealings in his native Czech Republic has been accused of fraud in an Azerbaijan venture that has attracted $450 million from foreign investors. C4.
 
Cell Genesys Backs Off Merger
Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, announced that its directors had rescinded a recommendation that the company be sold to Genzyme General for $350 million in stock. The reason is that Cell Genesys's 19 percent of Abgenix, worth about $130 million when a merger with Genezyme General was agreed to in October, has nearly tripled in value, to about $370 million, more than Genzyme would pay for all of Cell Genesys. Shares of Abgenix have soared because of investor enthusiasm for its Xenomouse technology, a line of mice that have had their genes modified so they can produce human antibodies. C12.
 
New York Called Year 2000 Ready
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that New York, after spending more than $350 million, had finished checking its hundreds of computers, 11,000 traffic lights and other equipment for any glitches and said he was confident that power, phones, elevators, and the rest of the city's electronic and electrical underpinnings would work when clocks switch to 2000.

'Goals 2000' Score: Failure 8, U.S. 0

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
IN 1989, President George Bush and the nation's governors set six education goals for the year 2000. In 1994, with President Clinton's endorsement, Congress adopted them, adding two more.
We can now declare defeat, having flunked all eight goals we were to reach by the millennium. What went wrong? 
 Some "Goals 2000" were ridiculous in the first place. Others required resources never provided. Still others required far more than 11 years to achieve.
The very leaders who set these national goals now demand accountability from districts and schools: principals and teachers should suffer consequences for not meeting state targets that sprang from the nationwide goals. But when national leaders fall short of goals, why do they not face similar sanctions? Policy makers' lack of candor about the irresponsible way the goals were set can breed local educators' contempt for the entire standards movement.
The goals were these: By 2000, all children will start school ready to learn; 90 percent will graduate from high school; all will demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter in English, math, science, foreign languages, civics, economics, the arts, history and geography; the United States will be first in the world in math and science; all adults will be literate; no school will have drugs, violence, firearms or alcohol; teachers will have needed skills; all schools will get parents involved.
Faced with unmet goals, it's easy to maintain that sincere effort was all that mattered. That is the approach taken by the National Education Goals Panel, an agency run by governors, members of Congress, state legislators and federal education officials. Ducking accountability, the panel earlier this year proposed changing the name "Goals 2000" to "America's Education Goals," dropping any mention of deadlines. Then, in its 1999 report, it stated that its "bold venture" had worked, because the goals had "helped stimulate reforms."
Now, declaring victory may be O.K. for dieters who lose 5 pounds after aiming for 15, but defining success downward is dicier for national goals to improve education. If we're serious about making schools accountable, then the lack of consequence when we set national goals and fail to meet them sends educators the wrong message. Will we permit schools to claim that standards were met if they merely "stimulate reforms"?
Perhaps the most irresponsible goal was the one calling for the nation to be first in math and science. We shouldn't want first place even if we could have it. Koreans and Japanese score high not only with curriculum we might emulate but also by subjecting children to intense cramming and competitive test pressure. These days Japan's news media are agonizing over the murder of a 2-year-old by the jealous mother of another toddler, who had scored less well on preschool exams. If this is what "first in the world" entails, we don't want it.
Perhaps we should aim for fifth, not first. Or perhaps we should seek absolute standards and ignore international ranking. The glibness of "being first" is worrisome, because it invites districts and schools also to set glib goals.
A better goal, but one that was set without necessary resources, was that all children start school ready to learn. The goals panel says this meant that by 2000, all would "have access to high-quality and developmentally appropriate preschool." Yet the political leaders who set this goal have also failed, since 1989, to finance such programs. France finances quality preschool for all 3-to-5-year-olds. If we really want first-in-the-world status, here is a more worthy competition.
Universal adult literacy was another goal where lack of financing made a mockery of our ambition. To fulfill it would have required expanded community and public-library programs, evening schools and instruction based in the workplace. Financing these was never on goal-setters' agendas.
Academic proficiency is what most people want goals to inspire, but here we can't monitor national progress because while Congress set goals for achievement, it couldn't agree on national standards or tests to measure it. Thus, each state (except Iowa, which declines to participate) now sets its own standards. What is "competent" in one state is not in others, so we can't know how far we are from "all" students' demonstrating "competency over challenging subject matter."
Standards-setting is serious business, and carefully reasoned goals can spur achievement. But goals we can't (or shouldn't) meet only promote cynicism. To reform the school reform movement, holding those accountable who so recklessly established "Goals 2000" might be a good place to start.

Albright Blocks Loan Over Russian Oil Deal
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright invoked a rarely used law to order the Export-Import Bank to reject a $500 million loan for Russia because the state-affiliated oil company for which the loan was intended is an example of resistance to economic reform.

HEADLINE: THEN/NOW: REFLECTIONS ON THE MILLENIUM;
The Receding Influence of Empires

 BODY:
For all the strife at the dawn of a new millennium, one enduring source of conflict may be receding. At least for now, the earth's empires have disappeared as anchors of international order. Some fear that a suffocating American imperium now enforces its culture and unforgiving economic rules. But in today's global environment, the cost and complexity of one people trying to control the sovereignty of broad stretches of the globe no longer seem worth bearing. Today's challenge is to make the new system of established states, new states, failed states, would-be states, regional conflicts and tenuous alliances work better than the old.
The 20th century has seen three waves of collapsing empires, as the political scientist Michael Mandelbaum points out. First came the great dynasties of the Hapsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Ottomans and Romanovs -- destroying each other in the calamity of World War I, followed by the demise of the British, French, Dutch and Japanese empires at the end of World War II and the disintegration of the Soviet empire a decade ago. 
 The current epoch began not only with the birth of the Christian era, but also the legacy of Rome. As the historian William McNeill notes in "The Rise of the West," the moment of Jesus' life coincided with a profound demographic change in human history, as "the submerged peoples and rootless populations" who had migrated to the urban centers of the Roman Empire, as well as the Parthian, Kushan and Han empires to the east, struggled for spiritual guidance. The spread of Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism among these peoples helped answer their needs.
For 2,000 years, Rome has given its identity to the West's political establishments. In Europe, Charlemagne and many subsequent rulers chose for their domain the legitimizing name of Holy Roman Empire. The Roman republic served as a model for the revolutionaries in France and North America, where a nation was established in 1776, the year of the publication of Edward Gibbon's "History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." Gibbon observed that barbarism and religion had destroyed an empire that at its height offered a realm in which "the human race was most happy and prosperous." In the book "Empires," the Princeton historian Michael Doyle suggests that empires today are dying from the spread of nationalism, liberal democracy, global capitalism and the ease with which the peoples of the world can subvert their subjugators. No one can know whether empires will rise again, in part because smaller nations may find it useful to ally themselves with larger ones. But for now, Mr. Doyle suggests, the cost of imperialism has risen to an unacceptable level.
Yet much of Asia, Africa and Latin America remain organized along boundaries designed by their onetime imperial overlords. Immense countries like Indonesia and India are residual imperial states, China rules coercively over its varied and restless peoples, and even the subgroups within Britain and France seem increasingly eager to assert their identities. The beginning of the next millennium offers the challenge of inventing a new order to replace the artificial, often brutal stability imposed by old imperial structures. Without a new respect for the rights of minorities, the world's thousands of ethnic, linguistic and religious subgroups will increasingly wonder whether their moment to press for independence as a nation has arrived.
At the beginning of this century, Woodrow Wilson proposed the concept of self-determination as the new organizing principle of the world after the end of the era of empires. But his secretary of state, Robert Lansing, wondered from the start whether self-determination would create more problems than it would solve. "The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite," he wrote in his diaries. "It will raise hopes which can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives."
At the end of the millennium, the world has a much better idea of what it is leaving behind than of what lies ahead. Yet surely the challenge of the future is to preserve Wilson's vision while avoiding atomization of the world into ever tinier nations. If there is a new world order, its stability will only come by a revitalization of each nation's identity, with or without new boundaries drawn on a map. A new philosophy of respect for the world's variety needs to replace the imperial designs that lasted for more than 2,000 years.

To Have and Have Not: Cubans' Life With Castro

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Behind a display case filled with cassettes of Cuban music from decades past, Wilfredo del Rio keeps another oldie under glass. It is a photograph of Fidel Castro, smiling and youthful, taken in the heady days after the revolution triumphed in January 1959.
"I have it guarded, like a relic," said Mr. del Rio, a cashier at the store in the Barrio Colon section of Havana. "It is something big for us. We love Fidel a lot. He has his defects like anyone else. But I consider him to be the man of the century." 
 He reeled off a litany of advances in education and health care in the 40 years since Mr. Castro came to power, a familiar refrain for many Cubans. For most of that time, the island has been under a United States trade embargo, a move intended to force Mr. Castro out of power or, at least, bring about democratic reforms. Despite the pressure, Mr. Castro and his Communist government remain in power.
The brunt of the embargo's impact has been borne by Cuban citizens, the most desperate of whom take to the seas in small boats and rafts, sometimes with tragic results. Those who remain scramble and improvise to supplement their small monthly incomes with American dollars from relatives abroad or with tips from tourists and trades with neighbors and co-workers. If not, they simply do without.
"We lack a lot that is needed to move forward and resolve the economic problems," Mr. del Rio said. "I think to resolve the economic problems there should be a little more liberty and democracy so that foreign investors will come and invest in Cuba."
Despite this, he insisted that he still had great affection for Mr. Castro as a person.
Such a mix of emotions are often encountered here, pitting whatever personal admiration people may have for Mr. Castro and the revolution against their daily struggle to make ends meet as the nation recovers from the economic crisis brought by the collapse of the Soviet Union eight years ago.
While officials point to recent economic reforms that have led to some growth -- legalizing the owning of dollars and courting foreign investment -- many Cubans complain privately that those benefits have yet to filter down to their households. In their daily lives, they are left reconciling their allegiance to the revolution's social advances with their individual pessimism about improving their standard of living after years of barely getting by.
Some Cubans have benefited from the modest liberalizing of the economy -- and not just in the tourist sector with its gleaming new hotels filled with dollar-laden foreigners. Tradespeople have gone into business for themselves while other enterprising types have opened up paladares -- restaurants they operate in their homes -- in return for paying a monthly tax in hard currency to the government.
The legalization of the dollar a few years ago has increased buying power, at least for those Cubans with jobs in the tourist industry or relatives in the United States. But it has also brought with it an uncomfortable distinction between those who have access to dollars and those who do not. In a country where people line up to receive their monthly rations of food, there is now yet another line, this time of people waiting to get into the state-run dollar shops.
"They say this is a socialist government," said Mr. del Rio, who supplements his monthly income with several hundred dollars sent each year by relatives in the United States. "But I see a mix of capitalism and socialism. On one side I see the dollar in circulation. Here, we work with the national currency. We do not get dollars. Yet all the good merchandise from clothes to food is in dollars."
On this particular morning, few people had passed by the record shop. Mr. del Rio's co-worker, Mercedes Martin, acknowledged that the economy was tight and that people had little money for amusements. At the same time, she considered it a small sacrifice.
"I lived under capitalism," said Ms. Martin, 53. "I suffered. When I was 11 I was cleaning floors in private homes. I could not go to school. My father was jailed because he was for the revolution. Things were hard."
"Now," she said, "we are another people. There is less diversion, but we have other things. We have a roof. We have security. We have schools for our children."
They also have the embargo, which for her and many other Cubans is the biggest impediment to their future. But it was a burden she insisted she was still willing to bear.
"If we did not have a blockade, we could live like we are supposed to," she said. "But I prefer the blockade to Fidel leaving."
Almost absent-mindedly, she stroked Mr. Castro's photograph, under glass and frozen in time.
"Leave Papa here," she said. "You think we would trade this because of the blockade? No."
Others are not so sure. A young man who lives in the Cayo Hueso section said that when he was not working at his maintenance job he tried to earn a few dollars by steering tourists to restaurants. He pointed to a child riding her bike on the street.
"I make $8 a month and that bike over there costs $30," said the man, who declined to give his name. "I get paid in pesos. How could I buy that? You cannot live on that. Who can?"
He wondered how much longer it would be like this.
"Things have got to get better," he said. "Maybe by 2005?"
But guessing when change will come, either by political reform or biological inevitability, has proved to be a perplexing game. At 73, Mr. Castro has outlived many of his fiercest critics. At a summit meeting in November of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations, he was resolute in affirming the path he had chosen 40 years ago.
Rather than speculate about any possible transfer of power, publicly at least, many Cubans prefer to criticize the embargo, saying that it has not accomplished much except to deny American businesses the chance to invest in Cuba.
"They themselves lose more by not selling to us," said Cristobal Solano Zuleta, a barber in Cayo Hueso. "So why not remove it? There is still a little group in Miami who are pressuring Washington because they have money. But it will not remove Fidel."
A few of his friends and neighbors had gathered inside his cramped apartment to celebrate his wedding earlier in the day. Apart from festive music and glasses filled with rum, there was not much else to fuel the party, but they made do with what they had.
"I only wish for a better future," Mr. Solano said. "Economically, socially. I don't know. To live a little better. We are of the lower class, but we live well. Poor, but well. We eat every day. We struggle, like any human being."
It wasn't easy, his friends said, but they insisted it was the only way they knew.
"There are people who say Fidel is going tomorrow, or that he is gone," said Raul Cabrera, 39, who dropped in on the party after finishing his shift at a construction site. "But those of us who were born with this will follow the revolution until the end."
More neighbors joined the party, as a young boy beat out a dance rhythm on a wooden block mounted on a steel pipe.
"Our wine is bitter," Mr. Cabrera said. "But it is ours. We labor. But it is ours and we drink it."

HEADLINE: Arrest at U.S. Border Reverberates in France

BYLINE: This article was reported by Craig Pyes, John Kifner, Sam Howe Verhovek and John F. Burns, and was written by Mr. Burns. 

 BODY:
When United States customs officials arrested Ahmed Ressam near Seattle last week after he came off a ferry from Canada in a car they say was loaded with jars of nitroglycerin, timing devices and other bomb-making materials, American intelligence officials knew little about him.
But the arrest set off alarms in France, where antiterrorist officials had been focusing on the 32-year-old Mr. Ressam because of his connections to a loosely organized group of Islamic radicals that French investigators suspect had carried out a series of attacks on supermarkets, armored security vehicles and banks in northern France in 1996. 
 French officials declined to provide specifics and did not suggest that Mr. Ressam, an Algerian, was involved in the attacks. But one senior French law-enforcement official said that Mr. Ressam had links to Fateh Kamel, an Algerian veteran of the Afghan war. The French have tied Mr. Kamel to the group that carried out the attacks in 1996, which left one bystander and several Islamic radicals dead.
Earlier this year, the French identified Said Atmani, an Algerian with a Bosnian passport who once roomed with Mr. Ressam in a Montreal apartment, as another figure with links to Mr. Kamel. French officials said they sent a delegation to Canada in October to interview Mr. Atmani and Mr. Ressam, but neither man could be located. A French antiterrorist official said that they briefed Canadian and American officials about their interest in Mr. Ressam, including his possible links to the financing of Islamic terror activities in Europe and elsewhere.
Much about Mr. Ressam remains unknown as officials in three countries trace his movements in an effort to learn what he planned to do with the explosives he was accused of bringing into the United States. But from interviews and a review of public records in Canada, a picture is emerging of a man who moved easily from country to country with falsified passports.
At the modest, $85-per-night hotel where he lived for two weeks in Vancouver, British Columbia, workers recalled that he was traveling with another man who spoke English with no discernible accent.
American officials now say they have unconfirmed intelligence reports that Mr. Ressam had been seen in training camps used in the 1980's by Islamic militants fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. Mr. Ressam told Canadian authorities that he had been falsely accused in Algeria of being an Islamic radical, and tortured, according to immigration records.
Canadian officials acknowledged yesterday that Mr. Ressam had taken advantage of lax procedures and loose cooperation between the police and immigration authorities to obtain his false papers. Reviewing the case, one Montreal police investigator, Claude Paquette, this week said that the loose rules had turned Canada into "a Club Med for terrorists."
Canada's investigation into the affair has established, among other things, that Mr. Ressam arrived in the country in 1994 with a French passport in an assumed name.
Later, after being ordered arrested and deported, he went underground and obtained a Canadian passport in a false name using only a Roman Catholic baptism certificate, a procedure said to be common in Quebec.
When arrested in Seattle, Mr. Ressam was carrying a Canadian passport in the assumed name of Benni Antoine Noris.
The group to which French investigators have linked Mr. Ressam is part of a new trend in Islamic radicalism in which small, loosely linked bands of militants collaborate in attacks on Western targets, often financing themselves by what the French call "gangster-terrorism."
One high-ranking French official who outlined what he called "the globalization of Islamist terror" said there were at least 20 Islamic groups that have planned or carried out terrorist attacks in countries like Canada, France, Belgium, Turkey, Malaysia and Australia, as well a dozen or more other nations. Few of these groups, he said, belonged to a coherent terrorist network, although many maintained loose links with each other.
What most of these groups have in common, French and American officials say, is a heritage from the Islamic "holy war" against Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980's, when thousands of young Muslims from across Europe, the Middle East and Asia were indoctrinated with a militant brand of Islam, and trained in weapons techniques and bomb-making.
Even if the Islamic terror groups are not centrally directed, antiterrorist officials in the United States and other Western countries say they are linked by many things, including their fiercely anti-Western system of beliefs on the fringe of Islam and common experiences and operating procedures.
Most of the leaders fought, or at least were trained, in Afghanistan. Most see the United States, with its secular political tradition, its military and economic power, and its backing for Israel, as the prime target for terrorist attacks. Many radicals use false passports and work from similar terror-training manuals.
Investigators are examining whether Mr. Ressam is linked to the most notorious figure to emerge from that war, Osama Bin Laden, the wealthy 42-year-old Saudi Arabian who lives in hiding in Afghanistan. American authorities have identified Mr. Bin Laden as the mastermind of the August 1998 bomb attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which more than 220 people were killed.
One Western official said there were reports that Mr. Ressam had met with several people in Canada tied to Mr. Bin Laden. It was unclear what significance, if any, these contacts had. French officials have concentrated their recent investigations on Mr. Kamel, whom they described as "important in the world of Islamic terrorists" and as a frequent traveler to Bosnia, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan among other places.
In Pakistan yesterday, a high-ranking official of the Taliban, the militant Islamic group that rules most of Afghanistan, scoffed at American suggestions that Mr. Bin Laden may have continued to play a role in terror attacks since the embassy bombings, which prompted the F.B.I. to place Mr. Bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list and post a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
"Bin Laden doesn't even have access to a telephone or a fax," Sayed Mohammed Haqqani, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, told a news conference.
When Mr. Ressam arrived at Mirabel International Airport in Montreal on Feb. 20, 1994, he had said he was fleeing a government that had unjustly accused him of arms smuggling and Islamic radicalism.
His French passport bore the name Tahar Medjadi, but he readily admitted to the authorities that the document and his birth certificate were fake. He asked for refugee status and asylum.
On his application, Mr. Ressam stated that the Algerian military "considered me to be nothing but an Islamic terrorist, even though I have no connection to Islamic movements." He said he was tortured and held in administrative detention for fifteen months.
After two years of legal wrangling, Canadian officials rejected Mr. Ressam's claim for refugee status, and ordered him deported. But at the time, his lawyer Dennis Buron said, the government had a policy of not deporting anybody to Algeria because of the harsh battles there between Islamic insurgents and the military rulers. So he remained in Canada.
Louise Charbonneau, a Canadian Immigration spokeswoman, said that there were no grounds to hold Mr. Ressam. "At that time, we had no proof that he was linked to any terrorist group," Ms. Charbonneau said. "If we had proof, we would have kept him in detention."
Mr. Ressam then slipped from official view, living under two false names.
On Feb. 8, 1998, an arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Ressam in the theft of a computer from a parked car. He served two weeks in jail.
At about the same time, a deportation order was issued for Mr. Ressam, apparently on the basis of three outstanding criminal arrest warrants, two involving thefts from cars and one in a breaking and entering. In May 1998, a nationwide immigration warrant was issued for his arrest.
Nonetheless, last February Mr. Ressam sought and obtained a government-issued Canadian passport under the name Benni Antoine Noris. Even though he had been fingerprinted during his refugee application, there was apparently no cross check with the police, immigration or intelligence agencies.
Those fingerprints remained on file. And when Mr. Ressam was arrested last week crossing the border in Washington, American authorities learned his true identity from his fingerprints.
France's interest in Mr. Ressam appears to have been prompted by the arrest in Jordan in the spring of Mr. Kamel, the Algerian-born Afghan veteran who has been linked by French investigators to the group that carried out a series of attacks in the northern French city of Roubaix.
French antiterrorist officials have said that they believed Mr. Kamel provided religious leadership and support to Islamic groups in France that carried out robberies that terrorized the French city for three months in early 1996. In one attack, the Islamic radicals shot and killed a French Muslim who was slow in handing over the keys to his Mercedes-Benz after the gang had bungled a robbery.
According to the French investigation, the robberies netted only about 70,000 francs -- a little more than $10,000 -- money that the French say was used to finance the activities of the Islamic groups Mr. Kamel is said to have led.
The robbery spree ended with a shootout in the Roubaix suburb of Alma in March 1996, in the course of which four gang members were killed, two after fleeing across the border into Belgium.
It is not clear what direct evidence, if any, exists linking Mr. Kamel to the attacks.
After his arrest this year, Jordan extradited him to France and Mr. Kamel has been held ever since under a French law providing for the detention of suspects under investigation for alleged involvement in a "terrorist enterprise."
In October, following leads that arose from the Roubaix inquiry, French antiterrorist officials visited Canada, where they hoped to question Mr. Ressam and Mr. Atmani, his former roommate in Montreal. A French law enforcement official described both as lieutenants of Mr. Kamel in Canada.
The Canadians were unable to locate either man. Mr. Atmani had been deported to Bosnia, where he had previously obtained his own passport. Mr. Ressam had assumed his new identity and was living underground.
Canadian investigators did turn up evidence suggesting that the Islamic groups with which Mr. Ressam and Mr. Atmani may have been associated, in Montreal, were practicing their own, less violent version of "gangster-terrorism."
According to the Canadians, police in Montreal arrested 11 Muslim men this fall on suspicion of stealing laptop computers and cell phones from parked cars, and selling them in front of the city's mosques.
Since Mr. Ressam's arrest, the Canadians have said that they believe the proceeds were funneled to Algerian-based Islamic organizations, including the Armed Islamic Group, which has been responsible for many of the 100,000 deaths in the Algerian civil war that began in 1992.
The investigation into Mr. Ressam's activities markedly intensified late last week, after his arrest. Bomb specialists from the Montreal police descended on Mr. Ressam's apartment at 1250 Fort Street, near the center of the downtown.
The police, apparently fearing booby traps, broke a window to enter the house. Inside, they found a .357 Magnum pistol, instructions for making bombs, a beige Valentino suit, a couple of shopping bags from expensive local stores, a pair of Nike sneakers, and the remnants of a carton of buttermilk with the expiration date of Oct. 6. Mr. Ressam paid his $460 a month rent in cash.
Sam Jacobs, the superintendent of the apartment said that Mr. Ressam was "an ideal tenant."
"Never caused any trouble" Mr. Jacobs added. "No one ever complained about him."
On Sunday night, the police found an Orange GMC van registered to the name of Benni Noris. About 400 people were evacuated for several blocks while the police searched for bombs, but found none.
There were grocery carts in the van, which neighbors said had been parked at the spot for a week or 10 days.
The neighbors also said they had seen the van carrying four men.
In November, Mr. Ressam began working on opening a small grocery store in the area. Some deliveries of chewing gum and other goods were made, but the store never opened.

HEADLINE: No Foul Play Is Seen in Death of Yale Student Found in the River

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
The death of a Yale University senior whose body was found in the Harlem River last month was not the result of foul play, university officials and the New Haven police said yesterday.
Gregory Norris, 21, an economics major from Omaha, disappeared from campus midway through the fall semester. After a fruitless search in Connecticut, the authorities retrieved his body on Nov. 16 on the Bronx shoreline near West 225 Street. He was identified late last week with dental X-rays. 
 "The case was being handled as a missing-person case, and now that he has been identified it will be closed out," said Douglas P. MacDonald, assistant chief of the New Haven Police Department. "It is not being handled as a criminal matter."
Mr. Norris was last seen on Oct. 31. Railroad workers in New Haven reported early that morning that he was acting strangely in a train station. They called the New Haven police, who arrived and found him on the platform, apparently under the influence of either drugs or alcohol, the police said.
The officers coaxed him into an ambulance that took him to Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was treated in the emergency room and checked himself out, said Kenneth Best, a spokesman for the hospital. Mr. Best declined to elaborate on Mr. Norris's care.
Later that day, Mr. Norris's family became concerned and notified the university. "His parents reported him missing when they couldn't contact him," said Thomas P. Conroy, a Yale University spokesman.
In early November, the police searched in New Haven and at Yale, interviewing students and faculty members. On Nov. 11, The Yale Daily News, the campus newspaper, reported that Mr. Norris had left two letters -- one for his sister, one for his parents -- in his university suite before he disappeared. The contents of the letters have not been publicly disclosed, and Mr. Norris's mother declined to comment yesterday.
How and why Mr. Norris traveled to New York remained unknown yesterday. The police said only that his body was spotted by a Metropolitan Transportation Authority foreman in mid-November and retrieved from the river by the crew of a police harbor patrol vessel. It remained unidentified in a city morgue for weeks.
In an open letter to the Yale student body on Monday, Richard H. Brodhead, dean of Yale College, wrote that Mr. Norris's body had been found. "This is a grievous loss to our community," he wrote. "I'm sure that you join me in extending our love and prayers to Greg's family at this painful time."
Although the New York medical examiner's office said yesterday that it had not determined the cause of Mr. Norris's death, Dean Brodhead's letter said that the "police report that there were no signs of foul play."

HEADLINE: U.S. Blocks Aid to Russian Oil Company

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ordered the Export-Import Bank today to reject a $500 million loan for Russia "for the time being, " arguing that the state-affiliated oil company that would receive it is an example of resistance to economic reform.
After a day of frantic meetings in which Dr. Albright tried unsuccessfully to persuade the independent agency to defer consideration of the loan guarantees, she invoked a rarely used law to block the loan. 
 The bank met behind closed doors late this afternoon after receiving a letter from Dr. Albright, and did not go ahead with its previously planned approval of the loan.
State Department officials said Dr. Albright's concerns were entirely focused on questions of the rule of law in Russia and had nothing to do with the country's military campaign in Chechnya, though senior aides to President Clinton noted that the secretary only became deeply involved in the loan issue after Russia's attacks in Chechnya intensified.
"There are a number of reports and allegations that raised questions about the use of bankruptcy laws in Russia and about shareholder and creditor rights," said Al Larson, the under secretary of state for economic affairs. "This is particularly important given the importance of promoting rule of law, something we have discussed for many years, and particularly in the past few months."
The denial of the loan will mean little for the Russian economy. It simply stops American companies from selling oil-drilling and environmental equipment to Tyumen Oil, a company that is 49.8 percent owned by the Russian government.
But the symbolism is far greater. At a crucial time in both Russian domestic politics and American relations with Moscow, Washington's move reflects a hardening of it's stance toward the benefits of "economic engagement" with Russia during its rocky transition to a market economy. American companies considering doing business in Russia could easily be scared off if they think it will become more difficult to obtain guarantees from the United States.
Republicans have already been assailing Vice President Al Gore for his leading role in the Russian aid packages of the past seven years, charging that the taxpayer-supported economic assistance has done little good. While the Clinton administration has defended its approach, it has also slowed money to a trickle while insisting on major changes in the Russian economic and legal system.
Aid from the International Monetary Fund, for example, has been strung along for months, with the administration insisting that Russia first carry out its promised reforms.
The head of the Export-Import Bank, James Harmon, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, had turned the loan into a test of the administration's stomach for continued economic engagement with Russia. He angered many in the administration by insisting that the loan should go ahead if it met the bank's criteria, which are economic in nature, not political.
But from the start the loan guarantees were politically troublesome. Tyumen Oil has been in the middle of several commercial battles in which it was accused of fraud in dealing with BP Amoco, with the investor George Soros and with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
BP Amoco and Mr. Soros both retained powerful lobbyists to plead their case, and Amoco used the loan issue to negotiate a deal resolving its long-running dispute with Tyumen. That agreement is expected to be announced this week, and its resolution might begin to clear the way for the lifting of Dr. Albright's order, officials suggested today.
Under an agreement that will reportedly be signed Wednesday, Tyumen will surrender a valuable oil production unit that it obtained through a quickly executed bankruptcy action from a company called Sidanco. BP Amoco owned 10 percent of Sidanco and originally believed that its investment was lost, leading to its complaints to the Clinton administration. Now, under the agreement reached hours before the Export-Import Bank's board was meeting, it will control a quarter of the voting rights in Sidanco, making it an equal partner with Tyumen.
It is unclear whether that will be enough to lift the order that Dr. Albright issued today under the 1978 "Chafee amendment," named for the late Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. The amendment gives the secretary the right to override any action by the bank deemed contrary to "the national interest." The law uses a country's human rights record as an example of a concern that could lead to canceling a loan; it makes no mention of reform of a nation's commercial legal structures.
No matter what the administration says motivated it to suspend the loan, officials conceded today that the action would be interpreted in Moscow as retaliation by Washington for President Boris N. Yeltsin's refusal to back off from the Chechnya campaign.
"This may really be all about promoting rule of law in Russia," one of Mr. Clinton's economic aides said late today. "But I wouldn't bet that the Russians are going to read it that way."
In the days and hours leading up to Dr. Albright's letter to the bank this afternoon, Mr. Harmon came under extraordinary pressure to back away from the loan. Lobbyists on both sides of the issue cruised the halls of the Ex-Im bank, across Lafayette Park from the White House. A series of senior adminstration officials broadly hinted that Mr. Harmon should become more attuned to the political difficulties of lending to Russia while war rages in Chechnya and Moscow still resists some of the reforms advocated by the I.M.F., according to officials familiar with the discussions.
But Mr. Harmon said that by the criteria his bank was to apply -- putting together financing that will aid American workers with loans and guarantees to creditworthy foreign firms -- the oil project should be approved.
Administration officials insisted today that the order was temporary. "We have issues to work through," one senior official said, "and when that happens this arrangement will be able to go forward."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 6, 2000, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 22 about the denial of an Export-Import Bank loan to Russia misidentified the Wall Street investment house where James A. Harmon worked before he became the bank's chairman and president. It was Schroder Wertheim & Co. (now known as Schroder & Company), not Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: On the Net, Curiosity Has a Price: Registration

BYLINE: By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
NO matter where you go on the Internet these days, it seems you won't get very far without first registering, signing in or becoming a "member," all of which require that you provide your name, your e-mail address and other personal information.
Many computer users shy away from registering at such sites out of concerns about privacy and spamming. But others don't bother simply because registering is a time-consuming pain in the neck. 
 "I wish people wouldn't require log-ins for sites that don't really need it," said Rhonda Hyslop of Washington, who spends about an hour online each day.
"There are two or three sites I've actually signed up for, but unless they provide me with really good information, I'm not going to bother," she added.
Access to the further reaches of a site typically requires you to register by picking a user name and a password, then entering line after line of personal information, which can take several minutes.
The quest for an unreserved user name is one example of how an Internet site throws a wrench into what should be a quick and easy task.
In some cases, if a desired user name is already taken, the site will send the surfer back to a blank page to enter not just a new user name but also every other piece of information relinquished on the first go-round.
"A lot of the time that the Internet was supposed to save you by not having to run to the newsstand or to the library is being lost by what you have to do to get into it," said Joseph Riser, a marketing consultant in Los Angeles.
"You end up registering for these sites that you might not ever use again," he said, "but getting beyond the first page is often not worth the effort."
Greg Peters, president of Vignette, an Internet consulting firm in Austin, Tex., said: "It often seems like Internet companies are more interested in the data than in the person who's actually coming to the site. You have to gain someone's trust before you throw a form in their face. It's like trying to kiss on the first date."
Approximately one in five people will register at a site to get beyond the first few pages of information, according to a recent survey of 10,000 Internet users conducted by Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. The firm also recently published a study predicting that electronic businesses would spend between $1.5 million and $2.1 million in 2000 to redesign sites, in part to address usability issues.
"Everyone is focusing on being first to market right now," said Nora King, vice president for interactive services at Xcelerate, an electronic commerce consulting company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., "but if companies can't master customer profiling in a way that maintains credibility and integrity, they won't stay in business."
Until then, one of the most effective solutions to registration overload is Enonymous.com's Enonymous Advisor, a software program that stores personal information on a person's computer and automatically plugs it into the appropriate registration boxes upon the user's request. The program, which is available free for downloading at www.enonymous.com, is distinct from similar software in that it rates the privacy policies of thousands of Web sites and reveals the ratings to the surfer in pop-up windows whenever a new site is visited. The person can then decide, based on the rating, whether to register.
Blue Mountain Arts, the electronic card company, is one of the few popular sites that does not require registration. That is because it believes the information that is handed over online is not always valid, said Karen Davidson, vice president of marketing and sales.
"Whether it's out of privacy concerns or not, we find that a lot of people give out information that's only partially correct anyway, so for now, we don't require it," Ms. Davidson said, although Blue Mountain Arts may change its policy after Excite@Home completes its acquisition of the company.
"If it's used in a good way, and not just turned over to an advertiser, we don't have a problem with that," she said.
But for patient users, the benefits of taking the time to register make the process worthwhile. "I've never considered registering any deterrent," said Roger Asbury of Fairbanks, Alaska, who is registered at several news and community sites. "It gives me some semblance of confidence that someone can't post a message using my name. Some of the places I visit don't have a lot of members, so they really know me by the name I use, which lends to the sense of community there."
News and community groups that users can customize are other perks that make registration worth the effort, Mr. Asbury said.

HEADLINE: TURF;
When a Broker Becomes an Investor

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
BARBARA CORCORAN, who runs the Corcoran Group, one of the biggest and most visible real estate companies in New York City, has agreed to help finance a new condominium development in Chelsea. She and a colleague have taken a 3 percent share in a new 12-story building planned for the old Barneys parking lot at the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.
With the residential real estate market booming, such a move is logical. Increasingly, the role of real estate brokers is expanding vis-a-vis new developments. Agents consult with developers about apartment layouts and lobby decorations, not to mention ways to attract the type of tenant desired for a particular project and neighborhood. It makes sense that agents want a larger share of the action -- more than just their commissions, which, on co-operatives and condominiums, usually range from 4 to 6 percent of the selling price. 
 But this week, after learning of Ms. Corcoran's new role, several real estate experts said they were generally chary of such investments.
Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that while Ms. Corcoran and Pamela Liebman, the president of Corcoran Group Marketing, had done nothing illegal, "it really clouds the relationships" between brokers and buyers.
"It might be a great business move, but from a brokerage standpoint it might be a big mistake," he said. "Her customers are going to feel she's steering them to a building she has an economic interest in." Asked if Ms. Corcoran should refrain from selling in the building, Mr. Saft said that might "alleviate the problem, but a problem still exists."
The Corcoran Group will be the exclusive sales agent for the new building, which, so far, has no name.
Ms. Corcoran said this week that her investment, on which she expects to make at least 12 percent -- on a dollar figure she refused to divulge -- may be used only for preliminary financing. In that case, she will be repaid before the 37 condominiums go on the market in late spring. But the two investors have the option of hanging on: Ms. Corcoran added that she and Ms. Liebman were told that if they held on until all the apartments were sold, they might earn 50 percent on their money.
She also said that the investment was an experiment and that she was not sure she would do it again.
Ms. Corcoran explained that she had agreed to the investment at the urging of Ms. Liebman, who has represented the developer, Mark Blau, on several projects in TriBeCa. "We grew up with him," she said. "We sold for him on one of his first jobs. When Mark asked Pam, she came and really endorsed it. We knew Mark and trusted Mark."
The investment is "both logical and illogical," Ms. Corcoran continued. "There's something very nice about knowing where you stand," acting only as the agent for a deal. As an investor, "you stand to make a lot of money -- or it could be terrible; you could lose your shirt."
Louise Sunshine, a marketing consultant, has made investments in about half of the Manhattan residential projects she has represented over the last five years -- some dozen properties, she said. At the moment she has no equity shares.
Looking back, Ms. Sunshine said she would not do it again any time soon. When you own part of a project, "you take the risk and responsibility," especially the risk that a contractor may not finish on time or may become mired in cost overruns. That, she said, is what happened in too many of her projects.
"I've not found it a pleasant position to be in," she said. "If I wanted to take those risks, I'd be a developer myself -- and I don't."
William Lie Zeckendorf, whose family has been in the development business for several generations, said that he keeps his development activities totally separate from his involvement in Brown Harris Stevens, the real estate company he owns with three partners. "It's cleaner, it's purer," he said.
Alan Rogers, the chairman and chief executive of Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate company, said that Insignia, which bought Douglas Elliman two years ago, has a commercial development arm. "But there's no residential," he said, and then paused. "Yet."
If Insignia does invest in residential developments, he continued, "the line has to be clear so that there is no misunderstanding; it has to be spelled out in the offering plan."
Mr. Rogers said that in the late 1980's, there wasn't the environment for private investment that exists now. In the 80's, he said, the developers were big-timers, building skyscrapers. Now, with the condominium spurt in low-rise neighborhoods like TriBeCa and Chelsea, "there are a lot of downtown developers who are new to the business, who have to scratch around for money," he continued.
"In this round of development," he added, "there are many more consortiums, amateurs linking up with architects -- that kind of thing."
Still, it is unusual for a broker with Ms. Corcoran's visibility to invest in a residential project.
"Prior to showing the place, there must be disclosure," said Deborah S. Beck, the executive director of the Real Estate Board of New York. "Disclosure is key -- and it must be up front, before the showing, not somewhere down the road."

HEADLINE: How to Make a Museum More Fun to Visit;
A Director Does What He Was Hired To, and the Criticism Won't Let Up

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
On a speedy tour of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he has been director for five years, Malcolm Rogers stopped in the high-ceilinged corridor that was once a tapestry gallery and is now the entryway to the museum's collection of European paintings. Fifty-four paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries, including works by Titian, El Greco, Velazquez and Rubens, are mounted two and three high. It is a commanding medley, a brazen array of artistic riches that tends to make visitors halt in their tracks.
"It's a wonderful room for displaying art," Mr. Rogers said, "that people used to walk right through without stopping." 
 The comment, deft and quite possibly calculated to head off the criticism that the exhibition enhances the dazzle of the room at the expense of the individual paintings, is emblematic of Mr. Rogers's stewardship and the rancorous debate it has generated over his new model for museum management.
In the broadest terms, what he has done at one of the nation's most established (and by most accounts stodgy) museums is to put a priority on enhancing the experience of visitors with the idea of attracting a larger, younger and more diverse audience. That has worked.
But it is an effort, his critics say, that undermines the seriousness of a serious place. The angry controversy that began in June over Mr. Rogers's announcement of a restructuring of the museum's organization and staff keeps being revived by aftershocks.
On Friday, Ellenor Alcorn, a curator of decorative arts who had been at the museum 17 years, resigned. She was the third curator to depart this fall, after two others, both in the decorative arts, were dismissed in the reorganization.
"I don't want the institution to be damaged more than it has," Ms. Alcorn said. "But the decorative arts collections cannot survive without the restitution of the positions that were eliminated."
The treatment of decorative arts, Mr. Rogers's detractors say, is typical of his priorities.
"I think the new director is good at getting money, and I applaud that," said Fred Licht, a curator and scholar who has resigned from the museum's visiting committee in protest. "But his acquisitions, his exhibition policies, everything that has to do with art is a disaster."
Mr. Licht is unusual among art professionals for attaching his name to a pejorative opinion, but he is not alone in that opinion. And it is indisputable by now that the museum's reputation has suffered by its lingering status as a culture-war battlefield.
The outrage has shaken and to a degree divided the museum's board, whose members seem, more than anything, chagrined by the controversy. And because Mr. Rogers, who was previously the deputy director of the National Portrait Gallery in London and whose contract here was renewed in October, was hired by the board with a mandate to make sweeping changes, he has become a flash point in the debate over how museums ought to be run in the 21st century.
"Resiliency and the ability to adapt are quite important in this job," Mr. Rogers said.
No one disputes that his tenure, in boom economic times to be sure, has rescued the museum from severe financial doldrums. His program of crowd-pleasing exhibitions, from "Monet in the 20th Century" to "John Singer Sargent" and a show on the work of the fashion and celebrity photographer Herb Ritts, and his gift for fund-raising have turned a $4 million operating deficit in 1995 into an operating surplus last year of $437,000. His efforts have helped the museum complete a $137 million capital campaign. And the 1.7 million visitors last year were the most in the 129-year history of the place, with membership, at 103,000, nearly double what it was five years ago.
The museum is now praised, among other things, for its renewed commitment to building maintenance (several employees mentioned how much cleaner the place was these days) and for its extended hours. (It is open seven days a week.) The stately front entrance on Huntington Avenue, which was closed in 1990 for financial reasons in a move considered an insult to the working-class neighborhood it faces, has reopened. And the museum's growing efforts to reach out to the community (150,000 students, including every fifth grader in the Boston public schools, took part in museum programs last year) have helped dispel its reputation as a Brahmin-controlled bastion of elitism.
But if Mr. Rogers, 51, an outgoing, round-faced man with a pleasant if beleaguered manner, is wont to anticipate opposition, it is not surprising. He has been drawing increasing criticism from curators, scholars and newspaper reviewers who lament, often with virulent disgust, what they see as an autocratically administered art museum with a diminished emphasis on, well, art.
The imbroglio dates from Mr. Rogers's announcement in June that he would restructure the museum's curatorial model, creating five megadepartments to increase cooperation among curatorial specialties in a way better suited to the physical plant of the museum, which is on the verge of an expansion.
His critics were particularly incensed by the minimal amount of consultation with curators about the new structure and by the abrupt dismissal of 18 employees in eliminated departments. Twenty other people were hired, but among the lost were two senior decorative-arts curators, Jonathan Fairbanks and Anne Poulet, who were dismissed early on June 25 and asked to turn in their keys by the end of the day.
In September, Jeffrey Munger, a European decorative arts curator, resigned. Then in November Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., the museum's curator of American paintings for 22 years, followed suit, stinging Mr. Rogers and the board with a letter critical of the reorganization as having created an unfelicitous atmosphere for curatorial work.
"Looking ahead, I see an endless number of meetings and memos," wrote Mr. Stebbins, whom Mr. Rogers had promoted to head one of the museum's new divisions, "without any assurance, in the end, that I will have the kind of strong voice curators have traditionally had in developing exhibitions and publications, guiding acquisitions, selecting staff and shaping policies."
The Stebbins letter renewed the vigor of Mr. Rogers's critics. The new bureaucracy robs curators of their independence, they say, and they offer a list of slights to the curatorial staff (the canceling of the museum's scholarly bulletin, for example) and a handful of pop-culture-oriented exhibitions (like the Ritts show and a 400-year retrospective on guitar design, scheduled next fall). as evidence that scholarship and high art are not prized as they were.
"The way the paintings are exhibited!" Mr. Licht exclaimed. "All the important jewels of the collection have been massed together in the tapestry gallery, so that these important things that are the center of the collection become a corridor. You can't possibly concentrate on them when you get them massed in close quarters, and it teaches the public a disrespect for art."
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the dispute is how vehement it has become. If Mr. Rogers's fiercest detractors see the battle as one between the forces of art and the forces of commerce, Mr. Rogers's staunchest supporters view the conflict as one between the forces of progress and the forces of inertia. These supporters say privately that the curators have long been coddled, many have been unproductive, and the management model that allowed them their independent pursuit of idiosyncratic interests helped bring the museum nearly to financial ruin.
"What I think is going on is that people are scared," said Alan Strassman, a trustee and former board president who was among the leading developers of the reorganization plan. "We're going to redefine the model of how to manage an encyclopedic art museum in the 21st century. And if people have been very cozy and happy, they're not going to be very interested in responsibilities associated with a new template."
The actual state of affairs, as visits on three consecutive days and dozens of interviews showed, is more nuanced than either view. The museum is thronged with visitors, and three current exhibitions -- one focusing on Egyptian art during the brief reign of the pharaoh Ikhnaton, another on the work of the 19th-century American painter Martin Johnson Heade and a third on new paintings by the contemporary Expressionist Susan Rothenberg -- all well reviewed, certainly argue against the notion that it has forsworn curatorial standards.
"The Egypt exhibit exemplifies the highest scholarship," Mr. Rogers said, with more than a hint of exasperation. "And the very critics who have accused me of dumbing down the museum love it. And it was my idea. It's so peculiar."
Some administrators at other museums recognize the pickle he's in. "This is what directors are hired to do, and it's what they inevitably have to do, make big decisions that are controversial," said the director of a major museum in New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Whether this particular plan is a good idea is debatable but not inconceivable. That is, it was perfectly reasonable to suggest this plan. You can debate whether it is an intelligent one."
That is precisely what happened, at high volume. The plan was immediately denounced by art scholars, who among other things found it untenable to think that a single curator could satisfyingly oversee such disparate collections as, for example, American paintings, decorative arts and pre-Columbian art, which have been gathered under the rubric Art of the Americas, headed until recently by Mr. Stebbins.
The dismissals that ignited much of the criticism were handled poorly, most board members admit. They say they followed the advice of outside consultants to get them over with as quickly as possible. And they have softened their announced position on the restructuring, saying there is some room for flexibility. (Mr. Fairbanks and Ms. Poulet, the dismissed curators, who have been given emeritus positions, said they were constrained from commenting by their severance agreements.)
In the museum Mr. Rogers's supporters have seen positive changes. What the director has done, said Nancy Allen, a 24-year employee who is director of information resources, is change the culture of the institution.
"What's different now is that change is possible," said Ms. Allen, who is in charge of developing the museum's computerized database and of augmenting the photographic documentation of the museum's holdings.
"We've gotten funding to photograph every Rembrandt, Durer and Goya in our collection. We plan to photograph every item in the textile collection. These things were never within our reach. If it takes a Herb Ritts show to do that, all I can say is, 'What's the next Herb Ritts show?' I don't know what it feels like to be a curator now, but I can't believe there's not enough respect to go around."
But as Ms Alcorn's resignation showed, wounds remain open. Over the summer, as published criticism continued and museum professionals from around the country wrote in to express concern, divisions within the board surfaced.
In August, James Cuno, a trustee who is director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, wrote a four-page letter to the board president, Robert P. Henderson, which was distributed among the trustees. In it he detailed the unanswered questions about the restructuring plan and said the board should seriously consider the criticism that the museum's curatorial enterprise was being undervalued.
Both sides say it will take years for their points to be proved. Either the new structure will work and a financially sound institution will provide increased community service for a growing audience as it maintains a foundation of high connoisseurship and academic rigor, or the devaluing of scholarship will attenuate the museum's curatorial expertise and the place will devolve into mediocrity.
"There is no question that the kinds of questions that have come to us from within the scholarly community need to be addressed," said Ted Landsmark, president of the Boston Architecture Center, who has been on the museum board for five years. Mr. Landsmark was the only one, among a dozen or so interviewed, to express a conciliatory stance for attribution.
"We will need to take deliberate steps designed to reassure the scholarly and curatorial communities that we have a commitment to core value of helping a broad public understand art in culture," he said, "and that we are not becoming a financial-based bottom-line institution."

HEADLINE: Space Travel in a Loft

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON 

 BODY:
CLIENTS willing to indulge the futuristic whims of architects are notoriously rare. But Winka Dubbeldam, a Dutch-born architect based in Manhattan, seems to have a knack for attracting patrons susceptible to her visual poetry and her sculptor's passion for combining natural materials to achieve novel effects. Among her fans, the famously demanding architect Peter Eisenman called her "a very talented, highly energetic and motivated person."
"She's the pulse of the moment," he added.
Swinging open a pivoting door at the center of a 50-foot-long wall of translucent glass and steel that tilts at five distinct angles, spaceship-style, Ms. Dubbeldam said, "What I do is so specific, people either love it or hate it." 
 She was standing in the exuberantly minimalist SoHo pied-a-terre she designed for Jonathon Carroll, a British art collector, who recently retired from investment banking at 33. "As my mum says, I'm unemployed," the Birmingham-born Mr. Carroll joked.
A devotee of cutting-edge design, he seemed eager to extol the beauty of his loft, and its sense of play: the space flows freely through three distinct areas, kept in flux by moving parts and transparency.
"I think it's a reaction to the traditional house with chintzy curtains I grew up in -- the kind of house that still horrifies me," he said.
The apartment occupies the fifth floor of a former warehouse, built around 1870, which had been unoccupied for a decade when Mr. Carroll moved in last year. He interviewed three architects before hiring Ms. Dubbeldam, admiring the experimental verve of her portfolio and her imaginative use of wood, polished plaster, steel, concrete and glass.
"I only work with natural materials because they have a subtle, soft effect on the experience of the space," Ms. Dubbeldam said, adding that she developed an affinity for them while studying sculpture. "I love the feeling of spaces that are seamless and fluid, where there's a possibility of transforming the space by pivoting a table, swiveling a TV."
Her passion for design was kindled in childhood in Gorinchem, a seaside town near Rotterdam, where she grew up the daughter of a government official and a fashion stylist. "My parents bought a new house every two years, because my father loved finding new houses and my mother loved doing the interiors," said Ms. Dubbeldam, a sprightly, handsome woman with expressive hands and eyes that are apt to twinkle when she speaks of architecture. "So, I was always fighting with my brother over who got the best room."
Spurred by that early sibling rivalry, Ms. Dubbeldam went on to graduate from the Academy of Architecture in Rotterdam before moving to New York in 1990 to study at Columbia University. From there, she worked for two innovative and internationally recognized architects, Bernard Tschumi and Mr. Eisenman, before setting up her own firm, Archi-Tectonics, in 1994. Fascinated by the challenges of creating sculptural design using computers, she currently teaches Paperless Studio, a course for third-year architecture graduates at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. Her meticulous computer-generated drawings, and a model for a house in Millbrook, N.Y., were included in "The Un-Private House," the Museum of Modern Art's critically acclaimed summer exhibition.
Ms. Dubbeldam has a fascinating way of layering space to create a sense of peacefulness: few interiors can match the tranquillity of Mr. Carroll's apartment. Stepping from the elevator, visitors first encounter a wall of soft-gray plaster interrupted at waist level by a broad horizontal cutaway that offers a peak into an intriguingly spare, ordered interior.
To obscure an unappealing view, windows at the rear of the loft were coated with a translucent, removable film that resembles sandblasted glass, creating the effect of radiant light boxes by day and providing privacy at night.
Ingeniously configured expanses of translucent glass, steel and concrete also dominate the new 24,000-square-foot headquarters on West 23rd Street of Duggal Color Projects, one of the city's largest photographic and computer imaging companies, which Ms. Dubbeldam designed for Baldev Duggal, the owner.
"Our work is all rush and meeting deadlines, but here, you still get a feeling of peace," Mr. Duggal said, contemplating a sweeping circular steel staircase leading to a new 6,000-square-foot cantilevered mezzanine -- a serene, glass-clad office space that appears to hover above the busy main floor "street level." Vintage columns form an arcade. The office has walls of opague glass; clear glass inserts at eye level form a horizon.
For Mr. Carroll, Ms. Dubbeldam produced drawings and models so inventive and assured that Mr. Carroll felt confident about leaving her to execute his project, monitoring progress from London via e-mail, fax and weekend visits once a month. "Winka had to make a lot of decisions for me," he said. "But she actually made better choices than I would have made myself."
Soaring arched windows illuminate the immense main living space, which encompasses three free-flowing but distinct areas, each containing movable elements that contribute to an engaging sense of playfulness, inviting discovery.
In a spacious sisal-carpeted sitting area, floor-to-ceiling raw-linen curtains can be drawn to create an intimate atmosphere for lounging in front of a slate fireplace set into a jutting, right-angled corner. Across the room, a silver flat-screen television suspended from a vertical pole can be swiveled to provide entertainment from multiple angles. Similarly, a poured-acrylic see-through breakfast bar, cantilevered from a tree-trunk column in front of the gleaming stainless-steel kitchen in the center of the apartment, can be swiveled from side to side at whim. "The structural engineer kept saying, 'Are you sure you want this?' " Ms. Dubbeldam recalled. "I guess it was a bit new for him."
Clearly enchanted by all the modernity, Mr. Carroll does not seem at all fazed that his designer has given him a doorless master bedroom. "It is possible to have privacy," he insisted, dragging a giant moss-green Ultrasuede curtain around the room to demonstrate that it can be transformed into a giant cocoon. "It is a bedroom, after all," he said.
Nearby, a suite of more intimately scaled rooms -- a modern walnut-paneled library, two guest bedrooms and the master bathroom -- are nestled behind the apartment's signature bulging steel-and-glass wall. The bathroom, contained in a glass capsule, is the most spectacular.
"If you're naked in the shower and your mum and gran are sitting out there in the kitchen having breakfast, you obviously don't want them going, 'Oh, my God!' " Mr. Carroll said, recalling that he erred on the side of caution when he and Ms. Dubbeldam experimented with glass of varying clarity for the wall.
"I said it should be more translucent, because it would steam up when you take a shower," Ms. Dubbeldam added mischievously, noting that they reached a compromise with semiopaque panels that permit the passage of light but preserve a bather's privacy.
In a striking contrast to the rest of the apartment, where neutral-toned plaster walls complement artworks by Warhol, Christo and Hockney, the master bathroom is a riot of vivid, purplish-blue polished plaster. The floor, washstand, shower and bathtub were created by pouring a thin warm-to-the-touch layer of concrete, mixed with prodigious quantities of pigment over custom-built molds of fiberglass and timber.
The most startling feature is the stainless-steel toilet from Metcraft, a Missouri-based company that supplies prisons. "I said I wanted two, and the guy said, 'Two hundred, right?' " Ms. Dubbeldam recalled, laughing.
Somewhat alarmingly, the all-metal toilet has no raiseable seat (to spare inmates the temptation of prying them off to use as weapons). "When I explained that to Jonathon, he said, 'But it's going to be cold,' " Ms. Dubbeldam said, grinning. "So I told him, 'Get used to it.' "
Working with Mr. Duggal over the last year on his new headquarters in Chelsea, Ms. Dubbeldam found herself dealing with a client no less passionate than Mr. Carroll about innovative design, but with an infinitely more complex and shifting series of spacial requirements. The challenge was to accommodate under one giant roof advances in new technology and operations that had sprawled over 12 floors.
At the company's new headquarters, gracious 1880 cast-iron columns coexist with sleek new forms in an office that is a city block deep.
"The columns are the real sculpture of the space," Ms. Dubbeldam said, recalling that all 18 were invisible under multiple layers of paint, gypsum and grime before Mr. Duggal had them stripped.
"I'm lucky having Jonathon and Mr. D. as clients because they're like me -- they want everything to look perfect," Ms. Dubbeldam said. She withholds such praise for those who labor at Gear magazine, whose offices in Chelsea she designed for Bob Guccione, the publisher, earlier this year.
"As the architect, I can't very well say, 'Clean this up!' " Ms. Dubbeldam noted ruefully. On a recent visit, Gear's spacious blue-and-green river-view offices were strewn with a workaday assortment of sports equipment, stray files and portable coat racks.
"Winka thinks we're a bunch of pigs, I guess," said Lonnie Major, the office manager.
To escape the exigencies of her architectural practice, Ms. Dubbeldam often leaves the city on weekends, driving her 1976 Pacer, with its distinctive oblong hatchback. "I can't tell you how much I love it when people in big Mercedes yell, 'Love your car,' " she said. Ambitiously, she is counting on the Pacer to pull her latest acquisition, a silvery 1967 Airstream.
"Next," she said, "I want to buy a piece of land so I can park my Airstream."
And hopefully, find the time to build a house of her own.

BYLINE: Compiled by Terence Neilan

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
RUSSIA: TALKS WITH U.S. -- Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott discussed arms control and other issues with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, but the two appeared to make little headway. The Defense Ministry again ridiculed United States proposals to alter the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to permit a limited defense against rogue missiles, saying the treaty is the basis of arms control. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
RUSSIA, BELARUS: PACT APPROVED -- Legislators in Russia and Belarus voted to ratify a treaty moving the two nations closer to economic union, but still well short of political merger. The treaty, signed this month by the Russian and Belarussian presidents, calls for a unified tax system by 2001 and a common currency by 2005, but is mostly short on details. It replaces a similar document signed in 1996. Michael Wines (NYT) 
 
BRITAIN: PINOCHET HEALTH CHECK -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, will be given an independent medical examination on Jan. 5, the government said. General Pinochet, 84, has complained of poor health as he waits for possible extradition to Spain on charges of torture. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: EASING QUARANTINE -- Starting Feb. 28, cats and dogs entering Britain from European Union countries, Switzerland and Norway will not be subject to the usual six months in quarantine. The government said that as part of a pilot program, pets vaccinated against rabies and that have been fitted with an identity microchip, among other things, will forgo the usual stay in a government-approved kennel. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
SWITZERLAND: MORE SLAVES BOUGHT -- A Swiss-based rights group said it bought the freedom of 5,514 more slaves in Sudan last week. Christian Solidarity International said the latest action brought to 20,961 the number of slaves freed through its program since 1995. The executive director of Unicef, Carol Bellamy, has said the practice of buying slaves' freedom "encouraged more trafficking and criminality." (Reuters)
 
UKRAINE: PREMIER APPROVED -- Parliament approved the central bank chairman, Viktor Yushchenko, as prime minister. Mr. Yushchenko, 45, was backed by 296 of 411 members in the chamber, well clear of the 226 votes needed for confirmation. Mr. Yushchenko, who advocates radical market reforms, pledged to reduce government intervention in the economy, consolidate state finances and promote privatization and land reform. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
NAMIBIA: U.S. WARNING -- The American Embassy issued a warning against travel in northeast Namibia, where fighting between Angolan rebels and Angolan and Namibian forces persists. Angolan troops have recently operated openly in northern Namibia, using the area to mount attacks on rebel bases in Angola's extreme southeast. The attacks have prompted rebel strikes against Namibian forces. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
 
NIGER: PRESIDENT SWORN IN -- The newly elected civilian president, Tandja Mamadou, took his oath of office, marking the end of military rule. Mr. Tandja, a retired army colonel, succeeded Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, who won the disputed 1996 presidential election but was shot dead by soldiers in April. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
INDONESIA: U.N. TRIBUNAL RULED OUT -- Indonesia will not allow its top generals to be tried at a war crimes tribunal being considered by the United Nations, President Abdurrahman Wahid said, adding that Indonesia's judicial system would bring those responsible for atrocities in East Timor to justice. He spoke after the former military chief, Gen. Wiranto, failed to appear before a panel investigating East Timor abuses. (AP)
 
CHINA: COMPUTER ALERT -- China has ordered a three-day New Year's holiday and prohibited foreign ships from entering Chinese ports for two days to minimize disruptions from possible computer coding failures, the state-run China Daily reported. The last day of business for 1999 will be Dec. 30. Government agencies and businesses will not reopen until Jan. 3. (AP)
 
TAIWAN: TOP AIDE RESIGNS -- The president's chief of staff resigned after admitting to an affair with a former actress, which he called a "serious error." John Chang, 58, grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and the only Chiang descendant active in Taiwan politics, said that he needed time off to be with his family but that he planned to continue in public service. Mr. Chang is a former foreign minister and deputy prime minister. (AP)
 
INDIA: SEATS FOR WOMEN -- Despite growing opposition, the government will introduce a bill in the lower house today seeking to reserve seats in Parliament for women, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan said. On Tuesday opposition legislators held a sit-in against the bill, saying it should also include quotas for lower castes and minorities in general. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: BUDGET IMPASSE -- Congress, meeting in extraordinary session to vote on next year's budget, defeated the bill offered by President Ernesto Zedillo's party as well as an alternative bill from the opposition, which includes slightly more spending for health and education. Lawmakers renewed negotiations, with some urging a second session after Christmas but before the New Year, when the budget must be approved to avoid a constitutional crisis. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: GOLAN RE-EDUCATION -- Education Minister Yossi Sarid sent a letter to school principals urging them to open up classrooms to discussion of a possible withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Calling it "a controversial and burning issue on the national agenda," he said viewpoints supporting and opposing withdrawal as a condition of peace with Syria should be presented.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Cigarette Tax

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "New York Raising Tax on Cigarettes to Help Uninsured" (front page, Dec. 18): As a smoker, I feel robbed. 
 First, while extending medical care to all who need it is a program worthy of any Democrat, paying for it is the responsibility of all of us. There is no fiscal justification for exempting non-smokers from financing the program's cost.
Second, Gov. George E. Pataki's economic calculation is iniquitous. Habituated smokers' demand for cigarettes is price inelastic. Exploiting inelasticities along a demand curve is called price discrimination and is outlawed in civilian applications under many of our antitrust laws. Third, the smugness with which nonsmokers believe that raising the price will reduce the number of smokers is as offensive as it is wrong-headed. Smoking is not a crime and should not be penalized.

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Agrees On Two-Year Budget

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 22

 BODY:
A General Assembly committee reached agreement today on a two-year budget for the organization that American diplomats hope will fall within the "nominal no-growth" spending demanded by the United States Congress in return for releasing money to pay overdue American debts.
The budget is expected to be approved by the full General Assembly on Thursday. 
 The two-year budget for the headquarters -- not including money to be spent on agencies like Unicef or the World Heath Organization, which raise their own funds -- has been held to $2.535 billion, $2 million more than the previous budget, diplomats said.
The American demand for a no-growth budget, which some United Nations officials see as hamstringing the organization for domestic political reasons in Washington, was one of many conditions that Congress attached to payments to the United Nations. The United States is now more than $1 billion in debt, a sum close to the United Nations operating expenses for one year.
The most difficult Congressional condition remains to be settled, a demand to lower American payments to the organization. The payments are linked to the proportion of the world economy in the hands of the United States. That issue will be taken up in the new year.

G.M. and Ford Expected to Compete for Daewoo Motor

BYLINE: By SAMUEL LEN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Daewoo Motor Company became the object of a potential bidding brawl between the world's two largest automakers today after the South Korean government decided to solicit offers instead of negotiate with a single buyer.
The government, which is overseeing Daewoo Motor's sale as part of a broader dismantling of the Daewoo Group, the insolvent conglomerate, decided to auction the automaker after the Ford Motor Company expressed interest in buying it. Earlier, the government had indicated it might bargain exclusively with the General Motors Corporation, which said last week that it wanted to buy Daewoo Motor. 
 It is unclear how much buyers ultimately would be willing to pay for Daewoo Motor, which carries more than $16 billion of Daewoo Group's estimated $78 billion in debts. But G.M. reportedly had offered as much as $7 billion for Daewoo Motor's assets, and the assumption of an unspecified amount of the debt.
For both Ford and G.M., the acquisition of Daewoo Motor would offer an instant expansion of their manufacturing and marketing in Asia, which has rebounded from a 1997 economic crisis and is now considered a most promising region for increased vehicle sales.
The Financial Supervisory Commission, the government agency responsible for the sale of Daewoo Motor, said it would "take place through a method where an investor with the best advantages, selected from their letters of intent, will be given exclusive negotiating rights."
G.M. declined to comment on the government's decision, but it is clearly a setback for the automaker, which had hoped to reach a deal without rival interference by negotiating an exclusive contract quickly.
Ford said it intended to step up negotiations with Daewoo Motor's South Korean creditors. Jim Bright, a Ford Motor spokesman in Detroit, said that Paul Drenkow, a senior Ford manager in the Asia-Pacific region, would lead a group meeting in early January with Daewoo Motor's main creditor, Korea Development Bank.
"Projected growth in the global auto industry is going to occur in other places than in North America and Europe, and most of that growth is going to occur in Asia," Mr. Bright said. "We're definitely interested in Daewoo Motor."
Ford and G.M. have jostled before in trying to acquire a South Korean automaker. When Ford began a serious bid for the Kia Motor Corporation, G.M. flirted briefly with that bankrupt company until the Hyundai Motor Company beat Ford in October 1998.
South Korea has spent the last year recovering from the Asian economic crisis and car sales this year have doubled since the peak of the recession in 1998, nearly catching up with levels seen just before the crisis began in 1997.
Combined domestic and overseas car sales by Daewoo, Hyundai and Kia totaled more than 300,000 vehicles last month. Ranked by automobile sales, South Korea is second only to Japan in the Asian market.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Kodak has given its Times Square billboard a face lift to keep up with the neighborhood.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane 

 BODY:
ONE of the original extravagant signs at the crossroads of the world has undergone a face lift to keep up with its glitzy high-technology neighbors.
After 15 years, the Eastman Kodak Company recently renovated its billboard, which has been a fixture in Times Square since it was designed as part of the exterior of the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets. 
 The gigantic billboard -- which outdoor-advertising executives refer to as spectaculars -- has always featured an illuminated image of stunning photography accompanied by the Kodak logo. Now, the new sign, which is 52 feet high by 70 feet wide, is not only 20 percent larger than its predecessor but is brighter and features a state-of-the-art Sony Jumbotron screen.
"Signage in Times Square has been changing dramatically over the past several years," said Mike Ianzito, director for marketing communications at Eastman Kodak, which is based in Rochester. "It was really our goal to bring it up to current times. With all the advances in technology, we decided to recreate the Kodarama with a completely new concept in lighting and imagery."
The new 1,800-square-foot Kodak image area, which the company refers to as the Kodarama, is divided into three areas: a 15-by-60 foot primary display that takes up the lower half featuring eye-catching photographs like those its predecessor displayed over the years. In the upper right portion is the Sony Jumbotron video screen. And the other section is either used as an extension of the main display or to show images of Kodak products and promotions.
"With the new video capability, we can show our commercials or do live telecasts from the Olympics or other venues," Mr. Ianzito said. In addition, Kodak will be able to create direct links to its Web site, displaying Web pages like Kodak Photoquilt, where consumers send in their most meaningful photos.
The content of the billboard, created by the New York office of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group, will ideally change every few months or so, Mr. Ianzito said. But through January the display will feature Kodak's "millennium gallery," which will cycle through images of the 20th century.
The entire image area features a black-and-white aerial view of a construction worker waving from a girder above the Manhattan skyline in the 1930's. The picture remains for five seconds, then the screen dissolves into a three-minute slide show of images from famous to everyday moments in this century. At various times, title cards state: "A picture speaks so loudly . . . just listen."
One image, for instance, is Winston Churchill flashing his "V" for victory sign, fading into Mickey Mantle with his four fingers up in the air signifying a grand slam home run, to former President Richard Nixon bidding farewell in front of a helicopter. Those famous moments in history, which are in no particular order, are interspersed with ordinary moments like people at the beach in the 1920's or a picture of a family having dinner.
The renovation of the sign is indicative of the ever-changing Times Square landscape. The Kodak sign is the second spectacular to be revamped, after the transformation of the Coca-Cola billboard eight and a half years ago. In the mid-1980's, those two were the only major American companies with billboards in the square when the neighborhood's bleak, seedy appearance discouraged tourists and New Yorkers alike.
But, over the years, the improvements in Times Square's economic and physical health transformed the lineup of marketers planting, or replanting, their brands on billboards there. And the square is now bursting with electronic spectaculars that feature huge video screens, message centers, electronic strips or ribbons, printed vinyl that changes and, of course, flashing neon.
Michael Forte, chief executive of Spectacolor Communications Inc. in New York, which specializes in Times Square signs and is handling Kodak's job, said: "Everybody gives the credit to Disney as the turning point to Times Square. But Times Square has always been Times Square. It was always an entertainment mecca. Although it had its slow days, I think people always wanted Times Square to come back."
The "great signs" in the square now have three components in common, Mr. Forte said. "They all have something that is permanent for the corporate name. They all have something that is spectacular, and something that is changeable."
Neither Kodak nor Spectacolor would disclose the cost of the Kodak sign or discuss the multiyear contract to lease the space. However, leases usually cost millions, plus millions more to build, operate and maintain the billboards.

HEADLINE: Strengthening Mr. Castro's Hand

 BODY:
Forty-one years after he came to power and a decade after the end of the cold war, Fidel Castro maintains his repressive rule over Cuba, in part with the unwitting collusion of the United States. The resolution this week of a hostage standoff with Cuban detainees in a Louisiana jail and the unresolved custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in Florida are examples of how an outdated American attempt to isolate Cuba and weaken Mr. Castro's regime accomplishes just the opposite.
Both of these events are symptoms of an obsolete and increasingly counterproductive American estrangement from Cuba. In Louisiana, United States officials ended the six-day standoff by striking a deal with the Cuban government that permitted six of seven Cuban inmates at the center of the uprising to be deported back to Cuba. The inmates had come here in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which Mr. Castro sent thousands of criminals to the United States. The inmates had completed prison sentences for crimes committed in this country but were being held indefinitely because their deportation had been blocked by Mr. Castro. 
 The agreement by which Mr. Castro dropped his opposition would appear to be a laudable example of all-too-infrequent cooperation between the two countries. But it should not have been necessary. Because the United States lacks normal diplomatic relations with Cuba, some 2,400 Cuban inmates are languishing in local jails across America under similarly combustible circumstances. Instead of deporting them routinely, the United States has to rely on Mr. Castro's political calculation that he can play the statesman, thereby enhancing his stature at home and abroad.
Similarly, the unseemly custody battle over Elian Gonzalez was partly a symptom of the embargo and related laws. The boy was rescued off the Florida coast on Nov. 25 after surviving a boat capsizing that claimed the lives of his mother and stepfather. The United States ban on all exports to Cuba, including food and medicine, fuels the very hardships that drive Cubans to flee the island. The Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, in turn, which enables Cubans to circumvent immigration requirements that apply to all other nationals, has become a strong incentive for the kind of smuggling enterprise using overloaded powerboats that nearly cost Elian his life.
The act also made it possible for the boy to be immediately turned over to relatives in Miami, who have allowed him to be cynically exploited by exiles bent on discrediting Mr. Castro. Now we are confronted with the spectacle of Mr. Castro, whose police state has ruined countless families, demanding that Elian be returned to his father and grandparents. The case must be resolved in a manner that best serves the boy's needs, not those of Mr. Castro or his opponents.
With his Soviet benefactors long gone and his state-controlled economy on its knees, Mr. Castro has little left with which to mobilize popular support beyond his stature as defender of the homeland against American economic aggression. The Clinton administration has moved in the last year toward a slight thawing on the margins, allowing cultural exchanges and increasing travel opportunities, for example. But on the larger issues of trade and diplomacy it remains trapped in a futile policy from the cold-war past.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Kept Surging In 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The nation's economic performance in the third quarter was its strongest in almost a year, Commerce Department figures showed today.
The gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced in the United States, rose at a 5.7 percent annual rate in the three months ended Sept. 30 because of upward revisions in consumer spending on services and business inventories. The pace, previously estimated at 5.5 percent, was the fastest since the 5.9 percent rate in 1998's fourth quarter. 
 Analysts are forecasting a 4.7 percent expansion rate in this year's final quarter, which ends a week from Friday. "The economy is going gangbusters and inflation remains muted," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland, Pa.
A separate University of Michigan report released today showed that consumer confidence in the economy rose to 105.4 this month in the index the university maintains, up from the preliminary reading of 104.2. That suggests that rising stock values and the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years will most likely fuel additional gains in spending.
The economic expansion, already the longest in peacetime, is on track to become the longest ever in February. It would surpass the 1961-1969 expansion that coincided with the Vietnam War, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group.
The consumer spending spree, even before the start of the holiday shopping season, drove most of the third-quarter increase in G.D.P. Spending rose at an annual rate of 4.9 percent, up from a previous estimate of 4.6 percent; the revised figure put spending on course to rise 5.2 percent for all of 1999. That would be the largest annual rise since a 5.4 percent gain in 1984. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity.
The revision was paced by an increase in spending on brokers' commissions and other services; it grew at a 5 percent pace, up from a previously estimated 4.5 percent rate. Spending on services is also on track to top last year's 4 percent increase, the largest gain since 1988.
The G.D.P. report offered fresh evidence that inflation stayed subdued. The G.D.P. price deflator -- a measure of price increases followed by many investors -- grew at a 1.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter, the same as previously reported. That is lower than increases of 1.4 percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first.

Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 Ride Technology to Records

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, led by technology companies like Microsoft, lifting the Nasdaq composite index and the S.& P. 500 to records.
The Nasdaq gained 26.15 points, to 3,937.30, its 57th record closing high of the year. The index has risen almost 80 percent this year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.06 points, to 11,203.60, with gains in Eastman Kodak and Procter & Gamble offsetting declines in banks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.70 points, to 1,436.13, a record high close.
The broad market, however, turned negative, as declining Nasdaq issues outpaced those advancing 2,257 to 1,920; on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,698 stocks fell compared with 1,426 gaining.
"The pattern remains the same, and that pattern is continued strength by individual issues that dominate the averages," said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar & Company.
"In the broader market, the new highs versus new lows is a disaster," he said. "But the stock market is not a democracy."
Eastman Kodak and Procter & Gamble raised the Dow. Kodak rose 4 11/16, to 62 1/16, after the company named a new chief financial officer.
P.& G. gained 4 1/2, to 109. Analysts said they saw strength in the entire consumer products sector. Also on Tuesday, the company won a court battle against a rival citing false advertising.
Insurers and drug stocks also traded higher. American International Group gained 2 7/16, to 107 13/16. The company, the world's largest insurer, may be interested in acquiring the Trust Insurance Company of Massachusetts, according to a report in The Boston Globe.
Pharmacia & Upjohn and Monsanto, which have agreed to merge, inched higher after offering skeptical investors a set of upbeat earnings forecasts to gain some support for their deal. Pharmacia gained 2, to 46 5/8, and Monsanto was up 9/16, to 36 13/16.
"They have been undervalued relative to their growth prospects," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, in reference to the drug stocks.
Bellwether technology names shifted higher with Microsoft, a Dow component, rising 1 11/16, to 117 9/16, after reaching a new intraday high of 118. Dell Computer also rose, by 9/16, to 50 5/16.
On the negative side, AT&T lost 1 1/4, to 52 15/16 7/8, after Bell Atlantic received clearance from the Federal Communications Commission to offer long-distance phone service in New York. AT&T said it expected to file a court challenge to the ruling. Bell Atlantic lost 1 1/16, to 64 1/2.
Among financial stocks, American Express declined 2 7/16, to 155 3/8.

Israel's Shame

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Li Peng, China's hardest-line Com munist leader the man famed for ordering the Tiananmen massacre -- was feted in Israel this month.
After a visit to the Holocaust memorial, Foreign Ministry officials took him to the Israeli Aircraft Industries facility near Ben-Gurion Airport. He inspected a Russian-built plane, owned by the Chinese, on which Israel is installing an advanced AWACS battle-management system called the Phalcon. 
 Israel is charging a quarter of a billion dollars for the aerial reconnaissance radar installation, and has a contract for three more. It's a lucrative deal. It may also be the biggest geopolitical blunder any Israeli government ever made.
Free Chinese on Taiwan have no such high-altitude early-warning system. Combined with the new long-range and surface-to-air missiles being installed by China in Zhangzhou, its Israeli purchases will give it a "qualitative edge" in any military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait. That would include, of course, new ability for China to look down on and target any U.S. warships sent to discourage invasion.
Why is Israel, a small democratic nation threatened by powerful neighbors, helping to menace Taiwan, another small democratic nation threatened by a nearby tyranny?
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been ducking me on this (Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin were more courageous about facing embarrassing questions), but here are the reasons behind Israel's amoral policy:
1. Arms exports enable Israel to improve its own defenses. Besides, America's Boeing and Loral have done more to build Beijing's military than all other nations combined.
2. China offers a huge market for Israeli technology; moreover, its position on the U.N. Security Council offers big-power diplomatic engagement long limited to the U.S.
3. Israel has avoided the transfer of technology it received from the U.S. to any third party without clearance; Phalcon avionics were Israeli-developed. And the U.S. for years did not object to Israel's efforts to follow the U.S. into the Chinese arms market.
4. China's vast network of human intelligence agents can, better than U.S. satellites, relay secret information to Israel about North Korea's sales of missiles to Iraq and Russia's nuclear development of Iran.
That's the case for Israel's supply alliance with China against Taiwan. Here is the case against:
This flies directly in the face of United States security interests. When China last threatened Taiwan, President Clinton was forced to put two U.S. aircraft carriers into the strait. When that happens again, American forces will be directly threatened by Chinese air, naval and missile forces emboldened by Israel's Phalcon battle management.
That's why the Senate Foreign Relations chairman, Jesse Helms, long a supporter of Israel, wrote to its government privately on Nov. 17: "The Pentagon has informed me that this system may be more advanced than the U.S. AWACS and will definitely enhance China's power projection capabilities. . . . United States security will be put at risk by the Phalcon and other Israeli sales to Beijing."
Though candidates for U.S. president today are fearful of raising this question, American supporters of Israel want to know: If Israel tips the technological military balance against a democratic American ally in Asia, why should the U.S. guarantee that Israel continue to have a "qualitative edge" in the Middle East?
Throughout the cold war, Israel and America were together on the side of freedom. In the coming superpower rivalry in Asia, will Israel choose neutralism? And when the multibillion-dollar bill comes in to subsidize a settlement with Syrians and Palestinians, will Israel's prime minister seek economic aid from his big new Asian customer?
Let's talk tachlis, Yiddish for "brass tacks": If the freedom of an island with 22 million souls is of no concern to Israel, the world will care even less about 6 million Jews getting pushed into the sea. Israeli survival has one dependable guarantor, and the powerful U.S.-Israel alliance is nothing without its moral dimension.
That's why some of us hope that after being shown around the Holocaust museum and the Phalcon plant, the "butcher of Beijing" did not get an idea for the final solution to the Taiwanese question.

HEADLINE: For Baby Sitters Around Nation, New Year's Eve Is Best of Times

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
On New Year's Eve, many of the 1,000-some couples attending the Memphis Junior League's charity ball at the Peabody Hotel will take their children along. So the parents can be free to cavort, they have corralled 40 baby sitters from the Annie's Nannies agency. Each sitter will be paid $330 for the 11-hour affair, triple the agency's usual rate.
So it will be in most big cities and their affluent suburbs this New Year's Eve. Baby sitters, whether teenage amateurs or professional adults like those from Annie's Nannies, stand to earn up to $100 an hour for one night's work, or more than many a partygoer's champagne. 
 In New York, the demand for sitters is "high, high, high," said Heidi Davalos of the Baby Sitters Guild placement service. She is charging a minimum of $250 for five hours for up to five children.
"We're fully booked," Ms. Davalos said, with 100 sitters assigned.
In spite of reports of a more tranquil millennium-crossing than first forecast, with many hotels and restaurants hoping for guests and chopping prices, placement services say they are running short of the nation's sitters -- baby sitters, pet sitters and building sitters, or security guards -- who free others to celebrate.
By most accounts, demand for sitters and guards this New Year's Eve far exceeds that of previous years. More people plan to go out, and more businesses want protection against vandalism and system and power failures if computers go awry. Meanwhile, the supply of sitters is lower than usual, with more taking the night off themselves. Many an agency's answering machine says its sitters are booked through New Year's.
"I'm getting more requests than I've ever had," said Nate Wood, a senior vice president at Blackhawk Inc. in Suitland, Md., near Washington, which places security guards. Blackhawk has exhausted its reserve supply of guards filling the swollen demand of regular clients.
"Everyone wants security," Mr. Wood said, "for cabarets, for special events. All of our banks want extra coverage. All of our retail clients. We've been driven all the way to the end of our means."
To feed and tend pets, Sit-a-Pet in Arlington, Va., normally charges $17 for a half-hour visit with one pet once a day and $2 for each additional dog or cat. But to induce more of her 70 sitters to stay on the job, the agency's owner, Debbie Hollander, said, "We have a millennium policy. For anyone using us the 31st or the 1st, it's an additional $25 a day."
But in terms of the pay, the cream of this crop is entrepreneurial teenagers and adult women who care for children.
Fifteen-year-old Ingrid Aguero of Miami and her cousin, Amy Rejaian, 14, will watch children in Ingrid's home. They have lined up three children so far, ages 8 months to 7 years to spend the night. For the three, they will earn $135, and they are advertising on the Internet for more.
"We thought it would be too much to charge at first," Ingrid said. "But, really, almost everyone is going out, and they would pay anything for a sitter on that night."
In the New York suburb of Ridgewood, N.J., 13-year-old Alex Ortiz, whose father will be at work on New Year's Eve and whose mother will be at home, plans to have two or three children ages 3 to 6 come to his home around 7 p.m.
"They'll eat dinner here," said Alex, who has honed his sitting skills watching two younger sisters. "And I'll entertain them. They'll spend the night, and their parents will pick them up around 10 or 11 in the morning."
Alex plans to ask $150 per child and has already signed one up.
In New York, Susan Tokayer, owner of Family Helpers in the Westchester County town of Dobbs Ferry, said she had not had many requests for sitters, but in defiance of the law of economics that says low demand means low prices, "I keep hearing of people who will be making hundreds and hundreds of dollars."
Rather than quote a price, Ms. Tokayer refers callers directly to sitters to negotiate one.
In Boston, Priscilla Garnache, owner of Boston's Best Baby Sitters-Nannies, said, "We're obviously very booked. We have placed about 20 for New Year's Eve. If I had 200, I'm sure I could place 200." Ms. Garnache is charging a family with three children $225 for five hours.
In the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, Buckingham Nannies usually charges $10 to place a sitter and then pays the sitter $10 to $12 an hour. But for New Year's Eve, the manager, Steven Lampert, said the agency is charging a $150 placement fee, $180 for a sitter, for a total of $330, and an additional $30 an hour after six hours.
"I want the nannies to make a worthwhile amount of money to give up the night," Mr. Lampert said.
Still, as Las Vegas has discovered, the sky is not the limit. Anticipating a high demand from high rollers at the casino hotels there, the Nannies and Grannies agency set a charge of $500 to watch one or two children in the hotels' bedrooms for four hours, or more than 10 times the usual $45 fee. But parents have been balking, and as in other big cities, hotel bookings have been fewer than expected.
"So we have readjusted that down to $350," H. D. Hale, the agency's general manager, said.
In all these cities, security guards are in high demand. Agencies say that calls for guards have soared, less in response to a need for crowd control and crime deterrence than to worries that buildings' computer-controlled locks, elevators and other systems will go berserk when the clock strikes midnight.
"Mostly, people are concerned about access control," said Michael Julian, New York City regional vice president for Spectaguard. Banks, for example, link their vaults and doors to clocks that could misread the debut of the millennium and open after midnight, and apartment buildings could lock out returning revelers.
"What we're talking about is locks more than anything else," Mr. Julian said.
Spectaguard will have 600 guards on the job on New Year's Eve in New York, 200 more than on a typical weekend night.
The guards, most of whom normally earn less than $10 an hour, can expect big rewards for giving up their night on the town.
"You have to give them some inducement to work," said Richard Hamilton, president of Watson Security Agency of DC, who said he had more than doubled his guards' pay, to $25 and $30 an hour.
Mark Calvery, manager of the Burns International office in Vienna, Va., said that for a lack of extra personnel, he had turned down a customer who offered $80 an hour. In Chicago, Mike Ragnanese, district manager for Pinkerton's there, declined to disclose how much he charges. But he said that some agencies would charge as much as $100 an hour for one guard.
At its offices nationwide, the Wackenhut Corporation is paying bonuses to off-duty guards who stay home. Then, if the guards are called in, they will receive holiday pay and an additional bonus.

HEADLINE: U.S. Banks Report Sharp Rise in Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
United States banks earned $19.4 billion in the third quarter, a 29.1 percent increase from a year ago, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today.
Banks have rebounded from a year ago, when Russia's default on its debt created market volatility that trimmed third-quarter 1998 earnings to $15 billion. More recently, banks earned $17 billion in the second quarter and a record $18 billion in the first quarter of this year. 
 "The domestic economy remains strong," said Ross Waldrop, senior financial analyst for the F.D.I.C. "Overseas markets remain stable."
Banks' profitability as measured by average return on assets rose to a record high 1.42 percent from 1.15 percent. The profitability yardstick measured 1.25 percent in this year's second quarter, and 1.32 percent in the first quarter.
Income from fees and other areas that do not include interest payments continued to rise to $36.9 billion in the third quarter, from $29.6 billion a year earlier, according to the agency.
Banks' trading profits of $2.9 billion in the quarter reversed results from 1998's rough third quarter, when the industry lost $4 billion.

HEADLINE: Port Authority And 2 States Discuss Lease For Terminal

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Top aides to the governors of New York and New Jersey met today with Port Authority officials in a step toward ending a long impasse over a new lease for a cargo terminal at Port Elizabeth.
At issue is a 30-year lease with Maersk Sea-Land to operate a terminal to handle up to 25 percent of the port's container cargo. The deal was negotiated by the staff of the Port Authority months ago but has not been acted on by the agency's board amid persistent disputes over its terms and economic impact. 
 New York representatives say the deal amounts to a subsidy that disproportionately benefits New Jersey. They boycotted last week's board meeting after New Jersey representatives insisted that the lease be voted on as part of a package of long-pending actions affecting operations on both sides of the Hudson River.
New Jersey insists that the lease deal, with the jobs throughout the area and increase in cargo it will generate, benefits the entire region and not just one state.
Lewis Eisenberg, the chairman of the port agency board and an appointee of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, confirmed that a meeting was held today as part of his and others' attempts to resolve the disagreement between the two states. Present were Brad Race, chief of staff to Gov. George E. Pataki of New York; Michael Torpey, chief of staff to Governor Whitman; Mr. Eisenberg; and Charles Gargano, Port Authority vice chairman and head of the board's New York delegation.
"We had a productive meeting and have determined that we will meet again early in the next year," said Mr. Eisenberg, who would not discuss any details.
Others officials, however, said that what was emerging as a possible solution to the impasse was the creation of pools of money or "development banks" drawn from agency revenues, from which each state could draw to finance pet projects that were not clearly regional priorities for the port agency.
According to Port Authority staff, such banks have been created twice in recent years. On both occasions the money was drawn from tolls or fare increases that, over time, were expected to take in more money than needed to pay for operations.
Officials said that there were currently no toll or fare increases envisioned, but that there was nothing to prevent the agency from setting up such banks using other regular revenues from port and airport operations.
Ronald H. Shiftan, deputy executive director of the port agency, said that New York representatives were advocating a bank that would finance only New York projects, while New Jersey representatives were pressing for funds available to both states.
Mr. Gargano contended that in recent years New Jersey had benefited from more subsidized development than had New York. He cited agency subsidies to the PATH system that had held the fare at one dollar, and improvements to Newark Airport that had outpaced improvements at La Guardia and Kennedy Airports.
"We need a more principled approach to these projects and we have to look at them and determine if they are subsidizing New Jersey then say, 'What about New York?' " said Mr. Gargano, who is also chairman of New York's Empire State Development Corporation.
Mr. Gargano said the lease arrangement with Maersk Sea-Land and the capital improvements it required amounted to a $55-million-a-year subsidy for the New Jersey-based operation over the 30-year lease.
Mr. Shiftan disputed those figures. He acknowledged that the first 10 years would mean net losses for the agency, but said the remainder of the term would be profitable, resulting in a $412.5 million gain over time.

HEADLINE: $20 Million in Pay Deferrals Prevents Union Layoffs in Nassau

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Dec. 22

 BODY:
After a tense bargaining session that lasted through the night, Nassau County's unions averted 500 threatened layoffs today by reluctantly agreeing to make $20 million worth of concessions to help the fiscally challenged county close its persistent budget gap.
The union presidents agreed to a plan in which county workers would be paid for only 50 weeks next year. The county would hold on to the extra two weeks' pay until the employee quits, retires or is fired. By doing so, county officials said, they expect to save $20 million next year. 
 In return, the unions got much more than simply avoiding the 500 layoffs that County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta had threatened to make if they refused to make the concessions. The unions extracted a pledge from the county that there would be no layoffs at all in 2000 and won agreements that would make it almost impossible for the county to lay off any workers until 2003.
The agreement brought an end to an anxious week in which county workers feared the loss of their jobs. After a night of negotiations, a tentative deal was reached at 6:30 a.m. but was not signed. One union, the Civil Service Employees Association, made a late attempt this morning to get a court order blocking any threatened layoffs. When that failed, the plan was presented to the unions' boards and signed.
The plan, which was signed by presidents of the unions representing Civil Service employees, police officers, police detectives, police sergeants, police superior officers and sheriffs, still needs the approval of rank and file members.
Mr. Gulotta, the embattled Republican county executive, said that these concessions brought the county significantly closer to closing the $60 million budget gap that was created last month when the Republican legislators repealed a real estate transfer tax that they themselves had passed.
"We have cut government spending by $41 million to date, and we are working on cutting the final $19 million," Mr. Gulotta told the Legislature this evening. So far he has cut human services contracts in half; cut roughly a third of the county's subsidy to Long Island Bus, a part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; cut $4 million in overtime; and halted a number of the county's capital improvement plans.
Anthony Giustino, the president of the local chapter of the Civil Service Employees Association, said it was hard to believe that the county has been forced to take such austere measures in healthy economic times.
"What's so incredible is that in a time of the greatest economic boom probably in American history -- certainly in my generation -- that we had to come to this point that we have to have threats of layoffs and furloughs," he said.
The deal was announced at what was expected to be the last session of the Republican-controlled Legislature. When the Legislature convenes in January, it will be led by Democrats, who were swept into power last month by an electorate unhappy with the county's fiscal condition and upset by tax increases.
It was the Republicans' decision to repeal one of those new taxes -- the transfer tax -- that unraveled the county budget and set off a frenzied search for further cuts in the few weeks before the 2000 budget takes effect.
Asked whether he regretted his Republican colleagues' repeal of the tax last month at a meeting he did not attend, Bruce A. Blakeman, the outgoing presiding officer, said, "I'm not going to comment on that -- that's ancient history."
Mr. Gulotta first proposed the union concession, known as a lag payroll, when he made an extremely rare appearance before the Legislature on Monday. This evening he returned to tell the legislators that the deal was accepted. The Legislature voted unanimously to ratify it.
Under the deal, the unions agreed that sometime after April 1 the county, which pays its employees every two weeks, will begin delaying its paychecks one day for 10 successive pay periods. Employees who are normally paid on Mondays would be paid two weeks later on a Tuesday, and then two weeks later on Wednesday, and so on for a total of 20 weeks.
The county would be giving workers 10 days of pay for every 11 days they work. At the end of the 20 weeks, the county would save $20 million, or two weeks' pay for each worker. The county would return the money when employees leave their jobs, and at their later pay levels.
On Monday Mr. Gulotta had proposed a similar plan in which workers would be given nine days' pay for every 10 days worked; this plan, essentially the same, was considered more acceptable because the total amount on each worker's paycheck will remain the same.
Workers were mixed in their reaction to the plan. "The county is basically borrowing money from its employees," said one union worker who asked not to be named. She said some people lived from paycheck to paycheck.
But Jane D'Amico, a union vice president, said, "Anything is better than layoffs."

HEADLINE: Gore, in Iowa, Duels an Absent Bradley

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore stumped through central Iowa today and sparred at long distance with former Senator Bill Bradley's campaign organization over farm problems and preschool education.
Before speaking here at a forum sponsored by the Iowa Farmers Union, Mr. Gore used half a dozen radio and television interviews to complain that Mr. Bradley had declined to debate him on farm issues here today or next month in Cedar Rapids. "Senator Bradley," he said, "has refused to have a specific debate on farm policy." 
 Mr. Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, replied from West Orange, N.J., that there were other forums where the two Democratic presidential candidates would appear together. "We'll be talking about agriculture a lot with Al Gore in Iowa," Mr. Hauser said, "and we look forward to it."
Mr. Bradley also said through his campaign staff that "for seven years the Clinton-Gore administration has presided over a farm crisis of historic proportions" and that "we've needed strong leadership for fundamental changes in our farm programs, and the administration has not provided it."
At the Farmers Union forum, the vice president renewed his criticism of Mr. Bradley's absence and promised that in a Gore administration, farm policy would be "explicitly directed at saving the viability of family farms." Among other things, he vowed that the Packers and Stockyards Act would be enforced to prevent price discrimination by packers against small farmers.
Much of his criticism was directed at the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress but signed into law by President Clinton. The vice president said it had an inadequate safety net to protect farmers when prices slumped.
Mr. Gore, the only presidential candidate who had not already stopped stumping for Christmas, began his campaign day at 6 a.m. at a Des Moines school, where he appeared at a "town meeting" sponsored, and briefly broadcast, by ABC's "Good Morning America." There he sketched a 10-year, $50 billion proposal for a "universal preschool initiative that will make high-quality preschool available to every 4-year-old in America and expand coverage to 3-year-olds."
"Most learning takes place in the first few years of life," he said, "and if kids get off to a great start before they ever get to kindergarten, the chances for them to succeed in life, to have good jobs, to lead fulfilling lives, is greatly enhanced."
Under the Gore proposal, federal matching grants to the states would allow 4-year-olds greater access to preschool. With some parents sure not to take advantage of the opportunity, he said, the leftover money could be used for programs for 3-year-olds.
The Bradley campaign promptly criticized the proposal as one that would deliver less than it promised. Pointing to a Gore campaign estimate that 75 percent of 4-year-olds would be enrolled if the initiative was adopted, the Bradley camp noted that 64 percent were already in preschool.
"Al Gore," the Bradley organization said, "would spend $50 billion to enroll an additional 11 percent of the nation's 4-year-olds in preschool."
The Bradley campaign also described the approach envisioned by Mr. Gore as a voucher program, since it would allow parents to use public money to place their children in private-school programs. Bradley aides suggested that the vice president was being hypocritical, because he has criticized Mr. Bradley for having supported an experimental school voucher program when he was a senator.
But Mr. Gore's campaign said that what he proposed was different from a voucher system, because it would give money not to individual families but to the states, which would run the program.
The sniping proceeded. A Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, issued a statement saying Mr. Bradley was launching "misleading attacks on Gore's bold plan."
"Since Bradley has failed to offer a comprehensive education plan and is running from his 18-year record of supporting private-school vouchers and tax credits," the statement said, "all his campaign can do is divert and attack."
In a more general campaign appearance at a breakfast meeting with Jewish supporters in Des Moines, Mr. Gore stressed his experience, saying that he knew how to "keep the economy going" and that he had once maintained a 100 percent pro-Israel voting record in the House, "compiled on the basis of inner instinct," despite having almost no Jewish constituents to lobby him.
He noted his 1991 vote in the Senate favoring authorization for President George Bush to make war on Iraq, a position Senator Bradley opposed. But for Congress's voting to support the war, he said, Saddam Hussein "would still be in Kuwait."
His spokesman, Mr. Lehane, said that after Mr. Gore returned to Washington tonight, he would not campaign again until the new year, although he might issue some statements next week.

HEADLINE: A Cadre of Familiar Foreign Policy Experts Is Putting Its Imprint on Bush

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is counting on a small group of conservative experts steeped in the intricacies of arms control, military budgets and geopolitical security to counsel him on a subject that has caused him the most trouble in his presidential campaign: foreign affairs.
The task of helping Mr. Bush translate his core principles for the United States' role in the world into concrete policies lies largely in the hands of eight hawkish advisers with broad experience under President Ronald Reagan or Mr. Bush's father, President George Bush. 
 Like Mr. Reagan when he ran for President, Governor Bush has no broad foreign policy experience. But unlike Mr. Reagan, who had a long history of preaching against communism, Mr. Bush had no similar guiding philosophy. As a result, his foreign policy stumbles, like flubbing a pop quiz on world leaders, have only amplified the role his advisers play.
After months of briefings and informal discussions, the advisers' influence over Mr. Bush has become more evident with every speech, news conference and debate. Indeed, perhaps even more than the other candidates in the field, it is not unusual to hear the advisers' words coming out of Mr. Bush's mouth.
This kitchen cabinet is a tight-knit, strong-willed group led by Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist in President Bush's National Security Council, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, a senior Pentagon official in the Bush administration and former ambassador to Indonesia.
Mr. Bush also consults with two unofficial senior advisers, Richard B. Cheney, President Bush's secretary of defense, and George P. Shultz, Mr. Reagan's secretary of state. Conspicuously absent is the elder Mr. Bush, who has not sought a foreign policy role, largely to give his son a degree of independence, aides said.
Most of the advisers have known each other for more than a decade, forging close ties as cold warriors combating the Soviet Union, as mediators helping to reunify Germany, or as Pentagon strategists leading the allied victory over Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
Advisers bristle at the notion that they are tutoring a novice, arguing that Mr. Bush surprised them by articulating a set of broad foreign policy principles and priorities -- from missile defenses to free trade to what he calls The Big Ones, Russia, China and India -- that need refining, not revamping.
"What this drill has involved is fleshing out the sense he has about things, rather than introducing things he didn't know anything about," said Dov S. Zakheim, a former deputy under secretary of defense for Mr. Reagan.
But Mr. Bush's words have a familiar ring, at times echoing his advisers' public pronouncements as well as their private counsel given in hours of free-wheeling, rapid-fire discussions in conference calls and in meetings at the governor's mansion here over the last year. Advisers say he has yet to overrule them on any major issue.
In August, for example, Ms. Rice, the governor's top foreign policy adviser, described to The National Journal how a future Bush administration would curtail the Clinton administration's penchant for dispatching troops on far-flung humanitarian or peacekeeping missions.
"We would be more selective in our military involvements," she said. "One downside of having this extraordinary power, relative to the rest of the world, is that you can easily become overextended. That risks erosion of domestic support for America's global role and international resentment of what many see as an arrogant and reckless power."
Six weeks later, in Mr. Bush's defense policy speech on Sept. 23, he issued a similar warning: "We must be selective in the use of our military, precisely because America has other great responsibilities that cannot be slighted or compromised."
Several advisers, including Richard Perle, an assistant secretary of defense under Mr. Reagan, have advocated that the United States withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Treaty if Russia refuses to negotiate changes to allow both countries to field national systems to protect against limited long-range missile attacks. The governor heartily embraced that position.
Mr. Bush rarely has to choose between stark divisions in his advisers. Last spring, his aides split over whether the United States should support NATO military action to protect Kosovar Albanians. Mr. Zakheim publicly opposed it. Mr. Wolfowitz supported it. Mr. Bush reluctantly backed Mr. Clinton's decision to intervene, persuaded that broader European interests were at stake.
His aides insist that they are often reinforcing and fine-tuning Mr. Bush's gut instincts, making it difficult to single out any one adviser's influence.
"It's like making sausage," Ms. Rice said in an interview at Bush campaign headquarters here. "We get in there, slog through together, and ideas emerge."
The foreign policy team sprang from a meeting in August 1998 that President Bush set up at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., between his son and Ms. Rice.
Within a few months, Ms. Rice, who stepped down in June as provost of Stanford University, agreed to head the governor's foreign policy team. Together with Mr. Wolfowitz, she chose a seasoned cadre of experts who, like Mr. Bush, champion internationalism, voice a tougher security approach to dealing with China and Russia, and promise an overhaul of Pentagon spending and strategy.
But surprisingly for a candidate who preaches the virtues of the global marketplace, the Bush team has only one expert in international economics -- Robert B. Zoellick, an undersecretary of state in the Bush administration -- and no specialists in Africa or Latin America. The campaign has a separate team of economic aides, with whom Ms. Rice and Mr. Zoellick coordinate.
"If there's a weakness in the team, it's that it's heavy on security issues," acknowledged Ms. Rice, who said she was seeking to diversify the group.
In their dealings with Mr. Bush, the advisers rely on a familiar working model.
"This operation runs a little bit like we'd run the N.S.C., with the daily briefing he gets, making sure there's press guidance, and worrying about speeches where your policy gets honed," said Ms. Rice, who studied international relations at the University of Denver under Josef Korbel, the father of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
"But in some ways, the most important thing in a campaign is to try to keep focused on the fact that there are a lot of audiences reading what you're saying, including foreign audiences, foreign governments," Ms. Rice said.
To keep that message sharp, the team has a routine. At nine o'clock every Monday morning, the advisers hook up by phone to swap diplomatic gossip, dissect world events and polish Mr. Bush's approach to international affairs.
Each Sunday evening, Ms. Rice, Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush and a few other top aides here hold a conference call to review global hot spots and talk about issues that have caught the governor's eye.
"It's a little bit more relaxed opportunity to discuss foreign policy, and a chance for him to talk directly to us," said Ms. Rice, who shuttles between here and Stanford, where she is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Ms. Rice periodically reaches outside the foreign policy brain trust for insights. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has met with Mr. Bush and critiqued his defense policy speech.
Senator Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who is Mr. Bush's point man in the Senate, briefed the governor's top aides on Senate Republicans' strategy to oppose a global treaty banning underground nuclear testing. The Senate rejected the pact in October.
 The musings of Mr. Bush's advisers are also important because they give a glimpse into who will undoubtedly fill the top ranks of the Pentagon, State Department and National Security Council, if he is elected.
When tensions in Asia ran high last summer over the rejection by Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, of the longstanding "one China" formula, Richard L. Armitage, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan administration, caused a stir in Australia when he told The Australian Financial Review that Australia "must stand ready to give military support to the U.S. if Washington goes to war with China" over Taiwan.
Mr. Armitage emphasized that Washington did not want to go to war with China, and that there was a low risk of conflict. But if a misjudgment triggered fighting, he said, the United States would expect Australia to help with "the dirty, hard and dangerous work."
In the Persian Gulf, Mr. Wolfowitz has not ruled out using American troops to support Iraqi insurgents in toppling Saddam Hussein.
"It will take American forces to create a protected area in which opposition forces can organize and to which units from Saddam's army can defect," Mr. Wolfowitz wrote in The New Republic in December 1998. "This policy is risky. But it is less risky than the present course, which is leading us to the day that we are obliged to face Saddam ourselves, when he is armed with weapons of unparalleled destructiveness."
Unlike his father or President Clinton, Mr. Bush is not likely to immerse himself in the arcana of policy, leaving more running room for his advisers.
"He's not a policy wonk and he never will be," Mr. Perle said. "But he's going to convey a sense of who he is and how he'd exercise authority."
 
New Tack In Ad Campaign
 AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 22 (AP) Facing a tightening race in New Hampshire, Gov. George W. Bush will try to convey a sense of immediacy by having some television commercials broadcast on the same day that they are produced, his campaign says.
Mark McKinnon, creator of the advertising campaign, said it was intended to show how aggressively Mr. Bush was campaigning in the state.
Mr. McKinnon said he knew of no campaign that had sought to get same-day advertisements on the air.
The first "crash ad," filmed on Monday at a Manchester, N.H., high school, showed Mr. Bush talking about leadership and his tax-cut plan.
The goal was to get the 30-second spot on the air around Monday evening newscasts, but it did not run until Tuesday, Mr. McKinnon said.

HEADLINE: ALBUM OF THE WEEK: RODNEY WHITAKER QUINTET;
"Ballads and Blues: The Brooklyn Session" (Criss Cross).

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
The first two albums by Rodney Whitaker, the bassist for the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, were valentines to his hometown, Detroit; he surrounded himself with players he had known before moving to New York, mixing them in with his new colleagues. The albums were ambitious and a little unwieldy and often lost focus and balance with so many different kinds of players.
But his third, "Ballads and Blues," has a streamlined, economized sound, the benefit of players who know one another. It includes some of the best young musicians in jazz: the saxophonist Ron Blake, the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the pianist Eric Reed and the drummer Carl Allen. Although Mr. Whitaker has included a number of songs by bassists -- three by Paul Chambers, one by George Duvivier -- it's not a thematic record. The album has the ring of the late 50's and early 60's, when great jazz musicians were under contract to produce several albums a year, and a huge number of high-quality records that weren't particularly high-concept were recorded, thus creating the mainstream. 
 The jazz mainstream has two aspects: there's the flat and the dull, and then there's a form of comfort within traditional language that allows musicians to let themselves go, which is what happens here. Mr. Allen fills his sound with cymbal-heavy swing; Mr. Blake plays long, connected, rapid lines that accrue an intellectual weight as they go along; Mr. Harris steps out of rhythm to play dots of sound in strange intervals; and Mr. Reed, an alert player, gets into tumbling waves of rolled chords.
The trombonist Wycliffe Gordon shows up on a few tracks, too, chattering his solos and using a mute to sound like a singer. The current anxiety emanating from jazz records -- the need to make a new sound stick, the dips into stylized retro, the nervous desire to connect with pop -- is, to our pleasure, nowhere to be found here.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 14. 

Now Playing
 
* "ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER," starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of this filmmaker's earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around "A Streetcar Named Desire" and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as "screwball drama." Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
 
* "ANY GIVEN SUNDAY," starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160 minutes). Mr. Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Mr. Stone's "Wall Street," the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old ways versus the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Mr. Pacino) embodying tradition and a young hot-shot quarterback Willie Beamen (Mr. Foxx) the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are shamelessly "Rocky"-ish, the movie delivers a credible, action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen Holden).
 
* "AMERICAN BEAUTY," starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Maslin).
 
* "AMERICAN MOVIE," featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Mr. Smith so affectingly reveals, Mr. Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle and finds Mr. Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile, his own life is eloquently presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Maslin).
 
"ANNA AND THE KING," starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 140 minutes). The same story that inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "The King and I" is the basis for this movie about the British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens (Ms. Foster) who travels to Bangkok in 1862 to educate the 58 children of King Mongkut (Mr. Chow). Although the story has been given a contemporary multicultural perspective that's critical of British imperialism, the picturesque film tells essentially the same story but without the beloved songs, which are badly missed. Ms. Foster's Anna is another of her nobler-than-thou ice queens, and Mr. Chow's king is authoritative but less than thunderous (Holden).
 
* "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH," starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder workout than they got from "The Truman Show." Mr. Cusack plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Mr. Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
 
"BICENTENNIAL MAN," starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132 minutes). This year's gushy Christmas card from Robin Williams follows the 200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to become human. Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who steered this star through "Mrs. Doubtfire," the movie is a joke-strewn sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us feel good about being human and is punctuated by corny speeches exalting freedom, the joys of sex and the mystery of mortality. Except for Mr. Williams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber (Holden).
 
* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
 
* "THE CIDER HOUSE RULES," starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 40's "David Copperfield" (Holden).
 
"CRADLE WILL ROCK," starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa Redgrave. Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes). This huge Depression-era story features well-known figures from Orson Welles to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works them into an ambitious "Ragtime"-like tableau. Though too many figures in this landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Mr. Robbins and his impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this (mostly) true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught production of the banner-waving 1936 agitprop musical "The Cradle Will Rock" by Welles and John Houseman. Mr. Robbins and his cast play out all sides of this event with the certitude that its importance lives on (Maslin).
 
* "DOGMA," starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino and Chris Rock.and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout comedy is any less outrageous than that. Mr. Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Mr. Rock's and semirepartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin).
 
* "THE END OF THE AFFAIR," starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes). Mr. Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker, this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret twist. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London in the mid-1940's) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume designer Sandy Powell ("Shakespeare in Love") (Maslin).
 
"END OF DAYS," starring Arnold Schwarenegger, Robin Tunney, Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118 minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years. And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty would-be thriller. The material is so derivative that it amounts to a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic films, with special credit owed to "The Exorcist" for grisly sacrilegious tricks. Mr. Hyams favors a jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock value. The star dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic forces. But Mr. Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and has the better role (Maslin).
 
* "FELICIA'S JOURNEY," starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes). In the brilliantly realized surreal thriller, adapted from William Trevor's popular novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant Irish girl searching for her boyfriend in the English midlands, is befriended by Joseph Hilditch (Mr. Hoskins), a catering manager who also happens to be a serial killer. Mr. Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, elevates this cat-and-mouse game into a film that transcends genre by entering the characters' consciousness and implying a world of half-discernible connections in which the weather, the landscape and the chance encounters of strangers suggest the sense of a grand design (Holden).
 
"FLAWLESS," starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes). Mr. De Niro is a retired New York City policeman recovering from a stroke and Mr. Hoffman the drag queen upstairs who gives him speech therapy in the form of singing lessons in this stridently campy comedy. Their flashy performances can't add dimension to a movie that is a message-laden duet for two caricatures, a homophobe and the angry, self-loathing drag queen who gets him out of his depression (Holden).
 
"GIRL, INTERRUPTED," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen, a pre-college-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend (Holden).
 
"THE GREEN MILE," starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of "The Shawshank Redemption" could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cell block. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
 
* "THE INSIDER," starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mr. Mann directs this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the 90's, truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa "All the President's Men." While Mr. Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for "60 Minutes," and Mr. Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Mr. Crowe movingly captures the complexity of Mr. Wigand's situation. Shaky docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on "60 Minutes." But this is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mr. Mann's stylistic brio at its best (Maslin).
 
* "LIBERTY HEIGHTS," starring Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134 minutes). This semiautobiographical comedy-drama remembering teenage life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950's Baltimore is the fourth movie by Mr. Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the look and social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and performances are too muted for the movie to come to terms with growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden).
 
* "THE LIMEY," starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Mr. Stamp, in a stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Mr. Fonda's slick Hollywood hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Mr. Soderbergh resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's "Point Blank" as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
 
"MAGNOLIA," starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180 minutes). In "Magnolia" the colossally talented Mr. Anderson has set up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories, with many of the cast members from his "Boogie Nights" assembled to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting, obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
 
"MAN ON THE MOON," starring Jim Carrey, Courtney Love, Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Milos Forman (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Carrey delivers an electrifying homage in Mr. Forman's vivid re-creation ofAndy Kaufman's too-short and enduringly strange career. In a film that summons its subject's most memorable creative inventions as a series of greatest hits, Mr. Carrey makes a flawless, uncanny impersonator. But what is missing here, though it might have been the first thing expected from an ostensible film biography, is an answer to the simplest question: Who was Andy Kaufman, and how did he get that way? (Maslin).
 
* "MANSFIELD PARK," starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105 minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor) has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century slave trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened with smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden).
 
"MUSIC OF THE HEART," starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110 minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt, no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other violin stars. Not a bad reason for Mr. Craven to have sidelined the claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
 
"ONEGIN," starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler and Martin Donovan. Directed by Martha Fiennes (not rated, 106 minutes). As the directorial debut of Mr. Fiennes's sister Martha, "Onegin" diminishes Alexander Pushkin's epic 19th-century novel "Evgeny Onegin" into a cramped little soap opera whose two stars are painfully mismatched. While Mr. Fiennes acts up a fine storm as the arrogant, cynical title character who doesn't believe in love, Ms. Tyler, who plays his romantic nemesis, is an inert cipher. Somehow, even the grand ballrooms of 1820's St. Petersburg look drab and chintzy (Holden).
 
"POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE," with the voices of Veronica Taylor, Philip Bartlett, Rachael Lillis, Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein and Ikue Otani. Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama (G, 90 minutes). Parents don't have to know all 151 monsters to understand "Pokemon: The First Movie," but they can observe several in action, including Pikachu, cutest of them all. The magic doesn't bridge the generation gap; whatever makes "Pokemon" such a huge pop-culture phenomenon is still a secret of the grammar school set, but the film is energetic and the animation is fun to watch. The plot is about a bioengineered Pokemon who lures young Pokemon trainers (including 12-year-old Ash of the television series) into a showdown. Characters spout pacifist profundities while pairs of monsters punch each other silly (Anita Gates).
 
"ROSETTA," starring Emilie Dequenne. Directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (R, 90 minutes). This grim quasi-documentary, filmed with hand-held cameras (it's almost as jiggly as "The Blair Witch Project"), picked up the Palme d'Or (the top prize) at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Ms. Dequenne was also chosen best actress for her portrayal of a miserable 17-year-old Belgian girl living in a trailer camp with her alcoholic mother. Her desperate quest for a job and what she calls a "normal life" leads her to betray her only friend, who works at a waffle stand, by stealing his job. Unlike the Dardenne brothers' last film, "La Promesse," the movie's social realist angst feels contrived, and its main character never fully comes to life (Holden).
 
"SLEEPY HOLLOW," starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with Mr. Burton's macabre vision. Mr. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's shy detective, but the story (by the writer of "Seven" and "Fight Club") is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic beheadings. It's possible to admire Mr. Burton immensely for the secret tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
 
"SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS," starring Ethan Hawke, James Cromwell and Max Von Sydow. Directed by Scott Hicks (PG-13, 130 minutes). This director's follow-up to "Shine" is the cinematic equivalent of an arty coffee-table book. It is so busy illustrating the story (with elaborate flashbacks and montage sequences) that it forgets to be dramatic. Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1950, the movie looks back to World War II and the charged relationships between Japanese-Americans and whites on an island north of the Puget Sound. Mr. Hawke is the brooding reporter covering the trial and Mr. Von Sydow the defense lawyer who is the film's official conscience. Robert Richardson is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography (Holden).
 
* "THE STRAIGHT STORY," starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Mr. Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall. And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been possible without Mr. Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its heart. Mr. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result: a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
 
* "STUART LITTLE," starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E. B. White's 1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film about a little mouse (the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is adopted by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian house cat, Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy boat race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Mr. Lane's sly, wise-guy vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny and sweet but never cloying (Holden).
 
"SWEET AND LOWDOWN," starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to the kind of jaunty 1930's jazz that has been heard on many of his other films' soundtracks, Mr. Allen imagines a consummate jazz character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Mr. Penn), who can play the guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into another one of Mr. Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
 
* "TOPSY-TURVY," starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Mr. Leigh's grandly entertaining "Topsy-Turvy" is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as "Shakespeare in Love" did last year. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
 
"THREE KINGS," starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). The prodigiously talented writer-director of "Spanking the Monkey" and "Flirting With Disaster" has made a much more ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf war film has a "Catch-22" absurdist edge, but it also has an oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are many clever peripheral touches, but there's something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).
 
* "TOY STORY 2," with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98 minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable "Star Wars" parody) to its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy dealer, experiences new-found celebrity and needs to be rescued by his fabulous old friends (Maslin).
 
* "TUMBLEWEEDS," starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown). Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of romantic disasters (Holden).
 
* "THE WAR ZONE," starring Freddie Cunliffe, Ray Winstone, Tilda Swinton and Lara Belmont. Directed by Tim Roth (not rated, 99 minutes). Mr. Roth is an actor known for roles in tough films, but never for anything quite as raw as this. In this searing first feature, the title battlefield is a rural English home where a teenage boy looks upon his own family with helpless rage and astonishment. Sensing the incestuous relationship between his father and older sister, the film's wordless, baleful young hero struggles to come to terms with this household horror. Understated but extremely graphic at times, and shot with mournfully expressive simplicity by Seamus McGarvey (Maslin).
 
"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH," starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards. Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is much admired for his "Up" series chronicling the lives of former schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James Bond grow up a little, too. Mr. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Mr. Apted handles the action as well as he does the talk (Maslin).

A Canvas of Concerns: Race, Racism and Class

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER; "Adrian Piper: A Retrospective" remains at the Fine Arts Gallery, University of Maryland in Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, through Jan. 15. It will travel to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan (Oct. 4 to Jan. 13, 2002) and then to the Weatherspoon Art Gallery in Greensboro, N.C.

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
For art, the 1990's started in a mood of agitation. The market went down the drain. AIDS was rampant. The 1993 Whitney Biennial, the most important American contemporary showcase of the decade, was a full-voiced chorus of long-excluded voices, black, Latino, gay and feminist among them.
What a difference a few years make. The 90's are ending on a complacent, upbeat note. Economics are back on track. AIDS has become the scourge of the silent poor at home and abroad. The art world has joined the rest of the world in dismissing politically concerned art as "politically correct." 
 All of this provides an interesting context for the traveling midcareer retrospective of work by the American artist Adrian Piper, making its inaugural appearance at the Fine Arts Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, a half-hour drive from the center of Baltimore.
Her work is about consciousness-raising. Her primary subjects are race, racism and their links to class and gender. Her forms are spare, unsensual, but for the most part attention-holding. Her method is interrogatory: she asks unsettling questions to evoke revealing responses. Sugar-coating isn't her style.
The retrospective, organized by the art historian Maurice Berger and accompanied by a solid catalog, covers roughly 30 years. A few crucial pieces are missing, notably the photo-and-text-based drawings of the 1970's known as the "Mythic Being" series. (They will join the show at a later venue.) But the show is still as complete a view of this influential artist's career as we have had.
It begins with paintings from 1966, when Ms. Piper was barely out of high school. One, titled "LSD Self-Portrait From the Inside Out," is period-piece psychedelia: an image of a black woman surrounded by an aura of high-color, splitting-apart geometric shards. The other, "Multichrome Mom and Dad," is a snapshotlike portrait of her parents, done in shades of gray except for the faces, which are biscuit-brown.
Although little more than juvenilia, the pictures point up essential aspects of Ms. Piper's work as a whole. The human figure and abstract forms play interactive roles. Autobiographical data recurs but is kept impersonal, always about something else, ideas as well as emotions. For example, the artist uses the fact that both her parents were of mixed-race heritage as a strategic point from which to attack essentialist concepts of race itself.
In the late 1960's Ms. Piper aligned herself with the nascent Conceptual art movement, attracted to its intellectual rigor and speculative logic. At the same time, her political convictions were growing acute and specific. She brought these strands together (she was among the first artists to do so) in performance pieces executed in private and in public.
"Food for the Spirit" (1970) was among her early private solo pieces, done when she was finishing a degree in philosophy at City College in New York. She approached an intensive study of Emmanuel Kant as a kind of yogic discipline, fasting as she worked. She recorded her appearance during this hermetic period in a series of remarkable photographs in which her body seems to be gradually dematerializing.
Her public performances, by contrast, were often assertive and disruptive. For the "Mythic Being" series, she disguised herself as a black or Latino teenager in an Afro wig and acted out stereotypes of antisocial behavior, cruising women in the street, even staging a fake mugging. A single piece in the show catches the spirit: it is a head shot of the bewigged artist with a thought balloon that reads, "I embody everything you most hate and fear."
Ms. Piper repeatedly appears in her own work, assuming different personae (she's a skilled and witty performer) and changing her looks as if she were herself a kind of malleable conceptual object.
Sometimes she is just a voice, as in the installation titled "Art for Art World Surface Pattern" (1976). The piece consists of a walk-in white cubicle resembling an abstract sculpture. The interior is papered with photos of calamitous third world events for which Ms. Piper supplies an exasperated-sounding taped commentary that begins: "Oh, I get it. O.K. Got it. This is social conscience art. Right. O.K. You know, I mean, I don't need this when I come to an art show."
Most of her role-playing, however, is visual. In a 1981 pencil drawing titled "Self-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features" she gives a cosmetic makeover the grim and haunted look of a mug shot. Elsewhere she plays with the educational aspects of her career as both didactic artist and professional academic. (She teaches philosophy at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.)
In a terrific, funny video titled "Funk Lessons" (1983), she earnestly uses diagrams and personal demonstrations to instruct students in the how-to's of popular music and dance, generating lively class participation in the process. In "Cornered" (1988), she is filmed sitting behind a desk and explaining with unflappable, schoolmarmish composure that most Americans are, like her, genetically black, even if their physical appearance seems to say otherwise.
This information also forms the basis for performance pieces she executed in social situations in the late 1980's. Their occurrence was spontaneous, their format simple: when she overheard casually dropped ethnic slurs at parties or dinners, she offered the offending speaker a business card printed with the words: "Dear Friend. I am black. I am sure you did not realize this when you made/laughed at/agreed with that racist remark."
Ms. Piper has placed a supply of these cards in the Baltimore show under the words: "Join the struggle. Take some for your own use." The implication is that any viewers, whatever their preferred racial self-identity, are eligible to pass them out. And that assumption gets to the radical core of what Ms. Piper's work is about.
On the most obvious level, her mission is to reveal racist attitudes and behavior, overt or hidden, and call them by their right name. But she also provocatively suggests that such attitudes and behavior actually create race as a perceptual category and that that category, however illusory, reinforces hierarchies of socioeconomic power and exclusion.
The idea of race as a construct, one producing tightly scripted and limiting roles, is being closely examined these days, with important implications for art.
Although increasing numbers of young artists of African-American descent are forging careers, their number is still small and most are faced with "ethnic" expectations in terms of subject matter (colonialism, spirituality) and materials (elephant dung, for example), as were artists before them, including a whole generation of abstract painters.
But the issue of ethnicity and post-ethnicity, intrinsic to the multiculturalist thinking of the 1990's, is far from being resolved and may stay that way. Racism, meanwhile, remains a fact. The black middle class is growing, but so is the black prison population. American consumerism is more and more an equal opportunity affair, but the hard-won benefits and protections gained by blacks during the civil rights era are now being legally dismantled.
And so Ms. Piper's role as agent provocateur is as valid as ever. Her persistence in exposing the mechanics of prejudice, her insistence on the double-edged dangers inherent in the perception of difference, and her passionately instrumental view of art as a mind-altering and expanding substance make her just as much an artist of the moment today -- a stimulating and prophetic one -- as she has been for the last 30 years.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Stealing a New Life, Carnal, Glamorous And Worth the Price

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
A FLOOD of adjectives bursts onto the screen at the start of Anthony Minghella's glittering new thriller, considering ways to describe Tom Ripley before settling on "talented" as le mot juste. This is only a minuscule show of ingenuity, but it's also a promise that the film will keep. "The Talented Mr. Ripley" offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.
Its opening credit sequence alone is a model of exquisitely economical suggestion, showing how the loan of a jacket with a Princeton insignia leads Tom from the life of a New York City men's room attendant to a thrillingly new world of opportunity. In a rush of gorgeous, agile exposition, Tom winds up in Europe, learning to say "This is my face" in Italian as he trains his binoculars on Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie is the spectacularly charismatic dilettante whose life Tom will eventually steal. 
 "I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors," remarks the chauffeur who drives Tom away from a bleak Manhattan neighborhood and hands him his first-class ticket for an ocean passage. In light of the mind games that the movie has in store, both the remark and the carnal high-low contrast (meat hangs on hooks near the limousine) are as splendidly barbed as they can be.
As a playwright and television writer who came to filmmaking with two comparatively modest, whimsical efforts ("Truly, Madly, Deeply" and "Mr. Wonderful") before the exponential leap of "The English Patient," Mr. Minghella now establishes that his Oscar-winning triumph was no fluke. His hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story has the same kind of complex allure that made "The English Patient" so mesmerizing.
This is a more conventional opportunity, being essentially the story of a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps. But Mr. Minghella, who wrote and directed "The Talented Mr. Ripley" with acute attention to every nuance, significantly broadens what Ms. Highsmith had in mind. Adding a couple of important new characters and bringing the secrets of Tom's sexual longings to the surface, he risks losing the profound chill that made Ripley so disturbing in the first place. The character is several shades less loathsome and more conscience-stricken than he was to begin with, and his homosexuality is more openly expressed. But as played by Matt Damon with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness, the nicer new Ripley is in no danger of losing his sting.
In a scenic, voluptuously beautiful film (kudos to the cinematographer, John Seale) that has a traffic-stopping cast, Mr. Minghella carefully plants the seeds of mayhem. When Tom is hired by Dickie's father (James Rebhorn) to bring the ne'er-do-well Greenleaf scion home from Italy, he contrives to bump into Dickie on the beach and to echo Dickie's infatuation with American jazz. The year is 1958, and it seems an impossibly glamorous time as depicted among pampered American expatriates in some of Italy's most breathtaking settings.
Tom's tricks, from wearing an embarrassingly skimpy chartreuse bathing suit to casually flashing some of Dickie's favorite record albums, neatly accomplish their purpose. Soon he has made himself Dickie's latest diversion, and managed this without even alienating Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's girlfriend. Marge was a thick, lumpen target for Tom's misogyny in Ms. Highsmith's version. Here, though still hopelessly oblivious to sexual currents between the men, she becomes a reminder that Ms. Paltrow makes as savvy a character actress as she does a swanlike leading lady.
A word about the film's Dickie Greenleaf: this is a star-making role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law. Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Mr. Law gives Dickie the manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently courted by every man or woman he knows. During the first half of the film, Dickie is pure eros and adrenaline, a combination not many actors could handle with this much aplomb.
During one especially sharp-edged scene here, as the tensions surrounding Dickie approach the unbearable, the handsome heir indulges in what he dismissively calls "Marge maintenance" on his sailboat. Leaving Tom and another rich crony, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman, scene-stealingly wonderful here), to wait uneasily during this sexual interlude, Dickie avidly plays off each passenger on the boat against the others. Something has to give.
When it does, in the deadly encounter that sends Tom Ripley into his new life, the film changes greatly in tone. Once its touristy idyll is over, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" becomes an elaborate round of gamesmanship about Tom's sleight of hand and how it can be sustained. The ruse, which Mr. Damon handles coyly and credibly, if not with the nascent Norman Bates streak that the situation warrants, is given an added complication by the presence of Meredith Logue. Meredith is a needy post-debutante played irresistibly by Cate Blanchett. Once Meredith latches onto Tom, who she thinks is Dickie, whom she regards as a bored and wealthy kindred spirit, the story has developed all the dizzying cross-currents it deserves.
The last part of the film, which opens tomorrow, runs into problems. Eventually tangled up, like Tom, in the particulars of a trail of crime, it tries to use yet another of Tom's attractions (to another new character, played by Peter Smith-Kingsley) to settle his fate. And despite the occasional flash of Hitchcockian magic -- like a scene involving a razor blade in the pocket of a white bathrobe -- there are late scenes that flounder or lag. These concluding events are far less meaningful than the ones that sent Tom on his odyssey of self-invention in the first place. As with any great impostor, there's more to say about where he came from than where he has to go.
 "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief and implied sexual situations, strong sexual undercurrents, profanity and murder.

HEADLINE: Further Rise In Spending By Consumers Lifts Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Consumers accelerated their spending in November, pushing the economy closer to a record expansion, government figures showed today.
Spending rose 0.5 percent last month, fueled by increased buying of cars and other manufactured goods, after a rise of 0.7 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. November spending was 7.6 percent above that of November 1998, the biggest year-over-year gain in more than a decade. 
 Personal incomes also rose last month, giving Americans the buying power to keep the expansion on track to set a record for length in February. "Everyone's working who wants to work, and those people who own the right stocks are getting richer by the day and so they continue to spend," said Paul Kasriel, chief United States economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Wages, salaries, rent collections, interest and dividends grew 0.4 percent in November after surging 1.3 percent in October when farm subsidy payments and union bonuses increased the figure, the Commerce Department said.
Americans' incomes have increased about 6 percent in each of the last three years. And gains in stock market wealth are "going to spill over into next year," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland.
Another Commerce Department report showed that factory orders for big-ticket durable goods increased 1.2 percent last month after two months of declines. Outside of transportation equipment, orders rose 2.2 percent. Both increases were the biggest since July.
"Manufacturing is back on track with more solid numbers," Mr. Mayland said. "Orders will be strong for several months" because of rising demand as well as a need to rebuild inventories, he said.
Unemployment hovering at a 29-year low has increased incomes along with confidence, and a report today from the Labor Department on weekly jobless claims gave no evidence of a change. While claims rose by 14,000 last week, to 281,000, the number is still low enough to suggest that jobs are abundant. Economists tend to view the weekly numbers cautiously this time of year because of difficulties in seasonal adjustment.
The November increase in spending reflected gains of 1.3 percent for durable goods like cars and appliances, the largest gain in three months. Spending on nondurable goods like food and clothes rose 0.4 percent, and spending on services increased 0.3 percent.
Wages increased 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.6 percent in October. Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, rose 0.4 percent in November after gaining 1.4 percent during October. The savings rate fell to 2.2 percent in November from 2.3 percent during October.
The increase in factory orders also reflected a rebound in demand for electronic equipment, which includes household appliances, semiconductors and communications devices. Orders for those goods rose 8.7 percent, after a revised 7.4 percent drop in October. The October decline was initially reported as 15.3 percent and was mostly attributed to the effects of an earthquake in Taiwan.
Income and job growth are proving to be a powerful combination for this year's holiday shopping season.
"Given the brisk pace of retail spending, past shopping patterns and an extra shopping day this season, retailers should have a very merry Christmas year," said William Ford, senior economic adviser for the TeleCheck unit of the First Data Corporation.
In the first 24 shopping days of the season, from Nov. 26 to Dec. 19, same-store sales rose 5.8 percent, compared with results in the period a year earlier, according to TeleCheck, which analyzed checks written by consumers at 27,000 of its 210,000 sites. Checks account for about a third of all retail spending, the company says.

HEADLINE: Nov. 16 Fed Notes Show Year 2000 Concern

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was unanimous in its decision to raise interest rates at its November meeting and expressed a desire to act well before any Year 2000 computer problems, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, voted 10 to 0 to raise the federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge one another on overnight loans -- by a quarter of a point, to 5.5 percent, according to the minutes of the meeting on Nov. 16. 
 That was the third time this year that the central bank raised rates to slow the economy and keep inflation at bay.
With the economy growing rapidly, all members "agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy," the minutes stated.
The members also said that concerns about the changeover to the year 2000 were a factor in deciding to raise rates in November instead of waiting for the Dec. 21 meeting, their last meeting before the turn of the century.
The decision to raise rates "was reinforced by the prospect that the committee might not find it desirable to adjust policy at its December meeting when a tightening action could add to the potential financial uncertainties and unsettlement surrounding the century date change," the members said.
"Accordingly, any action might have to wait until the meeting in early February, and the members agreed that the risks of waiting for such an extended period were unacceptably high," they added.
At its meeting on Tuesday, the Fed left rates unchanged, citing uncertainties about Year 2000 problems. But the Fed warned that inflation dangers could be lurking in the months ahead. The minutes of that meeting will not be released until February.
Separately, a survey released today by the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that 9 out of 10 customers think their banks will be ready for the year 2000, and a majority said they considered it unlikely that their automated teller machines would fail.
Many economists think the central bank will raise rates again in February or March if strong economic growth continues.
At the November meeting, members also unanimously agreed to move their stance on future action to neutral from one favoring an increase in rates. They maintained that stance on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Democrats Criticize Bush As Out of Touch on Poverty

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush's skeptical response to a federal report detailing hunger in Texas has brought criticism from Democrats who say Mr. Bush is out of touch with poverty in his state.
The Department of Agriculture, in a study titled "Measuring Food Security in the United States," found that 5 percent of Texas households had reported suffering from hunger from 1996 through 1998. Only Oregon had reported a higher percentage, the study said. 
 "I saw the report that children in Texas are going hungry. Where?" Mr. Bush said earlier this week in an interview with The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. "You'd think the governor would have heard if there are pockets of hunger in Texas."
Democrats quickly criticized Mr. Bush, who has campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination as a "compassionate conservative."
In Washington, the Democratic National Committee distributed the comments to reporters. In Texas, State Representative Elliott Naishtat, a Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Human Services, issued a statement today saying that he was "appalled" at the governor's comments and that "there are massive numbers of people who go hungry."
"Could it be the governor also doesn't know that Texas ranks at or near the bottom in every recognized national poverty-related category?" Mr. Naishtat said in the statement. "Perhaps so."
A Bush campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, noted that Mr. Bush's remarks to The Star-Telegram included a fuller comment in which the governor said, "I want to know the facts. I would like for the Department of Agriculture to show us who, where are they, and we'll respond."
Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush signed a measure earlier this year approving $2 million for nutrition education and outreach efforts to needy families. One of the governor's priorities, the spokesman said, has been to mobilize religious groups and charities to help the poor. Mr. Bush is proposing tax benefits for people who donate money to such organizations.
"He is committed to doing something about hunger," Mr. McClellan said.
After a campaign appearance in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, Mr. Bush was asked whether he had been surprised by the hunger report.
"I'm sure there are some people who are hungry," he replied. "I don't believe 5 percent of the children in my state are hungry, and if they are, we'll fix it.
"Yeah, I'm surprised. I'm surprised all of a sudden a report floats out of Washington, D.C., as I'm launching my campaign for president. There seems to be a lot of reports to be coming out of Washington, D.C., these days."
Celia Hagert, nutrition policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, a nonprofit organization focusing on issues affecting low-income Texans, said statistics compiled by America's Second Harvest, a network of food banks, showed that food banks in Texas distributed 25.9 percent more food in 1999 than in 1996. The amount was 118.6 million pounds, up from 94.2 million pounds.
Jan Pruitt, executive director of the North Texas Food Bank in Dallas, said demand at the food bank had increased about 12 percent over last year while donations had increased by 5 percent. Ms. Pruitt said the people seeking food were different from a decade ago, when the needy were mostly the unemployed.
"I've seen not only the need increase but the whole face of the hungry change," she said. "Now it's working people. They're employed, and they cannot feed their families."

HEADLINE: Ivory Coast Soldiers Rampage, Apparently to Demand Pay

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Soldiers rampaged in the streets of Abidjan today, shooting wildly into the air, stealing cars and looting stores, apparently in a protest over unpaid wages.
Residents dashed for cover as soldiers zoomed through Abidjan in stolen luxury sedans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, firing automatic weapons and shouting obscenities. Stores closed throughout the city, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, and barricades went up in some neighborhoods. 
 More soldiers drove up and down the road leading east from Abidjan to Bingerville, a nearby town. Abandoned cars littered the deserted road, which is normally crowded with people and vehicles.
Witnesses said the soldiers forced people from their cars and took off with the vehicles. "I am scared for my life and for my car," said a taxi driver, Koudjo Yao. "If I lose my car, I lose everything."
Daniel Kadja, an official in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, played down the rebellion, saying there was "no need to panic."
The violence eased somewhat late tonight. A presidential official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said negotiations were under way with leaders of the uprising.
The soldiers did not announce a reason for the protest, but individuals among them complained about unpaid salaries, poor living conditions and insufficient benefits like housing subsidies.
Ivory Coast, a country of 19 million people, has long been considered a model of West African stability. But political and social turmoil have risen steadily as the country prepares for presidential elections, scheduled for next October.
Earlier today, gunfire resounded near the national television and radio stations, which went off the air without explanation during the afternoon. Soldiers, some in uniform and others in T-shirts and caps, surrounded both broadcast centers. The gates of both were locked.
United Nations staff members were trapped in their downtown offices across the street from the radio station, which appeared to be under attack, a United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said in New York.
The gates to the American Embassy nearby were also locked. But the streets around the president's residence in suburban Cocody remained calm. The airport, on the southeastern edge of the city, continued to function normally.
The rampage subsided as night approached, but sporadic gunfire continued and soldiers blocked off the main roads leaving the city. At least one tank was seen, and the thud of explosions could be heard in the distance.
The State Department urged Americans in Abidjan to remain in their homes.
The country has been plagued by mounting foreign debt and an economic downturn linked to the falling prices of its main exports, coffee and cocoa. Government coffers were depleted further this year when the European Union and the International Monetary Fund suspended aid because of corruption allegations.
An opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, accuses the government of harassing his political party. Last month, 12 leaders of his party, Rally of the Republicans, were jailed and a warrant has been issued for Mr. Ouattara's arrest.
President Henri Konan Bedie says Mr. Ouattara is not eligible to run for president because his father was born in Burkina Faso. Mr. Ouattara denies the claim and says he has documents to prove his father's citizenship.
Mr. Bedie, who has banned all outdoor demonstrations, went on national television on Wednesday to appeal for unity and calm. Looking nervous, he promised "reconciliation, peace, happiness and prosperity" if the opposition cooperated with the government.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Average interest rates on 30- and 15-year fixed mortgages inched higher this week, despite a Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged, according to Freddie Mac. Thirty-year mortgage rates rose to an average 7.96 percent in the week from 7.86 percent in the previous week, while 15-year mortgages were at an average 7.57 percent from 7.47 percent. One-year adjustable rate mortgages also rose, to 6.64 percent from 6.49 percent; the new level is the highest since 6.66 percent in the week ended Feb. 17, 1995. A year earlier, 30-year mortgage rates averaged 6.77 percent, 15-year mortgages, 6.41 percent, and one-year adjustables, 5.58 percent.

Rehearing Sought in Reversal On Test-Based Eligibility Suit

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

 BODY:
Lawyers for four African-American athletes who sued the National Collegiate Athletic Association over the minimum test score requirement for athletic scholarships said yesterday they would ask the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to rehear their arguments and promised to pursue legal remedies, if necessary, all the way to the Supreme Court.
On Wednesday, in a 2-1 opinion, the judges reversed a lower court decision that struck down the eligibility requirement, ruling that it was unfair to African-Americans. The decision did not address the merits of the case -- that the African-American student-athletes are unfairly affected by the initial-eligibility rule as determined by test scores. 
 Rather, the court said that college sports' governing body did not directly receive federal funding and did not have to conform with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. Because of that, they said, it was not necessary to address the other issues.
"The battle is far from over," said Adele P. Kimmel, a staff lawyer for the Washington-based Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. "We will ask them to rehear it. If necessary we'll ask the entire court to hear arguments. I'm certain that no matter what the decision, both sides will want to take it to the Supreme Court. This is that important."
In March, Judge Ronald I. Buckwalter held that the N.C.A.A.'s Scholastic Assessment Tests and American College Test minimum score requirement -- 820 on the former or 16 on the latter -- "has an unjustified disparate impact against African-Americans."
The lawsuit was originally brought by two African-American students, Tai Kwan Cureton and Leatrice Shaw. Both graduated from Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia in June 1996 ranked high in their class, and both excelled in track. But despite earning academic honors, they did not do well on the Scholastic Assessment Tests and could not get athletic scholarships.
The suit took aim at the standards, called Proposition 16, which dictates initial eligibility for freshmen in the N.C.A.A.'s 302 Division I schools. The standards also include a core group of high school courses and a minimum grade-point average in that core.
Buckwalter cited the N.C.A.A.'s own research showing that the practice harmed African-American students' chances of being declared academically eligible and that the organization's goal of improving graduation rates -- the reason it instituted Proposition 16 -- could be achieved by other available methods.
Buckwalter's ruling on one of college sports' most enduring challenges -- how to improve graduation rates without excluding economically disadvantaged students -- briefly left coaches, administrators and college presidents uncertain of who is eligible for scholarships.
The debate over the use of standardized tests to determine college eligibility has long been an incendiary one that has extended beyond the realm of sports. Advocacy groups assert that the tests are not free of cultural bias and thus discriminate against minority students and lower-income students.
In the wake of the Buckwalter decision, N.C.A.A. officials argued that if individual schools were left to decide who could receive scholarships, it would create chaos. The courts ruled Proposition 16 would remain in place while the case is being litigated.
"The effect of this ruling is that the association's initial-eligibility bylaws remain in effect, and two more important jurisdictional questions have been answered with regard to the application of federal law to the N.C.A.A.," said Graham B. Spanier, chairman of the N.C.A.A. Division I board of directors and the president of Penn State University.
"We are pleased to obtain this ruling from the court," Spanier said. "But as we have said all along, we will continue to review initial-eligibility rules, including the test score cutoff."
The N.C.A.A. first began using test scores as a standard for athletic eligibility in 1986 in an effort to address concerns that athletes were being used for sports only and were not receiving an education. It followed several high-profile cases in which college athletes acknowledged that they were not being educated; in some cases they even had trouble reading.

HEADLINE: A CLOSER LOOK;
An Instant Ad on a Plan to Lower Taxes

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:

On Tuesday, the Bush campaign began running the first of what it calls "crash ads," swiftly assembled commercials designed to be broadcast within a day of filming. This 30-second spot was recorded on Monday in a speech by Gov. George W. Bush at Manchester West High School in Manchester, N.H.
 
PRODUCER -- Maverick Media 

THE PITCH -- The candidate as tax-cutter and newsmaker. Mr. Bush is filmed from a variety of camera angles, as he stands at the podium in what looks like the high school's gym and comments on his own tax proposals. The sense that this is a real event is palpable, from the handmade "Welcome" sign behind the candidate to the looks on the faces of the teenagers who fill the room. The minimal graphics that flash "Bush Campaign Update" and "Manchester West High School, December 20, 1999" are meant not only to mimic news footage, but also to heighten the spot's topicality and urgency. The camera wobbles and zooms in unexpectedly, adding to the feel of an event unfolding before the viewers' eyes.
 
THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: "A leader learns to take the will of the people and convert it into public policy. I'm used to having to set an agenda. It's important to cut the rates in order to keep the economy growing. If you like what you hear, endorse my plan. Send a signal to Washington that a $480 billion tax cut over five years is what they want. I've been criticized in this tax plan for it being too bold. And I've been criticized in the tax plan for it, that I'd not be bold enough. Which kind of says to me I'm doing all right."
 
ACCURACY -- The central component of the proposal Mr. Bush unveiled on Dec. 1 is a $483 billion tax cut over five years, an idea that has, in fact, come under attack from those who have called it either too generous or not ambitious enough. The proposed cut is larger than the one passed last summer by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton, who termed it irresponsible.
 
SCORECARD -- In what is coming to seem a signature of Mr. Bush's advertising team, the spot takes a lively approach to a stock campaign commercial. In over-the-shoulder shots, with a large audience staring back at him in a standard campaign panorama, the candidate looks presidential; his brisk lowering of his hand, at his mention of cutting "rates," evokes memories of his father's emphatic gestures and syntactic shorthand. The spot also places Mr. Bush in a thoroughly New Hampshire-oriented environment, at a moment in the campaign when he has come under some criticism for not spending enough time in the state. The potential for subtle lapses in making of commercials on the fly is also on view here: in one shot, a young man seated in the front row can be seen with his head bowed, as if in deep sleep.

HEADLINE: Mall School Tries Reading, Writing and Retail

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Dec. 21

 BODY:
If retail is war, then the students of Providence Place Academy are the first cadets in the country to have their boot camp on the field of battle.
The academy, a fledgling alternative public high school oriented toward business training, may be the first vocational high school in the nation to be based in a working mall. Classrooms have yet to be moved to the gigantic new Providence Place mall in the heart of this reviving city, but the academy's initial 14 students, as afternoon interns, are seeing their first combat just as the fighting is fiercest: Christmas shopping season. 
 "If they can handle this, they can handle anything," Jo-Ann Ward, the school's curriculum-design specialist, said. "The rest will be a walk in the park."
The academy's administrators have been tested as well in the debate that has arisen over the school's creation.
With Nordstrom and more than 100 other stores and restaurants, Providence Place, which opened in August, is a giant deal here, tangible proof that the tired old industrial city has new life. A highway traveler who suddenly sees the mall looming above an overpass might think he had just entered the city of Filene's.
Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. provided much of the motive force behind the mall and was instrumental in the conception of Providence Place Academy as well in discussions with city, school and chamber of commerce officials.
But the school's link to the mall is so unusual it has met with resistance, said Paul Gounaris, director of the "school to career" programs in the Providence school system. There have been complaints from school committee members that it will be too expensive, and criticism from opponents that it will simply funnel students into dead-end cashier jobs they could have had anyway.
One letter to The Providence Journal argued that the students would be better served by interning at high-tech companies. Another said: "This school is recruiting our most precious assets: our children. They are training them to serve the 'white elite' in menial jobs such as sales clerks, maids, food servers, and janitors. Is it just another coincidence that the majority of the students are poor and minority kids?"
The second letter-writer was partly right. Most of the 14 afternoon interns, all juniors, are black, Asian or Hispanic, and the program, which began in November, does have them ringing up sales, stocking shelves, greeting customers and busing tables. (An hour and a half of their labor is considered their internship, and if they work longer, which most do, they are paid.)
But the whole thrust of the school, its founders say, is to help the students parlay their work experiences into learning and into aspirations that can make the difference between success and failure in the real world. The idea, they say, is to use the mall as a great textbook, per a City Council resolution saying that the mall should function in part as an educational setting.
"I don't think many of them will end up working in retail for most of their lives," said Bernard Lough, the school's principal. "They're using the skills they learn to broaden their horizons."
Indeed, among a half dozen students interviewed, there seemed to be no stampede toward careers at Sak's Fifth Avenue. Rather, they were full of the revelations of that first venture into the serious working world: how to tie a tie, how so many things must be done just perfectly, even how personal tribulations must be kept at home.
"Even if you have troubles in your house, you have to always have a smile on your face," said Ana Hernandez, an intern at Nordstrom.
That is the less formal learning that goes on at the academy. The juniors also take a full academic course load in the mornings and, perhaps most important, will be linking their work experiences to the traditional "three R's" with requirements like keeping a workday log that must be grammatically correct.
In the summer, Mr. Gounaris said, the students will practice analytical, research and communications skills: figuring out what their store's market is, for example, researching the potential of that market and giving an oral presentation.
The academy is to move into its mall classrooms by late spring and is scheduled to expand to 100 students next fall. Administrators say there were many more applicants for the program than there were slots. Its focus on learning by experience fits into a broader movement intended to shift schools in that direction, Mr. Gounaris said, as well as fitting into a growing tendency for businesses to enter partnerships with schools. The academy was created in conjunction with the mall's developers, Commonwealth Development Group, and with Johnson & Wales, a Providence university that includes a well-known culinary college among its divisions.
Johnson & Wales is providing classroom space and its students are serving as mentors. The mall, aside from providing the venues where the students try their working wings, is giving them a kiosk at which they can sell their own wares. The students are planning to publish a children's book called "Hair-o" about a little Jamaican boy whose long dreadlocks have magical powers.
The stores seem happy with their roles as educators, although there has been little time to teach the finer points of Retail 101 during the Christmas rush, school officials say.
Debbie Almeida, manager of the Godiva chocolate store, said that her intern, Saveth Som, had learned what a Christmas crush was all about. "She's either going to love retail after this or hate it," Ms. Almeida said. "There's no gray in retail."
It is love for Jairo Garcia, the intern in Restoration Hardware. Still, Mr. Garcia said, "I want to be a pilot and have my own airlines."
Whether they love or hate their jobs, Providence Place interns had better not act like those teenagers who "hang" at the mall merely to wile away their time. The difference between the interns and their peers, Ms. Ward said, is, "Ours don't hang."

BYLINE: By Frank H. T. Rhodes; Frank H. T. Rhodes is president emeritus of Cornell University.

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
When I was provost of the University of Michigan, the medical school had a student prize for medical diagnosis: the S.S.W. Award. The initials stood for "swift, sure and wrong." I am reminded of it when I hear reports celebrating Texas's "10 percent solution" -- its experiment in maintaining diversity in its public universities by guaranteeing admission for every student graduating in the top 10 percent of any high school in the state.
Attracted though we are to swift and simple solutions to national problems, this route to expanding educational opportunity for underrepresented minorities should be avoided by any university that has better choices. 
 Texas adopted the 10 percent solution only after an unfortunate federal court decision banned the traditional affirmative action policies its university had used successfully for years. California followed, taking up a 4 percent rule after a voter referendum forced it, too, to abandon affirmative action. These guarantees may well be the best these states can do to help their universities maintain the diversity that prepares students best to participate in a pluralistic society.
But now Florida, with no constraint except the threat of a state referendum, has replaced affirmative action with a variation -- a 20 percent admissions system -- and other states will likely consider similar schemes.
The excitement over the simplicity of the 10 percent solution should not blind us to its liabilities. In the admissions process itself, the policy penalizes students at a state's more demanding secondary schools, where those in, say, the second decile are often better equipped for college than those in the top 10 percent at other schools. And, by encouraging admission of less able students into more selective institutions, it may leave them struggling for survival in classes more difficult than they have been prepared to handle.
In high schools, the promise of automatic admission may be an incentive to some students to work hard, but others will be discouraged from taking the extra-hard course or enrolling in the more demanding high school for fear of jeopardizing a high class rank. Consider, too, that the 10 percent solution's very success at assuring minority enrollment depends in large part on continuing de facto segregation of Texas high schools. Is that a situation we should seek to perpetuate?
At the university level, public education itself stands to be harmed as the great public institutions run the risk of becoming less competitive with the strongest private schools. The 10 percent solution does nothing, either, to address the vital question of minority balance in graduate, medical, law and other professional schools.
For all its simplicity and attractiveness, the 10 percent solution is race-blind at the price of being individual-blind. A quota system, however well intended, and a numerically based admissions system, however well-conceived, deny the significance and priority of individuality, in all its bewildering complexity. That is a terrible price to pay.
"A university," John Henry Newman once wrote, "is not a foundry, or a mint, or a treadmill . . . but an alma mater, knowing her children one by one." One by one, person by person: that is the basis for educational success. It is also the basis for a free society: we should not lightly abandon it for a system which, however swift, however simple, not only judges individuals by numbers, but uses numbers as ambiguous as those of class standing. Even in an age bedazzled by rankings, surely we can do better than that.
Why not base admissions decisions on an assessment of the student as a whole person, with honest regard for race and ethnicity as two attributes among many others -- scholastic promise, analytical skills, comprehension, test scores, grades, essay quality, creativity, artistic and musical ability, athletic skills, community service, leadership ability, motivation, success in dealing with adversity, teacher assessment, career objectives, geographic origin, economic background, interview performance and more? That is the practice explicitly upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1978 University of California v. Bakke decision, and most of our states are free to continue to use it. Unless and until it is overturned, we should stick with it. It has served us well.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
New Houses in Bronx Will Extend Neighborhood to Waterfront

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Earthmovers are clearing 22.5 acres that hug the East River in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx in preparation for a residential development that will extend the neighborhood to the water's edge and add to an old staple in the area: the two-family house.
The $40 million project, called Beechwood at Castle Hill, will have 144 such houses, all two stories. Each will have a three- to five-bedroom apartment for the owner and a studio, one- or two-bedroom rental unit. Each house will also have 1,900 square feet and a one-car garage. Most will sit on 23-by-105-foot lots, though some lots will be larger. 
 Construction of the first 70 houses is expected to begin in February, and they are being sold for $229,000 to $279,000, compared with $200,000 to $270,000 for older two-family houses in the neighborhood, said Maria Camporeale, president of Frontier Group Properties, the project's sales agent. Rents for apartments in the area are $600 to $1,000 a month.
Since sales began last month, 45 houses have been bought, she said. Mortgages, with down payments as low as 3 percent, are being made available to buyers through seven banks, she added. Ms. Camporeale noted that 75 percent of the rent from the apartment can be counted toward a buyer's total income.
The houses are also eligible for an eight-year tax abatement from the city, she said. Because of the abatement, taxes are expected to be $120 to $150 in the first year, rising to $2,000 to $3,000 after the exemption expires in the eighth year.
This is not the first project planned for the site, which is at Castle Hill and Norton Avenues and was once occupied by the Castle Hill Swim Club. The club was razed during the building boom of the mid-1980's to make way for a planned 511-unit condominium development, but that project was derailed by the recession when an earlier developer defaulted on its loan. In 1994, the mortgage holder, the River Bank of America of New Rochelle, which is now defunct, took back the property, as well as a nearby 55-acre waterfront site, also a former swim club, where the same developer had planned to build 1,100 units.
Over the next few years, the Castle Hill property sat vacant. (At the second project, known as Shorehaven, the first 256 of the 1,100 condominiums have been built, but spokesmen for the landowner declined to say when construction would begin on the rest of the project.)
Last year, judging that the housing market in the Bronx had rebounded from its doldrums, the owner of the Castle Hill property, R. B. Asset Inc. of Manhattan, the successor to River Bank, began marketing the site for redevelopment. It joined forces earlier this year with the Beechwood Organization of Jericho, N.Y., a builder of two-family houses in Brooklyn and the Bronx. The developers gave up the higher density that was allowed under special zoning granted to the first project in the 1980's. Instead, they chose to build their project according to the site's original zoning.
"The site is in a solid family community, where two-family homes predominate, but new ones haven't been built in 30 years," Leslie A. Lerner, a partner with Michael Dubb at Beechwood, said, explaining why the developers made the switch. "It's also large enough to create a new part of the existing neighborhood, which people like."
One person pleased with the new plans is Francisco Gonzalez, district manager of Community Board 9, which guides growth in the area. "The lower density along with the two-family-home concept complements the area," he said. Having the site redeveloped, he added, "will lift a drain from and upgrade that part of the community board as well as help raise property values."
Mr. Lerner said the partners see two-family homes, with their income-producing apartments, "as the basic form of housing for middle-income purchasers to buy because they can own a home, generally for less than the monthly cost of renting an apartment."
For example, he said, a person buying a $229,000 home with a 5 percent down payment would have a monthly mortgage payment of $1,500; including utilities and the abated real estate taxes, the cost would be $1,700. But a monthly rent of $1,000 from a two-bedroom unit reduces the owner's monthly cost to $700, he said.
Those advantages are among the reasons Damaso and Irisa Rosa have signed a contract to buy a house there. The Rosas now live with their two children in a rental apartment in Washington Heights, Manhattan. (He is a truck driver, and she is a dietitian at a nursing home.)
"We will get a little help with the mortgage, build up equity that we will get back when we sell the house, and our kids get a backyard to run around in and play," Mr. Rosa said. He calculates that his monthly cost to own the home will be about $700, which he said is slightly more than what the Rosas now pay in rent.
Mr. Lerner said the brick-and-aluminum-sided houses have been designed with three different layouts so buyers can choose the size of both apartments based on "how big their family is or how great their need is for the rental income." The architect is Fakler & Eliason, of Fresh Meadows, Queens.
The owners' apartments will range in size from 1,190 to 1,470 square feet and fill the first floor and part of the second, while the rentals will range from 430 to 710 square feet and occupy the rest of the second floor. In a home with a five-bedroom 1,470-square-foot unit for the owner, for instance, the rental will be a 430-square-foot studio.
Buyers will start moving into their new houses by Christmas next year, Mr. Lerner said. He said construction of the remaining 74 houses will be tied to sales.

HEADLINE: Selling Online, Delivering on Bikes;
Low-Tech Courier Services Thrive On Growth of Web-Based Retailing

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Here at the high noon of holiday shopping in Manhattan, the future of the e-commerce revolution is increasingly dependent on a low-tech, often-despised grunt: the bicycle messenger.
Newly belted with two-way radios and data pagers, tracked by sophisticated routing software, these two-wheeled e-liverers are more in demand, more highly paid, better trained and, well, better uniformed than ever before. 
 They call themselves riders, and only they can prevail on an island where gridlock is the black hole of the traditional delivery van, in a time when an exploding number of imperious dot-commerce customers want service in less than one hour.
And the riders know it. "They need us, all these people that want things faster than ever," said William Hightower, 33, a courier for Kozmo.com who was poised to hurl his 21-speed Trek mountain bike on yet another dangerous delivery run. "And now we ride all day."
Idealized in the 1980's for their rebel glamour, bicycle messengers found themselves superseded in this decade not only by the fax machine but also the ubiquitous e-mail attachment.
They have also been excoriated in the City Council, singled out by the mayor's quality-of-life crackdowns and stigmatized by terrorized pedestrians.
But now the city's couriers are enjoying a renaissance as new Web-based retailers -- including Kozmo.com, Urbanfetch.com and Barnesandnoble.com -- are employing them as shock troops in a struggle with traditional brick-and-mortar video outlets, food purveyors and retail stores. (Even those merchants are going virtual, and employing more messengers.)
"No matter how high-tech these companies are, their products are still going to be delivered in Manhattan on the back of the guy on the bike," said Denyse Barbay-Burgess, vice president for marketing at the Earlybird messenger service in Manhattan, which is delivering book orders for Barnesandnoble.com.
"New Yorkers are the busiest people in the United States, and we're catering to their needs for convenience and instant gratification," said Joseph C. Park, the chief executive of Kozmo.com, which employs 300 messengers in Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights to provide free delivery of anything from a package of Twizzlers ($1) to a Toshiba DVD player ($319).
And so at Earlybird, "we're up 15 percent thanks to e-commerce," Ms. Barbay-Burgess said.
"In the last few months," she said, "we've been bombarded by dot-com companies that want to crack the New York market."
Earlybird has dedicated more than 100 of its 300 messengers each day just to deliver 600 to 800 orders for Barnesandnoble.com that used to be schlepped by postal or parcel delivery trucks.
"It is not more expensive to us," Jonathan Bulkeley, chief executive of the online bookstore, said of the New York pilot project, "and it's a way for us to stand out from the crowd" of competitors that ship by snail mail.
At first, the Internet challenged the messenger business "because every time someone sent an e-mail document attachment, we lost a delivery," said Robert Kotch, owner of Breakaway Courier Systems in Manhattan, which fields 120 messengers serving 3,000 city accounts, many of them dot.companies.
"But e-commerce was a godsend to us," Mr. Kotch said. "It came just at the right time."
More than 300 New York messenger companies compete for business worth about $700 million, estimated Bill Goodman, director of the New York State Messenger and Courier Association, a trade group. Cruising the city is an army of as many as 10,000 unlicensed bicycle, van and foot messengers. (The vans are for bulky items like DVD players.) About 5 percent of couriers are women, Mr. Goodman said.
The going messenger rate is $6 to $10 per delivery, at least $5 less than it was a decade ago, because of severe competition, Mr. Goodman said. Full-time bicycle couriers can log more than 30 miles a day on shifts that last 8 to 10 hours. They are paid $300 to $800 a week.
Those employed by Kozmo.com and a few other e-tailers are allowed to accept tips, and can make $15 to $60 a night.
Thanks to Internet commerce, "We've been pulling our hair out to find people to work for us," Mr. Kotch said.
Nate Kretzschmar, 26, a delivery supervisor at Kozmo.com who paid his dues as a bicycle messenger, agreed. "It's definitely a messenger's market now," he said, adding that the Internet companies "are beginning to take all the best riders."
Unless the e-house of e-cards collapses, the demand for messengers will keep surging. Earlybird is recruiting more Manhattan couriers, and Mr. Park said Kozmo planned to expand its pool to 1,000 riders by the end of next year.
These days, seasoned street warriors are getting bonuses and benefits unheard of a few years ago. Earlybird offers a 10 percent bonus for trips on rainy days, a $500 bonus for six months of perfect attendance, and 401(k) retirement accounts and contributory health insurance.
In delivering a 50,000-item inventory ranging from Palm organizers to gift certificates at the restaurant Daniel, Urbanfetch.com "has a strictly enforced no-tipping policy," said Ross L. Stevens, the company's chief executive, "because customers are uncomfortable about how much to tip on a DVD player," he said.
To compensate for its no-tipping ukase, the company offers a cornucopia of incentives to its 100 couriers so "they can make more than $800 a week," Mr. Stevens said.
Urbanfetch.com, like a growing number of competitors, uniforms its couriers (in green, white and black). And many companies now put messengers through intensive delivery training sessions "because that one moment of interaction makes or breaks the experience for our customers," said Mr. Park (whose messengers at Kozmo.com wear orange, green and navy blue).
The training strategy reassures many customers. "Usually bike messengers are kind of a crazy crew, pierced and tattooed, but Kozmo.com has some very good guys," said Jarom Fawson, 26, a computer consultant who lives in the West Village and places Internet orders every other week.
The courier industry hopes that the city's newfound need for riders will upgrade their image. "Messengers have been stigmatized, but to make the city work, you have to have them," Mr. Goodman said. "It's a tough job, it's a big city, and it's crazy out there."
The streets they ride are indeed mean. So far, 34 bicyclists have been killed this year in the five boroughs. Although the Police Department cannot say how many were messengers, most are believed to be. "Even several of our bicycle officers have been injured on their bikes," said Inspector James Hegarty, commander of the Traffic Control Division.
Riders are prey to the bristling side-view mirrors of passing vehicles and to lane-changing drivers. "I've seen taxi doors suddenly open up on riders, and it took their fingers right off," said James Douglas, 19, a Kozmo.com messenger who was waiting recently in the dispatch room of the warehouse at 111 East 12th Street -- a bare-bones space filled with shipping boxes that everyone calls the lounge.
Riders are also under intense pressure from the police. Responding to citywide complaints about bicycle messengers, the Police Department doubled its Manhattan Traffic Task Force last year from 10 to 20 mountain-biking officers. The heightened enforcement came after a man was struck and killed on a sidewalk by a food deliveryman on a bicycle in 1997.
Mr. Goodman drew a distinction between couriers and the riders who inhabit the bottom of the food chain, delivering takeout orders for tips on wobbly balloon-tire bicycles with wire baskets. Those riders provoke "the No. 1 quality-of-life complaint by the people who reside and do business in our community," said Capt. Michael E. Shea, commander of the 20th Precinct in Manhattan.
Not long ago, messengers had a transgressive chic that was mainstreamed by entertainments like "Quicksilver," the 1986 Kevin Bacon film, and "Double Rush," the 1995 CBS series about a Manhattan bicycle-messenger service. Despite Hollywood, plenty of New Yorkers seem to prefer not to share an elevator with a messenger.
"If you want to know how discrimination feels to minorities, just be a bike messenger," Mr. Kotch said. "The guy at the front door takes one look at you and tells you to go around to the back."
And since it is Manhattan, they get some extraterrestrial requests that attempt to push them where no messenger has gone before. One regular Kozmo.com customer keeps specifying deliveries from "a cute, naked messenger" in his e-mail requests.
"That's one we haven't entirely fulfilled," Mr. Kretzschmar said.
But some veteran messengers cannot get enough of the riding rush. "It's a thrill riding on the streets; you're addicted," said Andrew Terrelonge, 38, a messenger for 10 years, the last 2 at Earlybird.
"There is nothing like it," agreed Jose Arroyo, 33, a courier for 12 years. "I even ride on my day off when it's nice." That's with his wife, Maisie, and the oldest of his four children, Junior, 12, and Justin, 9.
For others, the romance, such as it is, lies in their pay envelopes. "For me, it's quick cash while I'm going to school," said Danny Barrera, 24, a part-time business student at Queensborough Community College.
Perry Benes, 22, from Haifa, Israel, found himself in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, five months ago and started riding for the money, he said. "Another few months," he added, "and I'll have enough to go to South America."
But for a majority of riders, the glamour fades after five years, said Mr. Kotch, 42, who spent a couple of years as a messenger himself. "Then you get tired of sucking down diesel exhausts."
These days, he is content to lug a folding bicycle onto New Jersey Transit for his trip to work so that he can pedal to Canal Street, where his courier company plays its part in keeping the new Internet economy clicking right along.

Chart: "KEEPING TRACK -- Penalizing Pedal Pushers"

HEADLINE: THE CHANCELLOR'S OUSTER: THE DECLINE;
A Firebrand Who Seemed to Lose His Spark

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Just a year ago, Rudy Crew seemed poised to be the first chancellor in years to make a lasting difference on New York City's public schools. From the time he arrived from the comparatively tiny Tacoma, Wash., embraced by almost everyone in New York's troubled and politically divided system, he promised quick results and often seemed to deliver.
He wrested substantial control from corrupt and incompetent community school boards. He talked about setting higher standards. He ousted bad principals and took over schools that had abjectly failed their children, promising to turn them around. He gave hope that one man could move a huge bureaucracy to new heights. 
 Yesterday, after months of Hamletlike indecision, the one-time giant came crashing down, after his own board rejected his plea for public affirmation as symbolized by his request for a long-term contract, more money and higher benefits. As he fell -- going from hero to a figure some saw as tragic -- he was publicly excoriated by some politicians and board members who had once been his supporters.
As word of his ouster became public yesterday, virtually no one -- from parents at the schoolhouse gate to union leaders to academics and educators -- publicly begged him to stay. In seclusion with his children in his official townhouse in Brooklyn yesterday, he stood alone.
"I think it's real sad," said Arthur Levine, the president of Teacher's College at Columbia University and a sometime Crew confidant. "I'm still a very big fan of his. There aren't a lot of excellent urban school superintendents in America, and I thought New York had the best."
In the aftermath, there are two views of what happened. One espoused by Dr. Crew and his associates is that in standing up for public education -- opposing the national movement toward school vouchers and warning of the risks of charter schools -- he became the target of Gov. George E. Pataki and, more importantly, of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who controlled a majority of votes on the Board of Education.
The other view is that he came in with a grand vision of taking control of the city's huge school system, executed it through pure chutzpah and a network of unions and legislators, then tripped over the delicate and difficult work of taking his hard-won powers and improving the schools.
But whatever led to his demise, supporters and detractors all say that with more political skill and sheer stomach for the fight, Dr. Crew could have salvaged his job. Mr. Giuliani, his aides say, was genuinely torn about Dr. Crew, and was looking for signals that the chancellor was willing to work with him. The mayor had hounded out a previous chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, and a popular police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and did not want to be perceived again as a bully, officials said.
"My perspective on the fall is that he brought this on himself," said Raymond Domanico, education advisor for the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation. "I think to all observers he's been drifting for a while, and his unwillingness to make a strong commitment alienated sufficient numbers of the board to lead to his downfall."
Publicly, Dr. Crew's coalition began to fall apart last spring, when he and Mr. Giuliani carried on a bitter dispute over vouchers. Mr. Giuliani had begun lobbying the Board of Education to experiment with using government money to send poor children in failing schools to private school. Dr. Crew, saying vouchers would destroy the public school system, threatened to resign.
The two men publicly patched up their differences over the ensuing months, but aides to Dr. Crew say now that the mayor never forgot.
"I don't think it was in the mayor's nature to let that kind of message go," said Chiara Coletti, Dr. Crew's press secretary at the time. Dr. Crew's pride added to the tension, she said. "He tends to dig his heels in when he has strong convictions. If you consider the temperaments and personalities of both men, I don't consider this a big surprise."
Yet other confidants of Dr. Crew say that he seemed to have lost his fire for the job a year ago -- well before the vouchers dispute. One educator said that Dr. Crew had begun ruminating about where he might go next. Dr. Crew's wife, Kathy, was homesick for Tacoma, his friends say, and his ex-wife, the mother of his four children, was struggling with breast cancer.
Last December, Dr. Crew engaged in a bruising fight with Governor Pataki over charter schools. Dr. Crew warned that charter schools would bleed the public school system of resources and top students. Mr. Pataki, officials say, was infuriated.
Dr. Crew's aides argue that Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani took their revenge by orchestrating the release of two damaging but flimsy reports on the school system over the last month, just as Dr. Crew's contract was coming up for renewal. One report revealed widespread cheating by teachers on standardized tests; the other accused city high schools of inflating attendance figures to get more state aid. Allegations of cheating and attendance inflation have plagued the school system for years. Nonetheless, the scandals put Dr. Crew on the defensive.
In September, Dr. Crew began publicly flirting with a job offer at the University of Washington in Seattle. At the same time, the Board of Education began working on its annual evaluation of the chancellor. For the first time, the evaluation was critical, praising the chancellor for his vision but faulting him for lack of follow-through.
Dr. Crew reacted defensively, dismissing the evaluation as politically motivated. Board members complained that he was not taking them seriously.
Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, whose appointee to the board was the first to announce he would vote against Dr. Crew, said the chancellor "seemed to have lost his spark." Dr. Crew became increasingly isolated, often traveling out of town on family business and refusing to talk to board members he believed were allied with the mayor.
"You may disagree, you may feel that they're not on your side all the time, but you have an obligation to work with them," Mr. Molinari said of the board.

Online Holiday Shopping Cuts Into Traditional Sales
Online holiday shopping is increasingly cutting into the business of traditional retailers this year, with preliminary indications that seasonal Internet sales may nearly triple from last year. Visa estimates that Internet shoppers using its cards will have spent $1.47 billion this November and December, 179 percent more than in those months last year.
In the overall retail market, that figure is still small -- 1.74 percent of Visa's retail sales -- but it signals a troublesome phenomenon for traditional retailers, experts say. Stores are finding that their best customers are the quickest to move online. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Fall on Worries About the Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, rounding out a second week of losses that pushed yields to 27- month highs on expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in February.
"The Fed is telling us that they're going" to raise interest rates next year, said Roger Bayston, who handles $10 billion in fixed-income funds at Franklin Templeton Group in San Mateo, Calif. 
 Though the market is discounting higher rates, it "will continue to see whether the Fed will stay ahead of the curve" on inflation, said Mr. Bayston, who prefers corporate, government agency and asset-backed debt for the extra income they offer over Treasuries.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 14/32, to 95 9/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.49 percent from 6.45 percent on Wednesday.
Bonds pared early gains made as dealers covered short positions, or bets that the market would fall, after a report showed that factory orders for durable goods rose 1.2 percent in November, near analysts' forecasts for a 1.1 percent increase. A separate report showed that personal spending rose 0.5 percent last month, as expected, while income growth slowed from the previous month.
The Fed, which left interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week, is expected to raise rates at its Feb. 1-2 meeting to slow a growth pace that analysts say could lead to faster inflation down the road. The Fed has raised rates by a quarter of a point three times since June.
"The market's beginning to anticipate more Fed moves after the beginning of the year," said Alan Day, who helps manage some $4 billion at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt. A 30-year yield of "6.75 percent doesn't look very hard to get to," he added.
Trading was limited before the close at 2 p.m. New York time for the long Christmas holiday weekend. By noon, trading volume in Treasuries was 50 percent below the five-day average, according to GovPx Inc., a bond pricing service.
