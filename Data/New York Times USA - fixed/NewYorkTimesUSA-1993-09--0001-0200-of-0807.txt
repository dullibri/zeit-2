HEADLINE: Physicians Are Selling Practices To Companies as Changes Loom

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Worried doctors across the country are selling their offices to investor-owned public companies, hoping to bolster their prospects in the rapidly changing health care system. The doctors are signing long-term contracts to work with the companies, in some cases as long as 33 years.
The sales to corporations are part of widespread efforts by doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to prepare for the sweeping changes promised by the Clinton Administration. Although hospitals and insurers are also linking up with medical groups, many doctors say their interests are better served in a corporate setting. 
 "With health care reform coming, private practitioners are scared," said Dr. Steven M. Scott, the chairman of the Coastal Healthcare Group Inc., which acquired a Miami-based network of 12 clinics in July. "They are looking for any help they can get to economize and keep their income streams up."
In the latest high-profile example, prestigious group practices in Houston and Oklahoma City were sold this year to Caremark International, a home care and managed care company with annual revenues of $1.9 billion.
Companies like Caremark typically give doctors cash and stock -- although the companies declined to disclose the amounts they initially paid to complete the transactions -- and promise them a steady income based on a growing number of patients that the companies hope to recruit. The companies put up money for new medical buildings, technology and computers. Some provide malpractice insurance.
 
Pay Is Compared
 And they finance the growing cost of providing managed care, in which doctors and hospitals often accept a flat fee, or capitation, for each person covered by a health plan.
The purchasing companies also manage the business, employ the nurses, technicians and clerks, and assist with the electronic analysis of medical results and strategic planning.
The growth of medical groups used to be financed by member physicians, but many costs have soared out of reach. And younger physicians often have other priorities, including leaving the group after a few years to follow a spouse's career moves.
Family doctors at a clinic acquired last year by Pacific Physicians Services Inc. in a recession-plagued Southern California area see 25 to 30 patients a day, said Dr. Leland Giddings, a clinic medical director. He said they earned $10,000 to $11,000 a month, about the same as before they joined the company. Their benefits -- including an allowance for continuing medical education and malpractice, life and health insurance as well as stock options -- had "markedly improved," he added. The doctors also get a year-end bonus of $5,000 or more if their unit's profit margins exceed 7 percent.
With companies like Caremark the doctors remain in charge of treating patients, although subject to the growing constraints imposed by health maintenance organizations and employers. There are no industrywide statistics available on how many physicians have sold their practices to investor-owned companies, but doctors and analysts alike say the trend is gaining strength.
"This is a paradigm shift of doctors, who were organized as physician-owned groups, to partnerships with other sources of capital, said Dr. Alfredo Czerwinski, corporate medical director of the Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, a large group practice with 175 physicians in Houston.
Kelsey-Seybold's doctor-owners sold their 17 offices and clinics to Caremark, based in Northbrook, Ill., in January. The company will receive a management fee, based on clinic revenues, as well as interest payments on the capital it invests. At least eight more clinics in the Houston area are planned over the next 18 months.
Critics of the trend warn of potential conflicts between medical values of doing everything possible for the patient and company shareholders' insistence on seeing quarterly profits grow. Some also say the company-managed groups may be violating laws in many states that prohibit the practice of medicine by business entities. In smaller markets, a large company-owned physician group may even raise antitrust concerns.
 
'Like Herding Cats'
 Health care executives and analysts cite another challenge: keeping the loyalty of doctors who may chafe under economic constraints imposed by corporate managers. Most doctors fiercely guard their independence.
 "They say that managing physicians is like herding cats," said Neal C. Bradsher, a health care securities analyst at Alex. Brown & Company in New York.
Caremark, which was split off from Baxter International, a hospital supply company, last year, says it is reshaping itself as a diversified managed health care company that could be a prime bidder for contracts in the changing national system. Analysts say prime contractors will command a larger share of the health care dollar than companies that can subcontract only for specialties like Caremark's home care and discounted-prescription drug businesses.
Caremark insists that under the capitation payment system, its clinics will not have incentives to use its home health and pharmacy services; if they did, it might run afoul of Government regulations against doctors sending patients to businesses that they own.
In July, Caremark acquired the Oklahoma City Clinic, which has 102 doctors, and the company says there are 150 physician groups on its shopping list, including ones in Tulsa, Dallas and Southern California.
 
Sales of Practices Grow
 Pacific Physician Services, which operates two dozen Southern California clinics from its headquarters in Redlands, added a 90-physician clinic in Riverside on Aug. 4. And Phycor Inc., based in Nashville, manages physician groups in 11 states.
Lawrence C. Marsh, a health care analyst in Richmond at Wheat First Securities, said the combined annual business of medical groups acquired by for-profit companies would probably exceed $1 billion in 1993 and was growing by 30 percent a year.
Large investor-owned insurance companies, including the Cigna Corporation and Aetna Life and Casualty, also have extensive contracts with physicians who work for the insurers' H.M.O.'s and other managed health care organizations. So do Prudential and Metropolitan Life, which are mutual life insurance companies, owned by their policyholders.
Hospitals have also been establishing close ties with physicians. In California, for example, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic rejected an offer from Caremark in favor of a "strategic affiliation" with the Sutter Health System, a large hospital and physician group based in Sacramento.
"We didn't think Caremark was a good fit for us," said Dr. David Druker, the Palo Alto clinic's executive director. "Caremark is a for-profit organization. I just don't think medicine was set up to be a profit-and-loss center."
But Joseph C. Hutts, president of Phycor, argued that hospitals and health maintenance organizations "have different objectives than physicians."
Dr. William F. Barnes, president of the Oklahoma City Clinic's board, said, "The first concern of hospitals and insurers is their own survival," adding "We needed a partner that was willing to commit to our growth."
C. A. Lance Piccolo, chairman of Caremark, said the company expected to receive $100 million to $120 million in gross revenues this year from the two clinics, rising to at least $150 million in 1994.
 
Foreseeing Profits
 Kenneth C. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, forecast that profit margins from the clinic operations next year would be 5 percent to 10 percent.
Mr. Piccolo said that H.M.O.'s, which provide health coverage to large groups of employees, would be the main customers. Kelsey-Seybold already has agreements with Sanus, an H.M.O. owned by the New York Life Insurance Company, and on Aug. 3, it also signed with Metropolitan Life's H.M.O.
Because Kelsey-Seybold is not tied to a particular H.M.O., it will be free to seek the business of any group as the health care system changes, Mr. Piccolo said. If a particular H.M.O. loses out in managed care competition, the Kelsey-Seybold doctors can look elsewhere, he said.
But hospital officials and physicians not involved in the Houston deal had questions about doctors' growing relations with for-profit companies.
The American Medical Association and several state medical associations have been warning doctors to be cautious about signing long-term agreements with hospitals, insurance companies or other physician management companies.
"All of us in medicine have a concern that stock exchange companies may put the dollar before the quality of care they deliver," said Dr. Robert Mayo Tenery Jr., a Dallas ophthalmologist who is president of the Texas Medical Association.
Dr. Ralph D. Feigin, physician in chief of Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston, added, "There has to be a different feeling in the health care area than in other corporate activities, because health care is dealing with human life."
Mr. Piccolo responded that Caremark executives had had long experience in dealing with doctors in its home health care business. He said the physicians would have "clinical autonomy," meaning they would be free to decide the best way to practice, and would have half the seats on their clinic's joint policy committee.
But he added that under the clinics' pay system of salaries and shared bonuses, the doctors would be "as at risk as we are" in trying to curb costs.
"We understand the fragility of physician relationships and their strengths," he continued.
 
U.S. Studies Caremark
 The Inspector General's office of the Department of Health and Human Services since 1991 has been reviewing Caremark's former payment arrangements with doctors who supervised home health care patients, looking for possible Medicare fraud and abuse. The company has said it is cooperating in the review and that it stopped paying the doctors a fee for each patient after the practice was questioned.
Mr. Abramowitz, the securities analyst, said most physicians would happily tap the corporations for capital to expand their practices. "They will probably be unhappy to the extent that these new entrants come in and reduce any physician compensation or autonomy they may have," he said.
"Physicians are one of the great cottage industries still around," he said. . "You could argue that this is just the beginning of the corporatization of physicians, which I'm sure they regard as a mixed blessing."

HEADLINE: More Young Californians Spurn Their Strained University System

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORAGA, Calif., Aug. 31

 BODY:
These are the days for goodbyes and good wishes in this San Francisco Bay suburb of dun-colored hills and aquamarine swimming pools, as newly minted freshmen head off to college.
But this year the goodbyes are different. High school graduates who would once have scarcely considered leaving California -- students like Jeff Zell and Lori White, Kristina Artist and her friend Nicole Glassel -- are deserting this state's once envied university system and scattering in record numbers to public universities around the West. 
 "The lure of the university system that once was just isn't there anymore," said Jeff Zell, who was accepted at several campuses of the University of California but chose the University of Arizona. He had heard too many horror stories about fee increases, staff cuts, canceled courses, eliminated programs and students forced to spend six years working toward a degree in the California system.
 
On Their Parents' Heels
 The flight of these young men and women parallels that of their middle-class elders, many of whom have escaped California's crime, crowding, pollution, racial tension and high cost of living for gentler lives in the Pacific Northwest, the Mountain States and the Southwest.
And their exodus from a fragile system of colleges and universities that was once the crown jewel of American public higher education is yet another measure of how deeply three years of budget cuts have eroded the quality of life in California and dashed hope for the future in this not so Golden State.
"There is no question people are going," said Barry Munitz, the chancellor of the California State University system. "I see their parents every day at Rotary lunches and Chamber of Commerce meetings. Not a day goes by when somebody doesn't say, 'Chancellor, I love C.S.U., but I'm encouraging my Sally to go to Eugene, Nevada-Reno, Texas Women's.'
"These are California families who have been paying taxes in part to have the right for their children and grandchildren to benefit from a high quality, low-cost college education," Mr. Munitz said. "It's a worry that they are being driven out. It is one more erosion of California's ability to compete economically, because it sucks brains out of the state."
The data bear out Mr. Munitz's contention that California students are leaving in droves. A study by the University of California shows that migration of college freshmen to Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington State rose 14 percent from 1990 to 1992, with larger increases expected this year.
At the University of Oregon, 25 percent of this year's freshman class is from California (including Mr. Zell's classmates Ms. Artist and Ms. Glassel), up from 8 percent in 1986. At University of Arizona, Californians represented 11 percent of the freshman class two years ago and are now 16 percent. And at the University of Colorado, 1,439 Californians applied for admission five years ago as against 2,583 this year (including Ms. White).
The driving force behind the exodus is state budget cuts. For three consecutive years, both the California State system, with its 20 campuses, and the more prestigious nine-campus University of California system, have bowed under the budget ax. Fees at Cal State have nearly doubled in that time, to $1,440 a year from $780. On the university campuses, fees (covering such costs as registration, social and cultural activites and counseling) have more than doubled, to $3,674 a year from $1,820. This brings the total cost, counting living expenses, to an average of $9,300 a year at a Cal State campus and $12,400 at a university campus.
To be sure, California residents still pay less for a year's education than they would at an out-of-state university; for one thing, tuition is still free for in-state students. But the budget cuts mean they get less than they used to: larger classes, fewer sections, majors eliminated and fewer senior faculty members because of early retirements. Some campuses have wiped out whole subject areas. The Cal State system, which had a total of 50,000 classes in 1990, has eliminated an average of 7,500 each fall.
These changes have stretched the time it takes to get a bachelor's degree, often to five or six years. In other states it is often easier to get a degree in four years, for about the same overall cost -- particularly in light of the cheaper housing in many states. (Officials estimate that attending Oregon for a year costs $15,000, Arizona $13,000 and Colorado $16,000.)
 
Selling Out-of-State Colleges
 "We tell them the cost can equal out," said Carrie Besnette, a California-based recruiter for University of Arizona. She says she finds her most receptive audience in well-to-do suburbs like this one.
Out-of-state recruiters know exactly what Californians worry about and fine-tune their pitch accordingly.
Lori Goldman, assistant director of admissions at the University of Arizona, says students often ask if their chosen major will still be offered in four years. They ask if Arizona has "impacted programs," a term commonly used in California for fields of study that accept no new students. They ask if required classes are readily available, making timely graduation possible.
Ms. Glassel was reassured on those points at orientation in Oregon last month. But what impressed her the most, after the harrowing registration stories from siblings and older friends, was that Oregon "had a million classes to choose from, and I got every one I wanted."
It is not only out-of-state campuses that are romancing disaffected California high school graduates. At least one private college in the state, the University of the Pacific, has lately rented billboards near its Stockton campus that promise graduation in four years. "It's causing some people to look at us who might not have," said Doyle Minden, a university spokesman.
The tuition of Californians is helping to prop the sagging finances at out-of-state universities. "We have become a revenue stream for other states with fiscal problems," said Joni Finney, the associate director of the California Higher Education Policy Center, a San Jose research organization.
 
Cashing In on California Woes
 So vigorous was the recruiting at Colorado that more than half of last year's entering class was from out of state, with 22 percent coming from California, up from 15 percent in 1988. The Legislature, alarmed that a tax-supported university would admit so few natives, cracked down, limiting out-of-state students. So this year's freshman class has a slim majority from Colorado and only 12 percent from California.
Most admissions officers are loath to admit that they are cashing in on California's woes, but not Larry Mason, director of admissions at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where the number of entering Californians tripled in just a year: to 971 in the 1993-94 year from 301 in 1992, including transfers as well as freshmen. "It's a sad situation that we've grown because of somebody else's tragedy, but it's a great market," he said.
In addition to tuition, California students bring four years of spending money to Eugene, Ore., Tucson, Ariz., Boulder, Colo., and other points north and east. "We're talking thousands here," said Andrea Gray, the registrar at Campolinda High School here. "We're talking apartments, gas, taxes they'd pay on purchases, groceries, maybe even a car."
And many will choose to settle where they were educated once they land jobs and marry. "I doubt they'll come back here," said Jean White of her two daughters, who both graduated from Campolindo High School. Lori is a freshman at Colorado and Kimberly a junior at Oregon, and both are glad to be in a "less dog-eat-dog world" than California, Mrs. White said.
Charles Ratliff, the acting deputy director of the California Post-Secondary Education Commission, which advises the Legislature and the Governor, suspects that the leaders of the state university system, in hounding elected officials for more money each budget season, make a bad situation worse.
Invariably, Mr. Ratliff said, the chancellors and campus presidents cry wolf about how many professors will be retired, how many course sections will be scratched, how many departments will die. And their doom-and-gloom scenarios dominate the news during the very months when college decisions are made.
"We've managed to frighten away a lot of young people and their families," Mr. Ratliff said. "It never turns out as bad as we painted it to be. But they don't know that."

HEADLINE: Kodak Asks 275% Tariffs on Some Fuji Imports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company asked the Commerce Department late today to impose steep tariffs on imported paper and chemicals for color-film processing, a step that could result in higher film-processing prices in the United States.
The case is the first major one in which an American company argues that a Japanese competitor should raise its prices here to reflect the steady rise of the Japanese yen against the dollar. Trade experts say that other American companies, including auto makers, are now deciding whether to file similar cases against their Japanese competitors. 
 Kodak charged today that its rival, the Fuji Photo Film Company Ltd. of Japan, had violated a Federal law prohibiting imports from being sold at unfairly low prices, a practice known as dumping.
It argued that Fuji maintains a near-monopoly in Japan, allowing it to cut prices for photographic supplies in America. Kodak further contended that Fuji used its profits to undermine the economic viability of foreign rivals.
Robert T. Hamilton, Kodak's vice president and general manager for imaging in the United States and Canada, said in a statement tonight that "dumping undermines healthy competition because companies cannot continue to compete profitably where unlawful competition is taking place."
Thomas H. Shay, a spokesman for Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., the American subsidiary, said tonight that the company had just learned of the filing and had no immediate reply.
The case involves materials used to turn exposed film into prints, not the film itself.
Its filing represents a remarkable shift by Kodak. Kay R. Whitmore, the company's departing chairman and chief executive, has long been an outspoken defender of free trade, winning praise from fellow corporate executives for a leading role in the push for a North American trade accord, even allowing an aide to run the corporate lobbying campaign for the pact, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But Kodak's board, unhappy with Mr. Whitmore's managerial effectiveness, announced on Aug. 6 that it would replace him as soon as a new executive could be found. Big investors have harshly criticized Mr. Whitmore for his reluctance to take unpopular steps, like laying off thousands of workers, to reduce costs and increase the price of Kodak stock.
Paul C. Allen, a Kodak spokesman, said the company remained committed to liberalized trade. "We don't see this action as being inconsistent with our public stance on free trade," he said.
Mr. Allen also said that while today was the first time Kodak had pursued a dumping case involving a photographic product, a Kodak subsidiary successfully sought dumping duties on some Japanese computer disks in the late 1980's.
Kodak is seeking tariffs of 275 percent on imports of photo printing paper and on chemicals used in developing film both from Japan and the Netherlands, where a Fuji subsidiary has a factory.
According to Government statistics, the United States imported $487.7 million worth of the paper and chemicals from Japan last year and $26.6 million worth from the Netherlands. But Kodak contends that the official figures understate the imports, partly because some color-printing paper may be inaccurately classified as paper for black-and-white prints.
Fuji accounts for virtually all of the imports, said Kimberly E. Ritrievi, a photo industry analyst at Lehman Brothers. Kodak and Fuji dominate the United States market while the third-ranking company, Konica, has a factory in the United States, she said.
 
Calculation Method Is Assailed
 The yen's increase makes it easier for American companies to prevail in dumping cases at the Commerce Department because retail prices in Japan rise when converted to dollars. American dumping law requires the department to calculate an imported product's average retail price both in the United States and abroad, and to impose steep tariffs if the foreign price is higher.
The Japanese Government and many foreign companies have complained that such calculations are heavily biased in favor of financially troubled American producers.
But the dumping law also requires domestic producers to prove to the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, that the low-priced imports are a material cause of the American industry's problems.
In two highly visible cases this year and last, the commission ruled that imported steel and imported mini-vans had not caused material injury to the American makers, throwing out yearlong cases on which the domestic industries had spent millions of dollars in legal fees.
The new Kodak case presents President Clinton with a political problem at the International Trade Commission less than two weeks before the White House is to begin its push for Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The nine-year term of one commissioner, Anne E. Brunsdale, recently expired, and she is unlikely to be reappointed. It was she who cast the deciding vote in the mini-van case and in many of the steel cases.
 
Nominee Must Not Offend
 The domestic steel industry is strenuously lobbying for a replacement who is more likely to vote in favor of troubled American industries. But the White House has been reluctant to nominate someone who might be labeled either a protectionist or a hard-line free-trader.
Federal law allows Ms. Brunsdale to continue serving until a replacement is confirmed by the Senate. White House officials have said they expect a nomination soon.
In making its request for tariffs today, Kodak accused Fuji of selling color photographic paper for less than 20 cents a square foot in the United States while charging slightly more than 60 cents a square foot in Japan.
Kodak and Fuji have been locked in an increasingly nasty marketing battle. After years of cheerful ads showing beautiful photographs, for example, both companies have begun including implicit comparisons to their competitors. According to Advertising Age, a recent Fuji television spot pointed out that children now dress, play games and learn to read in new ways, and asked, "So why are you taking pictures of them with the same old film?"
Matthew J. Diserio, an analyst at Paine Webber, said that "in the first six months of this year, Fuji has clearly upped the competitive stakes of the war by increasing their promotional activity."
American companies do not have to win trade cases to be successful. Japanese car makers raised their prices in the United States after the mini-van case was filed last year and again after Detroit auto makers prepared, but did not file, trade cases at the beginning of this year.

HEADLINE: Man Testifies in Inquiry of Commerce Dept.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 31

 BODY:
A man involved in accusations that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown took $700,000 from the Vietnamese Government appeared today before a Federal grand jury investigating the Commerce Department.
Federal prosecutors refused to discuss the reason for the testimony by the witness, Nguyen Van Hao, or reveal the target of the investigation. 
 But officials close to the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the panel was examining the Commerce Department.
Mr. Brown has denied taking money from Vietnam to lift trade sanctions. He labeled the accusations "absolutely ridiculous" when they surfaced in U.S. News & World Report and The Miami Herald in mid-August.
Mr. Hao was South Vietnam's vice premier for commerce when the government fell to the communists in 1975, and was the only high official allowed to stay on in Vietnam's new government. He now lives in Coral Springs, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale.

HEADLINE: Indians' Casino Money Pumps Up the Volume;
Plan to Annex 8,000 Acres to a Connecticut Reservation Has Some Non-Indians Upset

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn., Aug. 27

 BODY:
This week, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians will open a new building that will double the size of their Foxwoods casino. But even before the expansion, the tribe has become the region's clear center of gravity, with influence that extends from town halls to the State Capitol in Hartford.
In a small town used to small business, the casino's numbers speak for themselves. The Pequots made $26 million in gross profits in July, just on slot machines. By year's end, they expect to be one of the largest employers in the state, with 9,000 workers. Their new building will give the tribe 139,000 square feet of gambling space. They say this will give them the largest gambling operation in the Western Hemisphere, edging out the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which claims to be the largest casino in the world. The power of all that money to buy up land has non-Indian residents worried. 
 Last month, in response to an inquiry from the three nearest towns -- Ledyard, Preston and North Stonington -- the Pequots said their long-term goal was to buy 8,000 acres and annex it to the reservation, more than quintupling the 1,850 acres of Federal trust land in the reservation's original boundary. The new lands would all but encircle the town halls of Ledyard and Preston.
"It's too much," said Ledyard's Mayor, Joseph A. Lozier. But Mr. Lozier, who describes himself as "pro-Indian" and "pro-Indian economic development," concedes that the growing power of the Pequots is not to be denied in the town of 15,000 population. "When you're making $26 million a month, it's, you know, what do you want this week?" Mr. Lozier said.
"I despise it," said one man, a lifelong Ledyard resident in his early 30's, who, like many of the Indians' harshest critics, refused to give his name because, he said, he had many friends with jobs at the casino. "They said they were going to preserve the land," he said. "Does it look like they're preserving the land?"
Despite such sentiments, the Pequots make no apologies for their expansion plans.
"The land is what everything is based on," said Bruce A. Kirchner, a tribe member and a senior vice president at the casino. Mr. Kirchner said the memories of the 1970's, when the tribe was struggling to gain Federal recognition and the reservation was almost lost, are too strong. "In order to be a viable tribe, we want to have sovereignty over the land," he said.
 
The Flash Point
 The immediate flash point in the land issue is a 248-acre parcel of non-reservation property just across Route 2 from the casino, which the tribe has petitioned the Department of the Interior to have annexed to the reservation as Federal trust land. If that happens, over the vehement objections of the towns, the land would be exempted from property taxes and local zoning, as are all Federal reservation lands. The tribe has already filed an application to annex another 1,250 acres that it owns contiguous to the first 248-acre section.
What is at stake is both control and money. With zoning restrictions removed, local government would have no say in how the land is developed. Building permits, inspections and other trappings of local land management would be removed because the property would become part of a sovereign Indian nation. Equally important, the towns could no longer collect property taxes.
The land is clearly growing in value. The Pequots have two hotels, a monorail, a virtual-reality theater, a golf course, a bingo and sporting events center, and a tribal community complex all under construction or about to break ground on their various properties.
This summer, the Pequots offered to make voluntary payments of $1 million a year for five years to each of the three towns, in lieu of property taxes on the annexed lands. But town leaders said they could not accept the arrangement without putting it to the voters, which would slow the annexation process.
In the meantime, the towns don't anticipate any help from the state. Connecticut will receive about $113 million from the tribe this year, under an agreement signed in January with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. guaranteeing the Pequots a monopoly on slot machines in Connecticut. But of that total, Ledyard will get only $183,000.
"Who's really making out here is the state," said Mayor Lozier. "They've got what they want."
Guy R. Martin, a Washington lawyer who is fighting the land annexation on the towns' behalf, said he thinks the root of the anxiety is the fear among non-Indian residents that they will lose their right to have some say in what goes on in their community.
"They're not objecting that the tribe is recognized, et cetera, or the economic development," Mr. Martin said. "What they can't accept is using those vast profits to purchase private land, which by virtue of the trust process is removed from the tax base and all local control. That's what they object to."
 
Local Concerns
 Tribal officials say they understand some local concerns. The crowds -- which on a holiday weekend can triple Ledyard's population to 45,000 -- the traffic, the development, the bustle that never ends, are irritants that residents can and should be concerned about, tribe members say.
But some opponents of the land annexation have gone beyond simple community concerns, some Indians say.
"I can't say it's anything racist," said Mr. Kirchner, the casino vice president. "But reading the paper, some comments made -- that we're not really American, we're foreigners -- were borderline."
Among residents who have received purchase offers from the tribe, however, or those who wish for such offers, emotions are much more complicated than the simple fear of how their town might be changing. The tribe has spent $3.8 million buying single-family homes and lots in Ledyard since early June, according to town land records. Real-estate agents say the tribe has been paying above market prices, then spending even more money to renovate the houses for use by tribe members.
"If the Indians came and made an aggressive offer, would I sell?" said Jane D. Smith. "Probably. Am I panicked? No." Ms. Smith said that at least seven homes in her neighborhood, called Stonehenge, have been purchased since this spring.
 
Pro-Indian but Troubled
 Ms. Smith, like many other non-Indian residents here, described herself as pro-Indian, but troubled by the land controversy.
"I don't think it's right that you have a group of people who don't have to abide by the laws of the state," she said. "I don't agree with having a sovereign nation within a sovereign nation."
Meanwhile, Clifford Allyn, a longtime neighbor to the tribe who rejected a Pequot offer of $10.5 million for his farm, expresses a sort of ostentatious indifference to any and all Indian doings. The casino just down the road? Never been there.
"From what people tell me, it's quite a place," he said.
"I can't say I'll never go," he said. "I might go down when I'm hungry some time at their buffet and eat all I can."

HEADLINE: Facing a Bigger Tax Bite, Will Well-Off Pay or Play?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The burden of the new taxes in the deficit reduction law, President Clinton has tirelessly reassured the nation, will be borne by the rich and near-rich. But will the rich, in fact, hunker down and pay?
During the months of wrangling over the economic package, some conservative economists voiced skepticism about the Administration's revenue estimates. These criticisms, which were widely discounted as a reprise of discredited supply-side arguments of the 1980's, had little effect on Democratic loyalists or mainstream economists. But in the sober light of the morning after, concern that affluent households will elude the tax collector -- or simply choose to work less -- is being taken more seriously by some economists. 
 Indeed, research, notably a study by James Poterba, an M.I.T. economist not known for any supply-side leanings, suggests that affluent households may well behave differently from others.
 "There is so much financial flexibility among high-income folks," worried Mr. Poterba. "Almost all our information about responses to tax changes is based on the behavior" of people with far lower incomes.
If these fears are indeed justified, then the President's bid to narrow the deficit without burdening the middle class is a high-stakes gamble. For if the tax increases fail to generate something close to the projected revenue, the odds that Mr. Clinton will bury the deficit demon before it buries him will be slim.
The great bulk of the revenue is supposed to come from raising the highest tax brackets for couples reporting more than $135,000. When the extension of the Medicare tax is added to the bracket rises, those reporting incomes exceeding $250,000 will pay 41 cents of tax on their last dollar earned -- up from 31 cents.
Most financial experts agree this increase of 10 percentage points will inspire efforts to avoid taxes. Indeed, the Administration's revenue estimates, based on computer simulations by the Treasury Department and Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, take unspecified shifts in investment behavior into account. But from the beginning of the budget debate some analysts have contended that these estimates woefully underestimated the capacity of the well-off to roll with the punches.
 While the pickings in tax shelters are much slimmer than they were before the Tax Reform Act of 1986, high-income families can still reduce their tax liability in a variety of legal ways -- everything from borrowing against their houses to increasing gifts to charity to socking away more cash in pension accounts. What is often not taken seriously enough, suggests John Taylor, a Stanford University economist who advised President George Bush and has never been identified with the hard-line supply-siders, is that they can also work less.
One spouse in a two-earner family, Mr. Taylor notes, might be induced to stay home with a new baby. Or a 60-year-old executive might decide to take early retirement. Or the proprietor of a medium-size family business might choose to put expansion plans on hold and enjoy the weekends.
This is guesswork. But Martin S. Feldstein, an economist at Harvard University who was President Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, and Daniel Feenberg of the National Bureau of Economic Research used a computer model to make it educated guesswork -- and with some political effect during the debate on the Clinton deficit bill. They simulated the response of high-income households to increased tax rates in 1993, assuming that it would mirror the response to lowering rates in 1982 to 1984. Their result: an income tax gain of just $3.7 billion for 1993, a number they broadcast before the Congressional vote as evidence of the President's folly in trying to soak the rich.
 Not everyone was impressed. For example, Jane Gravell, a senior specialist at the Congressional Research Service, contends that the Feldstein-Feenburg simulations are no more accurate than the assumptions that buttress them. The numbers used by the two economists, she said, are "not a reasonable basis for estimation" because they do not take into account myriad other economic changes in the early 1980's that led wealthy taxpayers to report more income.
Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas agrees. "No labor economist thinks work incentives are an issue," he said. "You can just as well argue the rich will work harder" to maintain their after-tax purchasing power.
But a recent analysis of the response to the 1986 tax overhaul by Mr. Poterba of M.I.T. and Mr. Feenberg of the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that the last word on the subject has yet to be written.
 
Factors Other Than Taxes
 The 1986 law cut the highest tax bracket from 50 percent to 28 percent, reducing the incentives of the wealthy to avoid taxation. The two economists examined the impact on the top one-half of 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with incomes of $280,000 or more in today's dollars. They found that even after excluding gains from the sale of assets the share of national income reported by this elite group leaped from just over 6 percent in the years 1983 to 1986 to just under 10 percent in 1988.
 As Ms. Gravell pointed out, factors other than taxes -- everything from the recovery from the recession to the diverging fortunes of skilled and unskilled workers -- played a role in the redistribution of income in the 1980's. But the post-1986 surge in the reported noncapital gains earnings of the very affluent cannot easily be explained away.
It may be related to greater work effort by the affluent, or by greater willingness to declare earnings as taxable income. Either way, though, Mr. Poterba says, "incentives played an important role in measured income changes after 1986."
Also, the restructuring of the economy has tempered the demand for high-income professionals ranging from lawyers to investment bankers to medical specialists. That suggests when the going gets tough, the tough are less likely to respond to higher tax rates by going on vacation.
But as Mr. Poterba points out, this latter point cuts both ways. The success of the deficit reduction measures turns as much on the ability as on the willingness of the affluent to pay more tax: if the share of income of this economic elite falls in the next five years, tax revenues from the group are likely to fall short of the target.
Deficit reduction in the 1990's is a high-wire act: a single stumble could produce a fatal fall. But that reality -- and the fact that his predecessors can make no claim to surefootedness -- must be modest comfort to a President who would prefer not to be remembered as the leader who lost the struggle for fiscal sanity.

HEADLINE: Ex-Presidents Invited to Help Promote the Trade Agreement

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Stung by complaints that it has moved too slowly in assembling a sales campaign on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration has invited the five surviving former Presidents to come to Washington for a bipartisan pitch on Sept. 14.
Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Richard M. Nixon have all been asked to take part, and Mr. Carter and Mr. Ford have expressed interest in attending, aides said. Mr. Nixon, who has established what one aide described as warm relations with the Clinton White House, is said to at least be giving the idea some thought. 
 But the idea of lobbying on behalf of a free trade agreement that is obscure to many Americans has apparently not proved a lure to Mr. Reagan. An aide said he had no plans to travel to Washington for the event.
"It is unlikely given his busy schedule that he would come to Washington for a photo op," said an aide to Mr. Reagan, who lives in California. It is unclear whether Mr. Bush will attend.
Mr. Clinton has spent much time bashing the economic initiatives of the Reagan Administration, and Mr. Reagan responded in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Aug. 3 criticizing Mr. Clinton's economic plan.
Clinton Administration officials hope they can get at least a few of the ex-Presidents to Washington to speak up for the trade agreement, which each has said at different times that he supports.
"This is in the realm of possibility," one White House official said.
Another Administration official said: "I think they want to be supportive of this. And we certainly appreciate their support and counsel."
Mr. Clinton is facing an uphill battle in gaining approval for the trade agreement, which has enemies in organized labor and in Congress. In addition, Ross Perot, the independent candidate for President in 1992, has published a book entitled: "Save Your Job, Save Our Country. Why Nafta Must Be Stopped -- Now!"
In the past, the five former Presidents have gathered for ceremonies but not on behalf of legislation. In 1991, they all attended the dedication of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
The President predicted passage of the despite a Democrat's warning that up to three-fourths of House Democrats opposed the pact.
"I think in the end my position will prevail," Mr. Clinton said today before a briefing on flood-relief efforts.
The President, fresh from an 11-day vacation, was answering a warning from Representative David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, who said that up to three-fourths the Democratic caucus in the House is opposed to this treaty.
But among the opponents are the second and third-ranked Democrats in the House, the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and Representative Bonior, the majority whip.
Most Republicans support the pact, which was negotiated during the Bush Administration.
The pact would lower tariffs and remove other trade restrictions among the United States, Mexico and Canada.

HEADLINE: Jury Gives Litton $1.2 Billion In Honeywell Patent Dispute

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 31

 BODY:
A Federal jury here awarded Litton Industries $1.2 billion in damages today after finding that Honeywell Inc. had infringed a Litton patent covering certain airplane navigation systems.
While the jury verdict is a setback for Honeywell, which had argued that Litton's patent was invalid, the 11-week-old case is not yet resolved. 
 Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer of the United States District Court for Central California is continuing to hear arguments in the case and will decide whether to accept or modify the jury's verdict. A final ruling is expected in the next week.
The judge ordered jurors not to discuss the case as she conducted a hearing late this afternoon to consider Honeywell's claim that Litton's patent was improperly obtained through what Honeywell called "inequitable conduct."
Shares of Litton and Honeywell were halted in trading on the New York Stock Exchange this afternoon before the jury's verdict was announced. Trading never resumed. Honeywell was up 87.5 cents, to $38.875, while Litton gained $1, to $66.50.
Honeywell was cautious about the case's outcome. "Obviously, I am not happy with the verdict, but we think that it's way too premature to say that anyone has won or lost," Edward D. Grayson, Honeywell's vice president and general counsel, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Grayson said Honeywell would continue to present evidence that he said could change the outcome of the case. He declined to elaborate.
Norman L. Roberts, Litton's senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement: "We have invested significant funds in the development and production of the Litton technology which the company has every intention to protect. We believe that the jury's verdict was clearly justified by the facts presented in the litigation."
The patent involves a process to coat mirrors used in ring laser gyroscopes, which are the principal element in airplane navigation systems. The mirrors increase the reliability and life span of the gyroscopes.
Honeywell, a Minneapolis-based maker of automation and control systems, invented the ring laser gyroscope in the 1960's. Litton received its first patent for an ion-beam process to coat mirrors in 1978.
Litton and Honeywell are the two principal players in the $400 million market for ring laser gyroscopes. Honeywell controls the commercial side of the market, while Litton dominates the military portion.
Litton, a major military contractor based in Beverly Hills, Calif., filed the lawsuit in March 1990, accusing Honeywell of infringing its ion-beam process. It also argued that Honeywell had violated antitrust law by trying to monopolize markets for ring laser gyroscopes.
Honeywell filed a counterclaim in December 1990 accusing Litton of trying to monopolize the market for navigational systems and of interfering with Honeywell's relationship with suppliers.
 
Questions for the Jury
 The jury was asked to determine if Litton's patent was valid, whether Honeywell's process infringed that patent, and what damages, if any, should be awarded.
Lawyers who have seen the jury's verdict said that it found that Honeywell intentionally induced a Litton licensee to breach its agreement with Litton and affiliate with Honeywell. The jury decided that Honeywell prevented Litton from obtaining the full economic benefit of its patent, the lawyers said.
Litton had licensed Ojay Research Inc. to use Litton's ion-beam coating technique but prohibited the company from selling mirrors that would be used in high-powered lasers, the lawyers said. Honeywell convinced Ojay to sell it mirrors that were later used in its ring laser gyroscopes, thereby competing with Litton, they said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Health Plan Aims To Cover Periodic Checkups

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will ask Congress to include periodic physical examinations, now available to only about one-third of conventional health insurance customers, as part of its health care package, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
For about half of all adult Americans, who now pay the full cost of regular physicals if they have them, this would be an important new benefit in the plan President Clinton is to propose next month. 
 Details of the proposal have not been settled within the Administration, including how frequently examinations would be provided, what they would cover and whether they would be introduced gradually or at once.
Those decisions will affect the overall costs of the benefit, which various audits commissioned by the Administration have put at $50 to $100 a year per person. This would amount to an additional national health care cost of $6 billion to $12 billion per year.
 
Support in Congress
 Congress may alter whatever the Administration proposes, but the basic idea is likely to command considerable support on Capitol Hill. For example, Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, regularly reminds his constituents in Washington State that the failure of most insurance policies to cover routine physicals makes it harder "to get people to take care of themselves."
Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said today: "The insurance industry has neglected this aspect of health care for too long. Preventing illnesses is far less costly than treating them. Coverage of preventive services is the stitch in time that can save billions."
About 35 percent of the 75 million Americans with conventional health insurance plans, which reimburse customers for most of their medical bills, are now covered for routine physicals, said Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America. He said that percentage was increasing as a result of public demand.
He said coverage of regular examinations was much more frequent or even customary among people enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans. He said the benefit was available at almost all health maintenance organizations and in about half of preferred provider plans, in which consumers choose from a list of doctors hired by the insurer.
Major employers are especially likely to cover physical examinations. A study of 545 major companies' benefit plans showed that 66 percent of them offered employees periodic examinations, said Michael Langan, vice president of Towers Perrin, an employee benefits consulting firm with headquarters in New York City.
 
A Shift in Emphasis
 Both Mr. Coorsh and Mr. Langan said health insurance plans had been slow to include physical examinations and other preventive services because the original purpose of such insurance was to protect against catastrophic expenses. But now, Mr. Coorsh said, "people are asking more than that" and the association recommends providing more preventive care, including regular examinations.
A major decision the Administration has not yet made is how frequently routine examinations should be included in the basic coverage that it wants all Americans to have. Various Federal recommendations in recent years have called for examinations every three years from late childhood until the age of 40, every two or three years until 65 and every year afterward.
How frequently the examinations are provided will have a significant effect on the cost of the health care program, although the costs in any case are uncertain.
The wide range of cost estimates received by the Administration assumes that examinations are provided regularly, but not each year.
Another unsettled question is whether benefits for physical examinations should be provided as soon as the program takes effect or should be gradually introduced. The Administration is considering guaranteeing examinations first for children and only later for adults.
There is no unanimity about the cost-effectiveness of various routine health examinations, and Administration officials say they are concerned about the cost of frequent, possibly expensive tests that may detect rare medical conditions.
 
A Healthier Work Force
 But officials say that a suitable level of preventive care, including examinations, would also produce the economic benefit of a healthier work force.
They also contend that a greater emphasis on prevention can change the "mindset of the health care system," as one official who asked not to be identified put it today, turning it away from expensive technology and an overemphasis on specialization.
Some of the greatest benefits of regular physical examinations are virtually cost-free, she said. It is possible to calculate the cost of a blood-pressure test or a urinalysis, she said, but the accompanying few minutes a doctor spends urging patients to give up smoking can be even more valuable to public health, even if only one patient in 50 is swayed.

Trying to Program Common Sense

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
Seated in front of a powerful personal computer here at the Microsoft Corporation, Stephen Richardson, a linguist, types one of those kinds of sentences that for decades have tied the smartest computing machines in knots: "The spaceship photographed Seattle, flying to Mars."
How is the computer to infer that it is the spaceship and not the city of Seattle that is on its way to the Red Planet? Without the vast storehouse of common-sense knowledge possessed by any child, today's computers are clueless about such apparently obvious relationships. 
 But future computers may not be so ignorant if the Microsoft team, and researchers at other corporate and university labs, succeed in teaching machines a little common sense.
 
New Use for Dictionaries
 Mr. Richardson is working with a small group of linguists and computer scientists here to build software tools that can automatically extract those obvious relationships -- what researchers call semantic information -- from standard dictionaries.
"We have been very surprised at how much of what people refer to as 'common sense' is found" through the dictionary approach, Mr. Richardson said. It is possible, for example, to derive the fact that a foot has five toes from the semantic information generated by their software, he said.
They believe it possible to tease enough information first from dictionaries, then encyclopedias and finally other texts like newspapers, magazines and novels, to provide the foundation for intelligent systems.
The resulting web of information will be organized in structured data bases of word relationships, perhaps permitting machines for the first time to understand and use language the way humans do.
Such systems, capable of understanding what researchers call natural language, would have a profound impact on society. They would make possible systems for recognizing speech and handwriting as well as systems that could respond to complex typed queries.
 
Impact on Jobs
 Indeed, social scientists say that natural-language understanding, if it is perfected, will have a far-reaching impact on employment. The technology holds out the potential for replacing people now doing service jobs conducted by telephone, like telephone operators and airline reservations agents.
Microsoft hopes that some simple products based on the technology may emerge within a few years. "This will make possible the first real grammar checker," said Chris Peters, the general manager of the Microsoft Word line of products, referring to software programs that check prose for grammatical errors. "None of them work well today."
To be sure, imposing research challenges remain. After decades of work, linguists acknowledge that there are vast gaps in the knowledge that computers will need for understanding natural language. But promising results from work with electronic dictionaries has generated new enthusiasm in a field that many computer scientists thought had reached a dead end in the mid-1980's.
"On-line dictionaries look like they're the best candidate to be the resource that is needed to break that terrible bottleneck of knowledge acquisition," said Karen Jensen, a computational linguist and the leader of the Microsoft team.
Ms. Jensen's group at Microsoft has taken the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, available on computer tape, and analyzed 75,000 of its definitions and phrases. The process focuses on 45,000 nouns and verbs, and each run-through takes about 11 hours to generate about 150,000 relationships between words.
The most widely publicized effort to build such a real-world information base has been Cyc, a project begun in 1984 at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in Austin, Tex., and led by Douglas Lenat, a computer scientist.
The project, whose name is short for encyclopedia, involves trying to give a computer common sense by feeding it millions of rules and assertions that people do not think twice about -- such truths as "a child is never older than its parents" or "people usually cannot see through walls."
 
Japanese Efforts
 In Japan, the Government is investing as much as $100 million in developing specialized computer dictionaries to aid in speech recognition and computer translation projects.
Also, a structured knowledge base, called Wordnet, based on analyzing dictionary definitions, has been created by a Princeton University group led by George Miller, a cognitive scientist. Wordnet is now widely used by language researchers.
Despite such efforts, one of the most significant disappointments in the progress of computer science has been the slow headway in perfecting systems that actually understand spoken and written language.
In the 1960's and 1970's the field was characterized by great optimism. "I can remember when people believed that fully automatic machine translation was going to happen by 1962 and that high-quality connected speech recognition would be doable by 1977 or 1978," said Michael Lesk, a computer scientist at Bell Communications Research, a consortium owned by the regional Bell telephone companies.
 
Working on Grammar
 Such hopes were thwarted, but Ms. Jensen's group at Microsoft may now have a significant advantage over earlier efforts. She, Mr. Richardson and a third linguist, George Heidron, came to Microsoft in May 1991 from the International Business Machines Corporation; there, the group had developed a computer-based grammar "parser," a digital schoolmarm that can analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence and identify the role of each word in it.
The group's software development environment, which originally ran on a mainframe computer at I.B.M., has been rewritten from scratch on a personal computer at Microsoft and its scope extended from grammatical to semantic information.
To date, the program works in three modules or stages. During a first pass, the software makes a sketch of the structure of the syntax of the sentence.
In a second pass, the sentence is re-examined, relying on semantic information taken from the data base. For example, the verb "fly" might produce example sentences that permit establishing a relationship between the words "aircraft" and "spaceship," in the case of the sentence "The spaceship photographed Seattle, flying to Mars." That would permit the program to draw the conclusion that a spaceship is more likely to fly than is the city of Seattle.
Finally, during a third stage, the logical form of the sentence is analyzed, deriving such things as active and passive verbs from a set of rules. And the sentence might be revised to make the meaning clear: "Flying to Mars, the spaceship photographed Seattle."
 
Adding Encyclopedias
 While some other researchers say the Microsoft work is promising, they note that lexical knowledge -- the kind of information that can be extracted from written texts -- is only one of several types of information needed to build intelligent systems.
Robert Amsler, a computational linguist who is a pioneer in the field and is now establishing a center for lexical research at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, identifies at least three other kinds of knowledge needed for language understanding: social, economic and experiential knowledge.
He offers an example: Anyone with common sense knows that a locomotive costs millions of dollars, not hundreds, and cannot be bought in a drugstore. But it would be difficult to find any one book, he says, that sets this down as a rule.
Other researchers see similar limitations. "The problem with dictionaries is that they are structured but incomplete," said Judith Klavans, a computational linguist at Columbia University. "There are huge gaps. It may be possible to determine that a foot has five toes, but we may miss the fact that people generally have two arms."

Diagram: "Can Seattle Fly?"
 Hoping to teach computers to understand and use human language, researchers at Microsoft are creating software tools that analyze sentences on the basis of grammar, syntax and semantic clues about the meaning of the words. An early commercial application might be a "grammar checker" program. Here is how it might analyze the following sentence.
 
1. SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS: The program tries to analyze the sentence's syntax, identifying the parts of speech and their relationships to one another. "The spaceship," for example, is identified as the subject of the sentence, and "Seattle" as the direct object of the verb "photographed." But syntactic analysis alone cannot unravel the ambiguity of the participial phrase "flying to Mars."
 
2. SEMANTIC INFORMATION: By consulting semantic clues, like dictionary definitions, the program concludes that a spaceship is more likely to fly than Seattle.
 
3. The computer now understands the sentence. If this was a "grammar checker," the program might suggest this revision to the writer.

HEADLINE: Loan Had a Higher Interest Rate Than Reported, Holtzman Says

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Trying to put to rest questions about a campaign loan that have become an issue in the Comptroller election, the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, has asserted that the loan she accepted from Fleet Bank last year carried a much higher interest rate than election records indicate. But one of her opponents accused her of misrepresenting the facts in the case.
Ms. Holtzman's campaign for United States Senate took out a $450,000 loan from Fleet Bank in late August last year. Ms. Holtzman secured the loan by promising to raise about $680,000 at a fund-raising dinner in early September, and the campaign agreed to repay the debt by Sept. 30. 
 But the campaign's fund-raising fell far short of the goal, bringing in less than $200,000, and Ms. Holtzman, who was the loan's sole guarantor, failed to meet the September deadline. She still owes nearly $240,000.
The loan became the subject of a city investigation because seven months after it was made, Fleet Securities, which is owned by the same Rhode Island financial company, was named an underwriter of city bonds on the recommendation of Ms. Holtzman's deputy, Darcy Bradbury. After the loan was disclosed, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who jointly chooses underwriters with the Comptroller, canceled the firm's designation.
Federal election records show the loan carried a rate of 7 percent, 1 percent above the prime rate. But in recent campaign appearances, Ms. Holtzman has said the loan actually had an interest rate of 18 percent.
"This loan was made at 18 percent interest for the campaign for the United States Senate," Ms. Holtzman said on a radio talk show on Monday morning. "I had to personally guarantee that loan and we have made interest payments and it's a tremendous burden."
Ms. Holtzman has argued that, because the campaign promised to pay a one-time fee of $4,500 to the bank to cover administrative costs, the total cost of the loan would have been equivalent to one month's worth of interest at an annual rate of 18 percent had she repaid it on time.
One of Ms. Holtzman's opponents, Alan G. Hevesi, a Queens Assemblyman, has charged that her argument is specious. "This is a sad attempt by Liz Holtzman to mislead the public about a loan that was clearly not made on usual and customary terms," he said.
Mr. Hevesi's spokesman, Hank Morris, said the question of the loan's ultimate cost is academic, because the Holtzman campaign has never paid the $4,500 fee to the bank. In addition, Mr. Morris said, the one-time fee has not grown over time as the interest has. The interest rate has remained at 7 percent, he said.
Mr. Morris said Ms. Holtzman had purposely twisted the facts. "This is an out and out lie," he said. "The issue is did she lie on her federal election filings when she said the loan was 7 percent, or is she lying now?"
Neither Ms. Holtzman's spokeswoman, Maerwydd McFarland, nor her campaign manager, Edward Miller, returned several telephone calls yesterday.

G.D.P. Data Revised Upward

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In its annual orgy of statistical revision, the Commerce Department said today that the broadest gauge of economic performance was stronger than previously thought during most of George Bush's Presidency.
Growth in the gross domestic product -- total output of goods and services within the country's borders -- is now found to have been about half a percentage point higher in 1990 and 1992. And the shrinkage of the G.D.P. in 1991 was half a point less, meaning that the brief recession that occurred then was less severe than previously portrayed. 
 This batch of economic data, which comes too late for Mr. Bush, was announced as the department also raised its growth figure for this year's spring quarter to a 1.8 percent annual pace from the 1.6 percent estimated in late July.
 
Offsetting Factors
 Higher investment in inventories and bigger purchases by Federal, state and local governments more than offset downward adjustments in the foreign trade sector and in spending on personal consumption.
But even as the revisions today suggested a slightly stronger economy, consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board, a business-sponsored organization in New York, remained at a depressed reading of 59 percent in August despite the passage of the Clinton Administration's budget package.
Most analysts had predicted that the G.D.P. revision for the spring quarter would be downward, but word of a slightly faster pace of activity did little to change economists' expectations for the months ahead.
 
Still Not Cheering
 "I don't see a lot of momentum in these numbers," said Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist for Fidelity Management and Research, the Boston-based mutual fund group. "The strength that is there is in components that are unlikely to continue" to do well, like business equipment and the government sector, he added.
At the White House, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's top economic adviser, said "this is still a modest recovery," although the United States now shows the best growth of any advanced industrial economy for the latest 12 months.
Ms. Tyson and Alan Blinder, another member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said there was nothing in today's report to cause the Administration to change its forecast of growth at about a 3 percent rate for the rest of this year and slightly less thereafter.
One of the most striking adjustments to economic history in today's report was a jump of a full percentage point, to 5.7 percent, in the growth rate for the fourth quarter of 1992.
Government and private analysts attributed this variously to the relief efforts and the rebuilding from last year's hurricanes and to spending by people who, fearing tax increases under Bill Clinton, arranged to receive in 1992 income that they might otherwise have received this year.
 
Difficult to Measure
 There is no way, however, to quantify either factor, said Robert P. Parker, a Commerce Department official, nor can it be determined to what extent the prospect or fact of Mr. Clinton's election and one-party dominance of the Government might have been a psychological force encouraging spending.
More relevant to the election is the fact that the economy is now seen to have been doing better than perceived during the campaign, particularly in the politically crucial second quarter of 1992. Growth for the period is now put at a rate of 2.8 percent, twice as fast as was reported on three occasions last summer when the political conventions were under way.
Yet it is by no means clear that had the data published today been known a year ago Mr. Bush might have been re-elected.
"What this does is increase the puzzle slightly as to why consumers and voters were so pessimistic," said Ray C. Fair, a Yale University economics professor who has studied the relationship between G.D.P. and other economic measures and election outcomes.
Professor Fair erred last year in predicting a Bush victory based on modest growth, low inflation and the advantages of incumbency.
It is likely, suggested Professor Fair, that voters pay greatest attention to such concrete indicators as paychecks and the availability of jobs, rather than gross domestic product.
Mr. Bush's office did not respond to a request today for comment. Previously Republicans have noted with some chagrin that the best quarter for G.D.P. during Mr. Bush's term was one not reported until just after Bill Clinton's inauguration and that reports of unemployment showed a half-point drop in the months after Election Day and no further decline for the balance of 1993's first half.
For full-year 1990, today's figures show, G.D.P. grew 1.2 percent instead of the previously reported eight-tenths of 1 percent, while the 1991 contraction was trimmed to seven-tenths of 1 percent from 1.2 percent. The 1992 rebound was raised to 2.6 percent from 2.1.
 
Inflation Played a Role
 Each of the revisions, which were larger than usual, primarily involved personal spending for goods, business investment in new equipment and spending by government entities, the Commerce Department said. It added that the main factor in these was new inflation estimates for these components.
The recession, the department also found, involved a 1.6 percent decline in G.D.P. from its second-quarter 1990 peak to its first-quarter 1991 trough, less than the 2.2 percent previously reported.
Today's report also showed that corporate profits from current production rose 2.6 percent in the second quarter after falling 1.7 percent in the January-March period. Current-production cash flow -- internal funds available to companies for investment -- rose 1.3 percent after a 2.4 percent fall during the winter.
The Conference Board's confidence reading of 59, typical of a sluggish economy, was not only the same as in July but the same as a year ago when Mr. Bush was still in office.
"The ordinary citizen is still a very insecure and apprehensive person," said Fabian Linden, supervisor of the monthly mail survey of 500 households. "It doesn't take much to make someone decide to repair the refrigerator instead of replacing it, to spend $50 instead of $500."
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1993 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Strong Gains On Positive Economic News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday, buoyed by better-than-expected data on the United States economy for the second quarter.
Gold prices were up in New York and mixed overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $373 a troy ounce, up $2.40 from Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $372.65 a troy ounce, an increase of $2.40. 
 Traders said the dollar jumped after the Commerce Department reported the gross domestic product -- the sum of goods and services produced in the United States -- was up 1.8 percent in the April-June period. That was better than the department's earlier estimate of 1.6 percent.
"It wasn't a tremendous boost, but in the last week or so it feels like the dollar has been stuck in a range," said Matt Porio, a vice president of Chase Manhattan. "This gave it an impetus."
But Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said the dollar only gained a limited amount from the new G.D.P. number, since it was based in part on higher-than-expected Government spending.
"That's not the same thing as definitive growth," she said.
 
Rate Cut Predicted
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 104.18 yen, up 0.28 yen from the close on Monday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 104.70 yen, up from 104.05 yen in Europe on Monday. In New York, the dollar finished at 104.75 yen, up from 103.80 yen.
Traders said the dollar was pushed higher by the purchases early yesterday by the Japanese central bank, which has been trying to keep the yen from skyrocketing against the dollar. In addition, the yen weakened on local news reports in Japan that predicted an interest rate cut, traders said. Such a cut would probably hurt the yen because investments in the Japanese currency would earn less.
The British pound was quoted in London at $1.4870, down from $1.4990 late Monday. Later in New York, the pound changed hands at $1.4915, down from $1.4930 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Fewer Raises Are Expected

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Many American workers will not get raises in the coming year and those who do can expect a small increase as companies try to hold the line on expenses, according to a national survey released yesterday.
Twenty-one percent of United States companies surveyed will not give some employee groups annual raises in 1994, up from 14 percent this year, the consulting firm William M. Mercer Inc. reported. 
 Instead, companies may offer one-time lump sum bonuses amounting to 3.5 percent of a worker's salary because in the long run it costs the company less.
"Raises have a compounding effect on payroll costs, but bonuses of this type do not, a fact that can help employers hold the line on rising expenses," a Mercer partner, Linda Ison, said.
The nationwide annual survey was based on data from 2,700 large employers with a combined payroll of 9.4 million workers.
Employees who survive the latest round of layoffs in any industry can expect a continued shrinkage in the size of average salary increases, projected to be 4.5 percent in 1994, down from 4.6 percent in 1993, according to the Mercer survey. Set against annual inflation projected at just 3 percent, this could provide a 1.5 percent cushion.
According to the survey, raises will tend to be comparatively higher in biotechnology (5.9 percent), computers and software (5.1 percent) and pharmaceuticals (5.1 percent).
On the bottom of the pay increase scale are pulp and paper (3.7 percent), aerospace (3.9 percent) and education (3.7 percent), sectors greatly hurt by the downturn in the economy.

HEADLINE: Letter: On Saudi Arabia;
Riyadh Outlines Its Fiscal Strategy

BYLINE: MOHAMMAD ABALKHAIL; Minister of Finance & Natl. Economy
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Aug. 26, 1993

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Aug. 22-23 front-page articles about the financial position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia:
Saudi Arabia, being an important member of the community of nations and the biggest exporter in the world of such an essential commodity as oil, has always managed its affairs prudently, with full realization of its international responsibilities. We do not expect all to approve of our policies, nor do we look for applause and encouragement from all quarters. However, objective judgments require accurate information. 
 You state that Saudi Arabia has depleted the huge petroleum wealth accumulated since 1973 in the transformation of the country from a tribal society to a modern state and that it had spent a lot on the building of infrastructure and huge educational and health facilities. This is correct, and we feel proud of it.
The strategy of development that Saudi Arabia followed was to direct petroleum revenues to building the physical and social infrastructure of this vast country (about one-fourth the size of the United States) and to harness the participation of the Saudi private sector by Government contracts and credit facilities, and through joint projects with foreign contractors and entrepreneurs.
This also helped the private sector build its financial resources and technical capabilities, and to assume its natural role in the national economy. In the last two decades thousands of foreign companies worked in our country, and thousands of new Saudi companies were established. A host of friendly countries, including the United States, also benefited.
Our budget deficit, of which you paint a lurid picture, is not a secret only now disclosed. It is mentioned in the annual Government budgets, which in recent years have also mentioned that the deficit will be financed by borrowing through domestic bond issues, similar to what all other governments do. There is nothing wrong in this, and I see it as the right policy in most circumstances because government borrowing to finance development is in my view better than imposing taxes and fees.
Most of the public debt in Saudi Arabia is an internal debt, and the amount borrowed abroad is very limited, not exceeding $4.5 billion, which is not a high figure for so large a state. The public debt does not exceed 52 percent of gross domestic product, less than the maximum taken by the European Community for its standard of creditworthiness. You should not forget that Saudi Arabia was confronted in 1991 with a war that cost it, as you state, $55 billion.
That Saudi Arabia produces about eight million barrels of oil daily should in itself be an assurance of continuing inflow of foreign exchange. The Saudi currency, which is fully convertible, is covered fully by a special reserve of hard currencies that exceeds $20 billion. The hard currency assets of Saudi banks exceed $15 billion. Government bond holding of the Saudi banks does not exceed $20 billion. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is among the 10 states holding the largest quotas in the International Monetary Fund.
Saudi banks enjoy a status not enjoyed by many banks in international financial centers. Despite the negative effects of the Persian Gulf war, the banks showed the strength and resilience to realize growth in deposits, assets and profits in 1991 and 1992. The results for the first half of 1993 indicate continuing all-round growth.
The financial position of banks in Saudi Arabia is better than that of most of their counterparts abroad, including American banks, and it is unfair to compare them to U.S. savings and loan institutions.
The Saudi Government has spent nearly $900 billion on a wide net of infrastructure projects and educational, health and other structures, and extended about $70 billion as soft long-term loans to Saudi nationals and companies to support their investment in industry, agriculture, housing and construction of private hospitals and hotels, and also granted about $70 billion as concessional credits and grants to 70 developing countries around the world. Don't you consider that proper use of our resources?

HEADLINE: Ranchers Can't Afford Grazing Fee Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposal to raise public lands grazing fees made by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt will do just the opposite of what he says it will do. 
 For instance, he says that his 130 percent increase in fees won't drive ranchers off the land. It will so greatly increase the costs of doing business that it won't be feasible for ranchers to operate. Ranchers will be forced to sell off their private holdings to developers, who are even now drooling at the prospects.
The open space that has been maintained by ranching families for 100 years or more will be filled with hotels, ranchettes and condos, and will become elite communities with room only for the affluent. Does anyone think that would be an environmentally friendly change?
The proposal will not add $80 billion to the Treasury, but will take money from the Treasury because the grazing fees paid to the Treasury will be dramatically reduced when ranchers are forced out of business. Government costs will also increase because of the need to hire more land managers to replace the stewardship now provided by ranchers.
Mr. Babbitt says his proposal will improve the lands. But Government agency reports show that Western public lands are in better condition today than at any other time in this century. This, along with significant increases in wildlife numbers, can be attributed to the stewardship and land improvements made by ranchers. If you price the stewards off the land, you won't have stewardship.
Mr. Babbitt also maintains that his proposal will eliminate a Government subsidy. Ranchers aren't receiving a Government subsidy now and don't want one in the future. They want to pay a fair price for public lands forage based on sound economic principles.
That's why the livestock industry is supporting legislation introduced by Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Democrat, and Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, that will set into law a fair formula to increase the current fee by 25 percent.
Livestock producers aren't crying wolf. The Babbitt proposal will devastate rural economies and lead to environmental damage in the West just when President Clinton wants to improve both.

HEADLINE: Undocumented Immigrants Avoid U.S. Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Governor's Brave Stand on Illegal Aliens" (Op-Ed, Aug. 23) by Alan C. Nelson, former Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner, is rife with questionable "facts" and "statistics" based on the erroneous premise that our borders are out of control, that undocumented immigrants are pouring into the United States at skyrocketing rates and that an unprecedented number are availing themselves of such social services as welfare. In truth, undocumented immigrants, fearful of being discovered and deported, tend not to use social services. 
 No one has the exact numbers of undocumented immigrants living in the United States because it is a population that tends to avoid contact with government agencies. However, the Bureau of the Census estimates that the undocumented population consists of about 4 million to 5 million people, and grows at a rate of 200,000 to 250,000 a year -- a drop in our population bucket, considering that we are a nation of 260 million.
There is some indication of what social services undocumented immigrants do and do not use, based on Immigration and Naturalization Service surveys of immigrants who were legalized during the "amnesty" program of 1987-88.
At the time of application, less than 1 percent of the legalized immigrant population received general assistance, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, workers compensation and unemployment insurance payments. Less than half of 1 percent obtained food stamps and Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Moreover, before legalization, undocumented immigrants, men and women, worked. Eighty-three percent of the legalized immigrant population participated in the labor force against 77 percent of the general population. For ages 18-64, 94 percent of the legalized population participated in the labor force against 88 percent of the general population.
Men in the legalized immigrant population worked on the average two hours a day more than men in the general population. Legalized immigrant women worked five hours a day more than women in the general population. Thirteen percent of the legalized immigrant population worked more than 40 hours a week and were not paid time and a half. Of this group, 52 percent were men, and 74 percent were women.
These figures make clear that undocumented immigrants are not the burden on our country that Mr. Nelson portrays them as being, nor is illegal immigration so great a problem as he states. To the degree that it is a problem, I agree that responsible steps must be taken to address it; but the proposals of California's Gov. Pete Wilson, as endorsed by Mr. Nelson, are cruel, unnecessary and irresponsible.

California's Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"California Scapegoats" (editorial, Aug. 16) charges Gov. Pete Wilson unfairly with "making immigration a scapegoat." You concede the economic hardship caused by defense layoffs in California. Also, you acknowledge the soundness of Governor Wilson's plea for tamperproof identification cards held by immigrants. In addition, both the Governor and you know that children of even illegal immigrants cannot be denied a public education. That would punish the innocent and run afoul of the Constitution. 
 However, while it is highly unlikely that the Constitution will be amended to deny full citizenship to children born in the United States of illegal immigrants, you are too cavalier in rejecting outright Governor Wilson's proposal. Did the citizenship definition in the 14th Amendment, "all persons born" on United States territory, intend to apply to the progeny of illegal immigrants? Hardly!
Again, although it would be the height of cruelty to deny health assistance to illegal immigrants, you fail to note the huge drain on state resources in California and taxpayer dissatisfaction. Nor with respect to illegals, can Governor Wilson be faulted for not focusing on violations and workplace enforcement. In this case, he may recognize limitations and futility better than you do.
California and other Mexican border states merit additional grants from the Federal Government to deal with an exceptional burden in a national problem.
Neither California nor public officials in those states warrant your characterization of "nativist demagogy."

Close a Bit Weaker in Volatile Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In a volatile day of trading, the bond market ended slightly weaker yesterday with yields rising. Only the price of the 30-year bond managed to eke out a small gain, which pushed its yield down from 6.11 percent Monday to 6.09 percent, just above the 20-year low reached last week.
The report that the economy grew at a revised 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after adjustment for inflation, had little impact, although the economic pace was higher than many forecasters had expected. 
 Since the Commerce Department reported two weeks ago a surprisingly large jump in the June trade deficit, in large part because of declining exports, many forecasters had said growth would slow in the second quarter to close to 1 percent. The initial Government report on the growth of the gross domestic product, which was released a month ago, was 1.6 percent.
The expectation that the second-quarter growth would be slower than initially reported bolstered the view that there was little chance that inflation, now rising at a slower pace than last yrear, would accelerate any time soon. And this view had helped the prices of both the 30-year bonds and shorter-term Treasury securities rally in the last two weeks.
When the new G.D.P. figure was released yesterday morning, the prices of short and intermediate Treasuries did fall. But they recovered to end little changed on the day.
"This is a market that wants to improve," said Nancy Kimmelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. "As soon as it can find an excuse to dismiss what would be negative data it rallies. The data are very much ancient history as far as the bond market is concerned."
Ms. Kimmelman said that investors seemed to be in a state where a selloff in the market was viewed as an opportunity to buy securities at a cheaper price rather than a signal that the recent sharp decline in interest rates was slowing or coming to an end.
 
2d-Quarter Economic Growth
 She noted that while the 1.8 percent pace of economic growth in the second quarter was higher than the roughly 1 percent expected by many forecasters, the overall growth rate of the economy for the first half of the year had not increased very much and was certainly still very sluggish with very slow job growth.
In addition, she said that the new data on the gross domestic product did include a downard revision in final sales in the second quarter, to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent. That number, which excludes the changes in inventories, is a sign that the "underlying strength of the economy" has weakened a bit. The market also got some support because the inflation rate for the seocnd quarter was revised down to 2.3 percent from 3.6 percent..
By late in day in secondary trading, the prices of Treasury notes had seesawed enough to erase most of the losses recorded in the morning. Traders said that the bounce-back during the day was in part a reaction to the fact that the Federal Reserve, as part of its regular monetary operations, had bought billions of dollars worth of Treasury securities. The Fed does this when it has to add reserves to the system to assure that its monetary policy is not tighter than it intends.
The price of the 10-year note was down just 1/32 on the day, with the yield remaining at 5.44 percent. The price has been down almost half a point in morning trade. The price of the two-year Treasury note was down 2/32 as the yield inched up to 3.86 percent, from 3.83 percent Monday.
The yield on the 6.25 percent 30-year bond was down to 6.09 percent, from 6.11 percent the day before. Earlier in the day the price had been up 15/32 in the morning with the yield down to 6.07 percent. As it has recently, the rally in the price of the 30-year bond seems to continue without much regard for whether the economic news is positive or negative.
In the afternoon, the Johnson Redbook survey of chain store sales showed that sales in August, through Saturday, were 1.1 percent below July's. This just added another bit of data to the slow growth outlook.
Trading was heavy in the morning but it may slow some the rest of the week as traders and investors turn their focus to the most important new economic data of the week, the employment numbers for July that will be released by the Labor Department Friday.
Based on the consensus forecast done by Bloomberg Business News, which predicts an increase of 147,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, the data should support the idea that the economy is still sluggish and help keep interest rates as low as they are or push them even lower.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A table in Business Day on Sept. 1, with an article about revisions of second-quarter data on the gross domestic product, reversed the data for current prices and 1987 prices. A corrected table, with final second-quarter revisions announced yesterday, appears today on page D8.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Seeking to Cut Military But Equip It for 2 Regional Wars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
After spending six months reviewing American military needs, the Clinton Administration unveiled a new plan today for cutting the armed forces, which embraces the Bush Administration's basic military doctrine: with the disappearance of a Russian military threat, the United States should be prepared to fight two regional wars at the same time.
The Pentagon plan, which President Clinton approved this week, would shrink the military to 1.4 million troops from 1.7 million over five years by cutting Army divisions, Navy aircraft carriers and Air Force fighter wings. 
 These cuts go somewhat further than those planned by the Bush Administration but do not represent a significant departure in military policy. The White House insists that its new plan amounts to the first post-cold-war military strategy, but it endorses the basic Bush Administration views.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was instrumental in developing the plans of both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, acknowledged as much today when he outlined the plan at a packed Pentagon briefing.
The strategy behind the Clinton plan is quite similar to the Bush plan, said General Powell, who will retire at the end of the month. "And it ought to be quite similar because the world looks the same to us."
In one significant departure, the new plan shows a willingness to protect the military industrial base in contrast to the Bush Administration's strict adherence to free market forces. [News analysis, page A18.]
In strictly military terms, one contentious issue is whether the forces provided for in the Clinton plan are sufficient to carry out its strategy, called "win win," of fighting two nearly simultaneous nonnuclear conflicts.
 
Overall Question
 Defense Secretary Les Aspin and General Powell said that to carry out the Bush Administration's two-war strategy with fewer forces, the Clinton Administration planned to store enough weapons and equipment for several Army brigades at several overseas locations for use in the Persian Gulf or in a conflict in Korea, to spend more money on precision-guided missiles and bombs and to buy additional ships for transporting troops and equipment.
But some former Pentagon officials say the Clinton Administration may be hard pressed to carry out the two-war strategy.
"It was tough enough to carry out the win-win strategy with the forces envisioned by the Bush Administration," said Zalmay Khalilzad, the head of Pentagon's office of policy planning in the Bush Administration and an analyst with the Rand Corporation. "The question is can they really do win-win with a reduced forced structure."
In the early stages of their deliberations, Clinton Administration officials looked at making even deeper cuts. Under one plan considered by the Pentagon the military would prepare to win one war at a time. Dubbed "win hold win," the plan called for first fighting and winning one war while holding the line in the other.
But reports that the Pentagon was considering such a change in strategy created some uneasiness in South Korea, where officials feared it would mean that the United States was backing away from its longstanding military commitments. The idea was criticized by American lawmakers as well.
After extensive review, the Clinton Administration embraced a win-win strategy, meaning the United States would keep enough troops and equipment ready to fight and prevail in conflicts that begin nearly at the same time. This was the same strategy that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney endorsed as part of the Bush Administration's regional military strategy before he left office.
 
Taking a Chance
 Both the Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration decided to take the chance that two conflicts would not start at exactly the same time. In doing so they held down the need for buying many more costly transport ships and cargo planes.
To justify the two-war strategy, General Powell said the United States needed to be able to fight a war in the Persian Gulf to defend the oil supply while also guarding against a North Korean attack against South Korea, or vice versa. If the United States had the ability to fight only one war at a time, the reasoning goes, adversaries might be tempted to exploit a crisis. If the United States was fighting a war against Iran, for example, North Korea might see it as a time to strike.
One assumption of the new strategy is that the United States may not be able to count on many allies and may have to fight virtually alone. "Our forces must be sized and structured to preserve the flexibility and the capability to act unilaterally, should we chose to do so," Mr. Aspin said in a paper released today.
Another key assumption is that American forces will seek to avoid the use of nuclear weapons, relying instead on high-technology and well-trained conventional forces.
 
Attention to Trouble Spots
 Reflecting its new strategy and its desire to maintain a military presence near trouble spots around the world, the Clinton Administration's cuts in the Navy and the Marines are relatively modest.
It plans to cut the Navy from 14 to 12 aircraft carriers. One carrier were be used for training and occasional patrols. The Bush Administration has planned a force of 12 carriers.
The Clinton Administration planned to reduce the Marine Corps by a smaller amount than the Bush Administration. The Clinton Administration will cut the corps from the current size of 180,000 to 174,000 instead of the force of 159,000 proposed by the Bush Administration.
The Air Force will be reduced to 20 tactical fighter wings, compared with the 24 wings the Bush Administration planned to keep.
The Army, whose role had declined after the dissipation of the Soviet threat, will be reduced to 10 active divisions, 2 fewer than the Bush Administration had planned.
 
More Use of Reserves
 But the Clinton Administration is planning to make greater use of Army reserve units. After the Persian Gulf war, the Bush Administration was disappointed by the failure of the Army to field reserve brigades for possible combat and wanted to cut the Army reserves. But the Congress, yielding to intensive lobbying by reservists, opposed deep cuts.
In a bow to political reality and in an effort to buttress its two-war strategy, the Clinton Administration plans to improve the training of 15 reserve brigades so they can be called up for combat.
Under the Clinton plan, only two weapons programs would be canceled: the AFX radar-evading bomber the Navy has been seeking and the Air Force's multirole fighter. Both the Navy and the Air Force, however, won the Administration's backing for their most-wanted programs. The Navy will field a new version of the FA-18 while the Air Force will field new F-22 fighters.
The Clinton plan disclosed today costs about $13 billion more than the $1.2 trillion than the Administration plans to spend on the military over the next five years, according to Administration officials. Military officials have said they are seeking to make offsetting cuts and it is still unclear how much additional money the Pentagon will seek.
Military experts and Pentagon officials acknowledged that are broad parallels between the forces proposed by the Clinton and Bush Administration.
 
'An Underlying Consensus'

"The similarities between the Secretary Aspin's findings and the Bush Administration's military plans suggest an underlying consensus on the forces that are required to deal with the threats of the 1990's," said Loren Thompson, the deputy director of the national security studies program at Georgetown University.
Like the Bush Administration's, the Clinton Administration plan avoids sweeping changes in the missions of the military services that Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Mr. Clinton, when he was a candidate, suggested were needed.
Still, there are some important differences between the Bush and Clinton approaches. The Clinton Administration, for example, has emphasized the development of ground based anti-missile defenses against Scud-type surface-to-surface missiles instead of the development of space-based anti-missile systems. And Clinton Administration has essentially written off the possiblity that Moscow might recreate its conventional military threat to the West and is placing greater emphasis preparing for peacekeeping operations.
Precisely because of its similarities with the Bush plan, however, the Clinton plan was criticized today by some lawmakers who said it did not cut enough programs.
"The Pentagon only canceled two weapons program today," said Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Government Operations subcommittee on national security. "It's a little bit like, 'Honey, I shrunk the military.' Somehow, you feel it's not quite real," he said in a statement.
And the Defense Budget Project, a research group that is often critical of the Pentagon, also challenged the Clinton plan, saying deeper cuts were needed.
"Like the Bush base force plan, the Clinton plan tries to pack too much force structure into too small a budget," it said. "Over the long term, the Defense Department will not be able to maintain a force of 1.4 million personnel within the projected Clinton defense budgets without sacrificing readiness or modernization."


GRAPHIC: The Defense Department unveiled long-range plans yesterday built around the goal of being able to fight two-large nonnuclear regional conflicts at the same time. The Bush Administration had developed a similar long-range plan, which in general called for slightly higher levels of forces.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: 2 Airlines Struggle to Revive Their Fortunes;
Delta May Start Low-Cost Carrier

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Vowing to return Delta Air Lines to profitability as "a lean, tough competitor," Ronald W. Allen, the carrier's chairman and president, said yesterday in New York that the financially troubled company was committed to cutting costs further and was considering starting a low-cost no-frills airline.
Delta's chief executive added that the carrier could furlough as many as 600 pilots in the next few months, including 250 pilots scheduled to be laid off by the end of next month. 
 They are the first layoffs since 1957, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta said. The pilots' union has been unwilling to accept the 5 percent pay cuts that other Delta employees have taken, so the carrier has resorted to layoffs.
 
 
Early Retirement Offer
 Delta, which lost about $540 million last year on $1.78 billion in revenue, has trimmed its work force 7.7 percent, or about 6,200 jobs, since June 1992, mostly by attrition or by ending part-time positions. The carrier also recently offered early retirement to 3,000 of its remaining 73,400 employees.
In yesterday's wide-ranging hour-long news conference, Mr. Allen said the carrier had lowered costs, increased productivity and streamlined every division, in part by eliminating "layers of management."
Asked whether Delta would consider starting a low-cost airline, Mr. Allen said it was an option, but did not elaborate. "We're going to do what is necessary to be competitive," he said. "We haven't ruled out anything."
American and United have suggested the possibility of operating low-cost subsidiaries to compete with Southwest Airlines and with several other airlines that have lowered labor costs through employee concessions or, in the case of Continental Airlines, after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. United's pilots, however, are opposed to any effort to start a nonunion carrier.
Mr. Allen also cited "dramatic improvement" in traffic and revenue on Delta's trans-Atlantic operations. Purchased from Pan Am in 1991 for more than $500 million, the routes have lost $750 million in the last 18 months. Earlier this year Delta eliminated its unprofitable route between Newark and Frankfurt; it will soon end its flights between Miami and Frankfurt, and at the end of the summer it will determine whether to end other unprofitable routes.
"We won't radically restructure our routes," said Robert W. Coggin, Delta's senior vice president of marketing, "we'll just do some refining." One way, he said, would be to add stops to what are now nonstop flights on some routes.
Mr. Allen implied that Delta's European operation would show a profit in the latter part of this year, but he declined to be specific. Likewise, he declared he was "not going to speculate" about future earnings.
Delta's trans-Atlantic woes stemmed from a combination of events, Mr. Allen said, beginning with the failure of the United States economy to improve in 1992, as widely predicted, and the fact that "the European economy went into the tank, particularly Germany." Delta's major European hub is at Frankfurt, from which the carrier flies to nine other European countries.
 
 
'Not Enough Lines'
 But the 21 A310 Airbus Industrie airplanes that came with the Pan Am sale proved to be "inadequate," Mr. Allen said, and would be replaced this year. In addition, the reservations system in Europe did not measure up. "People just couldn't get through to us," he said. "There were not enough lines."
Moreover, although Delta is the United States carrier with the most trans-Atlantic flights -- its 293 weekly trans-Atlantic flights include 115 nonstop departures from Kennedy International Airport -- Delta officials say that it suffers to this day from the image that it is primarily a North American carrier. In contrast, the Pan Am name was known around the world.
Meanwhile, Delta continues to look for computer code-sharing alliances for reservations, Mr. Allen said, in addition to its longstanding ones with Singapore Airlines and Swissair. It recently announced such alliances with Brazil's Varig Airlines and Aeromexico, but they are not yet approved.
Mr. Allen said he did not foresee any change in Delta's alliance with Swissair, which was given permission by the Swiss Government yesterday to enter into formal talks with its European rivals, Austrian Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System, for what is eventually expected to become a joint holding company.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Delta closed at $52.625 a share, down $1.375.

HEADLINE: Timber Country Sees a Vacation Land

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ANGELES, Wash., Aug. 31

 BODY:
When Senator Patty Murray ventured into the heart of timber country here today, she expected something less than the customary courtesy given legislators on home-state tours. As the only Senator from the Pacific Northwest to support President Clinton's broad plan to reduce logging on Federal land, Ms. Murray was prepared for jeers and worse.
To her surprise, she found a community trying to transform itself from one based on cutting down giant trees to one where visitors would come to spend money to see the standing forest and nearby sea life. 
 Instead of the usual, crudely drawn posters of endangered birds in gun sights, she found a new residential road named "Spotted Owl Lane." She also heard from dozens of community leaders here in the far northwest corner of the continental United States who are seeking a piece of the new Federal aid program that President Clinton is seeking to help areas hard hit by logging restrictions. People here envisioned using some of the money for retraining programs and building docks for cruise ships, Indian cultural centers and industrial parks.
There was also at least one encounter with an angry logger, Larry Mason of the timber town of Forks, who said the President's plan would put him out of business. And several others in the forest products industry asked what exactly they could be retrained to do.
 
Plan to Reduce Logging
 In seeking to save salmon streams and threatened species, the Clinton plan would reduce logging on Federal forests here to one-fourth of the highest level of the mid-1980's. It seeks to provide $1.2 billion in economic aid over five years to ease the transition. Mr. Clinton estimates the plan would put 6,000 people out of work, while the timber industry says the number would be 10 times that number.
Ms. Murray, a Democrat elected last year as an underdog, did not try to revisit the old ground of environment versus jobs. That fight, she told people here, is largely over. It would be a lie, she said later, to encourage people to believe they could continue logging at anything near past levels. "If we continue in the same old battle lines as the past, you people will be the losers," she said.
It was the Federal Government that created the modern economy on the Olympic Peninsula when it began to open up vast tracts of land for logging in the 1950's. What remained untouched was the scenic centerpiece of the peninsula, the one-million-acre Olympic National Park. As logging has declined, tourism has boomed, with the park's wild seashore and misted rain forest now drawing more than three million visitors a year.
Until now, there have been very few civic efforts to make money from tourists. The Port Angeles waterfront, framed by two pulp mills, is clogged with huge logs that were cut from private land and await export to Asia. A visitor is hard pressed to find even a small stretch of public beach amid the horizontal forest of export logs.
But the port's operators are drawing up plans to learn from Victoria, British Columbia, their neighbor across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is a prosperous cultural, tourism and government center.
The community college here, its enrollment swelled by unemployed loggers, asked for assistance to help design retraining programs. The Forest Service is about to embark on a major effort to restore streams damaged by years of excessive logging. But no one is exactly sure how it will be conducted.
 
Proposed Indian Center
 "We used to take logs out of streams, and now we're going to be spending a lot of money putting logs back into streams," said Jim Walton, an educator at Peninsula College, a two-year institution. "What are we supposed to teach?"
To the west of here, the Lower Elwha Indian tribe wants to build a longhouse, a traditional coastal Indian center, on the sand pit bordering the harbor. Farther west, the Makah Indians at Neah Bay presented Ms. Murray with a plan to transform an abandoned Air Force base into a 230-room retreat on the wild Pacific shore.
Inside the park, Ms. Murray visited a dam on the Elwha River that environmentalists want torn down. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recently came out for removing the dam, saying it would help to restore a run of chinook salmon used to draw hundreds of fishermen to this area.
Even Forks, long evoked by politicians and in many news reports as the epitome of a depressed timber town, is showing signs of life. Although the unemployment rate has been 19 percent for nearly two years, the town now wants to open an industrial center, where timber would processed into high-value goods from violins to wicker chairs.
"The town is not folding up and dying," said Sandra Kint, a Forks community leader who met with Senator Murray. "A lot of people are stressed, but there is a new infusion of ideas. We are trying to be visionary while still addressing the immediate concern of what you do about the guy who can't make his mortgage payment next month."
 
Approval of Aid Expected
 The dawning new economy here cannot go anywhere without Federal help, community leaders say. This fall, Congress is expected pass most of the President's request for the first year in aid money, about $280 million for the entire Northwest. Officials from the Olympic Peninsula have requested about 10 percent of that amount.
The challenge for Mr. Clinton and the handful of national legislators from the West who have backed him on the timber plan, Ms. Murray said, is to deliver on the promise that one successful way of life can be exchanged for another. "The last thing these people want is another empty promise," she said in an interview.
She also had a small personal request, if the peninsula makes a successful transition from its timber economy. "I wouldn't mind someday coming out here and seeing the Patty Murray Bike Path through the forest," she said.

HEADLINE: A Job-Oriented Defense: Protecting the American Work Place

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The Pentagon plans to spend billions over the next five years on weapons that it concedes have as much to do with protecting jobs and technology as with protecting America.
As it confronts the task of shrinking the armed forces in the post-cold war world, the Clinton Administration is taking an approach that combines economics and politics with military necessity. The long-range plan announced today by Defense Secretary Les Aspin would use the huge Pentagon budget to keep alive production lines and specialized military technologies that it fears would otherwise disappear. 
 For example, the Navy already has two Seawolf attack submarines on order, all the Pentagon says it needs for military purposes now. Indeed, the Navy plans to retire older submarines and reduce the total number of attack submarines by 1999 to about 45 from the present 81. But the long-range plan announced today calls for building a third Seawolf, for $2.4 billion, an economic life preserver to eastern Connecticut, where the submarine is built.
Mr. Aspin said the Navy would proceed with the third Seawolf because it would be too costly to close the production line and then restart it in the future when the United States needs new submarines.
 
Bridging a Gap
 The Pentagon knows it will need to start building a more advanced class of submarine around the turn of the century. The question, Mr. Aspin told reporters, is what to do in the meantime.
The alternatives, he said, are to shut down the program and restart it "when you need to build it" or to order a third Seawolf to bridge the gap between the time when the first two are completed and when work on the successor class of submarine would begin.
This concern for America's military industrial base is a significant departure from the Bush Administration's position of allowing free market forces to reign, even in technologies critical to the nation's military might.
Preserving critical technologies in areas like fighter planes, submarines and satellites is part of a broader Administration strategy to deal with the human and technical consequences of a vastly reduced military.
The plan includes easing the transition for communities with military industries, military workers and troops leaving the armed services, as well as encouraging military industries to develop products for commercial markets.
In political terms, it also reflects the Administration's concern for keeping a promise Mr. Clinton made during the campaign, when he endorsed buying additional Seawolf submarines, which are built by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Conn. Even with the third Seawolf, Electric Boat says its employment will shrink to 7,500 workers by 1997 from 17,500 now.
 
New Aircraft Carrier, Too
 Mr. Aspin also said today that the Defense Department would buy a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, built by Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va., which is owned by Tenneco Inc., thus insuring that despite the rapid shrinking of the military industry, Washington can count on one shipyard to build nuclear-powered submarines and another to build aircraft carriers.
The military rationale for the new $3.6 billion carrier is to help the Navy maintain a constant maritime presence around the world. Maintaining jobs and the specialized technology reinforces this need.
"In essence, it's a long-term investment policy," said Richard Bitzinger, a military industry analyst at the Defense Budget Project, a research organization here. "If you lose those niches in the industrial base, you're consigned to being dependent on foreign sources. Except that no one else builds nuclear submarines or aircraft carriers."
Critics of the Clinton Administration's plan, however, argue that the policy is just a Democratic pork barrel project and perpetuates military spending when the country should be making deeper cuts in the Pentagon's budget than the Administration has proposed.
 
Motives Questioned
 "Without any real military justification, the bottom-up review clearly just plans to keep building submarines merely for the United States to be able to keep building submarines," said Joshua Handler, a research analyst with Greenpeace in Washington.
As military budgets shrink and force many contractors to merge or get out of the business, the Pentagon is being forced to abandon its longstanding policy of requiring competition for Pentagon contracts to try to obtain the best prices.
"In certain areas, we are going to find inevitably, as we buy fewer weapons, that we rely on fewer competitors and fewer competing producers, and in some cases we will be down to one producer," a senior Defense Department official told reporters after Mr. Aspin's news conference. "For those very few instances which are defense-unique items, we are going to have to worry about how do we deal with the situation of having one industrial base."
This approach both hurts and helps a company like Newport News Shipbuilding. On the one hand, the Pentagon's decision to buy a new carrier preserves 5,000 to 7,500 jobs and the company's most important future project.
On the other, the Defense Department's decision to insure Electric Boat's survival as the country's sole builder of nuclear submarines appears to foreclose any chance that Newport News could bid on the contract for the third Seawolf.
When reports surfaced in June that the Pentagon would select Electric Boat to build the third Seawolf, Tenneco, in a rare show of pique toward its largest customer, criticized the Pentagon's handling of the matter as short-sighted.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Illegal Aliens In New Light

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Contrary to the images of Chinese boat people and Central American day laborers that dominate the public perception of New York State's illegal immigrants, the three major groups are from Ecuador, Italy and Poland.
The first complete analysis of undocumented immigrants, released yesterday by the City Planning Department, estimates that the illegal population in New York State is the second largest in the country, after California's. 
The analysis, based on a complex formula that used data from border crossings, airports and the census, found that among the 18 million residents of New York are some 490,000 illegal immigrants, with more than 80 percent living in New York City.
The report's profile of the illegal immigrants in New York differs strikingly from the national picture. Whereas Mexicans -- the largest group nationally -- and other Central Americans dominate illegal populations in much of the country, they barely show up in the state statistics. Illegal immigrants in New York are much more diverse, coming predominantly from Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America.
The illegal Ecuadorean, Italian and Polish populations are followed closely, and less surprisingly, by Dominicans, Colombians, Haitians and Jamaicans, the analysis found. But illegal Chinese immigrants do not even make the top 10, and illegal Mexicans are not even in the top 20. In fact, contrary even to the expectations of immigration experts, the typical illegal immigrant in New York is twice as likely to be an Italian who overstayed a travel visa as a Chinese migrant smuggled in by gangsters, the analysis concluded. The state is even home to slightly more illegal Israelis, 13,492, than to illegal Chinese -- 12,655, according to the report.
"The data show that much of the current debate over immigration is based on myths and stereotypes rather than facts and figures," an immigration expert at the American Civil Liberties Union, Lucas Guttentag, said. "I have to say -- Italy! -- now that's news to me."
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has struggled for years to amass reliable estimates about illegal immigrants. This year the agency's statisticians drew on more than 100 million records from 11 years. To estimate how many immigrants slipped undetected across the border, they used the Census and legalization and arrest statistics. To count those who overstayed travel visas, they analyzed departure records from airports and ports.
The agency estimated that there were 3.2 million illegal residents in the United States last fall and estimated that an additional 300,000 arrived in the last year, with as many as 45,000 settling in New York.
 
Criticisms of Newcomers
 At a time when illegal immigrants are under attack for draining the resources of an economically troubled country, advocates for immigrants welcomed the new statistics as fair, moderate appraisals of the illegal population. The figures were released not by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which distributed them just internally, but by a New York City agency.
"This whole anti-immigrant hysteria is not borne out by the statistics," said Patrick Young, director of the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, L.I. "Only about 1.25 percent of the U.S. population is undocumented, and if all the problems of your country are attributable to this minuscule population, then your system's really in trouble."
A majority of illegal immigrants live in California, followed by New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, immigration officials said.
But the proportion of illegal immigrants in California has decreased in the last six years, from 50 to 40 percent of the national total. Similarly, the proportion in New York City has increased, to 15 percent from 10 percent. That is a result of the legalization of illegal immigrants, mostly Mexicans, and mostly California residents, under the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986.
Many experts expect illegal immigrants to follow their legal countrymen in mirrored proportions. So, since very few Italians number among the legal immigrants to New York City, the size of the illegal Italian population -- at an estimated 27,425, the second largest -- caught most experts by surprise. But not totally.
"It's hardly a shock that New York draws Italians, given the fact that Italians are the largest ethnic group in the state," a city demographer, Joseph J. Salvo, said. "And in retrospect it's not that surprising that they are coming illegally, since the legal pathways for them have pretty much dried up."
Most legal immigrants are sponsored by their immediate family members. But most Italians immigrated a few generations ago, and their family ties are too distant for sponsorship.
In contrast, Dominicans, by far the largest legal immigrant population in the city, more easily sponsor their families to join them. The illegal Dominicans, however, may be undercounted in the statistics, as some enter the country through Puerto Rico, posing as Puerto Ricans, Mr. Salvo said.
 
Poles Apparently Melted In
 Presumably, the illegal Ecuadoreans have joined their legal compatriots in Queens, where, as the seventh largest legal immigrant group in the 1980's, they settled mostly in Jackson Heights and Corona.
The illegal Poles seem to have melted into the established Polish communities in Brooklyn, especially Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Borough Park. Polish immigrants were the seventh largest legal immigrant group to the city last year.
The number of illegal Chinese immigrants represents a small fraction of the illegal population in New York City. But, strikingly, New York is home to more than half the illegal Chinese in the country, Mr. Salvo said. In contrast, New York draws just one-fifth of the legal Chinese immigrants. Similarly, New York receives a greater proportion of Korean, Indian, Polish and Israeli illegal immigrants than legal immigrants.
Although their numbers are high, New York receives a smaller proportion of illegal than legal Dominican, Haitian, Honduran and El Salvadoran immigrants.
The statistics director of the I.N.S., Robert Warren, said it was possible that illegal Mexicans in New York City were underrepresented in the numbers. The statistical distribution of immigrants nationwide was based on their patterns of settlement in 1986, as shown in their applications for legalization. Immigration officials did not account for possible changes in migration patterns.

HEADLINE: A Paper Boom in Real Estate Investments

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
A California home builder recently raised a pile of money by selling notes that promised a startlingly high 10.375 percent interest rate with a rating below investment grade. Using the draw of high yield, the home builder collected $155 million, attracting investors to the troubled world of real estate even though the company was already behind or in default on about $143 million in loans -- a fact that was presumably reflected in the low credit rating.
A yield of around 20 percent was reportedly the draw in another real estate deal, this one from Daiwa Securities America, the American arm of the big Japanese brokerage firm. It turned a package of nursing-home mortgages into five classes of securities: three with investment-grade ratings and two with considerably more credit risk. One -- sold privately, and therefore not publicly described -- reportedly yielded around 20 percent. 
 The two deals illustrate a growing trend: high yields are drawing big money into the depressed real estate market -- and especially into securities that promise high returns but carry investment-service ratings that are junk, or below investment grade, or carry no ratings at all.
And the money is coming not just from traditional real estate investors.
"What you have is a marketplace that is obviously chasing yield, and real estate can produce the yield," said Stan Ross, managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, an accounting firm that specializes in real estate. "It's a signal that there is some capital returning to real estate."
Despite their mouth-watering yields, commercial mortgage securities are not for everyone. "These can be fabulous for smart investors, but they could be dangerous for people who don't understand the complexities," said Andrew D. Stone, a senior managing director at Daiwa Securities America, one of the most innovative firms in the business.
Commercial mortgage securities make up one of the fastest-growing markets on Wall Street. With the growing acceptance of the notion that commercial real estate values have hit bottom, about $12.2 billion in commercial mortgage securities were issued in 1992, up from $4.3 billion in 1991 and $920 million in 1990, according to Prudential Securities Inc. This year's number will probably be higher, as private securities issuers rush into the market to take up the slack left by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that disposes of the assets of failed savings and loans. The R.T.C. was the largest issuer in the market last year, but it has packaged far fewer loans this year.
Residential mortgages have long been made into packages of securities, but commercial mortgage packaging is fairly new. The crash in commercial real estate values chased many investors out of the market.
But in the last year or so, as banks, savings and loans, insurance companies and other traditional lenders continued to reel from their bad real-estate loans, bottom-fishing among buyers of buildings heated up. That has been accompanied by a surge of interest from investors who do not want buildings, but securities. And many of the securities are made up of loans bought from -- not surprisingly -- the banks, savings and loans and insurance companies.
 
Deals Are Many and Varied
 The new securities deals are many and varied. Here are a few examples:
*The R.T.C. has issued $14 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. Some pools of mortgages, especially those composed of delinquent or otherwise troubled mortgages, are typically backed by a reserve fund of assets to be used as security in case any of the loans fail to pay off. These offerings have made the agency the largest issuer of commercial mortgage-backed securities, with 75 percent of the total issued last year.
*In another sign that private companies are following the R.T.C.'s lead, the Pacific Investment Management Company has set up the first investment-grade securities fund backed by commercial mortgages. Pacific Investment, known as Pimco, is a top money manager, with about $50 billion under management. Last Friday, Pimco raised $165 million for the fund by selling 11 million shares at $15 apiece with a 7 1/2 percent coupon. Pimco is planning to buy at least 65 percent in investment-grade securities backed by commercial mortgages, with up to 35 percent going into below-investment-grade issues.
*In addition to the California home builder, the Baldwin Company, other developers have raised money in the same way this year. The Toll Corporation of Pennsylvania issued $75 million in notes priced to yield 9.625 percent in March. The notes were rated Ba3, below investment grade, by Moody's Investors Service. In April, UDC Homes, an Arizona builder, issued $115 million of 11 3/4 percent senior notes that Moody's rated B2, also below investment grade.
*In one of the more esoteric deals, Daiwa cut up $193 million in mobile-home park mortgages into seven slices of securities ranging from a top slice, with a rating of AA by Standard & Poor's -- its second-highest rating -- and a floating rate, down to two unrated offerings that were sold privately with undisclosed returns.
Sellers of such securities structure the deals to attract as many different investors as possible, often pooling debt and cutting it into slices, called tranches, with the lowest yields in the investment-grade top slices and progressively higher yields as the ratings drop to below-investment-grade. The purchaser of the top slice is first in line to get money from the mortgage payments.
Mr. Stone described a hypothetical typical deal: Daiwa purchases 50 commercial mortgages, combines them into a diversified pool, and issues bonds. The first slice, say 60 percent, is rated AA and yields around 6.25 percent, like other AA bonds. Another 20 percent may be rated BBB, the lowest investment-grade level, with a yield around 7.5 percent. The bottom slice, with no rating at all, may give a yield around 17 percent -- which is "enough money so I can keep a nice profit margin and pay out a healthy yield," he said.
"What I'm saying to you is, 'Don't buy real estate today,' " Mr. Stone said. "I'll sell you a bond that's performing, diversified and that the ratings agencies have just looked at. If there's any trouble, I'll give you the real estate. There is no equity -- you take over the property."
 
 
A Chance to Take Property
 Indeed, the chance to get at equity is what sometimes attracts many real estate players to the mortgage securities market. People in the business say that many investors who are taking the lowest-rated slices of debt offerings in these packages are real estate professionals themselves. They might be just as happy to be able to take the property.
William C. Powers, managing director at Pimco, said his firm found the market for mortgage-backed securities attractive partly because ratings agencies were basing their assessments on the expectation that real estate values would continue to decline at the rate of the last few years. But, he said, to make money, "one does not have to assume that commercial real estate values are going higher, or even that they will remain flat."
"One has to assume," he said, "that the decline that we have seen over the past few years will continue, but at a lesser rate."

HEADLINE: HURRICANE EMILY;
Near Miss Revives Debate Over Building on Islands

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OCRACOKE, N.C., Sept. 1

 BODY:
The residents of this thin sliver of sand southwest of Cape Hatteras awoke today to find their world miraculously intact, their damages limited to a few days of lost tourism business.
But if North Carolina's Outer Banks largely dodged a bullet on Tuesday, when Hurricane Emily grazed it and headed out to sea, few areas in America exemplify the knotty issues surrounding coastal development more than this string of islands jutting into the Atlantic. 
 Over the last two decades the Outer Banks have been transformed from a modest stretch of motels and beach cottages, where wild pigs and horses roamed free, to one of the fastest growing resort areas in the nation. The issues raised by the population boom on these shifting coastal sands will linger far after the memories of the storm's near miss have faded.
Indications today were that both the natural environment and the man-made one had avoided catastrophic damage, with the exception of the town of Buxton north of Cape Hatteras, which was hit hard by wind, rain and surging 10-foot seas.
 
Fears of Erosion
 Buxton, at the extreme southeastern tip of the Outer Banks, was hit much harder than Ocracoke and suffered the greatest damage.
But, for the most part, beach damage all along the Outer Banks was less severe than many had feared.
There had been fears that the hurricane would accelerate the erosion of the beaches along the Outer Banks, where the islands for the most part are less than a half mile wide. Experts say it clearly did some major damage to the beaches around Cape Hatteras and Buxton. North of Buxton, in Kitty Hawk, where many houses were built on the beach, several houses collapsed into the sea as the sand eroded beneath them.
"We dodged a very large bullet here as far as erosion goes," said Doug Remaley, chief of the Nags Head Fire and Rescue Department north of here. "There was a substantial amount of erosion, but my personal opinion is that this was no worse than a severe northeast storm, which we get in the winter months."
 
Growing Body of Knowledge
 In recent years, researchers have increasingly documented the degree to which the 295 barrier islands that stretch in a broken line from New England to Texas have been eroded in recent years. The Outer Banks are among the most vulnerable.
One of the most visible national symbols of the coastal debate is the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. When it was built in 1870, 1,500 feet of dunes and beach guarded it from the waves. Now that sandy buffer has been reduced to less than 300 feet, and no one knows what would have happened if the hurricane had come ashore there.
Dare County, which includes Nags Head and Kitty Hawk, grew in population by 70 percent, to 22,746 in 1990 from 13,377 in 1980. Property values there have increased by 1,231 percent since 1976.
"It's not like you get one Hurricane Andrew and wipe your brow and say, 'I'm glad we got that over with,' " said Beth Millemann, director of the Coast Alliance, a national coalition of environmental groups. "We have hurricanes after hurricanes after hurricanes, and the problem with living on the beach is it involves not only the people who have the beach house; it involves every taxpayer in America."
 
Development Has Support
 Ms. Milleman was referring to a variety of programs, including National Flood Insurance, beach projects by the Army Corps of Engineers and bridges and highways, all of which employ tax money to support coastal development.
Proponents of coastal development say her argument misses both the degree to which coastal development is an economic plus and the simple fact that people have always gravitated toward shores and always will. Many add that if people were moved away from all the nation's hazards, there might not be enough places to live.
"If my house blew down tomorrow, I'd starting rebuilding the next day," said Guy Newell, who lives here. "I'd rather be here than in the Midwest floods, or in Tornado Alley or in some places that's likely to have an earthquake."
But most agree that the major questions are not whether the coasts will be developed, but how they will be delveloped and who will bear the risks. Hurricane Andrew last year and the Midwest floods this year have renewed questions about the Federal flood insurance program, which critics say subsidizes development in hazardous areas. Similarly, critics have for years called for the mapping of erosion-prone coastal zones to help regulate development, but developers have so far fought off any such plan.
Some experts say that the building codes and construction standards on the Outer Banks are quite good, and that the development there is a reminder that man and nature can coexist even on barrier islands.
"The barrier islands have had thousands of hurricanes, and they survive," said Spencer Rogers, a coastal engineer at North Carolina State University. "The problem has been the fragile nature of what we build on them, not that the islands are fragile. And that depends on how we build."
But others look at the glossy Outer Banks Magazine, with its advertisements for high-cost malls and wonder what they are doing on a barrier island.
"I'm shocked by what I see there," said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland at College Park. "I grew up in North Carolina when the Outer Banks was just simple classic cottages. It's as if there are no development controls at all."

HEADLINE: BUDGET IS RECAST AS A BETTER PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
With its Republican critics on Congressional recess and not much else competing for headlines, the White House issued an economic report today that depicts its deficit-cutting labors as more muscular, and even more successful, than advertised to Congress just weeks ago.
Private economists and budget experts said the rosier description seemed reasonably credible, but cautioned that it relied on assumptions of continued low inflation and almost subterranean interest rates that have not been seen in recent decades. 
 The Administration report, the mid-session budget review, estimated that the Federal debt, more than $4 trillion, would grow by almost $100 billion less through 1998 than was forecast in August, after Congress approved a five-year deficit-cutting package.
Back then, the White House predicted that the overall Federal debt would rise by $1.1 trillion during the five years covered by the fiscal 1994 through 1998 budgets. Today, Mr. Clinton's budget director, Leon E. Panetta, pegged the total increase at $1.004 trillion.
 
Thinking Behind Changes
 Both projections include the effect of the $500 billion or so in new taxes and spending cuts that Congress approved in the deficit-cutting package. That figure is more or less unchanged under the new fiscal projections.
What is changed, and what will make the debt grow more slowly, is largely a melding of three factors. The first is the unexpectedly small growth in spending on Medicaid, which budget analysts now say will cost $36 billion less, through 1998, than they predicted a few months ago.
The second is a new forecast by White House economists that interest rates -- and therefore, the costs of financing that $4 trillion Federal debt -- will remain near historic lows for years to come. The Administration now figures it will pay $39 billion less interest on the debt in the next five years if rates on the main financing vehicle -- the 10-year Treasury bond -- hold steady at about 5.9 percent. The bond yields about 5.5 percent now.
The third, more subtle change is in the way the White House made all the economic projections in today's report. Until now, Mr. Panetta's analysts have used figures from Congress's forecasting agency, the Congressional Budget Office, as the base for all White House economic projections. Mr. Clinton pledged early this year to use the nonpartisan Congressional figures during the debate over his budget, saying that would remove any suspicion by critics that the White House was cooking its economic figures for political gain.
Today's report is the first important Administration document to rely not on Congress's numbers but on the estimates of Mr. Clinton's budget office and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Explaining the Switch
 The Congressional Budget Office will issue its own revised budget projections next week. They are expected to be slightly more conservative than the numbers released today.
An aide to Mr. Panetta, Barry Toiv, described the switch from Congressional to White House estimates as both natural and expected, now that the budget debate was over. In a briefing today, Mr. Panetta hastened to quash any suspicion that today's optimism was the result of rigged books or political scheming.
"There have been estimates about where deficits are headed over the last few years that have always been proven wrong," he said. "The reason we are confident that we can make these numbers is essentially because of the economic plan and the credibility of the economic plan. The numbers are real."
Mr. Panetta called today's report a "credible, conservative forecast." Mr. Clinton's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, called it "cautious." Indeed, it contemplates a rate of economic growth -- 2 percent this year, down from an earlier 3.1 percent, and no more than 3 percent in future years -- that rivals the sluggard economy of the Bush years.
Still, those and other officials put a positive gloss on some numbers that could be read several ways.
 
Role of 'Income-Shifting'
 Ms. Tyson at first said that the Administration's projection of anemic growth for this year was merely "an adjustment for the loss of the stimulus." That was a reference to Congress's defeat last spring of Mr. Clinton's plan to spend $19 billion on highways, Federal agency equipment purchases and other jobs programs.
Challenged by skeptics who noted that such a minuscule sum could not possibly wipe out a third of the growth in a multitrillion-dollar economy, Ms. Tyson later allowed that other factors played larger roles. Among them, she said, was "income-shifting" -- "a very large and unexpected increase in wages and salaries, primarily due to bonus payments," in the last months of 1992, offset by a similar decline in wages in early 1993.
An economist with the forecasting firm DRI, David Wyss, called today's report realistic, with some caveats. "They're not being nearly as rosy as in the Reagan era, when they were forecasting four percent growth and low inflation far as eye can see," he said.

HEADLINE: LABOR CHIEF URGES A RETRAINING PLAN

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
When the Portage, Pa., factory she had worked at for 20 years shut its doors last February, Mary Ann Bertolino, a sewing machine operator, found no government assistance to enable her to train for a new occupation. The reason was that she used to sew men's topcoats, not men's shirts or women's nightgowns.
Under the current patchwork of government programs to help workers permanently put out of jobs, the reason a worker has lost a job -- imports, military cuts, the spotted owl -- has to be the right one. The wrong one can mean that older workers whose job skills are no longer in demand are not eligible for much more than 26 weeks of unemployment checks and a bit of counseling. 
 American-made shirts and nightgowns have been hit hard by imports, so workers who used to sew them qualify for generous, longterm trade-adjustment assistance. But topcoat orders dried up when the economy turned sour, so Mrs. Bertolino is not eligible for the extra help.
 
Offsetting the Hurt
 To change that, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today that he proposed to overhaul the current system by folding disparate programs into one giant "re-employment program." His proposal to grant assistance to dislocated workers no matter why their jobs vanished is supposed to ease the pain of economic change, especially for older, less-skilled and less-educated workers.
"The challenge," Mr. Reich said, "is to ease the transition of Americans from the old economy to a new one."
An Administration economist familiar with the proposal said: "Economic change benefits everybody a little, but a few people get hurt a lot. We want to do something to offset that."
Striking back at the Administration's critics, Mr. Reich made it clear that the proposal was also intended to blunt criticism from labor unions, many Democrats and the Perot camp that the North American Free Trade Agreement would cost jobs.
"The adjustment assistance program is an important political element in getting Nafta approved, " said a Senate staff aide.
 
Framework for Legislation
 The Secretary's "Draft Proposal for a Comprehensive Worker Adjustment Program," a Labor Department spokesman said, has been circulated inside the Administration and to various constituents for comment. The proposal, which was published last month in the trade journal Daily Labor Report, is being modified, but it will be a framework for legislation that could be introduced as early as November.
If the proposal is adopted by Congress, the new program would be financed with $1.1 billion already earmarked in the 1994 budget for existing efforts as the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance program. The costs, the proposal indicated, would roughly triple by 1998. The $180 million Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which reaches about 23,000 workers a year, is apt to continue at least temporarily as an independent program.
Existing programs either provide a restricted number of services or limit the eligibility to workers who lost their jobs because of imports, military cuts or the Clean Air Act. By contrast, the new adjustment assistance program would fold most of the existing programs into one.
More importantly, it would be available to any workers with two or, more likely, three years on the job. According to the proposal, about 2.2 million such workers are potentially eligible for job placement services and cash grants while they attend school.
"The big thing the proposal does is that you don't have to prove that you lost your job because of imports or trees or clean air," said an Administration official. Mrs. Bertolino and her former co-workers in Pennsylvania, for example, have been turned down twice for assistance under the trade adjustment program.
 
Streamlining Called a Help
 People whose job involves helping dislocated workers get their lives back on track say that the proposed changes would help them reach more workers faster. "Some streamlining would be very beneficial," said David Seidel, a state official in Altoona, Pa., who has been working with garment workers who lost their jobs when factories closed or moved. "All the programs have different eligibility criteria," he said. "We're dealing with having to apply for separate grants for one group of dislocated workers."
What's more, the new program would especially avoid steering workers into the kind of short-term government-sponsored training programs that the Labor Department's proposals calls "ineffective for permanently laid- off workers." Instead, it would provide instant help for finding a new job, from resume-writing workshops to psychological counseling to help workers cope with the shock of losing their livelihoods.
And, for those who decided after a job search that they needed new careers, the program would provide cash -- equal to unemployment insurance payments -- to workers enrolled in community colleges and technical institutes. The proposal envisions a small fraction of dislocated workers -- about 300,000 a year -- needing support after unemployment insurance runs out at the cost of about $3,000 to $3,500 a worker.
"You can't just exhaust unemployment benefits and go into training," an Administration economist said.

Bonds Sluggish Ahead of Jobs Report

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The lull has begun. It is the week before Labor Day, and the Labor Department will release the July employment report tomorrow. So traders and investors are either away or sitting on their hands, and little is happening in the bond market.
In moderate trading yesterday, prices and yields barely budged. By late in trading, the price of the 30-year bond managed to gain 3/32 , which was enough to push the yield down to 6.08 percent, setting another in a growing string of 20-year lows. Price and yield move in opposite directions. 
 The prices of Treasury notes were also little changed. The price of the two-year note was unchanged, with the yield at 3.86 percent. The price of the three-year note was up 1/32 as the the yield slipped to 4.16 percent from 4.17 percent. And the price of the 10-year note was down 1/32 , with the yield up to 5.45 percent from 5.44 percent.
 
 
Data Have Little Impact
 There were a number of economic reports released yesterday, and most of them indicated that the economy was still sluggish. But the data made little impact ahead of the employment report, which is the first significant look into how the economy fared in August.
Among the reports yesterday, one showed a drop in personal income of two-tenths of a percent in July. Wall Street forecasts had expected a rise of three-tenths of a percent. And the National Association of Purchasing Management said its August index fell to 49.3 from 49.5 in July, showing a slight contraction in the manufacturing sector of the economy. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is generally expanding, while one below 50 suggests it is generally declining.
"Whatever bets they wanted to make, they have made them," said Peter McTeague, an analyst at Technical Data in Boston, referring to bond traders.
Traders, he said, "will not do anything dramatic" today before the release of the employment data. The consensus forecast on Wall Street, he said, was that nonfarm payrolls would rise by about 150,000 jobs in August.
 
 
Risk of Weaker Employment
 But Mr. McTeague added that there was a risk that the number would be lower than expected, based on recent data like yesterday's purchasing managers' report. The manufacturing employment index in the report dropped to 40.4 in August from 43.2 in July, the lowest level since May 1991. The news gave the credit market its only lift.
If the employment report is weak, it will probably have two effects. First, it may give the price of the 30-year bond the support it needs to push the yield to 6 percent and below. As of yesterday's close at 6.08 percent, the price has to increase just 1 1/8 point -- or $11.25 per $1,000 in face value -- to get the yield to 6 percent. A price increase of 1 1/4 point will get it to 5.99 percent. That could happen in a single day of frantic trading, or it could happen, as it has, slowly and relentlessly, day by day.
Another effect of weak employment data may be the revival of talk that the Federal Reserve will have to lower short-term interest rates again to keep the economy from faltering. The Fed has left its short-term interest rate target at 3 percent for a year.
If traders and investors begin to believe that a rate cut is likely, short- and intermediate-term interest rates could move lower. But the outlook now seems to be that the economy will not be weak enough for the Fed to cut interest rates again.

Dollar Is Off Against Mark But Strengthens Versus Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a 10-week low against the German mark yesterday, after investors sold dollars for marks on reports of strong German industrial growth.
But the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen because of repeated intervention by Japan's central bank and speculation about a potential fall in Japanese interest rates. 
 In New York, the dollar fell to 1.6595 marks, from 1.6767 marks on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 105.35 yen from 104.75 yen.
 
Speeds Recovery Timetable
 The mark also rose sharply against the yen and other European currencies on news that industrial production in western Germany rose five-tenths of a percent in July after a revised drop of three-tenths of a percent in June.
"People have taken this as supporting the idea of an early recovery in Germany," said Chris Turner, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. An economic rebound would reduce pressure on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. Lower interest rates make a nation's currency less attractive to investors.
By contrast, fresh American economic data proved disappointing. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index fell to a reading of 49.3 in August from 49.5 in July. Government data on personal income showed Americans took home two-tenths of a percent less pay in July than in June. With consumption up four-tenths of a percent in July, the savings rate dropped to an abysmal 3.3 percent. And construction spending fell five-tenths of a percent in July.
"The numbers in sum don't make us feel really comfortable about the dollar and any type of hike in U.S. interest rates," said Jim Phoenix, foreign exchange dealer at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Dealers also said the decision by the White House to lower its growth forecast for 1993 to 2 percent from 2.8 percent suggested growth would not be robust.
Meanwhile, speculation that Japan will soon cut its 2.5 percent official discount rate, perhaps by as much as three-quarters of a point, weighed on the yen. Many dealers expect the Bank of Japan to offer easier credit to help spur the economy.
Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.5030 in New York, from $1.4905 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer in July Spent More With Less Pay (Again)

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
American consumers increased their spending for the fourth straight month in July, the Commerce Department reported today, a sign that the economy continued to grind ahead slowly.
The latest rise, four-tenths of 1 percent, came despite an overall decline in income that reflected the costs of the Midwest flooding. 
 "The new quarter got off to a pretty decent start in terms of consumer spending," said Russell W. Sheldon, senior economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. Since then, however, other data on retail sales and automobile sales have tailed off.
Other reports today also depicted a sluggish economy, with mortgage delinquencies in the spring rising for a second quarter, construction edging down in July and purchasing managers' reporting a small but unexpected decline in August industrial activity that included job losses. [Page D3.]
The Commerce Department put consumer spending for July at an annual rate of $4.40 trillion compared with $4.38 trillion in June, a gain slightly larger than May's but less than those of April or June.
Amid this low state of confidence in the economy, various indicators pointed to a reluctance by consumers to make commitments for housing and other big-ticket items even while they continued to spend money on less costly goods.
On Tuesday, the department lowered its figures on personal spending for the second quarter, to an increase of 3.2 percent from 3.8 percent. A drop in durable-goods purchases accounted for most of the change.
Spending on durable goods, products intended to last at least three years, was virtually unchanged in July, while spending for nondurable goods posted the biggest gain since April. A fourth consecutive advance was recorded for services -- much of it for utilities, especially for air-conditioning in hot weather.
July's reported two-tenths of 1 percent decline in income was called satisfactory by economists, after they made allowances for the floods and for drought in the Southeast.
Except for these factors, which the department took account of by estimating crop and property losses and allocating seven months' worth of them to July, personal income would have increased five-tenths of 1 percent for the month.
Wages and salaries rose six-tenths of 1 percent in July, the third gain in four months, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said.
These results seemed less dire than was suggested by the fact that declines for June, upon revision, and for July represented the first back-to-back reductions in income since 1954. The disposable-income figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, they were down four-tenths of 1 percent, also the second consecutive decline.
 
Saving Down, Late Payment Up
 The nation's savings rate slumped to 3.3 percent from 4 percent, the lowest in almost four years. Savings -- disposable personal income, minus outlays -- ran at a $152.3 billion pace in July, well under the $186.3 billion in June, the department said.
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported that 4.39 percent of conventional and Government-backed residential mortgages were at least a month past due in the spring quarter, up from 4.29 percent in the January-March period.
The rise came entirely in F.H.A. and V.A. loans, suggesting to officials that lower-income households, which rely more on these Government-backed loans, are less able to take advantage of current low interest rates to refinance mortgages.
In still another report, the Commerce Department said that housing, highway and other construction begun in July totaled $458.2 billion on an annual basis, slightly under the revised June estimate of $460.5 billion. The decrease was concentrated in stores, hotels and home renovation. This was mostly offset by a rise in home building. Construction over the first seven months of 1993 was 5 percent above that in the comparable period of 1992.
Over all, Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank said, the statistics did little to alter expectations of continued but choppy growth. He said that over the last month he had become increasingly pessimistic because while consumers continued to spend for some goods, plans for scaled-down auto production were likely to weigh heavily on the broad economy.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing, and Factory Jobs, Fell in August, Survey Says

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Manufacturing in August slumped for the third straight month, with factory employment falling sharply, a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives indicated yesterday.
"The manufacturing sector is still essentially dead in the water," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
 The survey index, from the National Association of Purchasing Management, dipped to 49.3 in August, from 49.5 in July. A figure below 50 indicates that manufacturing is declining.
However, a reading above 44.5 usually means that the overall economy is growing. With the index averaging 51.9 this year, the economy is thought to be continuing a slow climb from recession.
Economists and the Federal Reserve Board track the purchasing managers' survey because it is one of the first indicators of economic activity for any month. The survey is considered a good gauge of future business activity because purchasing managers are responsible for buying raw material.
 
Employment Takes the Hit
 The overall August index was pulled down by the drop in jobs. But figures for production, new orders and delivery time were marginally higher, leading some economists to predict an upturn this month.
The rate of job cutting in August was the highest in more than two years in the survey, which draws on purchasing managers at more than 300 companies. Ten percent of them reported hiring in August, while 27 percent reduced employment. The job situation at the rest of the companies was unchanged.
Economists said manufacturing-job losses were worst in the aerospace and defense industries, which have been hurt by airline and Government military cutbacks.
The index of industrial production was up in August, to 51.6 from 51.3 in July. The index of new orders, considered a harbinger of future manufacturing activity, rose to 54.0 from 53.1.
The delivery of supplies was taking longer, indicating that demand was strengthening and companies were having trouble filling orders immediately. And more purchasing executives reported increased backlogs in orders than those who reported declines, a reversal of the situation in July.
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes, commented: "If you set that against a backdrop of lower manufacturing inventories, it really converts into the fact that any new orders coming through manufacturers are going to require new buying or purchasing throughout the entire supply chain. That would suggest to me that the month of September could be an improvement."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold and Silver Prices Fall As a Rally Ends Suddenly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold and silver prices fell sharply yesterday as a two-day rally in the futures market ended abruptly.
"It was a paper rally and paper rallies eventually run their course," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.
On other commodity markets, oil prices fell in reaction to a report of surprisingly large supplies. 
 Gold for October delivery lost $3.10, to $370.80 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. December gold, the most active contract, dropped $3.10, to $372.60. September silver dropped 9.9 cents, to $4.739 an ounce.
 
Selloff Wipes Out Gains
 The selling wiped out nearly all the gains posted in the two previous sessions.
Precious metals began climbing on Monday when some Middle Eastern silver purchases touched off a storm of investment fund buying on the Comex. The futures market drew an unusual amount of action because both the London and Hong Kong metals exchanges were closed Monday for a holiday.
On Tuesday, the buying interest shifted from silver futures to gold futures, then waned.
"There was no follow-through overnight, so we just drifted off today," said George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.
Mr. O'Neill said there was no fundamental justification for the rally. "If you look at the economic data, we're still in the same type of sluggish growth, no-inflation-threat atmosphere," he said. "Certainly the economic side of the market doesn't provide an incentive to buy gold."
Elsewhere, crude oil fell below $18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a trade group reported higher American inventories of crude than traders expected.
The American Petroleum Institute said in a weekly report released late Monday that crude supplies rose by 3.3 million barrels last week. Most analysts had expected supplies to decline by up to 4 million barrels.
Light sweet crude oil for October delivery fell 32 cents, to $17.97 a barrel. Also, October heating oil lost 0.52 cent, to 53.12 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline sank 0.76 cent, to 51.68 cents a gallon, and October natural gas fell 0.9 cent, to $2.366 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
After the floods, seeking a more comprehensive rebuilding policy.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WITH the Mississippi in retreat, all that's left to do is honor the indomitable spirit of the river valley dwellers and help them rebuild. Or is it?
Surely this charitable impulse sums up the view of the great majority of Americans. And it translates into a political imperative for Washington, which is dutifully scrambling to restore the river's protective levee system and parcel out some $5.7 billion in aid. 
 But it frustrates many economists who have long been struggling to transform after-the-fact disaster relief into a comprehensive policy for minimizing damage and insuring against risks -- a policy that asks those who gamble with nature to bear the consequences. "When scenes of families stranded on rooftops appear on the nightly news for five days running, nothing can stop Congress from picking up the tab," says Robert Stavins of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
It is Federal policy to help potential disaster victims help themselves. Since 1980, farmers have been able to insure most crops against natural calamities. And the National Flood Insurance Program, pieced together from a variety of initiatives since 1968, insures houses and other property in flood-prone areas.
What's more, disaster insurance is intended to be operated on a business-like basis. Crop insurance premiums are linked to actuarial risks. The flood insurance program does give a break to existing property, but charges actuarially sound rates for new development.
That, however, is hardly the whole story. Bob Hunter, director of the flood insurance program in the Carter Administration, charges that "government agencies and banks have failed to live up to the spirit of the law." Indeed, requirements that property owners with federally insured mortgages maintain flood insurance have not been enforced. A General Accounting Office survey after a 1989 flood in Texas found that 79 percent of homeowners with federally backed loans had not kept up their premiums.
As disturbing, fewer than one-fifth of those at risk actually buy flood or crop insurance. And economists suspect the reason is that people figure (correctly) that Uncle Sam will cover them after the fact. "The idea Washington will hang uninsured flood victims out to dry is just not credible," argues Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Howard Kunreuther, the co-director of the Risk Management Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, believes the choice to forgo insurance is more about lack of sense than dollars. The center's surveys of earthquake and flood victims suggest that people often discount small probabilities of natural disaster to zero -- the "it will not happen to me" syndrome.
Where incentives are more likely to count heavily, however, is where local governments or levee districts make decisions about big investments. And here, there is evidence that Federal largess encourages rebuilding in harm's way.
Uncle Sam will underwrite four-fifths of the cost of bringing both Federal levees and eligible, locally built levees back to pre-flood capacity. Even the local share may be finessed, providing the local sponsor is nimble enough to funnel other Federal disaster money into the repair effort.
The Clinton Administration has organized an interagency task force to screen the renovations and look for cheaper solutions. There are programs on the books, for example, to allot funds for purchasing "flood easements" through low-value farmland. Farms at risk can also be purchased for restoration as wetlands, which serve both as a habitat for wildlife and as a filter for groundwater.
But these alternatives are voluntary. "If an eligible levee sponsor says I want my levee rebuilt, that's what we do," confirms Scott Saunders, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers.
Oleta Fitzgerald, the Agriculture Department coordinator for flood relief, is still optimistic that communities will look carefully at cheaper alternatives to concrete and earthworks. She notes that while the Army Corps has the money to repair Federal levees, the funds available will not cover every repair to which local levee sponsors may be technically entitled. By the same token, disaster relief will not come close to covering total property and crop damage, conservatively estimated at $12 billion. And that, she suggests, raises the pressure to get the most bang for a Federal buck.
Leonard Shabman, an economist at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, is inclined to look on the bright side. Washington's huge investment in flood control did pay off handsomely, he notes. Only 30 of some 200 Federal levees were breached, sparing the big cities along the Mississippi and Missouri from serious damage. Where levees were washed away, the losses were less than astronomical because relatively little property was inundated.
But critics remain skeptical. "American values and institutions," said William Riebsame, a natural disaster expert at the University of Colorado, "just don't make it easy to tell people what to do with their property."

Fade to Black: Pinstripes in Peril on WPIX

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Free telecasts of Yankee games, a tradition for 43 years, seem headed toward extinction because WPIX and the MSG Network are at an impasse.
"This is what the consumer feared all along, the loss of all free games to cable," said Michael Eigner, the president of WPIX/Channel 11. "I've been hopeful of making a deal, but they've made an offer and said, 'Take it or leave it.' " 
 Control of all Yankees telecasts has resided with MSG since 1991 as part of its $486 million cable contract with the team. Over the last three years, MSG has aired 75 games, paid about $5 million a season for the time on WPIX to telecast 50 games and then sold the advertising for both outlets. MSG said it was now time for WPIX to pay for the right to show Yankee games and has proposed a figure of $15 million annually.
 
Mets Have Even Split
 When MSG and WPIX struck their deal before the 1991 season, the reason was the importance of keeping a significant portion of games on over-the-air, or free television. MSG had 4.9 million subscribers, including 3.5 million in the New York market.
The cable network is available in 49 percent of the TV homes in which WPIX is seen in in the New York market area, so appearing on WPIX expanded the geographic reach of the games. Appearing on free TV enables viewers who can't afford cable or can't get it to watch games. The Mets have an even split of telecasts, with 75 games on SportsChannel and 75 on WWOR/Channel 9.
MSG officials say that they have lost $22 million on the WPIX arrangement and that continuing it is economically unfeasible. WPIX says MSG is making a profit, but MSG refuses to include in its WPIX arithmetic the advertising revenues and subscriber fees it gets for its cable games.
"It's a tough situation," said Douglas Moss, president of the MSG Network. "All we're trying to do is make a reasonable deal. But we can't continue to suffer losses."
During the spring, MSG proposed that WPIX continue to air 50 games a season through the year 2000 for a $15 million annual fee. At $300,000 a game, said Moss, "that's exactly what we're paying now, not one cent more." He was referring to MSG's contract with the Yankees, which costs about $5 million a year.
WPIX rejected the offer, and made three counterproposals, said Eigner: continue the current arrangement; a revenue-sharing deal in which WPIX would sell the advertising time and split revenues with MSG; pay the $15 million rights fee if MSG shared one-third of its subscriber fees.
Last week, MSG rejected the counteroffers. Moss called them all "fancy ways for us to keep losing money."
"They have not offered anything else," said Eigner. "There have been no other proposals from them. They said they'd accept any reasonable offer and we made three of them."
 
Additional Talks Planned
 Moss said they would sit down for talks again later this month.
"We have months and months to work on this and come up with something new," he said.
"We don't have to offer WPIX anything, but we don't want to hoard games," said Bob Gutkowski, president of Madison Square Garden, the parent company of the MSG Network. Both are part of Paramount Communications.
Eigner said: "The Bronx and Brooklyn have very low cable penetration. Over 80 percent of the homes don't subscribe to cable or can't get it. So we want to keep the franchise on the station."

Ramirez Loses Luggage, but Not His Way to Majors

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Manny Ramirez hurried through the bowels of the Metrodome, late on his first day in the major leagues. It was only 55 minutes to game time.
"Which way?" he asked a companion. 
 "Over there," came the reply.
And just ahead was a sign that read "Visiting Team Club House." Ramirez, in light-blue sport jacket, T-shirt with a gold chain around his neck, blue jeans and black boots, pushed through the clubhouse door and was greeted by several members of the Cleveland Indians.
"Where you been?" infielder Alvaro Espinosa asked, shaking his hand.
Ramirez began to explain that the plane was late, that the airlines had lost one of his bags, that. . . .
"Get ready quick," Felix Fermin, the shortstop, said in Spanish, "you're in the lineup."
Ramirez looked around the clubhouse. "It's unbelievable I'm here," he said.
Unbelievable that this 6-foot, 190-pound outfielder made it, unbelievable that he made it so quickly, unbelievable that he had come so far, unbelievable that he will be playing in Yankee Stadium on Friday night, when Cleveland visits his hometown for a weekend series.
Only two years and three months ago, Manuel Aristides Ramirez was playing third base for the George Washington High School team in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Two years ago he was living with his father, Aristides, in a narrow sixth-floor walkup. He was considered the best baseball player in New York City in 1991, hitting for an average of .633, with 21 home runs. Legends had developed around him, some saying that when he hits the ball it sounds different from when anyone else hits one.
Ramirez was born in Santiago, the Dominican Republic, 21 years ago, came to the United States in 1985 when he was 12, played for the Pablo Morales Little League in Washington Heights and then for George Washington High, the school that produced the Hall of Famer, Rod Carew, and another of the famed, Henry Kissinger.
Ramirez was chosen in the first round of the 1991 draft by Cleveland -- the 13th pick over all -- and signed a $250,000 bonus. And he began tearing up the minor leagues. He was sent first to Burlington, N.C., where he hit .326 with 19 homers. He moved on to Kinston, N.C., where he had 13 home runs until he sustained an injury. Then this season he went from Class AA, Canton-Akron, to Class AAA Charlotte. He batted .340 at Canton with 17 homers and 79 runs batted in and .317 with 14 homers and 36 r.b.i. in only four and a half weeks with Charlotte.
 
A Call From Indians
 This morning he had flown into the Richmond airport from Charlotte when his manager, Charlie Manuel, was paged. After taking the call, which was from the Indians' office, Manuel motioned for Ramirez.
"You're going to Minnesota, you're going to the big leagues," Manuel told him.
"I didn't know what to say," Ramirez recalled. "I said, 'Thank you.' "
While Ramirez is considered a great talent, he is still a raw one. He is a born hitter, apparently, with amazingly quick hands and great power. His outfield play and his base running still need refinement, the Indians believe. But they have great hopes for him, and wanted to give him a taste of the big leagues, starting today, the day rosters can be expanded.
The Indians called up Bob Milacki, a pitcher, along with Ramirez. They had flown into Richmond on economy class and flew back out -- on the same plane -- first class.
Milacki, who had been in the major leagues for four years, turned to Ramirez in the first-class seat and said, "This is the only way to travel."
 
Missing Luggage
 But even first class can have problems. And Ramirez's bag with his sport jackets and slacks was missing. He had to put a tracer on it, and so time ticked away. He had to get to the ball park, but he also needed his clothes. Another bag was left in Charlotte, and that one contained his baseball equipment, his glove, his bats, his supporter. But all that would be provided by his new team.
Everything had happened so fast that he couldn't even call his father at the electronics store where he works as a handyman, or to the garment factory in Manhattan where his mother, Onelcidad, is employed as a seamstress. "I didn't know their numbers at work," he said, "and didn't have time to find out."
But he was able to call one of his high-school friends, Nestor Cruz. "He told me that they had thought I might get called up and a lot of people in the neighborhood already bought tickets for the Yankee game Friday."
"I'm excited to go back to New York, where all my friends will see me," said Ramirez. He smiled. "I heard they're going to be bringing signs about me."
One will say "The Hit Man From Washington." And they'll be wearing Cleveland caps for one of their own.
 
'He's Just Like Us'
 "He was the most exciting player ever to come out of here," said Jose (Peligro) Matteo, an old friend and the owner of Peligro Sandwich, a combination baseball card shop and deli on 170th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. "And he never forgot the neighborhood. He's just like us."
In the Cleveland clubhouse tonight, Manager Mike Hargrove told Ramirez that, because he had come late, he was being scratched as the designated hitter. He was assured that he would get his chance.
"Just relax," Hargrove said. "Don't try to be Reggie Jackson. Or Henry Aaron. Just be Manny Ramirez. That's all we can expect -- and it's all we want."
Manny Ramirez nodded and smiled. And then put on the Cleveland uniform -- No. 24 -- which looked like a perfect fit.

HEADLINE: A Sensible Teachers' Settlement

 BODY:
After two years of negotiations, Mayor David Dinkins of New York City and the teachers' union have reached agreement on a new contract. The timing of the contract can't hurt the Mayor, coming as it does before the start of the school year and the concluding phase of the mayoral campaign. But it will also bring improvements in the teacher evaluation process and is sounder financially than the previous teachers' contract.
It's disappointing that this agreement does not include many long-term gains in teacher efficiency in the classroom. Other labor pacts have also failed to achieve productivity gains. Even so, Mr. Dinkins seems to have learned a lesson from his expensive agreement with the teachers three years ago. That contract gave them a one-year, 5.5 percent raise at a time when the city faced a severe recession, and established a precedent for other labor agreements the city could ill afford. 
 This time the teachers' settlement follows other municipal labor contracts, including one reached in January with about 180,000 civilian employees. That contract called for a raise of a relatively modest 8.25 percent over 39 months.
The new teachers' contract provides for a net 10.53 percent raise over 48 1/2 months -- a bit costly but fair. The increases are not evenly distributed. They become more generous as the contract matures, taking the risk that the city will have more money three or four years from now.
In addition, the most experienced teachers will get the biggest salary boost; maximum salaries will jump from $52,750 to $60,000 in 1995. That's meant to retain senior teachers by making top salaries more competitive with those in many nearby school districts. Since recruiting new teachers isn't a problem, beginning salaries will increase more gradually, from $26,375 to $28,749 in 1995.
In exchange, there are some real educational gains. Teachers will now be evaluated on an annual basis, not just when they come up for tenure. That should improve the quality of teaching. And the union will help push for state legislation that extends the time period during which teachers may be subject to disciplinary action.
This agreement may serve the political interests of Mr. Dinkins and the union. It also serves the city's budget and its schoolchildren.

HEADLINE: Avoid a Bosnian Quagmire

 BODY:
The Geneva peace talks have broken down once again, with Bosnian Muslim leaders refusing to sign a plan based on a three-way partition of the country unless they are allotted more territory. Serbian and Croatian leaders insist they have made their last offer. Either way, the new plan to end the Bosnian war so reduces Muslim territory that it's a big step backward from the earlier, flawed Vance-Owen plan. It was that earlier plan that the Clinton Administration once pledged as many as 30,000 American troops to enforce.
But if agreement is reached, President Clinton would be mistaken to let that earlier pledge be taken as a blank-check guarantee that U.S. forces will be available to enforce the current plan. 
 The new plan would also require enforcement by tens of thousands of international troops. Mr. Clinton now wisely indicates he wants to wait and see the details before committing Americans to an enforcement effort. Rightly, he makes the fairness and enforceability of any final agreement the key criteria.
The current mediators, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, are pressing for a crude partition that would leave Bosnia's mostly Muslim Government with lands that could not survive economically and are not even connected. The mediators have frankly told the Bosnians that the only alternative to three-way partition is a two-way partition between Serbs and Croats that would leave the Muslims no territory at all.
Given the unwillingness of Western governments to intervene and Europe's insistence on maintaining a one-sided arms embargo, that's probably an accurate prediction. But the Owen-Stoltenberg plan is scarcely a formula that Americans could accept as the basis for a long-term commitment of a larger American force. It doesn't reflect the interests, preferences or principles of the U.S.
When you trace the outlines of this plan, the picture that emerges is that of a quagmire. Moreover, it is a quagmire that the European powers are themselves avoiding, but urging Mr. Clinton to wade into. The mediators estimate that enforcing the new plan would require at least 40,000 new peacekeeping troops beyond the 25,000 already in Bosnia. The peacekeeping forces would be expected to remain in place for years, and they would be constantly in harm's way.
The peacekeepers' main assignments would be to separate the combatants, patrol the newly drawn boundaries and defend vital transportation corridors, duties that would put them in the line of fire if local militias follow their bellicose history and attempt to redraw the treaty map with force.
Britain and France, the plan's main diplomatic sponsors, aren't willing to commit significant additional troops from their standing armies or to spend the money to expand their forces. And the idea of German or Turkish troops has been ruled out because of Serbian political sensitivities. Some Russian troops may be available, but U.S. allies in Western Europe want the main burden -- perhaps 20,000 troops -- to fall on the United States.
These are the same allies, of course, that rejected the Administration's preferred alternative of lifting the U.N. arms embargo and reinforcing Bosnia's bargaining position with NATO air power.
The Clinton Administration is right to want to see Europe take more responsibility for its own security in the post-cold-war world. But it must resist having its healthy commitment to multilateralism result in the use of American troops to enforce an agreement that goes against America's own policy preferences and principles.
Sending tens of thousands of U.S. troops to enforce such a dubious plan in Bosnia would set a dangerous precedent for other enforcement actions around the world.
Mr. Clinton should hold fast to his latest criteria. Given the military and diplomatic pressures surrounding the negotiations, there's ample grounds for questioning whether the Owen-Stoltenberg plan can be judged fair or freely arrived at. And given the likely circumstances of its institution, with all sides questioning the details, there's reason to doubt whether it is enforceable without unacceptable risks to American lives.

HEADLINE: In Ex-Soviet Lands, U.S. Must Use Caution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"U.S. Cavalry for Soviet Borders?" (editorial, Aug. 23) is right to call for a serious assessment of the situation on the periphery of the former Soviet Union before there is any United States involvement -- whether it be negotiation or peacekeeping. 
 Russian foreign policy debates are too multisided to view as only reformers versus conservatives. Many "liberal" reformers are finding it difficult to deal with Russia's loss of superpower status and empire. Moreover, Russian fears of Islamic fundamentalism and growing civil unrest have led Boris N. Yeltsin's Government to support enlightened and not-so-enlightened authoritarian regimes in other former Soviet republics.
They have opted for short-term stability instead of long-term political development and democratization. In the longer run, Russian involvement in these areas is not the answer. Such intervention could be seen as imperialist and could inflame those very forces that Russia (and the United States) wish to contain.
In Russia, the absence of a well-defined national interest has created strong support for Russian nationalism, a tendency fueled by fears of the disintegration of the Russian federation. Reform alone will not necessarily mitigate the tendency. Fights over resources, tax revenues and political power contribute to decentralization.
The United States needs, first, accurate knowledge of Russian politics and the often confusing situations in the other former Soviet republics. These are the results of the long legacy of Russian domination and age-old ethnic conflicts. These conflicts could trigger outside interventions, especially from Turkey or Iran.
Our second priority should be to prevent Russian intervention and to facilitate the Red Army's withdrawal from the conflict areas.
Then, we should promote economic development, reform and democratization in the other successor states. It is dangerous to focus all our attention on Russia.

HEADLINE: On Abortion-Clinic Rounds: Forceps and Bulletproof Vest

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Aug. 28

 BODY:
It was 7:45 A.M., and still cool, but as Dr. Bernard Smith drove his Jeep to his abortion clinic, he was sweating. It was his bulletproof vest that was making him hot.
Dr. Smith has been performing abortions for more than 10 years, much of the time driving a weekly 600-mile circuit of abortion clinics in three states. As fewer and fewer abortion doctors are willing to put up with the harassment and tension in their own communities, such circuit riders have become far more common. 
 Among the things Dr. Smith knows about his business is that violence against doctors has been on the rise. He got the bulletproof vest six months ago, after an abortion doctor was fatally shot outside a clinic in Pensacola, Fla. Another doctor was shot and wounded two weeks ago in Wichita, Kan.
As Dr. Smith approached the Affiliated Medical Services clinic on Milwaukee's east side, 30 anti-abortion protesters were waiting with picket signs and pictures of bloody fetuses, as they are every Saturday. The tall, broad-shouldered doctor showed no tension or anxiety.
"It's always the same," he said. "They tell me: 'Bernie, don't do any killing today. Shame on you. Repent.' I just agree and keep walking. I used to try and talk to them, but I just don't feel up to it anymore. It's at an impasse. There's no common ground."
Dr. Smith, who put himself through Northwestern Medical School 20 years ago by working nights as a mail carrier and is on the board of the National Abortion Federation, describes himself as a passionate defender of a woman's right to have an abortion.
 
Cheers for Landmark Ruling
 "I remember being in a lecture in medical school when they announced that Roe v. Wade had passed," he said of the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in 1973. "We all cheered. I've had to question my motives. Do I really want to do this in the face of all this adversity? Am I willing to risk this whatever the consequences? The answer is yes."
It is not only his bulletproof vest that protects the 49-year-old doctor; it is his cloak of professionalism. To him, abortion is simply not a moral issue. "I know exactly what I'm doing and why I'm doing it," he said. "I'm providing a medical service. I do it out of a sense of duty, just the way other doctors do theirs, only mine happens to be in a controversial field."
And if he did not do his duty, he said, the clinic in Milwaukee, one of five in the city, might close its doors. Dr. Smith is the only doctor in the area who performs abortions as late as 20 weeks into a pregnancy. The next closest doctor who does that works out of a clinic in Madison, 90 miles away. Most doctors stop performing abortions after the first 12 weeks, after which the danger to the woman increases.
Anti-abortion protesters have picketed Dr. Smith's home, surrounded his car, distributed "wanted" posters with his picture branding him a "child killer," blockaded the clinics where he works and mailed him anonymous death threats.
"Those are techniques of shame and embarrassment, and I am not ashamed of what I do," Dr. Smith said. "I'm not proud of it, either. It would be nice if what I do wasn't really needed. That would be O.K. by me. People think I don't like kids. But I have four kids, and an 8-month-old grandchild."
The director of the clinic, Victoria Sprinkman, worries for Dr. Smith. She is the one who insisted that he get a bulletproof vest.
"He's either not scared, or he's covering it up better than anyone I've seen in my life," she said.
 
Slaying in Florida
 Dr. David Gunn, who was killed in Pensacola, had received numerous death threats and carried three guns in his car for protection. Dr. Smith says he will not get a gun, though lately he has been varying his route, and checking his rear view mirror more than he used to.
He spends a lot of time behind the wheel of his Jeep: he makes a 600-mile, six-day, weekly circuit from a clinic in Niles, Mich., to one in Peoria, Ill., to Milwaukee. With fewer and fewer young doctors being trained in abortion, even as older doctors are reaching retirement, Dr. Smith's is not an uncommon journey. Dr. Gunn used to put in 1,000 miles a week, covering clinics in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Some doctors have become pilots so they can fly their own planes from state to state. Others have stopped providing abortions because of the harassment.
Dr. Smith says he considers himself fortunate to have the support of volunteers from the Milwaukee Clinic Protection Coalition, a local volunteer group. "I'm not out there alone," he said. "That means a lot to me."
The volunteers were there when he pulled into the parking lot at the clinic here. They escorted him past the line of protesters, and through the locked door, with a sign above: "This clinic stays open."
Inside, the doctor took off his bulletproof vest and put on his blue scrubs. Every year 1.3 million abortions are performed in the United States. Today 23 women, ranging in age from 16 to 35, were waiting for the doctor. They were black, white, Hispanic and Asian, married and unmarried, employed and unemployed.
Dr. Smith, who will soon be divorced, says he regularly visits his children: three grown daughters and a teen-age son. When his children were small, he said: "I told them, 'Your daddy does abortions. That means he interrupts pregnancies. Some people are going to say your daddy is a baby killer. I don't see it that way.' "
He said that his oldest patient was a 54-year-old who never dreamed she could get pregnant, and that his youngest was an 11-year-old victim of incest. "How is an 11-year-old going to raise a child?" he asked. "What was she in -- fifth grade? How could she possibly understand what was happening to her?"
To the protesters outside, though, there can be no exceptions. Asked about the 11-year-old incest victim, one of them, a fundamentalist Christian named Karen Schneider, said: "That baby is created by God. I believe there should be no compromises. A life is a life."
Among Dr. Smith's patients on this day was a waitress with four children, who said she could not afford another. There was a mother of five on public assistance who had worked as a prostitute and been shot and stabbed, according to her records.
Another, a 30-year-old mother, is rearing a daughter alone, working as an administrative assistant and dreaming of one day going back to college. "My job is very demanding," she said. "It would be in jeopardy if I had another child. I could end up on welfare. I've been crying for weeks. This is not something I want to do."
Mrs. Schneider, 39, the protester, who has three sons, acknowledges having had four abortions more than 10 years ago before she married. "I listened to the feminist viewpoint that it is better for us to have control over our bodies than to bring children into the world," she said, clutching her Bible. "The first one was at age 24. I have to admit I wanted that abortion. I was in graduate school. I did not want to be saddled with that child."
Dr. Smith is familiar with Mrs. Schneider's story. "Why can't other women have four chances and then repent?" he said. "Why can't other women have a chance to make mistakes?"
 
Too Poor to Dream
 Dr. Smith, who is black, was one of 11 children who grew up in Mississippi and Chicago with a mother who scrubbed white people's floors. "I knew about the color thing growing up," he said. "But I didn't find out about the man-woman thing until I got older. Women can work anywhere they want to now. They can't harass you in the workplace anymore. What else can they do? They can harass you in the moral arena."
He was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He went to work as a high school mathematics and science teacher on the South Side of Chicago. "We were too poor for me to even dream about becoming a doctor," he said. But at the age of 25, under a minority recruitment program, he started medical school.
He began his career in emergency medicine at Methodist Hospital in Gary, Ind. He had no intention of doing abortions, he said. But in 1979, the director of a local Planned Parenthood chapter said his clinic needed a doctor. After long reflection, Dr. Smith said, he decided to help.
On this day, one of his last patients was a 17-year-old girl with a pearl heart necklace over her sweatshirt and braces on her teeth. Her father and her boyfriend, who is also 17, sat with her in the waiting room. In five days she would start her senior year of high school. She is a dancer on the pompon squad. She had a job at a fast food restaurant. She was nine weeks pregnant.
"I'm sad," she said, with her hands scrunched inside the sleeves of her sweatshirt. "I don't want to do this, and I do want to do this. My best friend said it's my fault. I shouldn't have had sex. She wants me to give the baby up for adoption. I don't want the baby to die because it's not his fault. But I don't want to mess up my life, either. I want to go to college.
"My dad says he doesn't want me to end up like him. I was an unwanted baby. My mother had three abortions before me. My dad wanted her to have another one. They got divorced over it." Her father, who was not present while she spoke to a reporter, said later that everything she had said was true.
The girl's mother was 16 when she was born; her father was 19.
The price of her abortion was $260 with local anesthesia, $320 with a stronger medication, called "twilight." Her father ordered the local. The girl said she would leave if he did not pay for the twilight. She got the twilight. Her boyfriend held her hand during the three-minute operation.
Afterward, Dr. Smith checked the tissue with forceps to make sure he had gotten everything. With forceps, he indicated the embryo. It was an inch long.
"This is what everybody's fighting about," he said. "It has a beating heart." It had no skeletal structure, only buds for limbs.
After performing thousands of abortions, Dr. Smith added, he looked upon the embryo much as another doctor might view an appendix he had just removed. "To me, I'm playing the same role at 8 weeks or at 12," he said. "The decision that was made by the woman is paramount. It's the woman's choice."
He placed the the embryo and other tissue in a sealed plastic bag with preservatives. It would be sent to a secret location for incineration.
It was after 5 P.M. when Dr. Smith got back in his Jeep and started on the two-hour drive home, to Chicago. His children live there. Sunday was his day off.
By 6:45 A.M. Monday he was back at the wheel, heading out of downtown toward Niles, Mich., two hours away. Thirty-four abortions were scheduled. The youngest patient would be a 13-year-old girl. Often, women drive five and six hours from upstate Michigan to the Niles clinic.
"There's a clinic about three minutes from my apartment in Chicago that would hire me in a minute," Dr. Smith said. "But they've already got doctors. The other clinics would close if I left. And the staff in Milwaukee said they'd shoot me if I did."

HEADLINE: CLINTON CUTS AIMS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to jettison some of the ambitious plans for comprehensive health benefits that he and his advisers had decided should be guaranteed to all Americans, Administration officials said today.
Because of concerns about cost, the health care overhaul package will initially include only limited amounts of mental health care and will not cover dental services for adults. 
 White House documents say the package to be proposed by Mr. Clinton, which would prescribe the minimum coverage provided by all health plans, is "as comprehensive as those offered by most Fortune 500 companies." But the public's aversion to new taxes forced the President to scale back plans to offer coverage broader than many big employers now provide.
 
Objections by Tipper Gore
 Administration officials said limits on mental health care -- in general, 30 outpatient visits and 60 days in a hospital each year -- were more stringent than they had originally hoped. But they said the plan would still permit coverage that is more generous than many Americans now have.
The limits were adopted over the objections of Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, who has advocated complete parity in coverage of mental and physical illnesses.
But White House documents show that the President's plan, scheduled to be submitted to Congress later this month, will recommend expanding coverage of mental health, dental and preventive services in the year 2000.
 
Medicare Curbs Planned
 Asked about his proposals, President Clinton said today that he planned to slash the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor, to help finance new benefits like long-term care and prescription drug coverage for the elderly. The Government typically tries to curb the cost of these programs by limiting payments to doctors and hospitals or by requiring beneficiaries to pay a larger share of the bill.
In addition, Mr. Clinton said that "a bureaucratic system of price controls" would not be needed to hold down health costs. Some drug companies and other segments of the health care industry have offered to keep prices in line with inflation for a year or two, Mr. Clinton said, and "they should be given the opportunity to adhere to the commitment that they've made."
Democrats and Republicans alike have warned Mr. Clinton that price controls would not work in the health care industry. In trying to allay such concerns today, Mr. Clinton conspicuously omitted any reference to one type of price controls that he does intend to impose: limits on private health insurance premiums.
By controlling the annual increase in premiums, he hopes to make insurance companies restrain payments to doctors and hospitals, thus controlling all health care spending.
The Health Insurance Association of America assailed this aspect of the Clinton plan, saying it had "ominous implications for consumers" and would not fully control health costs.
Mr. Clinton intends to unveil his health care plan in a speech to Congress the week of Sept. 20, and he will probably issue a detailed description of it at that time. But it may take weeks for the Administration to submit draft legislation to Congress, officials said.
Kevin Anderson, a White House spokesman, said the guaranteed benefits, like other elements of the plan, could be changed as a result of Mr. Clinton's discussions with Congress, scheduled to begin next week.
 
A Minimum Package
 As it now stands, the basic benefits package will include hospital and doctors' services, family planning services, pregnancy-related services, hospice care, home health care, nursing homes care (up to 100 days after a hospital stay), routine eye and ear examinations and preventive dental services for children.
The benefits package will not cover cosmetic surgery, hearing aids, eyeglasses for adults, in vitro fertilization services, sex-change surgery or private hospital rooms.
The basic benefits package reflects a minimum that all health insurance plans would have to cover. Employers could provide more. But under the Clinton proposal they would lose their Federal tax deduction for such extra expenses after three years, or at the end of existing labor contracts that expire after Jan. 1, 1997.
Many companies already cover dental care for employees and their families, and this benefit has proved popular with employees.
Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting concern based in Lincolnshire, Ill., says more than 90 percent of big employers offer dental benefits to their workers. This estimate is based on data collected from 1,000 companies with 20 million employees and 35 million spouses and dependents.
 
Congress to Weigh Plan
 Mr. Clinton's proposals are subject to approval by Congress, which has made clear that it intends to prescribe the minimum package of health benefits in minute detail.
White House documents say the Administration "proposes to phase in additional benefits in the year 2000." For example, the documents say, adults would become eligible for preventive dental care in that year, and hospital coverage for mental illness would be increased to 90 days, from 60 days. In addition, the documents say, the Administration hopes to eliminate limits on the number of outpatient psychotherapy visits in the year 2000.
But such improvements are contingent on "savings from reform" of the health care system and on of Mr. Clinton's efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit, the documents say.
In a letter to the White House this week, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and 14 other Democratic senators argued against "artificial caps on the length of treatment" for people with mental disorders.
"For too long," the senators said, "standard health insurance plans have imposed arbitrary restrictions on treatment for mental and addictive disorders. Such discriminatory policies are based on stigma and outmoded assumptions about these illnesses."
White House documents show that Mr. Clinton's plan would require all insurers and employers to cover some mental health services. For treatment in a hospital or a group home, the required coverage would be "30 days per episode," or spell of mental illness, up to a total of 60 days a year.
Limits would be stricter for services outside a hospital. Insurance provided in the basic benefits package would cover part of the cost for 30 visits to a psychotherapist; White House documents say that in many cases the patient would have to pay half the cost. A patient's initial visit to a psychotherapist would not be subject to this limit.
 
Dental Service for Children
 Under Mr. Clinton's plan, the initial package of benefits would include dental services for children under 18 years old. In the year 2000, when dental benefits may be extended to adults, low-income people may pay as little as $20 for each visit to a dentist. Other patients would be expected to pay 40 percent of each dental bill, up to a total of $1,500 a year.
But even in the year 2000, patients would generally be expected to pay 20 percent of the cost of the first 12 sessions with a psychotherapist and 50 percent for subsequent visits.
The documents list routine physical examinations among the services that may not be covered till the year 2000. In that year, the documents say, the Government may require employers and insurers to cover "periodic medical examinations: every three years for individuals age 20 to 39, every two years for adults age 40 to 65 and annually for adults age 65 or more."
Ira C. Magaziner, the President's health policy coordinator, has said the White House was considering explicit controls on doctors' fees, hospital rates and drug prices as a temporary measure to curb health spending.
But today, when asked if the idea of short-term price controls was dead, Mr. Clinton said: "They never were alive. I never embraced them."

HEADLINE: A New Information Mass Market

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch's acquisition of Delphi Internet Services, a gateway to the global Internet computer network, may be the clearest indication yet that businesses are eager to tap into a market of computer users that is growing by as many as a million new customers a month.
When the News Corporation, of which Mr. Murdoch is chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday that it would buy Delphi, an on-line computer service, the company said it planned to offer many of its newspapers and magazines in electronic form over the Internet. It was one of many recent moves helping to lift the company's stock. [Market Place, page D4.] 
 The Murdoch deal followed by one week the announcement that Continental Cablevision, the nation's third-largest cable TV company, would join forces with Performance Systems International Inc., the largest private provider of Internet services, to offer hundreds of thousands of telecommuters connections to the Internet via Continental's cable network.
The Internet is an ad hoc amalgamation of thousands of individual computer networks that are interconnected by a routing language that permits them to exchange messages and share data. Most industry estimates say that more than 15 million computer users are now connected to the Internet, and that as many as one million new users a month are learning how to employ it for work or recreation.
The international reach of its tentacles is awesome to consider. But the scramble by big media corporations may miss a fundamental point: deep pockets and mass-media savvy are no guarantee of commercial success in the quirky, anarchistic world of the Internet.
"The Internet is now big enough that it qualifies as a mass market," said Vinton Cerf, president of the Internet Society in Reston, Va., an organization that sets network standards. "This strikes fear and anger into many people who live in this piece of cyberspace."
It is the fear of being late to the party that has communications and publishing companies rushing to repackage their products digitally for the new information economy.
"People are just beginning to realize the implications of the fact that anything can be digitized," said Stephen Wolff, director of the network division of the National Science Foundation. "The Internet is the universal communications medium of the future."
But as big companies discover the Internet, they will find that the Net, as it is known, is already a thriving electronic marketplace for thousands of mom-and-pop electronic ventures and tiny cottage businesses.
One of the newest examples is the Global Network Navigator, offered by O'Reilly & Associates, a small book publisher in Sebastopol, Calif. The Navigator is a software program that is part interactive magazine, part book catalogue and part computer dashboard for retrieving information in the Internet. Because no one is yet certain what the electronic magazine of the future will look like, dozens of ventures are trying to develop innovative and interactive alternatives to today's paper-based publications.
 
No Guarantees for Success
 Even officials at the News Corporation acknowledge that size and economic influence in themselves will not guarantee that large publishers eventually displace smaller start-ups in an environment where any computer connected to the network can serve as an electronic publishing house. But they say that their ability to use other media to promote their Internet products will give them an edge.
"We certainly have the power to promote what we build," said John Evans, president of News and Electronic Data Inc., a News Corporation subsidiary in Clinton, N.J.
"Today people buy bits of dead cellulose and have an emotional experience," he said, referring to the print media. "Maybe there's a way to use a piece of dead silicon instead."
The growth of the Internet is also shaking up telecommunications providers, because it is largely based on a different pricing model than previous data- and voice-transmission services.
While commercial electronic mail services have typically priced their services on a per-message basis, Internet services are usually priced on a monthly flat-rate basis. This tends to make it more economical to offer messaging and information services, and encourages customers to make greater use of the network than they would on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The potential impact can be seen in a small Washington-based company, the Internet Multicasting Service, which recently introduced an Internet facsimile service that will effectively bypass the long-distance telephone network and charge much lower rates. To encourage Internet computer hubs to serve as local relay points for this fax network, the company allows these hosts to sell local advertising that can be displayed on the bottom third of the fax cover sheet. Larger national advertisers are also being offered advertising space.
 
Proven Marketing Uses
 As the bandwidth -- the carrying capacity -- of the Internet increases, and it becomes as feasible to send voice conversations and video as it now is to transmit data, the Internet is certain to have a far greater impact on the traditional communications carriers. And the Internet has already demonstrated its power as a marketing channel, particularly for software.
"The Internet has a tremendous reputation as a market that's a channel for connecting with people with a need for products and information," said Christopher Locke, editor of the Internet Business Report, an industry newsletter in Manhasset, L.I.
One company using the Internet to help sell its product is Qualcomm Inc., a San Diego-based digital communications company. Last week Qualcomm began marketing a commercial version of an electronic mail program called Eudora, which was once offered for free to Internet users. The program is popular among habitues of the Net for its ease of use and power.
The program, which will sell for $50, is already being used by more than 100,000 electronic mail users and Qualcomm executives said they were confident that many of them would purchase the commercial version, which has additional features.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Los Angeles Times Weighs Sale of Headquarters

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Pressed for cash in a depressed California regional economy, the Times Mirror Company, publisher of The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, is considering selling its downtown Los Angeles headquarters and moving to a high-rise office tower, people familiar with the plan said today.
Officials of Times Mirror said today that they had hired a consultant to conduct a feasibility study of the cost advantages in moving but that no decision to relocate had been made. 
 The headquarters complex, known as Times Mirror Square, is situated on more than a square block, a valuable area running mainly from First to Second Street and from Spring Street to Broadway, across from City Hall. It consists of three connected buildings and two parking garages. The Los Angeles Times is largely written and edited there, and most business operations are there, too.
Times Mirror is a large and diverse company that publishes other daily and weekly papers, including The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant, and owns television stations and specialty publishing companies.
The Los Angeles Times has occupied the downtown site for more than 55 years, but is now facing a severe advertising slump that has forced it to cut costs. Much of the space in the complex is in disrepair, and fixing it could be far more costly than renting space elsewhere, those familiar with the plan said. The offices were built in the 1930's, 40's and 70's.
Still, selling the headquarters, particularly the signature building, which is identifiable at night by huge lighted letters reading "The Times," is a drastic step, and it underscores a tenuous financial condition.
In the first half of the year, advertising revenue at The Los Angeles Times was $374 million, compared with $406 million in the first half of 1992. Ad revenue for Times Mirror's Eastern newspapers was $336 million, compared with $330 million in the corresponding period last year.
Since its peak in 1990, advertising revenue has fallen 15 percent. The Los Angeles Times's publisher, David Laventhol, said today that no improvement in advertising was foreseen in the next year.
In the second quarter of 1993, Times Mirror had net income of $47.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $44.1 million, or 34 cents a share, in the period last year.
Last month, rumors circulated that the paper had put its headquarters up for sale. But Times Mirror said then that it had not approached any potential buyers and was simply responding to requests made from time to time by brokers and developers about relocating, since it no longer printed the paper there.
Officials of the company said today, in confirming that a relocation consultant had been hired, that they were talking as well with a real estate developer, John Cushman, and with brokers.
Mr. Laventhol, who is also president of the Times Mirror Company, said it would be a mistake to think that selling Times Mirror Square was a centerpiece of the paper's efforts to cut costs. Asked why rumors of the sale had created such a stir in recent weeks, he said: "I don't think they have. We all know that change is a challenge for a lot of people, and where there's the possibility of change taking place, they react to it."
And Martha Goldstein, Times Mirror's corporate communications director, said of the reports, "We have not made a decision, nor do we have a timetable for making a decision."
But commercial real estate brokers here said the company was in serious negotiations to sell the complex to the Metropolitan Water District, which is looking for new space in the civic-center district.
Robert Gomperz, a spokesman for the water district, said it has had preliminary contacts with Times Mirror about possibly acquiring the square but that no hard negotiations have taken place. It is also considering other options, such as building a new facility or leaving downtown altogether, he said.
In addition, the brokers said Times Mirror had been involved in talks to lease space at Security Pacific Plaza, a major corporate office tower a few blocks away.
Some reporters and editors of The Los Angeles Times have expressed glee at the prospects of moving to a modern building, describing their current work place as a "dump," where the plumbing does not work and they are harassed by beggars and transients on the street.
Others, especially some who have been at the paper for a long time, said they were saddened that The Los Angeles Times would even consider moving, given the history and traditions of the downtown building.
Ms. Goldstein, the Times Mirror spokeswoman, said the buildings were in "above average" condition for structures their age.
Newspaper analysts said that relocating the headquarters was a viable cost-cutting choice that Times Mirror was smart to consider. In other cost-related moves, the paper has closed its San Diego edition and significantly reduced its staff through buyouts.

HEADLINE: Texaco Gets Aid to Invest In Russia

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The United States and Russia have put together a fund to encourage American companies to invest in Russia, and in a White House signing ceremony yesterday Texaco became the first beneficiary.
The oil company, which has an $80 million project to restore the production of 150 dormant wells in the giant Sutormin field in western Siberia, concluded an agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency, which will provide $28 million of loan guarantees and insurance against political risk for the effort. 
 OPIC helps American businesses invest in developing nations, and one of its major goals is to support economic change in formerly Communist nations. Since 1971 the agency has supported investment worth about $60 billion.
 
Dual Policy Goal
 The agency is prepared to provide up to $2.5 billion in new loans, loan guarantees, equity and insurance in the next year to support private investment in Russia.
Increased investment by the oil industry serves a dual policy goal -- not only bolstering relations with Russia, but also providing an alternative to importing from the Middle East. Many analysts have warned of potential political risks in overdependence on the Mideast oil producers.
Under yesterday's agreement, an investment fund has been set up by the Russian Government, which will contribute $25 million; $50 million more will be guaranteed by OPIC.
Ruth R. Harkin, the president of OPIC, said the Texaco agreement was "a pioneer project in a long line of U.S. projects for U.S. companies contemplating the vast opportunities in the Russian oil and gas sector."
The agreement was signed at the White House, and the ceremony was attended by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia.
The fund is the first of its kind, and it is hoped that it will eventually generate several hundred million dollars of investment in Russia by helping to overcome the reluctance of American companies to invest there because of political uncertainties.
Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., Texaco's chairman and chief executive, who signed the agreement yesterday, said that OPIC "is a valuable resource for U.S. companies making investments in newly independent states."
Texaco has overcome a major stumbling block to investment in Russia by being paid in dollars from oil that is exported by Sutorminskneft, a western Siberian oil and gas production association.
United States oil companies have put their toe into Russia, but are still wary and are seeking ways to operate in spite of this.
 
Texaco's Current Operation
 Texaco estimated that the project would bring $76 million to the United States, helping the balance of payments.
The company has about a dozen employees there and has helped restore the production of nine wells generating about 4,000 barrels a day. When completed, the project will help restore the production of about 30,000 barrels a day.
Russian petroleum production has fallen as fields have stopped operating and replacement parts have been hard to obtain. The Russians are making a major effort to restore production to generate convertible foreign currency, which they need to buy imported goods and otherwise spur the economy.
Through the first two years of production, it is estimated that the project will generate $62 million in foreign exchange for Russia.
 
Russia Serves a Need
 Major foreign oil companies are seeking ties with Russia because it has huge and promising undeveloped reserves. The oil companies are under pressure to build up reserves at a time when many have given up exploration in other areas.
Texaco's project is an important step in moving toward larger investments in long-term exploration for new fields.
The company has an agreement with Russia to explore in the Timan-Pechora area in Siberia over the next 50 years, where reserves could turn out to be about five billion barrels.
Texaco, through its subsidiary Texaco International Operations Inc., signed its agreement with Russia in March to restore production at the field, which lies about 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle and 1,500 miles from Moscow. About 40 percent of the wells were idle at the time.

HEADLINE: Medical Issues Shine On Mixed Trading Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed in heavy trading yesterday, bolstered by drug issues and low interest rates but held back by weakness in airline and cyclical stocks.
Reports that President Clinton had backed away from cost controls as part of the Government's proposed health care program led investors on a shopping spree for drug stocks. Pfizer's settlement of liability cases in California related to a heart valve added a lift to the group. 
 Airline issues came under pressure as investors focused on the industry's financial plight and weak profitability. Another group under siege was the high-technology sector, mostly on profit taking.
 
Weaker Factory Orders
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19 points, to 3,626.10, pulled down by Alcoa, Caterpillar, General Motors, and International Paper. These and other cyclical issues, which are sensitive to the economy's direction, were hurt by the Commerce Department's report of weaker-than-expected factory orders in July.
Drug stocks and health maintenance organizations, which are well represented on the Nasdaq, pushed the Nasdaq composite index up 2.50 points, to 748.65, its fourth straight record closing high. The American Stock Exchange was the only other index to close at a high.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 259.9 million shares, up from 246.6 million traded on Wednesday. The number of issues trading lower outpaced gainers by 1,033 to 945.
Among medical issues, Merck rose 1 5/8, to 33 1/8; Bristol-Myers Squibb 7/8, to 57; American Home Products 1/2, to 64 5/8, and SmtihKline 1 3/8, to 30 1/8.
Renewed interest in the medical stocks also rallied shares of HMO companies. U.S. Healthcare added 2 7/8, to 47 1/8; Oxford Health 6 3/8, to 72 1/2; United Health 3, to 62 1/8, and Coventry 2, to 32.
Pfizer gained 2 on the day to close at 64 3/4, after the news of the settlement of most cases and claims concerning the Bjork-Shiley heart valve. The company said it did not see any material adverse affect on its financial condition.
Medimmune, however, fell 4 5/8, to 19 1/8, in active trading. The company reported that the Food and Drug Administration had postponed a review of product license applications for its Respivir drug.
 
Retailing Report
 Elsewhere, retailers reported mixed sales for August. Wal-Mart, fell to 24 3/4, down 1, and J. C. Penney dropped 3/4, to 41 1/8. Sears, Roebuck, however, gained 3/8, to 54 3/4, and the Bombay Company rose 1 5/8, to 44 1/8.
Avon Products fell 4 5/8, to 54 7/8, on a sluggish earnings forecast.
Western Waste rose 3, to 20, after the environmental-control company agreed to be acquired by Browning-Ferris in a stock swap. Traders said there was some talk that Browning-Ferris, down 1 1/4, to 23 5/8, was paying a premium for Western Waste. The swap calls for Browning-Ferris to exchange 1.02 shares of its common for each share of Western Waste.
Shares of Chipsoft, the personal finance and tax-preparation software company, fell 1 1/2, to 13 3/4, after its agreement to be acquired by Intuit,, another software company. Intuit was down 1/8, to 32 1/8.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Prime Minister Installs His Cabinet

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 2,

 BODY:
With Haiti's military high command among the witnesses, Prime Minister Robert Malval installed his Cabinet today and formally ended nearly two years of military rule.
"It is perhaps our last chance as a nation," Mr. Malval said in a ceremony at the National Palace, where the Army arrested President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991 and sent him into exile. 
 Under an accord signed July 3 by Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Father Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, is to be restored to power on Oct. 30.
International sanctions were suspended last week after Haiti's Parliament approved Mr. Malval as Prime Minister.
In a brief address, Mr. Malval, who was selected by Father Aristide, urged the military to join civilians in combating "the enemies of change."
"Together we can check these acts of banditry and vandalism that leave families mourning and discredit our country," he said.
Among the diplomats present was Dante Caputo, the United Nations special envoy who played a crucial role in the peace accord. Mr. Caputo came to Haiti to discuss the resumption of economic aid, which was suspended after the coup, and a proposed 1,000-member United Nations police and military aid mission.
The United States will have a much greater role in the United Nations mission than originally thought: the Pentagon is to pay for the group reforming the Army, and the Justice Department is to pay for the program to establish a civilian police force.

HEADLINE: Fall in Business Confidence

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Business executives' confidence in the economy fell in August to the lowest level since just after the recession, the United States Chamber of Commerce said today.
Martin A. Regalia, the group's chief economist, said the drop in the chamber's bimonthly confidence index reflected "the economy's inability to develop any real momentum." 
 The business confidence index fell to 45.6 in August from 47.7 in June and 59.3 in April. It was the lowest level since the index hit 39.3 in December 1991, six months after the recession ended.
An index reading of 50 or more indicates moderate economic growth. A reading of 70 or more signals strong growth.
"In addition to their concern over the economy's failure to generate significant job growth, businesses are unsure of the Administration's economic plan and are worried about future regulatory and health care costs," Mr. Regalia said.
Of the 8,280 businesses surveyed for the latest index, 13.9 percent said the economy would improve in the next six months, 48.6 percent said it was in decline and 37.5 percent said it would hold its own.
Executives were a bit more optimistic about sales: 36.8 percent expected an increase, 25.1 percent a decline and 38.1 percent no change. On employment, 17 percent expected an increase, 20.6 percent a drop and 48.2 percent no change.

HEADLINE: On Bosnia Talks: Hoping to Bridge a Slender Gap

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept 2

 BODY:
Despite the breakdown of the latest peace talks on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the three warring parties were apparently so close to agreement Wednesday night that diplomats here are still hopeful that Bosnia's Muslims, Serbs and Croats will try again soon to end their war.
After Bosnian Serbs rejected an earlier peace plan this spring, the immediate result was an upsurge in fighting between Serbs and Muslims and between Croats and Muslims, with the Muslims scoring their first significant military successes against the Croats in central Bosnia. 
 This time, however, while the danger of increased warfare exists, all three parties have pledged to respect a shaky cease-fire and, perhaps most important, the Bosnian Serb forces appear to have no interest in occupying more than the 70 percent of Bosnian territory they now hold.
 
Willing to Return
 Further, although the Muslims in the end refused to endorse a peace agreement drawn up by international mediators, they as well as the Serbs and Croats insisted that the plan is "still on the table" and that they are willing to return to Geneva for more talks.
"I would say that it's not a time to be pessimistic," a senior United States official said. "There is no reason to despair at this point. Yes, we're disappointed, but we hope the parties will come back as soon as possible to complete this negotiation."
President Clinton warned today that NATO could still carry out air strikes against Serb positions if the shelling of Sarajevo resumed. But diplomats here discounted any military intervention while an agreement to end the 17-month-old war was still within reach.
All sides have already agreed to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina into three autonomous ethnic republics with a weak central government.
 
New Demands
 But, while the Serbs and Croats accepted a map prepared by the European Community's Lord Owen and the United Nations envoy, Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Muslims returned to the negotiations here this week with new demands for additional territory.
The map would give the Muslims 30 percent of the territory against the 10 percent the Bosnian Government now controls, while the Serbs, who occupy 70 percent, would retain slightly more than 52 percent. The Bosnian Croats now control 20 percent and would be left with almost 18 percent
But Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated government, argued that the map "rewarded" Serb aggression and "ethnic cleansing" and he claimed about 4 percent more land in eastern and north-western Bosnia as well as part of Neum, Bosnia's only Adriatic port.
During talks with the mediators Wednesday, the Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, offered a two-mile-wide corridor -- instead of the Muslim-controlled highway proposed under the peace plan -- linking the Srebrenica-Zepa enclave and Gorazde. The Croat leader, Mate Boban, in turn said the Muslims could buy land in Neum and build their own port.
 
Pressed for Flexibility
 Diplomats said that both Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, and Franjo Tudjman, the President of Croatia pressured Dr. Karadzic and Mr. Boban respectively to be flexible. But when no new offers were forthcoming last night, Mr. Izetbegovic refused to sign the draft agreement.
The question now is: What can the Muslims do to force the Serbs and Croats to meet their demands? One month ago, Mr. Izetbegovic still hoped for NATO air strikes.
But there were no air strikes and, with the Serbs having eased the siege of Sarajevo in recent weeks, there may be no immediate justification for such an action. "The Serbs will do nothing to give anyone an excuse for air strikes," one United Nations official said. "They're going to be very careful."
Today, Dr. Karadzic forgot all his earlier threats to crush the Muslims if they failed to accept the agreement, pledging to respect the cease-fire and calling on the international community to encourage all parties "not to miss this opportunity for peace."
"No one can understand why the Muslims should fight if they're doing better at the bargaining table," he went on. "Honestly, I could not believe that the Muslims were refusing this honest offer, which was fair and meant a way out without winners or losers. We still hope the Muslims will sign."
 
Talking in Turkey
 Unable to change the military balance on their own, the Muslims can now only hope to win new concessions through diplomatic pressure. Today, Mr. Izetbegovic flew to Istanbul for talks with Turkey's President, Suleyman Demirel, a strong ally of the Bosnian Muslim cause. Mr. Izetbegovic also plans to travel to New York to address the United Nations Security Council on Monday.
So far, however, while Islamic countries have repeatedly urged both the Security Council and Western powers to use force to stop Serb attacks, the United States, Russia and the European Community have preferred not to interfere in the negotiations.
The senior United States official reiterated today that it was up to the warring parties to reach an agreement. But he also blamed the "intransigence" of the Serbs and Croats in refusing to give "that extra bit."
"It's in the hands of those who have taken territory by force to make the necessary moves to present a solution acceptable to those who have little force," the official noted, adding the Serbs and Croats were asked to make "a very minimum addition" to what was already agreed.
Diplomats said they expected Washington and European Community to send the message to Bosnia's Serbs and Croats as well as to Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Tudjman that they will not accept a resurgence of warfare and that they insist on an early political settlement.
In this, they have two potential weapons: the promise that economic sanctions against Serbia will be lifted as soon as a peace accord is implemented in good faith and the suggestion that an early agreement could protect senior Serbian and Croatian leaders from being brought before a planned international war crimes tribunal.
For the moment, though, the mediators are taking a wait-and-see attitude. "There's a feeling that public opinion in Bosnia may express itself," Lord Owen said after the talks broke up. "People are war-weary, fed up that their politicians don't get on with settling the conflict. Perhaps people will demand peace."

HEADLINE: Sumburgh Journal;
As Oil Calamities Go, Shetland Spill Was a Wimp

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUMBURGH HEAD, Shetland Is lands, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Braer's giant steel hull has been smashed and scattered by the long Atlantic swells. Only its blunt prow remains intact, tilted at a broken angle from the boiling surf where the tanker was driven aground in January, spilling its cargo of 630,000 barrels of oil.
But shoreward of the wreck, along a narrow cleft in the steep coastline that only last winter was oiled black and stinking with petroleum, there is nothing to suggest that this ragged headland had been the site of one of the biggest tanker accidents in a decade. 
 Instead, less than 200 yards from the broken ship, more than 100 gray seals now bob and tumble in the clear sea, or bask on rocky islands at the foot of cliffs dotted with the nests of seabirds. Overhead, white fulmars and black-tipped gannets wheel and dive over a ruggedly scenic coast that remains home to one of the largest seabird colonies in Europe.
Atop the sheer headland overlooking the wreck, in treeless pasture stippled with sea pink, a heather flower, Les Fishman, a tourist from southern England, watched the seals playing near the ship and shook his head in wonder.
 
Why Damage Was Limited
 "It's amazing, but in a way, it also belies the situation," Mr. Fishman said. "I think we are just very lucky it was not much worse."
Scientists cautiously acknowledge that they do not know what kinds of hidden, long-term effects the oil spill might yet have on the islands, and are still carefully monitoring everything from bird breeding populations to the blood chemistry of residents who inhaled the gagging oil-tainted mist that storm winds carried over the island for several days last winter.
But nearly eight months after one of the fiercest winter storms in memory pounded the helpless Braer onto rocks at the southern tip of these remote islands, 200 miles north of Aberdeen, and broke apart her tanks, the environmental and economic effect of the accident remains surprisingly muted, even though the volume of oil lost here was more than twice the amount spilled onto the Alaska coast by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
The Alaska accident fouled a sheltered wildlife estuary with a thick, tar-like crude, but the oil pouring from the Braer was much lighter and thinner. At the same time, the very winds and pounding seas that doomed the Braer also kept the spill from forming large shorebound slicks; instead, the leaking oil was scattered and dispersed by the constant churning of 30-foot seas.
Much of the oil was carried away from the islands by deep sea currents. An extensive survey last spring revealed that the largest patches -- about 30 percent of the Braer's total cargo -- are now mixed in muddy bottom sediments in two separate ocean basins covering hundreds of square miles, far to the west and the southeast of the islands.
Only a small portion of the oil was washed ashore, and wildlife specialists who have combed the Shetlands' rugged and windswept coasts say they have yet to find evidence that the spill here has cost the life of a single sea mammal. Although surveys taken last January counted half a dozen dead seals and sea otters, scientists now say those deaths were unrelated to the spill.
Moreover, because few of the Shetland bird colonies breed here in the winter, the oil accounted for only limited and highly localized damage to the islands' vast colonies of seabirds.
"The population of shag and eiders were down near the wreck," said Peter Ellis, the Shetland representative for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. "But otherwise, we had a reasonably good breeding season over the summer, and the overall effect appears remarkably light."
But Mr. Ellis says further monitoring is essential to measure whether contamination of seabeds has done long-term damage to the population of sand eels and other marine animals on which the seabirds feed.
So far, more than $16 million in claims have been paid out to local islanders from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Most of the money has gone to salmon fisherman and salmon farmers up the coast from the wreck, where the rainbow sheen of oil spreading from the ship tainted their stock and has forced them to destroy two seasons worth of fish.
In the island capital of Lerwick, a picturesque coastal village about 30 miles north of here, officials say they have extracted promises from the British Government to install maritime radar systems that will monitor the passage of tankers and other ships in the busy shipping channels around the islands.
The Braer was passing south of the islands in January when the tanker lost engine power and began drifting helplessly toward the rocky southern coast. While rescue teams managed to save the ship's 34-man crew, they say they could have towed the tanker free of danger as well, if they'd had more warning that the ship was in trouble.
Among the islands' 23,000 residents, most agree that so far the relatively limited nature of the damage has been almost too good to believe. "Everyone knows it could have been so much worse," said Mark Donaldson, who owns the Sumburgh Hotel, less than two miles from the scene of the wreck. "But I think people are still a bit wary; they want to know for sure everything will turn out all right."

HEADLINE: Home Is Where the Profits Are;
Suburbanites Reap the Benefits of a Weak Economy as Entrepreneurs Come Calling

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOCUST VALLEY, L.I., Sept. 2

 BODY:
On Sunday mornings, sporting a black wet suit and neon fins, Harry Triola of Fort Salonga, L.I., flip-flops over to his neighbor's swimming pool, where he meets Nicholas Martielli, his personal scuba-diving instructor.
At least three nights a week, Eric Swenson, an estates and trusts lawyer, sets himself apart from the competition by writing clients a complete will, in the privacy of their living rooms, for $99. 
 On Thursday afternoons, Carol Shapiro of Glen Cove, a physical therapist who makes house calls, runs home to meet Terry Tetro of Franklin Square. For $18, she enjoys a manicure and pedicure while sitting at her kitchen table.
Increasingly, suburbanites across the metropolitan area are finding that they can get almost any service they need at home, and often for no more than it would cost elsewhere.
The market is there, experts say, because many families, especially two-career couples, have long had trouble finding the time for routine chores like buying groceries and picking up the dry cleaning. But the phenomenon also reflects a weak economy in which people are looking for new ways to make money or trying to keep busy after being laid off.
"It's partly due to a weak economy, but it's also an entrepreneurial spirit that is driving this," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It is part of the growth of the service industry. A lot of people who see a tough job market out there are looking around for a new niche in the service economy."
Entrepreneurs and small businesses are scrambling to fill such niches, offering every service from food shopping to dog grooming. Freshly picked vegetables, all-natural granola, even a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream is just a phone call away.
There are mobile dog groomers, mobile boat repairmen and mobile car repairmen, and for $22 someone will even come to the house and clean the barbecue grill.
"People don't have a lot of time to take care of their household chores and personal needs," said Peter Lambert, a researcher at the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "Because of the economy, both husband and wife are working. They are working longer hours, many of them are working two jobs to afford their mortgage and all their other expenses."
The same phenomenon is apparent elsewhere.
"I see a definite trend" said Gary Levine, executive director of the Fairfield, Conn., Chamber of Commerce. "I don't think people have time to make their own dinner anymore, but now you can order from a gourmet restaurant and they will deliver."
Brad M. King, an insurance broker in Manhattan who spends summers in Southampton, is an enthusiastic user of the services in the home.
 
Poolside Service
 "It's great," he said, "Everything is available at our convenience, it's done on our time. It's a great way of differentiating a service from the other guys and it gives them a competitive edge."
Mr. Triola, a mortgage and securities broker in Manhattan, said he was thrilled when he learned that he could become certified in scuba diving at a neighbor's home. "I work crazy hours. I commute and don't get home until after 7 P.M. I want to have time to spend with my wife and the kids, and that means that I cannot sign up for a scuba course at one of the local Y's."
Mr. Martielli, the scuba instructor, said he would be in a real bind without his personal-service business. Last year, he was laid off from his job as a lab manager at the New York Institute of Technology when the school's Islip campus closed. Now he works as a private tutor of math, physics, chemistry and scuba diving.
"I was glad to have my tutoring and scuba business," he said. "It's not like I am making money, but it has a lot of potential. If I could get booked up for the entire summer, I could earn up to $1,000 a week."
Two years ago, Scott Beagelman and Scott Fletcher of Glen Cove and Paul Jacobs of Dix Hills graduated from college and wanted to go into the restaurant business, but did not have the money. Instead, they offered meals from local restaurants delivered for a $2 service charge by a driver decked out in a black tuxedo and white shirt -- thus the company name, Black Tie Express.
The company has served well over 100,000 meals on Long Island and has helped other young entrepreneurs open operations in five states: Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Three weeks ago, the company opened an operation in Westchester County and "already we have over 400 customers," said Mr. Fletcher.
"People call us from the car, give us their order, and say, I'll meet you in my driveway in 30 minutes," he said. "People love the service, because they just don't have free time anymore. They come home, they are tired and they would rather not cook."
 
So Much to Be Done
 Mr. Beagelman said the company plans to offer other services soon, including picking up dry cleaning, prescription drugs, videotapes, groceries and pets from the groomer, and taking mail to the post office. It will even make trips to the motor vehicles department.
Terry Tetro, the manicurist, said: "When I started the service, I just wanted to make some extra money, but it turned out to be something I really like. People like it because it is a little more personable and it's away from the hectic atmosphere of the salon."
Doctors, veterinarians, chiropractors, even psychiatrists are making home visits. Susan Estep, a massage therapist at a chiropractor's office in New Hyde Park, said she earns a large portion of her income traveling with her massage table to people's homes.
"Most of my clients are overworked and stressed out," she explained. "When the recession hit, my business really picked up. People that decided to save their money and not take their vacations were really stressed out about it. That made them tense, so they used the money they saved to get a massage."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Will Mattresses Take Their Lumps?;
And Now the Innkeepers Are Critiquing the Rooms

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Move over Mobil and the American Automobile Association, a new entrant will start rating hotels: Days Inn of America, the economy chain that says it is the nation's largest hotel franchiser.
But instead of awarding lodging properties one to five stars (as do Mobil's guides) or one to five diamonds (A.A.A.'s Tour Books), Days Inn -- in keeping with its corporate sunburst logo -- will award as many as five sunbursts. And rather than have independent evaluators rate a range of hotels, Days Inn's own quality-assurance department will rate only the company's 1,400 properties. 
 To allay suspicion that this is the ratings equivalent of the fox guarding the henhouse or employees writing their own evaluation reports, Days Inn said its ratings system had "tough standards" based on three detailed inspections a year. The ratings are based on scores measured on a 500-point system, with anything below 370 points unrated. Three sunbursts or more requires at least 425 points.
Based on incomplete results for this year, the company said, 217 Days Inn lodgings would qualify for the five-sunburst ranking, and an additional 1,125 would score three or more. Thus, Days Inn ranks 96 percent of the properties above average.
"But most of the properties get pretty much the same grades from the A.A.A.," said Brian Feldman, public relations manager of Days Inn. "So it's not just our ratings system." Jerry Cheske, an A.A.A. spokesman, said the auto club awarded only 48 properties across North America five diamonds in 1993.
Days Inn also said it would not hesitate to downgrade any property that does not measure up. "A bad rating will force our franchises to improve," Mr. Feldman said.
The ratings will be published next spring in the almost two million directories the company publishes twice yearly, and customers can request individual hotel ratings when they call the company's reservations system.
Meanwhile, hotel guests might do well to remember that five diamonds, five stars and five sunbursts are not necessarily one and the same.

HEADLINE: Police Identify 13th Body As Victim of L.I. Killer

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Body parts found last summer in the waterways around New York City have been identified as those of a 20-year-old Manhattan woman who the police believe was among 18 women killed by Joel Rifkin.
The body of the woman, Violet O'Neill, is the 13th that the police have identified and linked to Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper who the authorities say has confessed to the murders of 17 women, many of whom were prostitutes. Another body is still unidentified, and four women believed to be among his victims are still missing, the police said. 
 The body parts belonging to Ms. O'Neill were identified through D.N.A. tests, said Detective Joseph McConville, a New York City police spokesman. Last week, the victim's mother, Victoria O'Neill, and a sister supplied their own blood and other tissue samples for the tests, the mother said today.
 
Three Grisly Discoveries
 Officer Peter Friscia, another police spokesman, said the body parts were found over three days in July 1992. On July 22, a torso wrapped in a plastic bag was found in the Harlem River at East 123d Street. Three days later, arms and a left leg were found wrapped in plastic in a suitcase in the East River at 23d Street, and a right leg was found in the water near Governors Island two days after that.
Mr. Rifkin, of East Meadow, is being held without bail at the Nassau County Jail, where he is awaiting trial in the one murder with which he has been charged, that of Tiffany Bresciani. The body of the 22-year-old Ms. Bresciani was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck on June 28 by state troopers who had chased his vehicle and pulled him over in Mineola for a routine traffic violation.
In a telephone interview, Victoria O'Neill of Manhattan said she last saw her daughter on July 16, 1992, when Violet was staying with her grandmother on East Eighth Street. After her disappearance, the family distributed fliers bearing her description and asking anyone with information about her to come forward.
The mother said that Violet had a 6-year-old son, but declined to offer more details about her life.
"My daughter was a very beautiful girl," Ms. O'Neill said. "The only thing that makes me feel a little better is to think that perhaps she didn't die in pain."
She added, however, that she was upset that the identification had taken so long. Last year, she said, the police had told her that some of the body parts might have belonged to her daughter. But no one followed up until the recent developments in the Rifkin case, she said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Fell 2.1% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Orders to American factories dropped 2.1 percent in July, the biggest decline in 19 months, as demand for aircraft and communications equipment plunged, the Commerce Department said today.
Despite the decline and other signs of economic sluggishness in the July-September quarter, including sluggish retail sales for August, the job market continues to show evidence of a slow but steady revival. 
 The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 7,000 last week, to 324,000, the lowest since the week that ended on Feb. 6. More important, the less volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims fell by 3,750, to 327,500, the lowest level since September 1989.
 
 
Unemployment Report Is Due
 Economists suspect that a report due out on Friday will show that the nation's unemployment rate ticked up to 6.9 percent in August from 6.8 percent in July. But it should soon start to show gradual improvement, they said.
Factory orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $250.2 billion in July. It was the worst decline since December 1991 and the fifth in seven months. Orders had risen 2.9 percent in June.
"Manufacturing is certainly languishing," said Laurence H. Meyer, an economist who heads a consulting firm in St. Louis. "The industrial sector is struggling to even stay flat."
 An indicator of future factory employment -- the backlog of unfilled orders --suggested that manufacturing would not soon be an important source of new jobs. The backlog fell three-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $457.9 billion, the lowest level since September 1988. It was the fifth drop in a row and the 20th in 23 months.
A shrinking backlog is an indication that the current factory work force is having little difficulty keeping up with the flow of new orders.
Manufacturing has been weak this year, in part because domestic demand has been soft and because recessions in Europe and Japan have cut the export sales of American companies.
"In recent months, export growth has all but stopped," Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., said. "That's hurting a wide range of manufacturing from computers to chemicals. Right now that's the most significant impediment to manufacturing."
 
 
Better Job Growth
 Even though manufacturing has lagged compared with last year, job growth is better. It has been averaging 169,000 a month, more than double the 80,000 average of 1992. Most of the job growth, however, is at service companies, not manufacturing concerns.
In July, orders for transportation equipment fell 16.7 percent, more than reversing a 14.5 percent increase the month before. Aircraft orders plummeted 37.3 percent after rising 52.5 percent in June. Orders fell 10.8 percent for autos and were also down for railroad equipment.
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders edged up two-tenths of a percent in July after a 1.2 percent gain in June. But those back-to-back increases followed three consecutive drops.
Orders for military goods surged 18.7 percent. Excluding the military, orders fell 2.6 percent.
Durable goods manufacturers -- those making big-ticket items that are expected to last three or more years -- said orders fell 3.1 percent. Orders declined 1 percent for nondurable goods.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen; Investors Rush Into Marks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday but was mixed against European currencies as investors piled into the German mark, convinced that German interest rates would remain high and United States rates low.
Traders said investors were selling dollars and buying marks in part because of lackluster United States economic data issued this week. "It doesn't give a good feeling about the U.S. right now," said Jack Griffin, a vice president at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. 
 AS a result of the middling economic news, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates low, spurring the economy but also reducing the returns for investors holding United States dollars.
In contrast, the president of the German central bank warned yesterday against a "too rapid easing of our interest-rate policies." The remarks by Helmut Schlesinger indicated that investors would continue to benefit from high interest rates for mark-denominated investments.
Belgium's central bank raised short-term interest rates after speculators dumped the Belgian franc, betting the Government would not be able to hold to its policy of tightly pegging to the German mark.
 
Change in Policy Seen
 The dollar also continued to rise against the Japanese yen. Traders said the market had come around to the idea that the Federal Reserve was no longer pushing for a strong yen to fight the trade deficit. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive, and imports into that country cheaper.
The dollar was also helped by dollar-buying by the Japanese central bank during Asian trading, and heavy selling of yen for marks, a transaction often done through the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 105.50 yen, up 0.56 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 105.85 yen, up from 105.72. In New York, the dollar finished at 105.87 yen, up from 105.35 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5005, down from $1.5060 late Wednesday. Later, in New York, the pound was trading at $1.5030, cheaper than $1.5040 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold and Silver Off Sharply While Copper Prices Surge

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices hit a 16-week low yesterday as the sluggish economy continued to undercut investment demand for precious metals.
Silver futures also fell sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York. On other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply and soybeans rebounded. Grain futures and energy futures were mixed, while livestock futures rose. 
 Gold for October delivery dropped $6.30, to $364.50 a troy ounce, the contract's lowest daily settlement since May 11. The more heavily traded December contract also fell $6.30, to $366.30 a troy ounce.
September silver ended 17.1 cents lower at $4.568 a troy ounce after plunging early in the session to $4.38, the lowest price for near-term silver deliveries since June 23.
Silver led the decline on selling by Middle Eastern interests and individual speculators. Light trading before the Labor Day weekend enabled speculators to push silver prices down far enough to set off computer-driven selling by investment funds, analysts said.
The selloff was also driven by Government reports showing slumping manufacturing and lackluster retail sales.
"It's just been a solid two weeks of bad news -- or at least no good news for the industrial sector," said Ted Ryan, research director at the Chicago Corporation, an investment firm.
Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst at Prudential Securities, saw a positive sign in silver's recovery from the day's low.
"It means the funds were doing their technical thing; now we'll have to assess whether the fundamentals take over," she said. Investment funds trade mainly on technical factors like chart patterns and price trends. Fundamentals are basic supply-and-demand factors.
Mr. Ryan predicted a recovery in gold prices in October and November, based on the dollar's weakness against major European currencies.
September copper surged 3.05 cents on the Commodity Exchange to 86.45 cents a pound. Ms. Raptopoulos said the rally reflected perceptions of a potential for tighter supplies in the future.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, October light sweet crude oil ended unchanged at $17.97 a barrel, while October heating oil rose 0.08 cent, to 53.20 cents a gallon. October unleaded gasoline fell 0.34 cent, to 51.34 cents a gallon, and October natural gas rose 0.40 cent, to $2.406 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Finding a Whole World in 64 Squares

BYLINE: By WILL JOYNER

 BODY:
ON a recent Saturday afternoon in the thick of August, Manhattan was anything but deserted. The humidity was down, the sky was blue and an insistent breeze appeared to have convinced streams of people in Greenwich Village that a good mood was in order, that a distant beach wasn't a better place to be.
In the southwest corner of Washington Square Park stood the 19 chess tables that recently regained notoriety by way of the film "Searching for Bobby Fischer." The movie describes the early playing days of Josh Waitzkin, who is now a 16-year-old international master and ranked No. 1 in that age group in the United States. I was not looking for the next Josh Waitzkin. In the interest of exploring the chess world of New York City shown in "Bobby Fischer," I was simply trying to summon the nerve to play a game with one of the hustlers who threaded through the onlookers, competition clocks in hand, saying, "Speed chess, anyone?" 
 Sixty-four squares to a board, eight pieces and eight pawns to a side, five minutes a person to win. White goes first; then anything can happen.
At one of the tables, three men were engaged in a sort of round robin for a pot of "just a few dollars," one of them explained, with the money going to whoever prevailed in two consecutive games. A man who was wearing wraparound sunglasses and delivering his chatter in both English and Spanish was the hustler here. But the two others, a slight man with a beard and an academic type who easily fended off gibes about his Chinese origins, were clearly acquaintances of his, regulars on the scene.
The three played impressively and for the most part equally, maintaining decisiveness with the clock buttons and concentration on their positions despite a torrent of words that came at them from all around. ("Is he a master? He's a master of disaster.") What was most striking, though, was the respect they showed for one another, in spite of occasional tension. It was difficult to stop watching as they hurried to endgame after endgame, exchanging places and, from time to time, rumpled bills.
Earlier in the afternoon, in a brownstone just a few blocks north, a contest was under way in what is probably the opposite pole of New York's chess world, the understatedly stately Marshall Chess Club, which was founded in 1915 by Frank Marshall, the United States champion from 1909 until 1936. In a second-floor drawing room full of engraved trophies and era-hopping photographs, 20 players were in a competition of games timed at 15 minutes. Each would play eight games, then $175 would be apportioned, according to the players' United States Chess Federation ratings, to winners at various levels.
As these games proceeded, the only sound, beyond the clicking of the pieces and the tapping of the clock controls, was classical music coming from a small office filled with books, a desk and piles of documents. Sitting at the desk, Ron Young, an employee of the nonprofit club, said that Marshall members made up about half of the day's field.
As they finished a round, players stood up from the old wooden tables and quietly surrounded games still under way, or whispered insistent but polite analyses of one another's performances, waiting for Mr. Young to post the next pairings. In the sparely appointed entrance hall, an annotated national ranking of players under age 21 showed that 14 of the top 30 were Marshall members. These included 17-year-old Erez Klein of Forest Hills, Queens, who is ranked No. 14 and was progressing well in the day's event, having won his first two games. At No. 4 on the national list and No. 5 on a nearby overall club ranking was Josh Waitzkin.
 
Reality Behind a Film
 This exploration of the New York chess world began on Aug. 11 with the opening of the film "Searching for Bobby Fischer," which is based on Fred Waitzkin's book about his grappling with his son's gift in the mid-1980's as Josh, then 8, succeeded at the top rung of national scholastic chess competition. It's a story that examines the emotional tug between father and son and the fine line between pressure and support, a distinction I often ponder, having two sons. And with world-championship intrigue already swirling around two rival matches that are to begin next week, this film about the dawning of chess inspiration took on added meaning.
After my elder son, 6-year-old Luke, watched the movie, he said: "Just right, Dad. The best scene is where they kick the parents out of the competition hall and the kids cheer."
Although I first showed him the game, Luke quickly went beyond that instruction last year when he entered the Dalton School, which has an extensive chess program, administered by Svetozar Jovanovic, a Yugoslav emigre who is one of the most respected teachers for young people. Last spring, as we played in the evenings, Luke began to pass along Mr. Jovanovic's advice. I began to take the games more seriously and urged him to pay more attention. But it seemed that yet one more private thing had been thrown into the New York pressure cooker.
My father taught me chess, on a tiny peg set that he packed across Europe as a young soldier in World War II; those games were relaxing engagements. My games with Luke had become something different, and I wanted to understand why. The movie helped, but it couldn't explain everything about what Fred Waitzkin, whose new book is "Mortal Games: The Turbulent Genius of Gary Kasparov" (Putnam), described as "a self-contained little world full of fascinating people who are so needy and brilliant."
On a threatening weekday afternoon, Luke and I discovered a place for chess that was cool and not fraught with tension. The Chess and Checkers House is in the southern portion of Central Park, just across the Park Drive from the Carousel, on a hill above Wollman Rink. There is an actual brick house, which was closed, but in a circle around it, within an open, gazebolike structure, are 24 of the 2,048 stone chess tables the Department of Parks and Recreation estimates are in the city.
We placed our armies and began to play. The music of the Carousel drifted around us; the storm held off, and I proceeded to lose three games in a row.
At a table nearby, two men were playing, with a clock. At the end of a game, they explained that they were acquaintances and often played here together, but never arranged to meet. Joe Green, 50, said he lived nearby and came to the Chess and Checkers House almost every day, and played as a hobby. The stronger player, Mark Crawford, 25, of Flushing, Queens, said he worked in a nearby office building and occasionally came to play during his lunch hour.
As a teen-ager in Kingston, Jamaica, Mr. Crawford said, he played in tournaments and had a rating. He wants to return to tournament chess, but has no illusions about his prospects. "I started at 13, which was not young enough," he said. He inquired about Luke's age and, after hearing the reply, said, "That's the age to start."
 
Josh Waitzkin at 16
 The next day, I spoke by telephone with Fred and Josh Waitzkin, who were in the Bahamas, where their family fishes each summer. Fred -- who has a more animated voice than Joe Mantegna gives him in the movie, but the same focused friendliness -- was asked what he would do differently, looking back on his early days as a chess parent. His answer was surprising, but then made sense given Josh's progress since the time covered in the film.
"As Josh got older and better, I realized that a lot of my guilt was stupid," the writer said. "If I had it to do over again, I'd probably encourage him to study a little bit more, because what became clear is, there are no miracles here. If you're lucky in life, you're gifted in one or maybe two things. Then, it's work."
Josh Waitzkin, who also possesses a friendliness that resonates across a telephone line, also gave a surprising answer. As portrayed in the film by Max Pomeranc, a 9-year-old Manhattanite who is making his own way in tournament chess, Josh is a competitor who can win without a killer's instinct. What about the 16-year-old Josh?
"That's Utopia," he said. "There's a sad truth in the movie that you do have to hate your opponent, during the game. On a higher level, every psychological power goes into the game, to ripping your opponent apart."
This fall, Josh, an 11th grader, will transfer from Dalton to the Children's Professional School, hoping to find a more workable blend of academics and competition. During the school year, he works at chess about 16 hours a week. His teacher, Grigory Kaidanov, a 33-year-old grandmaster who immigrated to Lexington, Ky., from Moscow two years ago, flies to New York every five weeks for a four-day, 10-hour-a-day work session.
A couple of days later, I met Josh's first teacher, Bruce Pandolfini, who is portrayed by Ben Kingsley in "Searching for Bobby Fischer" as a small, hard man who bends just a bit in the face of Josh's amiability. The real Mr. Pandolfini, looking almost as youthful as he did in 1972 when he helped Shelby Lyman analyze the Bobby Fischer-Boris Spassky world-title match on PBS, is tall and lovable, amiability itself. Although he was up against a deadline for delivering the manuscript of his 18th book on chess, he bounced into a Broadway restaurant to discuss fledgling chess parents.
"The key ingredient is intelligent parental involvement: knowing when to withdraw when you're pressuring too much, but certainly pressuring to a point, if you want to succeed," he said. "If you don't show any interest, it's very hard for a child to push on with anything."
Should you let a child win?
"One approach is that you have to show them what is true about the world, that you've got to beat them," Mr. Pandolfini said. "That's ridiculous. What you're actually showing them is that the world can be sadistic.
"I think you should essentially let the child win. You can find creative approaches. One might be this: At the point when you're about to win, you could make it a problem and say, more or less honestly, 'Well, I think I can beat you now. If you can show me how, you win.' "
 
A New Chess Center
 Unlike the Bruce Pandolfini in the film, the real one has brought the game of chess to thousands of children. In addition to writing his books, he runs the chess programs at Trinity and several other private schools, and he still teaches, although to only about eight students at a time.
Perhaps his greatest influence, however, has been through the Manhattan Chess Club School, an outreach program now in more than 100 New York City public schools, which he was the primary designer for in 1985. It reached a special moment of glory in 1991, when the Raging Rooks of Adam Clayton Powell Junior High School 43 in Harlem won the National Junior High School Championship, and is now being used as a model in Dallas and San Francisco, as well as in other parts of New York State.
Since last November, this program, among many for players of all ages and levels, has been run out of the American Chess Center, a slickly renovated four-story brownstone on West 46th Street. This is the new home for both the Manhattan Chess Club, which was founded in 1877, and the American Chess Foundation, a private group that raises money to develop serious players for the United States. The center, which still has a just-moved-into feel about it, clearly represents a dream of what chess might finally become in this country rather than a finished reality, but it's undoubtedly a democratic dream.
"I was optimistic to think that when we had such a wonderful building, people would come running in the door and we would just sign them up," said Faneuil Adams, a retired oil-company executive who serves as president of the foundation, treasurer of the club and United States representative to the International Chess Federation. "It turns out that hasn't been the case at all. It turns out we have to go out and sell."
On a recent night, Bill Colias, a foundation employee who also acts as a manager of the club, was doing an estimable job of selling to several prospective members, on top of running a tournament of 30-minute games for lower-rated players in a large ground-floor hall. In a small fourth-floor room designed primarily for teaching, Nick Conticello was overseeing the first night of a competition among expert and master players who are trying to qualify for international ratings.
On the second floor, sitting at a bank of finely built tables in the building's most striking competition room, Asa Hoffman, who is the same age as Bobby Fischer, 50, and who played speed games with him in the old days, was reflecting on his life as a money player.
"I'm from pre-inflationary times," he said. "I remember bus fare to Washington was $10 and a hotel room was $15. You could really afford to go away for a weekend and play in a tournament. Now, it's hundreds of dollars. It's more a rich man's game."
Back downstairs, in a front room that serves as office, meeting place and kibitzing parlor, Mr. Hoffman -- who was portrayed in "Searching for Bobby Fischer" as a raving chess casualty, much to his bemused consternation -- dismantles a regular in a game of blitz, complete with gently mocking commentary.
On a bulletin board near what will soon be a street-level bookstore, run in partnership with the national federation, the members' ranking of the club reveals that it has certainly brought its competitive swagger from its old home in the Carnegie Hall building. At the top is Gata Kamsky, a 19-year-old grandmaster from Russia who many feel will have a shot at the world championship someday; he is also ranked No. 1 in the country. At No. 3 is the grandmaster Joel Benjamin, 29, like Mr. Fischer a prodigy from Brooklyn; he is ranked No. 3 in the country. (Larry Christiansen, who recently moved to Europe, is No. 2 on the club list, while Boris Gulko, another Russian emigre, is No. 2 in the country.) Mr. Kamsky and Mr. Benjamin will be on the United States team at the prestigious World Team Championship in Lucerne, Switzerland, in October.
 
'Different Dimension'
 In Washington Square Park, the afternoon had worn on and the tension among the speed-chess players had escalated as the alcohol began to flow. The scene was quieter at the nearby Village Chess Shop, a dusty institution that's about as old-world comfortable as you can get.
To the left, in glass cases, was an exotic array of chess sets. A handcarved Polish set was going for $199; a goldplated set was priced at $129. The most expensive was Egyptian, at $5,600. On a couple of tables were piles of boards. At the cash register, Lucien Crowder was helping a couple choose a board that would fold.
To the right, the coffeemaker was on, set against a wall covered with newspaper and magazine clippings from the present back to the 1960's. Chess pieces were set out in wicker baskets on several long tables. Four games were in progress, quietly. At one board, the players held hands as they stared at their game.
In the shop was a woman who had been playing in the park. Her name was Olga Zugor, and she said she was an artist and a fabric designer and a regular at this place. She came to this country from Budapest in 1956, and she, too, learned to play chess from her father. "He needed a partner and had only three daughters," she said. "I was the one."
Ms. Zugor is a member of the Manhattan Chess Club, still plays in tournaments, "for fun," and still has a national federation rating, although "it's going down and down." But her love of chess has to do with something other than triumph.
"It's so relaxing because you have to focus on the board, and the moves, and it really takes you to a different dimension," she said. "But everyone has a different reason why they play. For a lot of players, it's their ego pushing them to get better."
That same day, at a stone table along Riverside Drive, Luke and I prepared to play. Adding his basketball to the bench as a perch, he sat and arranged the black side, his favorite these days. His brother, 1-year-old Alec, took tentative steps around us and stooped to pick up rocks.
My chess games will be with them, for as long as they wish to play with me. Sixty-four squares to a board, eight pieces and eight pawns to a side, all the time in the world to win, or lose. White goes first, then anything can happen.
 
 
Stars at Their Boards Overseas
 The film "Searching for Bobby Fischer" has in its title -- and at its heart -- the eerie nonpresence of Mr. Fischer. In the 1950's and 60's, the Brooklyn youngster's genius awed his elders in tournaments and matches around the world. And in 1972, he sparked enormous new interest in chess when he beat Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union to become the world champion.
When he refused to defend his title in a dispute with the International Chess Federation (the game's governing body, which is known by its French acronym, FIDE), and disappeared from public life, Mr. Fischer took with him much of the standing of chess in the United States. But in the 1980's, chess slowly rebounded in this country, through scholastic programs and the revitalization of the clubs, along with the influence of the dynamic Gary Kasparov, the highest-rated player in chess history. Mr. Kasparov captured the world title from Anatoly Karpov in 1985, then defended it against Mr. Karpov three more times, the last in 1990, in a match that began with fanfare in Manhattan in the Hudson Theater at the Hotel Macklowe before shifting to Lyons, France.
Bizarrely, Mr. Fischer re-emerged a year ago to beat Boris Spassky in an exhibition match in Yugoslavia. Also bizarrely, news came last month that the 50-year-old Mr. Fischer, who faces arrest on charges of tax evasion if he returns to the United States, wished to play a match of high-speed games against 17-year-old Judit Polgar of Hungary. When she was 15 years 4 months old, Ms. Polgar, one of three prominent chess-playing sisters, broke a Fischer record by becoming the youngest grandmaster in history.
Mr. Fischer met recently with Ms. Polgar at her summer home outside Budapest to try to arrange the match, but nothing definite has been announced. Reports from Hungary indicate Mr. Fischer is demanding a $5 million purse, a sum considered unrealistic even for such a widely desired matchup. But preliminary feints and flourishes are familiar to Mr. Fischer's many followers, who are eager to see him play Ms. Polgar but who, from bitter experience, tend to remain skeptical about his plans.
Next week, the world championship season opens without Mr. Fischer and chess enthusiasts everywhere are caught up in an exciting but conflicted time. The throne has been officially vacant since Mr. Kasparov, who was born in Azerbaijan but represents Russia, was stripped of his crown last March as part of a long feud with FIDE.
On Tuesday in London, by arrangement of the new Professional Chess Association, an organization he is spearheading, Mr. Kasparov, 30, will start his own world-title match against the 28-year-old British grandmaster Nigel Short. They will be playing under the sponsorship of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper The Times of London, for a purse of $2.5 million.
The day before, the federation, which has erased Mr. Kasparov and Mr. Short from its list of ratings, will have begun its own championship match in Zwolle, the Netherlands, between the losing semifinalists from its own three-year title-playoff process. They are Mr. Karpov, the Russian grandmaster and former world champion, and the Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman. The second half of that match, which now has a purse of $2.64 million, will be played in Oman.

HEADLINE: A Shepherd Coyotes Are Sure to Hate: the Llama

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Va.

 BODY:
On a hillside here in Highland County, Count Dondi surveys his flock, his elegant neck poised, his doleful eyes ever watchful, his ears twitching expressively at the slightest sign of potential danger.
On the steep, partly wooded slopes of southwestern Virginia, where sheep graze in the shadow of the Allegheny Mountains, danger means coyotes. Farmers in these parts have used donkeys, dogs, traps, snares, even night vision glasses to combat the wily predators, to little avail. Now the coyotes may have met their match in an unlikely combatant: the docile llama. 
 Llamas, domesticated South American animals related to the camel, have been used extensively in sheep farming areas in the West as an answer to the growing coyote menace that has decimated many sheep flocks.
Here on a 1,100-acre farm, Count Dondi and his brother Smokey are George and Peggy Bird's answer to the coyote threat to their 240 sheep. Even though the animals' lineage is impressive -- their paternal grandparents are Dr. Doolittle (renowned as a prolific wool breeder) and Grace Kelly -- they do not look as if they could strike fear into the heart of a coyote.
Yet the normally placid llamas are surprisingly effective. If a coyote approaches, the llama will sound a high-pitched trumpeting alarm. It will charge toward the intruder, chase and kick or paw at it with front hooves, and if is really riled, the llama will spit.
Llamas are naturally inquisitive and protective, and once they have bonded with a flock of sheep "they will investigate anything that is different" in the area, said Dr. Donna Matthews, a veterinarian in Luray, Va., who specializes in llamas. "They chase coyotes because it's a fun thing to do."
The Birds got their llamas in May and are still the only farmers in this area who use guard llamas. During the lambing season earlier this year, the Birds and other farmers in the Mill Gap area -- 12 miles south of Monterey, the county seat -- lost about 60 of 300 sheep to coyotes.
"It was real frustrating around here during that time," Mr. Bird said. "One farmer along this road was practically wiped out." But since the llamas' arrival, the Birds have lost only 4 sheep, as against 16 in the previous two months.
Other animals are used as guards against predators. "Donkeys worked better than anything else until the guard llamas came along," Dr. Matthews said. A favorite game of some male donkeys is to play with lambs, but occasionally they play too rough and end up injuring or killing them.
 
Man's Better Friend?
 Dogs are widely used as guards, but they have short life spans compared with those of llamas and need to be fed daily. In addition, to be effective, they must be raised with sheep and have little or no human contact. Llamas, on the other hand, live for about 25 years and can be left alone to thrive on a simple herbivore diet.
Coyotes are a major headache for an industry that is already struggling. Sheep losses to predators cost American sheep farmers more than $80 million a year, one study found. For many sheep farmers, "the coyote problem is kind of the last straw," driving them out of the business, said Rodney Leech, the agricultural extension agent here.
"Coyotes have won the battle so far," said Mr. Leech, pointing out that 26 of the county's 175 sheep producers had given up over the last five years.
But llamas have helped even the score for sheep farmers in other areas of the country. Dr. William Franklin of Iowa State University at Ames interviewed 145 sheep producers using guard llamas in the West and found that 7 percent of sheep flocks were lost to predators after llamas were introduced, as opposed to 21 percent without them. Eight of 10 producers rated their llamas "very effective" or "effective."
Controlling coyotes has become something of an obsession in this picturesque, rural community about four hours from Washington.
A predator control committee was established, and this year it raised $4,500 to buy a pair of night vision glasses, similar to those used in the Persian Gulf war, to spot coyotes at night. Sheriff Herbert Lightner is in charge of the after-dark sorties, a task he relishes since his father lost many lambs to coyotes earlier this year.
 
Lambs Will Be the Test
 The Birds did not have much of a problem with coyotes until recently, because a local trapper was placing snares for the animals around their property. But after the trapper died, the Birds bought Count Dondi and Smokey from a local llama farm.
"We really won't know how the llamas have worked until next year," Mr. Bird said, when the animals will have guarded the sheep through a lambing season.
Llama breeding is a growth industry in the agricultural world, with the creatures becoming increasingly prized for their soft, fine wool. They are also used as pack animals and kept as pets. But while females, especially those with dark or beige wool, can cost up to $20,000, the white males are out of fashion, especially those that do not meet the industry's breeding standards. Many of these can be bought for as little as a few hundred dollars and are the most likely to end up as guard animals.
"Most people think that llamas aren't economical," Mr. Bird said. He paid $700 each for Count Dondi and Smokey, so each llama need only save about a dozen lambs, each worth about $70, for him to recoup his investment.
The unwanted male llamas often come from herds of hobbyist llama breeders, Dr. Matthews said, city dwellers using the animals on their country property as a way of qualifying for agricultural tax breaks.
The arrangement works to everybody's advantage. For the sheep farmers, the llamas can mean the difference between survival and failure, and for the breeders, Dr. Matthews said, guard llamas provide a way of cashing in on "a lot of males that don't really serve a useful purpose."

HEADLINE: Bank Fraud Plea Forestalls Questions About Iraq Arms

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
A bank fraud case that was to have been the main stage for an accusation that the Bush Administration secretly engaged in the arming of Iraq and then sought to cover it up came to a surprising close today when the defendant, a week away from trial, struck a deal with the Government and pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Atlanta.
The defendant, Christopher P. Drogoul, former manager of the Atlanta branch of a Rome bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, had earlier insisted that he wanted to go to trial to demonstrate that he had been a pawn in an international conspiracy, involving the Bush Administration, to strengthen the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein in the months before its invasion of Kuwait. 
 But today Mr. Drogoul, who had been indicted on 70 counts stemming from the Atlanta branch's secret loans of more than $5 billion used by Iraq for an arms buildup, pleaded guilty to three of those counts: one of wire fraud and two of making false statements to bank regulators.
Mr. Drogoul's lawyer, Robert M. Simels of New York, said the defendant had decided to enter guilty pleas because his family had urged him to bring the prosecution against him to a close.
 
Two Crucial Rulings
 But a far more important factor was apparently a pair of rulings last month by Judge Ernest Tidwell, who was to have presided at the trial and who accepted Mr. Drogoul's pleas today.
In those rulings, which cut the heart out of the strategy that Mr. Simels had been expected to pursue, Judge Tidwell held that the defense could not present evidence concerning Washington's policy tilt toward Baghdad during the 1980's and President George Bush's subsequent determination that economic and political incentives should be used to moderate Mr. Hussein's actions. The judge said such evidence would be irrelevant to the charges against Mr. Drogoul.
Judge Tidwell also ruled then that Mr. Simels could not present evidence that senior officials of the Italian Government, which largely owns B.N.L., had pleaded with the Bush Administration to limit its inquiry into the Atlanta branch's loans.
After those rulings, Mr. Simels said today, "it became apparent to the defense that a search for the truth in this matter was being curtailed."
 
Approval by Reno
 At the Justice Department today, Carl Stern, the agency's chief spokesman, said the plea arrangement had been approved by Attorney General Janet Reno.
"With these three counts," Mr. Stern said, "the Government achieved the likely prison term which would have been achieved no matter how many counts you took to trial. It would have been pointless to go to trial."
Mr. Drogoul is to be sentenced on Nov. 29. Government prosecutors said that under Federal sentencing guidelines, Judge Tidwell was obliged to send him to prison for 46 to 57 months. But Mr. Simels said he would argue that Mr. Drogoul, who has already been imprisoned for 17 months while awaiting disposition of the case, should be sentenced to time already served.
Mr. Drogoul and five other officers of the Atlanta branch of B.N.L. were charged with bank fraud after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided their offices in August 1989 and found evidence of illegal loans to Iraq.
In the many months that the issue has simmered, there has been little doubt that Mr. Drogoul, in arranging for unsecured credit to a nation that had a history as a bad credit risk, had been involved in the improper lending of money, some of it backed by a Federal guarantee program.
 
Did the White House Know?
 What was at issue was whether the loans had been made with the knowledge of White House officials trying to buy favor with Mr. Hussein, and whether those officials sought to cover up their efforts after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
The Bush Administration's Justice Department charged that the six Atlanta bank officers had defrauded the parent bank by making the loans without the knowledge of the Rome headquarters.
But at a tumultuous hearing in Atlanta last September before Judge Marvin H. Shoob, who was then presiding over the B.N.L. case, it was disclosed that the Central Intelligence Agency had apparently concluded that bank managers in Rome had been aware of the loans and thus could not have been defrauded.
Immediately after that disclosure, Mr. Drogoul, charged with receiving bribes of $2.5 million in exchange for the loans, withdrew an earlier guilty plea and demanded a trial in order to demonstrate that the loans had been made with the knowledge of senior American officials working with the Italian Government.
Much of the speculation that quickly surrounded the case was whether the C.I.A. and the Bush Administration had sought to limit the investigation to the Atlanta bankers, in order not to embarrass President Bush, who was then running for re-election, and the Italian Government.
After expressing ever-increasing skepticism of the Government's contention that the trail of suspicion led only to the Atlanta bankers and no higher, Judge Shoob agreed to a Justice Department request that he relinquish the case involving Mr. Drogoul to another judge.
During the Presidential election campaign last year, Bill Clinton said he would favor the renewal of a law allowing for the appointment of independent prosecutors and would seriously consider seeking the appointment of one to take over the B.N.L. case.
But at a sentencing hearing last week for the five bankers who had worked under Mr. Drogoul, a senior Justice Department official signaled that the Clinton Administration did not believe there was any need for a special prosecutor. That official, John Hogan, a special assistant to Attorney General Reno, said the Administration had conducted its own review of the B.N.L. matter and had concluded that there had been no conspiracy by Mr. Bush or his aides.
Judge Shoob, who still retained control over the cases of those five bankers, reacted harshly to Mr. Hogan, saying such a conclusion was possible only "in never-never land." He said it was highly implausible that a multibillion-dollar bank fraud had been run out of a small branch in Atlanta.
He described the five defendants before him as pawns in a large international conspiracy and rejected the Government's request that they be sent to prison. He instead put them on probation.

HEADLINE: Inequity Seen in Drug Forfeiture Law

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 2

 BODY:
A California state law aimed at seizing the money and property of major drug dealers is increasingly taking assets from people who can ill-afford to defend themselves, a newspaper says.
The San Jose Mercury News reported this week that while leaders of drug rings had learned to fend off forfeitures with lawyers and accountants, the poor, those who speak little English and those who are casual drug users most often had their money and property seized by the authorities in drug-related arrests. 
 In more than 6,000 forfeiture cases filed by local prosecutors last year, 94 percent involved the seizure of less than $5,000, the newspaper reported. The police must report any seizure of $5,000 or more to the Franchise Tax Board. Seized assets are distributed for use among local police and prosecutors.
 
Lack of Legal Help
 The Mercury News found dozens of cases in which claimants without lawyers had to fill out 14-page questionnaires with nearly 200 questions and were asked to produce documentation for purchases, bank statements, canceled checks and a list of medical and dental expenses dating back five years. Claimants can also be forced to undergo hours of cross-examination from a prosecutor.
Seizing the money of people never intended to be targets of forfeiture "is like shooting fish in a barrel," said Justin Scott, a Sacramento forfeiture lawyer.
The state forfeiture law leaves many people little recourse to reclaim assets seized by the authorities, Mr. Scott said. The burden is on claimants to prove they obtained the seized assets legally by producing bank statements or receipts.
"If it's less than a couple of thousand dollars, I tell people not to bother unless they've got some kind of ironclad proof," Mr. Scott said. "And usually, when it's cash, you don't have it."
 
10-Day Filing Limit
 Claimants also have only 10 days from the time of seizure to file a claim for the seized property. Although the law requires the police to give written notice explaining how to claim seized property, many officers wait until suspects are about to be booked into county jail, said a former Santa Barbara County judge, S. Jon Gudmunds.
"They get him in front of the jailer who's going to do the booking, they hand him the notice at that moment, and the jailer says, 'empty your pockets; give me everything you've got,' and he takes the paper out of the guy's hand," Judge Gudmunds said. "The guy has the notice in his hand for 10 seconds maybe, if he's lucky."
Thomas Muscio, Deputy District Attorney of Santa Barbara County, acknowledged that such a practice was possible.
"You're allowed to keep legal papers in your cell, but if they don't understand what it is, it may be taken away from them," he said.
Slight mistakes in filling out often-copious forms can also mean that forfeited property will never be recovered, as one woman found.
Sacramento County deputies arrested Karri Welch and seized $1,013 from her for drug trafficking in 1992 after discovering eight one-hundredths of a gram of methamphetamine -- about the size of a grain of salt -- in her purse. After being released from jail, Ms. Welch had five days to file her claim.
"They didn't notify me until after the time expired that I hadn't signed the form correctly," Ms. Welch said. "I lost $1,000 because I didn't sign the form in two places. I only signed it in one."
Forfeiture claims are often too small, and the process is often too expensive, to recoup losses after paying lawyers' fees and a $182 filing cost, Mr. Scott said.
"Economically, it's just not worth it," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Toyota Unit Sues Its Former Agency

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America said yesterday that it had filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court against its former agency, Martin Davis Omon & Partners, seeking the return of funds forwarded to the agency for payment of media bills and other charges related to the company's corporate advertising account.
The $5 million to $10 million account had been at Martin Davis in New York from February 1990, when the agency was known as Omon New York Ltd., until June 13, when the account followed four former Martin Davis executives to their new shop, Oasis International Group Ltd. in New York. 
 Toyota said under its contract with Martin Davis, the company had paid the agency in advance for related media and production charges, but the agency left invoices unpaid while holding Toyota's advanced funds. As part of the legal action, Toyota said it had obtained a court order that prevented further spending of those funds on expenditures unrelated to the outstanding billings.
Tim Andree, the group manager of external affairs for Toyota in New York, declined to discuss the amount of money involved, but said, "It justifies us taking legal action."
Joanne M. Davis, the president of Martin Davis, said, "The allegations of financial impropriety are completely false and without merit." She added that Omon had "reason to believe that the actions of both Toyota and certain former employees of Omon in connection with the formation of the Oasis advertising agency were improper." She said her agency "is considering options including legal actions against those parties."
The other Martin Davis principal, Rodd Martin, who is now an executive vice president and group creative director on the Diet Coke account at Lintas New York, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Where's the Bottom?

 BODY:
With its only superpower enemy having retired from the global battlefield, does a fiscally strapped United States still need to spend more than $1.2 trillion over the next five years for defense? It's hard to see why. But that's the number on the bottom line of the Pentagon's new "bottom up review," unveiled Wednesday by Secretary of Defense Aspin.
By cutting perhaps $120 billion more than the Bush Administration had planned over the five-year period and scrapping some of the forces and weapons aimed solely at the now-vanished Soviet threat, the review makes a modest start at adjusting defense budgets to new international realities. But the start is too modest to do justice to competing fiscal needs. 
Sure, it's still a dangerous world out there, and it would be reckless and economically disruptive to abruptly shrink America's defense effort to the levels other countries consider comfortable. One of the reasons most of our allies spend less is that they count on us to spend more.
The Pentagon document's greatest merit is that it usefully reorients American strategy away from confronting the vanished Soviet Union toward more plausible regional threats, and scraps a handful of weapons programs that no longer serve any realistic purpose.
But then it ingeniously totes up the costs of fighting regional wars with conventional weapons in ways that make them nearly as expensive as facing down the thermonuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles of the old Warsaw Pact.
One reason for these unnecessarily high costs is Secretary Aspin's determination not to give allies a veto on whether the U.S. takes military action against regional aggressors like Saddam Hussein or, potentially, North Korea's Kim Il Sung.
Given the Europeans' performance on Bosnia, the Secretary's concerns are understandable. But America's allies aren't likely ever to be induced into more constructive multilateralism if Washington budgeters continue to offer them a free ride.
Besides assigning too much of the regional-conflict burden to American taxpayers, the Pentagon's program also keeps alive a number of no longer needed weapons programs. The acknowledged reason is to keep production lines in place, preserve defense industry jobs and ease economic pressures on military contractors. For example, the main rationale for building a third Seawolf attack submarine, at $2.4 billion, and a new nuclear carrier, at $3.6 billion, is to keep afloat the Connecticut and Virginia shipyards that construct them.
This seems to reaffirm the old political truth that defense lobbyists have a much easier time protecting their endangered programs than do those who press for public investment programs. Last month, Administration initiatives like youth apprenticeship, college tuition aid and even adjustment assistance for those thrown out of nondefense jobs were all cut back sharply to meet budget reduction targets.
President Clinton's obvious political need is to avoid further disaffection in states like California, Connecticut and Virginia, already hard hit by base closings and procurement cuts. But slighting more critical national needs is no answer.
Mr. Aspin's handiwork needs to be re-reviewed by the White House and Congress. The security of America depends on a realistic defense budget, not a padded one.

HEADLINE: 'Star Wars' Deception Just Prolonged Cold War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert McFarlane's claim in "Consider What Star Wars Accomplished" (Op-Ed, Aug. 24), that the Strategic Defense Initiative was designed to bring the Soviet Union to its knees and that it helped do so, is as much a fantasy as "Star Wars" itself. 
 As to the design, Ronald Reagan did not present the Strategic Defense Initiative as a way to gain "even greater political and economic leverage" over the Soviets, as his former national security adviser may have seen it, but as a way to end reliance on "mutual assured destruction" by making nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete." He even offered to share the benefits with the Soviets.
Mr. McFarlane now seems to imply that the Administration's rationale was an artful deception, not just of the Soviet Union but also of the American electorate. If he is right, this is an even more serious disclosure than the report that a critical Strategic Defense Initiative test was rigged with the knowledge of high Reagan Administration officials.
The claim that the Strategic Defense Initiative hastened the collapse of the Soviet system by five years (which Mr. McFarlane attributes to a former Soviet official), saving us $100 billion in defense spending, is one of those propositions that can neither be verified nor falsified because they are gross oversimplifications.
Already under Yuri Andropov, the Soviet leader in 1982-84, the Politburo recognized that its command economy was falling behind the West's market systems. Investment would have shifted to the civil sector sooner had the Reagan military buildup, including the Strategic Defense Initiative, not allowed Soviet generals to object that lower military spending would compromise security.
Although Soviet weapons experts advised that the Strategic Defense Initiative could not provide an impenetrable defense, the leadership feared that the general buildup would improve the West's offensive capacities to jeopardize strategic parity. All these considerations helped generate the "new thinking" under Mikhail S. Gorbachev that led to "perestroika" and to willingness to negotiate cutbacks in levels of nuclear weapons.
The subsequent Soviet implosion was due far more to internal developments, including the reforms themselves, than to any of the policies of the Reagan Administration. It caught Mr. Reagan by surprise as much as the rest of us. Any credit he deserves for it hardly vitiates the blame he bears for helping saddle us with a crippling deficit, partly to pay for a strategic military buildup we now know was not needed to match anything the Soviets were doing.
In any case, what Mr. McFarlane's praise for the supposed political benefits of the Strategic Defense Initiative does not alter is that the program altogether failed to achieve its technological objectives. Had the $30 billion wasted on the Strategic Defense Initiative been spent to upgrade our civil technology and work force skills, the cold war would still be over, and our economy would be a lot healthier than it is now.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Agrees to Allow Russians To Buy Fleet and Destroy Arsenal

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Faced with a deepening economic crisis and a heavy debt to Russia for oil and gas, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine agreed today to let Russia buy Ukraine's share of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, and to dismantle the nuclear weapons remaining on Ukrainian territory, in return for the uranium extracted from their warheads.
Mr. Kravchuk's agreement with President Boris N. Yeltsin marked a sharp rollback in Ukraine's ambitions for equal status with its giant and powerful neighbor. But the accords need to be approved by both the Russian and Ukrainian Parliaments, and such action is not necessarily preordained. 
 Ukraine's concessions on the Black Sea Fleet, one of the most contentious and emotional issues to divide the Slavic neighbors, would return the fleet to Russian ownership. The transfer of the 176 nuclear missiles to Russia would end any further Ukrainian claims to nuclear status but allow the country to use uranium from the warheads as fuel for nuclear power plants.
 
U.S. Disarmament Efforts
 The United States has pressed Ukraine to turn over its missiles to Russia and not seek to become a nuclear power on its own. The United States has offered to help defray the costs of Russian disarmament, and presumably a Ukrainian decision to go along on the nuclear plan would help persuade Washington to be more generous in its aid to Ukraine.
The Black Sea fleet has about 350 ships, as well as aircraft, and has about 70,000 sailors. In the Soviet era, it was one of the most important wings of the armed forces, projecting the Soviet Union's presence into the Mediterranean.
At their last meeting, Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Yeltsin had agreed to split the fleet in half by 1995, but that plan ran into difficulties, particularly from a predominantly Russian officer corps for whom the fleet, founded by Catherine the Great, is an integral part of Russia's historical legacy.
 
Many Details Unclear
 The current agreement was reached after a day of talks at Massandra, a mountain resort in the Crimea, a peninsula in the Black Sea. It was the fifth such meeting between the two leaders in two years.
Many details of the agreement are unclear, in particular, the terms of Russia's rental of the fleet's home port, the naval base at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula. But as Mr. Yeltsin made clear at a news conference after the meeting, if the accord is approved, the fleet will belong to Russia, although it may also be charged with guarding the Ukrainian coast.
"We agreed that Russia would buy out half of the fleet," said Mr. Yeltsin. "Russian payment for its share of the fleet will be counted against Ukrainian debts to Russia. If the balance is then in Ukraine's favor, then Russia will pay."
The Russian and Ukrainian Parliaments never had a chance to vote on the last agreement reached by Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk. At Massandra today, Mr. Kravchuk said that the previous agreement to split the fleet had not been a mistake, but rather the reflection of an earlier set of circumstances.
In Kiev, the capital, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Ukrainian Parliament worried that Ukraine was sacrificing too much.
"In my mind, I can understand that it should be done," said Dmytro Pavlychko, speaking about the sale of the fleet, "but in my heart, I feel we have retreated too far."
"It was not a compromise, but almost a capitulation," said Mr. Pavlychko. "But we had to do it, we were forced to because of our economic difficulties. We agreed, I am sure, in order to be paid rather than start shooting guns."
In his statement at the news conference today, Mr. Kravchuk emphasized that the use of Sevastopol would be subject to further negotiations. Mr. Pavlychko noted that "the fact that Russia will pay rent means they recognize that it is Ukrainian territory."
"At the same time, it gives us oil and gas, and that is a big plus," Mr. Pavlychko added, "but a big minus is that Russia will be able to modernize the Black Sea Fleet and turn it into a strategic fleet that could fight or pressure Ukraine."
 
Russia's Economic Leverage
 In recent weeks, while the two sides prepared for talks on Ukraine's mounting debt to Russia, Russia drastically cut back on the gas it supplied to its neighbor because of back debts of about $600 million. Ukraine was given another reminder of Russia's economic leverage last week when Mr. Yeltsin, visiting Poland, signed an agreement that would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine in transporting natural gas to Europe. Ukraine has retaliated against threatened price increases on Russian gas by raising the tariff for gas piped westward across its territory.
Before the meeting today, Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, said Russia would not threaten Ukraine with ultimatums, or with higher prices for gas and oil deliveries. But, he said caustically, "independence involves responsibilities."
Mr. Yeltsin told reporters that the two Prime Ministers had reached an agreement today for the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia to be dismantled, with the provision that Russia then supply Ukraine with uranium to be used as fuel at nuclear power stations. No mention, however, was made of a schedule for dismantling the intercontinental missiles, with an estimated 1,800 warheads, that were left on Ukrainian territory after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Washington has offered $175 million in aid to help disarm Ukraine. The Pentagon is authorized to spend up to $800 million to help the former Soviet republics destroy nuclear weapons and safeguard nuclear materials.
Russia has insisted that it will remain the only nuclear state among the former Soviet republics. Initially, the three other former republics where nuclear weapons were based, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, agreed to hand over all nuclear weapons to Russia. But as relations between Ukraine and Russia soured, the Ukrainian Parliament moved to declare the 1,800 nuclear warheads to be Ukrainian property, and delayed promised votes to ratify the Start 1 arms control treaty and to sign the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons as a non-nuclear state.

HEADLINE: LEADING INDICATORS AND PAYROLL JOBS DISPLAY WEAKNESS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
In reports raising fresh doubts about the durability of the economic recovery, the Government said today that the number of payroll jobs fell in August for the first time in more than a year and that its chief forecasting index turned down in July.
These and other sobering results more than offset improvements elsewhere among figures released today, including a slight decline in the August unemployment rate, to 6.7 percent from 6.8 percent in July. 
 The index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict the course of the economy six to nine months in advance, edged down a tenth of a percent in July. It was the seventh month in a row in which the Commerce Department index moved in the opposite direction from the preceding month; it had gained a tenth of a percent in June.
 
 
At Odds With Other Data
 The monthly employment report is widely thought to be the best single indicator of the economy's performance, as well as a window on the financial well-being of the nation's households. But today's report appeared to be at odds, at least superficially, with other recent data, including upward revisions in output for the spring quarter and for 1990, 1991 and 1992.
"It's kind of confusing," said Robert T. McGee, an economist at Tokai Bank in New York, noting various crosscurrents in today's labor-market figures.
As is often the case, jitters about the economy prompted a scramble to buy bonds, sending long-term interest rates skidding below 6 percent, the lowest level in 25 years. [Page 35.]
"The economy has slowed here in the summer," said Paul W. Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates, a mutual fund group in Baltimore. "These payroll figures really look worrisome."
 
Northeast Jobless Rate Up
 The one-tenth of a point decline in the unemployment rate was considered too small by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be statistically significant.
In the Northeast, joblessness rose three-tenths of a point, to 7.3 percent, as the rate moved up in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, the only states in the region for which individual results are reported.
"We don't need anybody," said Donna All, a member of the personnel department of the Dale-Pak Corporation in Vineland, N.J. The 40-employee company, which makes components for corrugated boxes -- a product that has historically led upturns and downturns in the economy -- describes business as essentially flat.
While the shrinkage in payroll jobs, was relatively modest at 39,000, including losses from flooding in the Midwest, a gain of about 150,000 had been generally expected. And not only was there a further 42,000 drop in manufacturing -- bringing the total factory job loss since February to 239,000 -- a gain in service jobs was only about a third as big as the average monthly increase since early 1992.
Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said the Administration was "disappointed" by the drop in factory and other goods-producing sectors and by too many people being forced to work in temporary or part-time jobs. After a sharp rise in July, the "part-time for economic reasons" category swelled 42,000, one-fourth as much, in August.
But the department's survey of households showed a 409,000 jump in the number of people with jobs, enough to more than absorb an increase in the work force and thin the ranks of the unemployed by 108,000.
Rather than hiring new workers, employers are asking their current employees to work longer hours. Employees were called on to work an average of 12 minutes a week longer in August, driving hourly and weekly earnings sharply higher. Although longer workweeks are historically a precursor of hiring, many analysts suspect that uncertainty over factors like higher health care costs may be inhibiting further hiring.
In addition to the 7.3 percent jobless rate for the Northeast, the regional rates were 6.5 percent in the South, down from 6.6; 5.5 percent in the Midwest, down from 5.8, and 8 percent in the West, down from 8.4.
 
Ominous Situation
 While the July decline in the leading indicators was smaller than many economists had expected, it was viewed direly by those familiar with the work of two researchers, Gerald Anderson and John Erceg of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
The often-cited rule of thumb is that a shift in direction by the indicators, confirmed immediately by two similar readings, points to an impending turn in the economy. But the researchers found that in calling downturns, at least, four out of seven negative readings are more reliable than three in a row.
Now that the four-of-seven condition has been met, Prof. James F. Smith of the University of North Carolina said today, the chances are two in three that there will be a business peak -- that is, the beginning of a recession -- within 14 months.
Another worrisome sign, other analysts said, is that the department's companion index of coincident indicators -- those that tend to move with the economy instead of anticipating it -- eased in July for the second straight month after nine months with no declines.
"We've gone for two years now in which the leading index has moved up sharply and the coincident index has failed to follow," said David B. Bostian of Herzog Heine Geduld, a New York brokerage firm. "It's eerie."
The employment report showed little change in the status of most ethnic and demographic groups, but the Hispanic jobless rate dropped 1.2 points, to 9.7 percent, more than offsetting a July increase. And unemployment among black teen-agers posted a sharp decline -- to 31.4 percent from 41.4 percent -- in the last two months. But William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, cautioned that there had been no confirmation yet that this improvement represented more than temporary summer jobs.
Although the overall jobless rate moved negligibly last month to a 25-month low, there has been a decline of three-tenths of a percent from the 7 percent rate that prevailed in June and was the average for both the first and second quarters.
Elsewhere in the report, only 46.6 percent of industries enlarged their payrolls last month, wiping out the big July advance, and the construction industry shed 8,000 jobs.
And while the index of aggregate hours, watched by the most studious economists, jumped six-tenths of a percent, to 124.9, the figures were disheartening to Robert Giordano, research chief at Goldman, Sachs.
He said the index almost always rises in the middle month of a quarter. And, he added, not only was the August rise less than usual in this context, but also some heavy-industry components fell. Mr. Giordano suggested that this could mean that investment in labor-saving machinery was "wobbling."
Today's report also showed a 274,000 decline in the newly unemployed -- those out of work five weeks or less -- but virtually no change in the 1.74 million people who have been jobless more than six months. Special benefits for the long-term unemployed will run out on Oct. 2 for workers in 48 states.
Seven of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators contributed to the one-tenth of 1 percent July decline, that report showed, paced by a drop in consumer expectations.
The two biggest positive contributors were a longer average workweek and a rise in construction permits.
Still another indicator, an index of items like the prime rate and the duration of unemployment that tend to move only after the economy has turned, climbed six-tenths of a percent in July, the second straight gain after three declines.

The Economy
The number of United States payroll jobs fell in August for the first time in more than a year, and the Government's chief forecasting index turned down in July. These and other sobering results more than offset economic improvements elsewhere, including a slight decline in the August unemployment rate, to 6.7 percent from 6.8 percent in July. [Page 1.] The jobless rate rose slightly in New York and New Jersey, but remained unchanged in New York City. [47.] 
Long-term interest rates broke through 6 percent, with the 30-year Treasury bond closing at 5.94 percent. The long bond and shorter-maturity debt moved on further bad news on growth and good news on inflation. [35.]
The drop in the 30-year Treasury bond's yield is a sign of near-consensus that the American economy is hunkering down for a long period of stable prices and tepid growth. [1.]
President Clinton pushed his "School-to-Work Opportunities Act," a measure that would provide development grants for states to create training programs to help students make a more successful transition from school to the work place. [A8.]
 
Companies
Sales of domestic cars and light trucks continued their steady rise in late August, gaining 19.7 percent from a year earlier. Many dealers said low inventories kept them from selling more vehicles. [35.]
Advanced Micro Devices' stock fell after the company disclosed that its "cleanroom" version of Intel's 486-series computer microprocessor was not so clean after all. [35.]

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 7.83 for Day But Slips 6.70 for Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were up modestly on moderate volume ahead of Labor Day, as weakness in the European markets carried into early trading yesterday in the United States. But a strong rally in the bond market on weaker-than-expected employment data for August kept equities afloat.
Long-term interest rates slipped below 6 percent for the first time, making the return on investment in equities more attractive and limiting the downside to the market as some buyers stepped in from the sidelines. 
 Analysts at MMS International, a Wall Street economic analysis and research firm, said the employment data had caused a slow leak in the market rather than a blowout. The perception that the Federal Reserve may have to ease rates to jump-start the economy contained market losses, the analysts said, and allowed a small rally near the close.
 
Trading Is Slower
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.83 points on the day but closed down 6.70 points for the week, to 3,633.93. Only the Nasdaq composite and American Stock Exchange managed to scratch out new highs.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 197.2 million shares, down from 259.8 million on Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,019 to 890.
Steven Resnick, senior investment strategist at Cowen & Company, said he expected a bullish trend on the assumption that good corporate earnings would continue.
"Our forecast for this year, if your talking about S.& P. 500 earnings on an operating basis without extraordinary items, is for an increase of 13 percent this year and 10 percent next," he said. "This is assuming that you have a growing economy and you get continued benefit on the bottom line from restructuring. And it's not difficult to justify a price earnings ratio of 17 or 18 times when money market rates are at 3 percent and the long-term Treasury is about 6 percent."
Medical issues and H.M.O. stocks, which rallied strongly on Thursday, were mixed yesterday. Merck was down 1/4, to 32 7/8; Bristol-Myers Squibb rose1/4, to 57 1/4; Oxford Health gained 3/4, to 73 1/4, and United Health fell 5/8, to 61 1/2.
Scimed Life Systems fell 2 1/8, to 54 1/4. The manufacturer of disposable medical products used in the treatment of cardiovascular and vascular diseases set up a reserve to buy back inventory from its Japanese distributor, reducing second-quarter revenue by about $2.5 million.
St. Jude Medical dropped 2, to 29 1/2, as Carbomedics, a unit of Switzerland's Gebruder Sulzer, received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market a heart valve that will compete with St. Jude's product.
Elsewhere in the market, Advanced Micro Devices was down 2, to 29, in heavy trading, amid concern about the company's legal battle with Intel over a chip design. Prudential Securities reduced its rating to hold from buy.
Cami'z fell 1 1/8, to 7 1/4, on news that its merger with Chauvin International, parent of B.U.M. Equipment, which was expected to be completed in December, will be delayed until next spring.
On news of a definitive agreement for the merger of Dial Page and two specialized mobile radio operators, Transit Communications and Advance Mobile Comm, shares of Dial Page rose, 3 3/4, to 40. The combined company will be the third-largest operator of specialized mobile radios in the country.
In Tokyo yesterday, stocks ended higher as foreign investors pushed the Nikkei index to a new closing high for the year. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 133.01 points, or more than six-tenths of a percent, at 21,116.21.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Appears to Alter Stand On Exemptions to Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, appears to have altered his position on exempting certain city agencies from the substantial budget cuts that he proposed last month.
In releasing a broad plan for the city's economy and the municipal budget on Aug. 10, Mr. Giuliani said he would reduce the size of the city's work force by about 35,000 jobs, from about 215,000 workers to 180,000 workers, within four years. Mr. Giuliani said he would trim the size of local government through attrition and early-retirement packages. 
 At the time, he also proposed "exempting a few agencies and programs that have already experienced disproportionate cuts," including "critical city services involving children and public safety and parks and cultural affairs."
But in an interview with WABC-TV news, taped on Thursday night and scheduled for broadcast tomorrow, Mr. Giuliani seemed to pull back from his initial position.
 
No Blanket Exemptions
 "I haven't exempted anyone," he said, according to a transcript provided by the station. "What I have said is that in making the determination in how to do the cutbacks, we're going to take a look at those agencies that have already been cut back."
Mr. Giuliani cited the Parks Department and the Fire Department as two agencies that had already absorbed significant budget cuts, adding that they "would be at the bottom of the list" for additional reductions.
"We're going to have to try and exempt them, have to find restorations for them," he said at another point in the interview. "But since no one really knows what's going to happen in the economy next year, what's going to happen with regard to receipts by the city next year, you can't make blanket exemptions in any particular area."
The Dinkins administration seized on Mr. Giuliani's remarks last night, contending that he had flip-flopped on the issue. Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, argued that Mr. Giuliani's shift was similar to changes he had made previously in his positions on rent control and on abortion rights.
"I think that Rudy Giuliani ought to be honest enough to admit that he did not know what he was talking about then and that he doesn't know what he's talking about now," Mr. Jones said of Mr. Giuliani's fiscal proposals.
But Richard Bryers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, contended that the Republican candidate had not altered his position on the budget. When Mr. Giuliani said in the television interview that no agencies would be exempt, he was referring only to the requirement he would place on all agency heads to look for potential savings and new efficiencies throughout their agencies, Mr. Bryers said.

HEADLINE: Peronist Backsliding

 BODY:
Argentina's President, Carlos Menem, proudly claims the mantle of Juan Peron, the charismatic strongman who transfixed his nation from the 1940's through the 70's. And with his brilliantly successful economic policies, Mr. Menem has revived the political fortunes of the Peronist movement. Unfortunately, as Nathaniel Nash of The Times reported this week, Mr. Menem seems to have revived some of the negative sides of Peronism as well, including thuggish attacks on reporters who dare to criticize his Government.
Mr. Menem points out, rightly, that he is a Peronist with a difference. Where Juan Peron nationalized, Carlos Menem privatizes. And where Juan Peron won ovations and elections by demonizing the United States, Mr. Menem loves to boast of the "carnal relationship" he has established between Buenos Aires and Washington. 
 The idea has been to revitalize Argentina's once-thriving economy with a new burst of foreign investment lured by political stability and consistently pro-market policies. So far, Mr. Menem's approach has been a stunning success. Inflation has been subdued, a long-abused currency has been stabilized and economic growth rates have soared.
But a shadow has been cast on this progress by the contempt for law and democracy displayed by some Peronist loyalists, and on occasion by Mr. Menem himself. There's no evidence personally linking the President to the worst abuses, but he has sometimes set an unfortunate tone.
For example, he has carelessly appointed corrupt relatives and cronies to high office and has brazenly manipulated the courts. And by officially forgiving past acts of military insubordination, Mr. Menem undid painfully won progress on establishing accountability and civilian control. Now his bitter attacks on press critics are widely believed to have spurred misguided loyalists to physically attack reporters.
There's an easy way for Mr. Menem to refute such damaging suspicions and reinforce his own record of reform. He could publicly clarify his personal commitment to a free and unintimidated press and insist that criminal attacks against journalists and other critics be fully and fairly prosecuted. To Peronists and other Argentines, that could make a big difference.

HEADLINE: When Workfare Is Just Make-Work

BYLINE: By Betsy Gotbaum; Betsy Gotbaum is Commissioner of New York City Parks and Recreation.

 BODY:
As usual, Washington is a few steps behind New York City. Federal lawmakers have been making a lot of noise about the need for "workfare" programs that would require able-bodied welfare recipients to work as a condition for receiving benefits. In New York, we have tried such a program and know it doesn't work.
At the Parks Department, about 800 welfare recipients currently help clean parks as part of the citywide Work Experience Program, started in 1987. Participants work 35 hours every other week, and can only stay at the Parks Department for nine months. 
 After that, they have to find a job in the private sector or with another city agency. The time restriction exists to encourage the workers to think of the program as a steppingstone, not a career.
For taxpayers determined to get a return for their investment, this arrangement does achieve a kind of rough economic justice: Welfare recipients are punching a time clock in the public service. But if the goal is to get people off public assistance then the program falls short.
As it is set up now, the Work Experience Program offers little encouragement to participants because hard work won't earn them a promotion or even a permanent job with the city. For the agencies involved, there is no point in training the workers, because they will be gone in nine months. This is a shame: many of them lacks skills as basic as the ability to drive a car.
It is a semi-enlightened type of chain gang. Because of the lack of incentives and training, the productivity of the workers is usually low.
Some turn out to be enthusiastic workers anyway, and in better economic times city agencies have hired them as full-time employees.
As part of the Work Projects Administration during the Great Depression, Robert Moses put as many as 80,000 unemployed people to work in New York City parks. In 1936 alone, Moses opened 11 of the mammoth outdoor swimming pools that are still keeping New York's children cool.
In November, the Parks Department will begin a new program that is not as ambitious but that suggests a new direction for welfare reform in the 90's. With about $1.1 million in public and private funds, the Parks Career Training program will employ 250 welfare recipients for a year and train them in a range of job skills, from driving tractors to computer processing to tending gardens.
This will cost $4,400 a worker in public and private funds. The Parks Department is now surveying workers taking part in the current program to find recruits, and we will not exclude those with criminal records or a history of drug abuse.
At the end of the on-the-job training, participants will be guided into full-time unionized jobs at the Parks Department, other municipal agencies, civic organizations and private companies through a partnership with America Works, a private, for-profit organization that finds jobs for welfare recipients.
The participants will be actively at work maintaining parks around the city. This is not job creation (as was the case with the Work Projects Administration) but an investment in reducing the welfare rolls while gaining much-needed extra hands. Participants won't be taking jobs away from anyone because they will be working at tasks that simply cannot be performed with the current staff.
The motives behind the program are based solely on self-interest: the Parks Department has lost 1,000 employees over the last two years because of budget cuts, yet park acreage -- 26,000 acres -- has not diminished, nor has the use of parks, pools, ballfields or playgrounds.
In New York City, the Work Experience Program currently costs $8,700 per person every year, and provides little hope or incentive for participants to leave the welfare system. By investing just $4,400 more for each participant than the Work Experience Program, we hope to be running an on-the-job training program that offers a permanent exit from the system.

HEADLINE: Weicker Calls Special Session Over Patriots

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. summoned the General Assembly today for a special legislative session later this month on the subject of football, specifically the hows and whys of luring the New England Patriots professional football team south from Massachusetts.
Mr. Weicker said the move poses an "opportunity of potentially great benefit" to Connecticut and thus qualifies as an emergency that justifies a special session. It is to begin Sept. 22. 
 "A prompt and clear expression of support for such a transfer is necessary to maximize the probability that such a transfer will occur," Mr. Weicker said.
 
Asking for a Stadium
 Administration officials have been negotiating for months with a group of investors who have said they would try to buy the team and move it to Hartford, in return for a $260 million stadium built by the state. The legislature will have to consider the money questions: how and whether to sell bonds for a stadium, buying the land, and "related infrastructure improvements," as Mr. Weicker put it.
Legislative leaders said they were ready to play ball with the Governor. But they warned that for all the euphoria that the notion of a local National Football League team has produced among fans and business owners, the talks are preliminary and the arrangement will still have to prove itself economically for the city and the state, or it will go nowhere.
"I want to know what the deal is that we're going to have to live with," said Senator William A. DiBella, a Democrat from Hartford and the Senate majority leader. Mr. DiBella, who has opposed Mr. Weicker on several recent issues, notably casino gambling -- Mr. DiBella favored it, Mr. Weicker was against -- has lately been one of the loudest voices in questioning the Patriots proposal.
The plan calls for an investors group led by a former minority owner, Francis T. Murray, to buy the team, which would play in a state-financed 70,000-seat stadium. But many questions remain unanswered. Mr. DiBella said lawmakers had not been provided with a list of the team's prospective buyers, which he described as the most basic of first steps.
 
Bargaining Chip?
 Other legislators have voiced concerns that Hartford's hopes are being raised simply as a bargaining chip to pressure Massachusetts to build a new stadium to replace the Patriots current site in Foxboro, or negotiate a more favorable deal there. The team now has one of the least generous leasing arrangements in the league, industry experts say, and has chafed for years about not getting any money for parking or concessions.
"I do not want to be perceived as an obstructionist, but as a skeptic," Mr. DiBella told reporters in outlining his concerns. "I am a skeptic by virtue of my having to spend $260 million in taxpayers' money."
Connecticut is already heavily invested in sports. In a deal announced earlier this week after six months of negotiations between the Weicker administration and the owners of the Hartford Whalers hockey team, the state said it would assume $27.5 million in debts of the team in return for a 20-year commitment by the Whalers to remain in Hartford. The state went further into the entertainment business by agreeing to take over control and revenue of the luxury skyboxes and the parking garage at the Hartford Civic Center, where the team plays.
 
State Could Own Whalers
 The state could even end up owning the hockey franchise, under an agreement that gives the Connecticut Development Authority an option to buy a majority interest in the team if the current owners want to sell and cannot find a local buyer during the 20-year contract.
In both the Whalers deal and the initial study of the Patriots proposal, state officials have said that the bonds sold to pay for the investments would be paid off through concessions, fees and tax revenues generated by the franchises themselves, and that taxpayers would not be stuck with the bills, even though public money was used.
A state-commissioned study by KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm, also concluded that as major league cities go, Hartford is not far short of the mark. The study, issued this week, said that if the region within 25 miles of the city were ranked among the 10 N.F.L. teams with the highest attendance in 1992, the Hartford market would rank fourth in average household income and eighth in population. About 2.4 million people live within a 60-minute drive of Hartford, which is 120 miles from New York City and 105 miles from Boston.
A move by the Patriots would also have to be approved by the N.F.L. Legislative leaders said this week that they want to commission their own study to validate the numbers from Peat Marwick.

HEADLINE: Out and About: A periodic look at summer in the New York area;
All Summer Long, in One Weekend

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J., Sept. 2

 BODY:
As the sun drops in the sky and the children grow tired and the gulls become cockier, the people who linger on the beach go down to the water and stand in it, sit in it, lie in it, surrender to it.
On the wide beach that runs for miles here, an old man stood ankle-deep in the surf, staring out to sea and massaging his belly, as round as his wife's when she bore their children. A woman lay on her back in the wet sand, knees drawn up, arms at her sides, eyes closed, as if waiting to be swept away. A girl knelt in the shallow surf, each retreating wave digging her deeper into the sand. But she would not close the book she was reading or rise from the water. 
 This is the last week of summer, a quiet time even for resort areas like Wildwood Island, before the final crush of beachgoers comes over the bridges for the Labor Day weekend. It has been a good summer for vacation areas throughout the New York region, a season of sunny weekends and large crowds, and the respite is almost welcome here, where a hot day in August brings 250,000 people to the beach and the boardwalk.
"We're still kind of on autopilot for the end of the season," Edmund J. Grant Jr., Wildwood's part-time Mayor, said as he worried over his crowded schedule for coming weekends, when vacationing families are succeeded by conventioneers and empty-nesters and American Association of Retired Persons tours.
Most of the college help is back at school. The exchange students from Ireland who wait on tables are in their last week. "People double up, work a little harder, and I always say no job is beneath me," said Mary Erseg, who runs the Heart of Wildwood motel with her husband, Joseph. "Our motto is, 'if you see it, do it.' "
Tourism officials say that even as the poor economy led to shorter vacations, the good weather and renewed confidence in the water quality off Long Island and New Jersey produced the best summer in years.
"Reports range from the best ever to the best in five years, since the beach washups in 1987," said Eugene Dilbeck, director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. "The big thing is the weather really cooperated, and the water quality has been excellent."
Bern Rotman, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Tourism, said most areas of the state were reporting an excellent season. "People aren't saying 'I can't go anywhere at all,' " he said. "They're saying, 'I still have to get away, so I'll do it close to home.' "
 
Too Much Beach for Some
 On the Wildwood beaches, the biggest complaint is that the strip of sand grows every year, making the walk to the water longer and longer. This might sound like lunatic grumbling elsewhere on the Jersey Shore, where beaches are eroding. But trudging across nearly a third of a mile of hot sand is no vacation.
"Younger people are coming down from up north," Nicky Ripoli observed from his umbrella-rental stand in Wildwood Crest, as evidence that the expanding sands are spurring a migration.
"Up north," to Mr. Ripoli, who is 17 years old, is 26th Street in Wildwood, at the heart of the boardwalk and amusement piers, but also where the beach is broadest. If the younger crowd is leaving the boardwalk for a shorter walk across the beach in "the Crest," a dry town whose hotels cater to families with small children, other herds must also be on the move.
The Wildwoods are a world apart from the rest of the Jersey Shore. In the 1950's and 60's they tore down the Victorian homes that their neighbor Cape May let stand, and a riot of hotels and motels took their place.
The local owners pillaged the world for their hotels' names -- from the Alps and the Aztec to the Shalimar and the Waikiki -- dressed them up in wraparound wrought-iron balconies, and planted artificial palm trees around the pools.
The 1970's lowered the drinking age to 18 and brought new life to Wildwood as a party town. But when the drinking age went back up to 21, the island remained what it had always been, a family resort for the kind of families who somehow never got around to buying that summer home.
Stone Harbor and Avalon had their sedate summer colonies and their beach-tag police; the Wildwoods had free beaches and thousands of affordable hotel rooms and efficiencies.
 
Mom-and-Pop Charm
 "Sometimes I'm a little jealous of Cape May," said Joseph Salerno, who owns the Imperial 500, a block-long motel near the boardwalk. But there is also charm in Wildwood's mom-and-pop motels and their period architecture, even if that period is 1964.
"They're not the quality of a Hilton or Sheraton, but they're not sterile and anonymous, either," he said. "There's a warmer quality to them. With the open balconies, you get to meet your neighbors. I've seen people become friends."
At season's end, the island now has the families who are squeezing in a vacation, getting away one last time before school begins, or getting away for the first time after a long summer of saving or being stuck at work.
Down in the surf, their chairs set in about four inches of water, Mary Ellen Keaney and Debby Ference of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., gave different reasons for rewarding themselves.
 
Conflicts With Sports Leagues
 "My summer's been great," said Ms. Keaney. "This is our vacation for the end of the year."
This was Ms. Ference's first vacation; her 12-year-old daughter, Nicole, and 6-year-old son, Stephen, were in sports leagues all summer. Still, she said, she was lucky. "We have friends here whose son couldn't come, because he'd be benched if he missed football this week."
The Branco sisters of Montreal, Sandra, Teresa and Lucy, first came here with their parents 20 years ago, and now come each year with their parents, their husbands and their children, 14 people in all this year. They rent a house, cook their own meals, and so save enough for a goal of many Canadians, a winter vacation in the Caribbean.
"We always take the last week in August, because it's not as crowded and it's still hot," Teresa said. "And there aren't as many other Quebecers, either. We want to get away, after all."
 
Paradise for Little Suckers
 The beach is so wide that to people standing in the surf, the hotels and boardwalk seem to be another island. And indeed the boardwalk is one more escape, perhaps the last place where parents don't have to worry when a stranger calls to a child; all he wants is for another sucker to spend a dollar on the Frog Bog.
Ian and Sarah Gillespie of Cranford wanted their parents to spend $5 so they could play Boat Tag: they would pilot an armored boat while as many as a dozen people fired rubber balls at them at 90 miles an hour. Their father, John, had doubts.
But their mother, Linda, said it was fine. They were here for a day and a night, and this was their entire vacation. "John had to work through his vacation, so he said, let's come down here," Mrs. Gillespie said. "I prefer the quiet on Long Beach Island, where we usually go, but this is for kids, and they're having fun."
Mr. Gillespie walked up, holding a five-dollar bill, enough for a jumbo bucket of balls. "This is how you get back at your kids," he said. A minute later, his wife joined him at a second gun, firing at point-blank range. They seemed to be having fun, too.

HEADLINE: Enrollment Diminishes At Blue Cross

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Buffeted by criticism and management turmoil, New York State's largest health insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, lost half a million of the 7.6 million people it was insuring at the beginning of the year.
Empire executives attributed the loss to a variety of causes, ranging from rate increases to its customers' smaller work forces to a year of internal disruption and an erosion in consumer confidence. For the company, which has always prided itself on being the nation's largest Blue Cross plan, the loss is humbling, but its financial effects are unclear. 
 Indeed, in filings with the State Insurance Department, which show how dramatically Empire's business has changed, the company is predicting its first annual profit in years. In January, when it was granted rate increases of as much as 27 percent, it projected a loss of $92 million.
 
Claims Lower Than Expected
 Company officials said the unexpected profit was largely a result of a health-industry-wide phenomenon in which the size of claims for virtually every type of medical service, including hospital and doctor care and drugs, has been running far lower than anticipated. They said the development may serve to hold down future rate requests, and the company's new chief executive officer said that it had not determined what action it might take regarding increases already approved.
Salvatore R. Curiale, the State Superintendent of Insurance, has described the prospect of further large increases by Empire as "nauseating." In addition to the rate increases that more than 100,000 of Empire's 7.1 million customers already face this year is the potential for a further increase of 35 percent now being pondered by the company. The increase would be for those who pay for major medical coverage directly, rather than as members of groups and who in many cases are among the oldest and sickest residents in the state -- people no other company will insure.
The changes in Empire's financial projections are contained within a quarterly filing the company made with the state on its performance through March 31. Surprised by its prediction of profitability, State Insurance Department officials asked the company for a clarification, and in replies, as well as in interviews yesterday, several of Empire's top executives indicated how sweepingly the company's profile and its strategies have changed since its longtime leader, Albert A. Cardone, was forced to leave the company last spring.
For example, Empire's new chief executive, G. Robert O'Brien, questioned the strategy of seeking landmark insurance legislation, which the company had lobbied for tenaciously for years and which took effect last April. The regulation requires any insurance company writing coverage for smaller employers and groups to provide coverage to all applicants, something that Empire and other nonprofit companies alone had to do previously.
 
Accounts Lost
 One result of that legislation, Mr. O'Brien said, was a raiding of Empire accounts by brokers who received commissions from for-profit companies, which Empire is barred from paying by state regulation. The company said it lost 7,000 of the 41,000 small groups in what are called its community-rated pool since the legislation took effect.
Mr. O'Brien also said that in light of continuing losses involving its business with large national companies -- losses that the company estimates will top $10 million this year -- it had decided not to rebid for the indemnity contracts it currently holds with A.T.&T., which cover several hundred thousand people and which will expire next year. Under Mr. Cardone, Empire had actively sought such large national accounts, ostensibly to provide profits that would subsidize losses it incurred as the insurer of last resort for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers.
According to company figures, however, the national accounts appear to be the only ones showing losses this year while the community-rated accounts, after six years in which they sustained losses of $600 million, are showing a projected profit of more than $30 million.
Donald L. Morchower, Empire's chief operating officer, said Empire would continue to bid for other types of A.T.&T. business and would make a bid for the indemnity insurance as part of a consortium of several Blue Cross plans.
Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Morchower cited several reasons for the significant decline in business at Empire, including ever-increasing rates and substantial employee reductions at many companies it insures, like I.B.M. But, a significant factor for many, Mr. O'Brien said, was "the adverse publicity."
"They don't have faith in the company anymore. Based on everything I know, there is not a risk of this company going out of business. But the perception on the street is it's very shaky."
According to company figures, 80,000 of 685,000 people who maintained individual policies with Empire dropped their coverage this year. According to what Mr. Morchower described as the study of a small sample, "about 25 percent left us and went uninsured."
Mr. O'Brien said Empire's sales force had difficulty in particular in acquiring new accounts in light of newspaper reports that cited the executive salaries and perquisites and questionable business decisions that led to Mr. Cardone's ouster and the company's own admission that it submitted false business figures to the state.

HEADLINE: 30-Year Treasury Bond's Yield Falls Below 6%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates plunged to their lowest level in a quarter century yesterday, riding a rising wave of bad news on the economy and good news on inflation that could carry interest rates even lower.
Although expectations had grown for a drop below 6 percent in the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, a yield of 5.94 percent was still an unfamiliar sight to many on Wall Street. 
 Traders and analysts reared in the high-inflation years of the late 1970's and early 1980's have never seen rates this low, which is why many had refused to believe that the rally of the last month would continue.
And even for those who remember 6 percent, this move had an odd sensation. When long-term rates were last at this level, in the late 1960's, they were on the way up, not down.
"When I came to the bank in 1972, the yield on the 10-year note was 6.27 percent," said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities as he looked at his handwritten entry of the yield on July 6, 1972. Yesterday, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.28 percent, the lowest since 1968, when Mr. Fine was in graduate school at Columbia.
But as strange as the new levels may feel, both traders and analysts are going with the flow, saying that long-term rates should keep falling.
"The window has not closed for lower yields," said Mr. Fine, who had forecast that 6 percent would be breached. "But you have to be more cautious when you get below 6 percent."
Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said, "This is certainly one of the dramatic rallies in modern times," referring to the drop of three-quarters of a percentage point in the yield on the 30-year bond in just six weeks. Since the election of President Clinton in November, the yield is down more than one and a half percentage points.
"So you would think we are due to catch our breath," added Mr. DiClemente, suggesting yields would rise a little and prices fall as traders and investors take stock. "But the economic fundamentals -- subdued inflation and slow growth -- and policy considerations, all suggest there is no lasting threat to this rally. We're not prepared to say sell."
But both those outlooks assume that the economic backdrop to the rally -- low inflation and very slow growth -- stays in place. If there is a surprise on the high side in the August inflation data or the economy picks up some steam faster than now expected, the yield decline could at least stall, if not reverse slightly.
 
Jobs Data Are Key
 The rally yesterday, which also drove down intermediate- and short-term interest rates, was set off by a surprisingly weak jobs report for August. According to the Labor Department, nonfarm payroll jobs fell 39,000 last month while the expectation in the market had been for an increase of around 145,000.
In half-day trading ahead of the Labor Day holiday, the price of the 30-year bond ended up 114/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.94 percent, from 6.04 percent Wednesday.
Shorter-term maturities fared even better. The yield on the two-year note dropped to 3.69 percent, a low for the year, from 3.81 percent the day before. This sharp move seems to indicate that there are investors in the market beginning to think that the Federal Reserve Board may be forced to cut short-term interest rates if the economy continues to be as weak as the jobs figures indicate.
Combined with recent data that show inflation rising at a 2.8 percent annual rate this year, the slow growth makes a perfect backdrop for falling yields. On the one hand, it dampens any fear that prices will rise soon, which helps long-term rates fall. On the other hand, it helps short-term yields fall because it makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will move any time soon to raise short-term interest rates, which the central bank would do if it felt economic growth was speeding up enough to push prices higher.
But the economic fundamentals are not the only factor moving prices higher and yields lower. There are portfolio managers and small investors who are just scrambling for higher yields.
There are others who have little concern about the interest rate and price levels they are buying at. This is another reason many analysts feel that rates can move lower.
These buyers are portfolio managers who have invested in mortgage-backed securities only to see them prepaid much earlier than expected as homeowners refinance their mortgages to take advantage of declining rates. To keep their portfolios with the average maturity level they want, they have to grab quickly for long-term Treasury securities.
State, city and local governments also need Treasury securities for the escrow funds they set up to pay off the old, higher-interest-rate municipal bonds they are refinancing.
"People aren't paying through 6 percent because they want to," said Williman Pike, who runs the primary dealership at Chemical Securities. "They need it for their investment objectives, and they are doing it because they have to."
And because of these buyers, he concluded, "there is no reason to think that this trade has ended."
 
Troublesome Dates
 Determining when interest rates on the 30-year bond were as low as yesterday is not as easy at it might seem.
Regular issuing of 30-year bonds did not begin until May 1977. So only since then has there been a consistent market in 30-year Treasury bonds.
Based on historical data compiled by Salomon Brothers, yesterday's 5.94 percent is the lowest since the monthly average yield of 5.82 percent in January 1973.
But Mr. DiClemente argued that that yield was not an accurate reflection of 30-year Treasury yields at the time. The yield is based on old 30-year bonds sold by the Treasury that were selling at a deep discount to their face value as inflation started to rise. This meant the yield was lower than real market levels, a point reinforced by the jump in the average yield to 6.89 percent the next month.
Thirty-year utility bonds, which unlike Treasury bonds were regularly issued 25 years ago, are a good proxy, therefore, to use to determine when 30-year interest rates were last at the level they reached yesterday. Based on that, the yield on double-A utility bonds is now back to the 6.5 percent it was at in the fall of 1968.
The Salomon reading of the old 30-year Treasury bonds for late 1968 puts their average yield then at 5.57 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Built Vehicles in Sales Rise

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks continued their steady rise in late August, gaining 19.7 percent from the corresponding period last year, when sales were sluggish.
Many dealers reported that low inventories of 1993 models, rather than flagging consumer interest, kept them from selling even more vehicles. "Sales were decent, but inventory was so low we could have done better," said Bob Van Ramshorst, co-owner of Ridgeway Chevrolet-Geo in Lansing, Ill. He said that that problem was easing as the new 1994 models arrived in his showroom. 
 "Right now we're selling as many as we can get," he said.
Inventories are low at many dealerships in part because demand is stronger than expected and in part because some plants have been shut to gear up for new models.
 
Clearance Sales Cited
 "The figure for August probably understates the strength in the market, because inventories are low," said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, a consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J.
Some dealers attributed the strong period to clearance sales, to make room for the new models, and to low interest rates. "The credit unions are sending out fliers telling people about the low rates," said Curtis Markland, new-car sales manager at McMorris Downtown Ford in Austin, Tex.
Analysts who had been worried that demand appeared to soften in early August were reassured by the new figures. "The positive thing I see is that we don't have big spikes in demand," said Joseph S. Phillippi, a Lehman Brothers analyst. "It looks as if demand is in a steady uptrend."
In late August, sales of domestically built cars rose 17.8 percent, while sales of light trucks rose 22.4 percent. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 6.8 million for the Aug. 21-31 period, compared with 5.9 million for the corresponding period last year and 7 million in mid-August. For the entire month, the rate was 6.7 million, compared with 5.9 million last year.
For the month, total vehicle sales -- including domestically built and imported cars and light trucks -- rose 8.7 percent, to 1,148,132, compared with 1,056,393 in August 1992. Dealers sold a total of 702,507 cars and 445,625 light trucks.
The Big Three lost a sliver of market share in August, selling 67.1 percent of cars and light trucks, compared with 67.4 percent in August 1992. Japanese-built vehicles accounted for 27.9 percent of the market, as opposed to 27.2 percent last year. The Japanese gains came thanks to cars and trucks built at plants in the United States, rather than from imports.
Vehicles built by European and other producers declined to 5 percent of the market, from 5.4 percent last year.
Sales of domestically built cars totaled 201,641 for General Motors, 150,940 for Ford Motor and 51,310 for Chrysler.
Honda sold 50,992 domestically built cars, while Toyota sold 36,181, Nissan sold 24,548, Mazda sold 8,513, Mitsubishi sold 7,016 and Suburu sold 4,040.
August sales of domestically built light trucks totaled 131,266 for G.M., 144,028 for Ford, 91,764 for Chrysler, 10,957 for Toyota, 15,929 for Nissan, 6,413 for Isuzu and 3,760 for Mazda.
While G.M. posted an increase in total car sales -- domestic and imported -- of 4.8 percent, to 210,117, its share of the car market slipped to 30.3 percent, from 31.2 percent during August 1992. Its total truck sales slipped 5.3 percent, to 131,701.
Ford continued to gain its share of the market, rising to 22.2, compared with 21.8 percent last year. Chrysler claimed 8.5 percent of the market, compared with 8.2 percent last year. Car sales rose 10.2 percent at Ford, to 154,212, and 11.4 percent at Chrysler, to 58,772.
August was the 21st straight month in which Ford beat its comparable month's sales, and the 19th straight month that Chrysler did.
Nissan's car sales posted a 10.2 percent gain in August, to 43,864, thanks partly to strong sales of the Altima sedan. Nissan's truck sales rose 11.3 percent, to 20,074.
New cars helped increase Mitsubishi sales by 53.5 percent, to 15,206. The maker's truck sales rose 29.8 percent, to 719.
Toyota car sales rose 5.2 percent for the month, to 69,727, while truck sales increased 31.3 percent, to 40,426. Honda car sales rose 5.2 percent, to 75,759.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Is Flat for New York City

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The August unemployment rate rose slightly in New York and New Jersey but remained unchanged in New York City, according to a Labor Department report issued yesterday.
New York State's unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent, from 7.5 percent in July, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year in August, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. 
 In New York City, the unemployment rate for August was 9.5 percent, unchanged from July, but down from the August 1992 figure of 11.1 percent.
New Jersey's unemployment rate was 7.1 percent for August, up just slightly from 6.9 percent in July. In August 1992, the rate was 9.2 percent.
 
U.S. Rate at 2-Year Low
 Nationwide, the unemployment rate edged down to a two-year low of 6.7 percent in August. The Labor Department survey of the largest industrial states does not include figures for Connecticut.
"A broad, sustained job expansion continues to be a tough proposition to put into place," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
In another measure of economic activity for the region, the report found the number of employed people declined slightly in August in New York City and New York State, and remained almost unchanged in New Jersey.
In New York City, it said there were 2,985,000 people employed in August, 52,000 fewer than in July. In New York State, it said there were 7,814,000 people employed in August, 45,000 fewer than in July. In New Jersey, it said there were 3,662,000 people employed in August, a gain of 21,000 from July.
 
Issue in Governor's Race
 In New Jersey, the figures were released as the campaign for Governor was expected to intensify after the Labor Day weekend. The campaign of Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican challenger to Gov. Jim Florio, seized on the figures.
"The rise in unemployment is continuing proof that the economic policies of the incumbent administration aren't working," a Whitman campaign spokesman, Carl Golden, said.
In a statement, Mr. Florio said: "The long-term trend continues to be encouraging, but we are in a long, slow battle for economic recovery. We will keep doing everything possible to create jobs and build an economy that offers good jobs for good pay."
 
Pennsylvania Rate Is Up
 The employment picture in New Jersey continued to be brighter than its neighbors'. Pennsylvania's jobless rate crept up two-tenths of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent.
Richard M. Stein, vice president and associate economist with the Corestates Financial Corporation, a bank holding company in Philadelphia, said the increase in the size of New Jersey's labor force might indicate that discouraged workers were no longer dropping out of the labor pool. It could also signify a reversal of net migration out of the state by unsuccessful job seekers.
Mr. Stein said he expected little change in the state's future jobless rate.
"We'll see a tenth of a point change up or down on a monthly basis," he said. "Over all, even for 1994, we'll see a rate that averages above 7.5 percent."

HEADLINE: Olympus Drops Plan for New Headquarters in Melville

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Sept. 3

 BODY:
The Olympus Corporation, the Japanese-owned manufacturer of cameras and medical equipment, has dropped plans to build a new American corporate headquarters on 53.7 acres of state land in Melville, L.I., citing legal opposition from a local civic association.
The decision, conveyed to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a letter today from Kenji Fujii, the president and chief executive officer of Olympus America of Lake Success, marks the collapse of a two-year effort by the State Urban Development Corporation and Suffolk County to assist the company in siting the headquarters on a corner of the 500-acre Long Island Developmental Center, a former state center for the retarded. 
 Mr. Fujii said in the letter that "the continued uncertainty of the proposed project" and "strong opposition" from the civic group compelled the company to look for another Long Island site on which to consolidate its Lake Success and Woodbury offices.
 
Lawsuit by Owners' Group
 The group, House Beautiful at Dix Hills Owners Association, filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in July charging that the Urban Development Corporation had overstepped its authority and violated state environmental laws in trying to advance the project on land surrounded by residential communities, including Dix Hills. The state property is zoned for residential use.
Sheila Saks, the group's president, said group members hoped that Olympus would relocate in a commercially zoned area of the town. "Hopefully the state will work with the town and the community in developing a master plan for the Long Island Developmental Center property that is compatible with the surrounding area so as to avoid further controversy and litigation," Mrs. Saks said.
The Town of Huntington, where Melville is located, had also sued to stop the project, but the town and officials of the Urban Development Corporation were near a settlement. "The Olympus action therefore comes as a complete surprise," said Matthew L. Hickerson, a town spokesman.
 
Hearing on Restructured Plan
 Under the Urban Development Corporation plan, the state would have leased the 53.7 acre site to a developer, Ronald Parr, for a $7.2 million initial payment. Mr. Parr would then have built the 234,000-square-foot headquarters office building to house 600 Olympus employees. The Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency was to issue $40 million in bonds to back the project.
However, the Urban Development Corporation contended that the pending legal actions had hindered private financing. The state agency had scheduled a hearing for Sept. 12 on a restructured plan under which the agency would agree to assume financial responsibility for the project if construction was delayed or halted by court order.
In a statement today, the chairman of the Urban Development Corporation, Vincent Tese, decried the stifling of "reasonable economic growth" by "narrow, parochial concerns that some citizens would place above the legitimate interests of the broader community in which they reside."
Mr. Tese said that Long Island "needs to preserve its global competitive stature, and needs to remain a hospitable locale for such clean, responsible, high-technology companies as Olympus."

Oil Ends the Week Lower As OPEC Exceeds Ceiling

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices finished lower yesterday, ending a bearish week in which prices declined $1 a barrel.
Pressure is coming from high output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is producing well above the group's ceiling of 23.6 million barrels a day. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said output was 25 million barrels a day, with some oil going into stockpiles. 
 "OPEC is increasing its crude supplies to Europe and elsewhere in a battle for market share ahead of the Sept. 25 meeting," said Al Roark, energy economist at the WEFA Group.
October crude oil dropped 24 cents, to $17.73 a barrel, October unleaded gas fell 0.54 cent, to 50.80 cents a gallon, and October heating oil sank 0.32 cent, to 52.88 cents a gallon.
After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute said that for the second time in six weeks the United States had imported a record amount of crude oil, averaging 7.9 million barrels a day.
 
New Contract Highs on Pork
 Commodity trading was slow in most markets ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. All United States commodity exchanges will be closed Monday, Labor Day.
Pork prices soared to new contract highs on growing sentiment among traders that the Government had previously overestimated the size of the hog herd. "Traders are finally realizing that the hogs are simply not there," said Dennis Smith, director of research for Linnco Futures Group.
The pace of the hog slaughter slowed again this week despite strong cash prices. Some livestock analysts suspected that the Government's previous pig crop report had exaggerated the size of the herd, although prices declined on suspicions that Midwestern flooding had hindered efforts to market the animals.
Adding to the price strength yesterday was talk that Russia would seek to buy pork through the United States export enhancement program, in which the Government subsidizes foreign sales of grain and other agricultural commodities.
Coffee prices sank, with September off 2.1 cents at 73.35 cents a pound.

Dollar Falls Against Mark On Drop in U.S. Payroll Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark yesterday after an unexpected drop in the number of United States payroll jobs convinced investors that American interest rates would remain lower than those abroad. The dollar also dropped against most other currencies.
Gold prices were up domestically and mixed overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $364.50 a troy ounce, up 90 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $364.50 a troy ounce, up $1.10. 
 The dollar plunged to its lowest closing level against the German mark in nearly three months after the Labor Department reported that businesses cut 39,000 jobs from their payrolls in August. Traders had expected an increase of 140,000 or more.
"It was like a shock to the market," said David De Rosa, a foreign-exchange director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
He said that German officials had indicated continued support in recent days for keeping relatively high interest rates as their economy emerges from recession. Other European countries, while expected to drop interest rates soon, also offer higher returns on government bonds than the United States.
 
Move Hurts Dollar
 Government authorities are expected to keep rates low, which is thought to stimulate the domestic economy, but hurts the dollar as investors look to other currencies for higher returns.
The dollar's decline was exaggerated by the thinness of the market just before the Labor Day weekend.
Investors also sold European currencies and the Japanese yen to buy marks.
The dollar lost the momentum it had gained against the yen in the last week, after indications that the United States Government was no longer pushing for a stronger yen as a way to close the huge United States trade deficit.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 105.55 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 105.05 yen, compared with 105.85 on Thursday. In New York, the dollar finished at 104.55 yen, down from 105.87 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5263, up from $1.5005 late Thursday. In New York, the pound finished at $1.5265, more expensive than $1.5030 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A Primer: The Forces Propelling Interest Rates Back to the 1960's

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The earth did not tremble when the interest yield on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped below 6 percent yesterday for the first time in a quarter century. But as economic symbols go, it was a big one, a sign of near-consensus that the American economy is hunkering down for a long period of stable prices and tepid growth.
 "The Wall Street types are all redoing their charts to go back to the 1950's," said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute -- back to an era when savings accounts paid 2 percent and inflation was something that happened to profligate foreigners. 
 That is good news or bad news, depending on what you own and whether you are securely employed. With interest earnings on bank deposits barely covering inflation, those living on savings have been induced to take bigger risks to find higher returns. Tens of billions of dollars have poured into mutual funds that invest in bonds and stocks, driving the securities markets to record highs and cutting the cost of borrowing for homeowners and businesses.
 The messages are equally mixed for Washington's movers and shakers. On the one hand, the willingness of Americans to lend their money to Uncle Sam for as long as three decades at just half the rate they demanded as recently as late 1984 is evidence of the Federal Reserve's credibility as a bulwark against a decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. On the other, it is evidence that Corporate America lacks sufficient confidence to respond to attractive credit terms with a boom in investment.
 An interest rate is a price determined by supply and demand. Just as the price of a bag of Fritos represents the terms of the deal struck between snack-craving teen-agers and the Frito-Lay Company, interest represents the bargain between those willing to part temporarily with their savings and those eager to command the use of resources they do not own.
There are many interest rates, of course, not one. Rates vary with the perceived risk that the borrower will fail to honor the contract. The Grace L. Ferguson Storm Door and Airline Company pays higher rates than General Electric. And G.E., in turn, pays higher rates than the United States Treasury.
Treasury rates are sometimes called "riskless" rates because Washington can always create enough money to meet the interest bill on Government securities. But riskless is a bit of a misnomer since it only refers to the chance the borrower will default. Those who lend dollars -- even to the Government -- are taking a risk about how much the periodic payments they get in the future will be worth in terms of shoes or rent or phone calls to Grandma.
 
Eyes on the Calendar
 By no coincidence, then, lenders generally demand higher rates for longer loans: yesterday, the annualized cost of borrowing for 30 years was roughly double the cost of borrowing overnight. But it is often higher because longer commitments are sometimes seen as more favorable to lenders than borrowers.
If, for example, most people expect the cost of borrowing to fall in a few years, borrowers will be reluctant to lock in as high an interest rate on, say, a 10-year loan as on a one-year loan. The last time this happened -- the last time the "yield curve" tilted downhill -- was in the summer of 1981, when the Federal Reserve was in the midst of the battle to convince jittery financial markets that Washington would absolutely, positively not let inflation fly out of control.
The Fed, as just pointed out, does play a role in determining interest rates. But as millions of college sophomores who have struggled through Econ 101 know at least before exam time, there is more than an occasional slip between cup and lip.
As the owner of tens of billions of dollars worth of Government securities, the Fed can influence the interest cost of short-term loans by buying or selling from its vast portfolio. Buying Treasury securities from the public makes more money available for private loans, lowering interest rates. Alternatively, selling Treasury i.o.u.'s siphons money out of private bank accounts and makes credit less plentiful and more expensive.
Such "open market operations," along with a handful of other techniques in the Fed's bag of tricks, give the central bank effective control of the cost of borrowing money for a day, a week or a month. But the Fed's influence on the terms of longer loans is more elusive.
 
How Short Affects Long
 In the most direct way -- and the way things seem to be working -- lowering interest rates on short loans drives down the rates on longer loans by increasing the willingness of savers to part with their money for longer periods. Just ask the hordes of retirees from Miami to Santa Barbara, who have been plowing their billions from maturing bank deposits into long-term bonds that pay a few percentage points more interest.
But this is a game in which the rules can change. At some point, people may recall what happened in the 1970's, when two oil shocks and a boom in grain demand sent world prices soaring. If retirees -- and more important, the professional advisers to pension plans and mutual funds -- begin to fear that easier credit terms today will lead to more inflation tomorrow, low short-term rates could actually lead to higher long-term rates.
For the moment, though, inflation is apparently a very distant worry, and for obvious reasons.
The Federal Reserve has been telling everyone who will listen that it will not casually let go of its hard-won credibility as keeper of a sound currency -- that it is more inclined to tighten credit than to loosen it. Banks, shellshocked by a barrage of bad real estate debt in the late 1980's, are still reluctant to lend. And as Henry Kaufman, a longtime observer of Wall Street, points out, much of the borrowing by homeowners and corporations is merely recycling existing debts at better terms.
After four years of slow or no growth and wave after wave of corporate belt-tightening, neither businesses nor wage earners are in a mood to take chances with other people's money.
Thus, how one views the breaking of the 6 percent barrier depends on where one stands. For those who assumed the 1970's and 1980's were a prelude, it is reassurance that instability is not a new fact of economic life. But it is hardly a vote of confidence in the vigor of the Great American Job Machine, or for that matter in the wheezing economic giants of Japan and the European Community. Interest rates are low because "the industrial economies are going nowhere," concludes Mr. Kaufman.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Looking for Safer Yield In All the Right Places

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
PREDICTING the course of interest rates is notoriously difficult. It requires getting the economy right, and then timing the market. Who could have guessed that a Democratic President with ambitious social programs would send yields to their lowest levels in decades?
But for investors who trembled as long Treasuries burst through 6 percent this week, a growing breed of strategists aims to provide some protection should yields bounce back up. Foreign debt, junk bonds, high-yielding stocks and municipals are among their suggestions. In general, the strategists favor broad diversification and caution that the credit markets can't continue to deliver terrific returns. 
 Like most messianic longings, the search for higher yields with lower risks has given rise to impostors. Short-term global income funds looked remarkably like safe domestic funds with higher yields until last September. When Europe's monetary system cracked, investors in these funds learned about the currency risks. Faddish, adjustable-rate mortgage funds have also attracted yield seekers, but have been among the year's worst performers.
The standard advice to wary bond investors is to shorten maturities, because going from 20 or more years to 5 or 10 can usually preserve much of the yield with less chance of loss. But now, the longest maturities yield so much more than the shorter ones that a sudden jump in interest rates could leave holders of the shorter issues no better off.
Robert A. Beckwitt, who runs the Fidelity Asset Manager funds, calculated this week that whether you buy 5, 10 or 30-year Treasury issues, a rise in yields of three-tenths of 1 percent over the coming year would leave you with total returns of slightly more than 3 percent. That's about the same as the one-year bill. If rates remain stable or lower, the 30-year bond would provide returns so much better that he recommends it over the shorter issues. As of yesterday, the five-year yielded 4.6 percent, the 30-year 5.9 percent.
Most mainstream domestic debt offers yields and potential price gains far below the returns of recent years, Mr. Beckwitt says. He has turned instead to foreign debt, junk bonds and some stocks. He likes emerging markets, especially Mexico, "an investment grade country, but it's not rated that way," he said. Mexico's Brady bonds, with the principal guaranteed by the Treasury, are still paying much more than American issues of similar security.
Falling interest rates in Europe also make debt there attractive, although Mr. Beckwitt has hedged most of his currency risk.
Junk bonds? The experience of a few years ago was terrible, Mr. Beckwitt concedes -- so terrible that spreads over other bonds remain advantageously high. "People remember Michael Milken," he said, "but the circumstances now are completely different." Yields of 9.5 to 10 percent on relatively sound issues provide a thick cushion against a reversal in the credit markets, he said. Some analysts, however, question the safety of a junk bond market that has welcomed new offerings from Donald Trump.
If a strengthening economy causes interest rates to rise, the improved health of junk bond issuers might still protect the value of their debt. Flourishing economies here and abroad would also lift cyclical stocks, which have generous dividends to boot. Energy stocks, Mr. Beckwitt adds, offer both high dividends and an inflation hedge based on the underlying commodities.
Mr. Beckwitt's major fund, with top ratings from the Morningstar newsletters, has had total returns of more than 15 percent this year. Eric E. Ryback, who also ranges across the stock and bond markets in search of income and capital gains, has returned 14 percent to his Lindner Dividend Fund investors.
Like Mr. Beckwitt, Mr. Ryback owns some junk, searching especially for corporate turnarounds. "We're value players, so we try to find things that have been depressed for reasons we believe are temporary," he said. For him, Dell Computer's 11 percent bonds represent good value from a company whose prospects are better than its press.
Otherwise, he has maintained his appetite for both bonds and preferred stock that is convertible into common, again favoring unloved issues. Both have higher yields than common stock but stand to benefit much more than straight bonds from improved business. His fund now yields about 6.5 percent.
Mr. Ryback has also bought some high-dividend stocks, including Eastman Kodak in the $40's last year when it was yielding about 5 percent. Most of the payoff has come from price gains, to $60 yesterday.
With money pouring into his fund, Mr. Ryback, worried about his ability to place it in a pricey market, closed the fund to new investors in early March. He plans to start a utility fund at the end of September.
Henry Kaufman, an economist whose consulting and money management firm bears his name, recommends not only the foreign markets but also municipal bonds. Depending on their credit quality, municipals are yielding 80 to 90 percent as much as Treasuries, and are especially attractive in view of rising tax rates.
Municipals are also more stable, Mr. Kaufman contends. Their yields have not fallen as far as other bonds' recently, but if the market turns, municipals will be safer.
Even if interest rates rise somewhat -- a quarter to half a percentage point on long Treasuries -- the stock market will remain steady, Mr. Kaufman said. But he sees little chance of the robust growth that could send rates much higher. "We have our stethoscopes out, but we're listening to faint murmurs instead of strong heartbeats," he said.
Rather than lending money to governments and corporations by buying their bonds, those worried about higher rates could always become borrowers. "Buy a house," said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. And take out a huge, fixed mortgage. Then, if inflation returns and interest rates rise, "You're paying back with cheaper dollars."

HEADLINE: Budapest and I.B.M. Make Music Together

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Sept. 3

 BODY:
When subscribers to the Hungarian Symphony Orchestra arrive for the season's opening night at the handsome Art Nouveau Academy of Music here next month, their tickets, their programs and the posters in the lobby will be emblazoned with the corporate logo of I.B.M., which is sponsoring the season. And I.B.M. is backing a special four-concert Mozart series and a Mozart piano concerto contest.
The idea of corporate support for cultural institutions is new in Eastern Europe and is still treated somewhat gingerly in countries where Communism held sway for so many years. Art is often considered by East Europeans to be sacrosanct and too pure for the incursion of crude commerce. But as a sign of the changes now taking place, Budapest University is offering well-attended courses on the economics of arts institutions, with a heavy emphasis on how to attract private money for culture. 
 I.B.M. says its initiative in Hungary is the start of a trend, and that similar efforts will flow from the financial needs of arts institutions in Eastern Europe and from the need for corporate image-building in these increasingly consumer-oriented societies.
"We would be supporting the Hungarian Symphony even if it wasn't having financial problems," said Balint Nagy, the marketing manager for I.B.M. here. "The orchestra has the image that suits us; it is an integral part of the cultural life here." Just as Marlboro sponsored the recent Formula One car race in Budapest because racing cars fit the cigarette company's identity, so the orchestra dovetailed with I.B.M.'s image, he said, adding, "We are trying to reach the music audience."
 
Innovative Efforts
 While Hungary's arts budgets have not been drastically cut by the Government, they have not been increased to keep pace with inflation. Thus, said Miklos Marschall, the Deputy Mayor for Culture in Budapest: "We have to come to a competely new way of financing culture and we have to do this in a situation in which there is no wealthy citizenry."
Mr. Marschall has been busy for the last year trying to marry commerce and culture. "The writers union came to us, for example, and said they couldn't pay the rent on their headquarters, and they asked us for money," he said. "We said we can't give you money but organized an American-style fund-raising event. We invited leading writers and bankers and businessmen. In this way we're trying to encourage Budapest firms to be patrons for the capital's culture."
I.B.M.'s sponsorship of the Hungarian Symphony, the first of its kind in the region, came after the company backed a special concert last year. "Discussions began then on how the relationship could be developed into a more fruitful and long-term cooperation," Mr. Nagy said.
The company's contribution involves only a fairly small amount of money: about $34,000 to be spread among the orchestra's costs, prize money for the student contest and support for the Mozart series. Mr. Nagy said the Hungarian Government had started to make provisions for tax exemptions for sponsorship of cultural groups.
 
Some Czech Doubts
 In Prague, the Czech Philharmonic, after several years of management difficulties, is in worse financial straits than the Hungarian Symphony. To turn the orchestra's economic situation around, a development director, a new term in the East European cultural lexicon, was hired this summer from England.
The orchestra, like all the major ensembles in Eastern Europe, earns hard currency from foreign tours but most of this is spent on new instruments. To plug a $1 million hole in the Philharmonic's $3 million budget for performances in the Czech Republic, the orchestra's new development director, Penny Steer, is searching for corporate help.
"We're at the beginning," said Miss Steer. "As yet there is no law for tax deductions that would favor potential sponsors, so the climate is not helpful. And recent statements by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus make it clear he is not favorable to sponsorship."
Mr. Klaus, one of the most pro-business politicians in Eastern Europe, expressed surprisingly old-guard ideas about support for the arts in an interview with a Czech newspaper in July.
"A sponsor says through his behavior that he doesn't accept the state view of sponsorship, that he disapproves of the way the state chooses its priorities and secures the public good," Mr. Klaus said in the interview in Cesky Denik, adding that he was opposed to tax breaks for sponsorship.
But Miss Steer said a debate was starting and Mr. Klaus's opposition might provoke the arts organizations into making "a united stand." Some companies have already offered help, she said, including Ceska Sporitelna, a national savings bank and the country's biggest financial institution.
The Rudolfphinum, the concert hall on the edge of the Vltava River where the Philharmonic plays, was built under the bank's auspices in the late 1800's, so the bank felt a natural affinity with the orchestra, she said. The bank gave a "meaningful" grant this year, Miss Steer said, although she would not say how much.
 
Warsaw Makes Do
 In Poland, the two best-known performing institutions, the National Philharmonic and the Wielki Theater, are finding that their government subsidies do not even make up for inflation. But with the exception of occasional sponsorship of special performances, corporate involvement has not been encouraged. Rather, these two organizations make do with revenue from overseas performances and increased rentals of their halls.
But in the provinces in Poland, where music, dance and theatrical groups abound, business involvement in the arts is rising. One such beneficiary is a new contemporary dance group, the Silesian Dance Theater based in Bytom in southern Poland, which won praise at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., this year. The troupe has received $7,000 or about 15 percent of its budget from three regional banks and an insurance company, said its director, Jacek Luminski. In return, the donors ask that they be identified in the programs and on the posters for the performances in the town's culture center, which until four years ago was run by the local Communist Party.
In Gdansk, on Poland's northern coast, the Teatr Wybrzeze, a repertory group with 36 full-time actors and 12 premieres a year, will lose its annual city subsidy of $80,000 next year. To make up the shortfall, the theater will open a restaurant, a bar and an art gallery. But the company also plans to try to increase corporate sponsorship to 5 percent of revenues from the current 0.5 percent.
"There's no tradition here of corporate sponsorship, so it's something we have to really sell companies," said Ewa Bonk-Wozniakiewicz, the theater's director. "But once they see a Western firm has sponsored us, it's easier to convince them. Our Shakespeare Festival was sponsored by British Airways."
"True corporate sponsorship is sort of selling out," she added. "But I would rather commercialize art a little than close down altogether."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "We have to come to a completely new way of financing culture," said Miklos Marschall, Deputy Mayor for Culture in Budapest, "and we have to do this in a situation in which there is no wealthy citizenry" (pg. 11); "We would be supporting the Hungarian Symphony even if it wasn't having financial problems," said Balint Nagy, the marketing manager in Budapest for I.B.M., the season sponsor for the orchestra.

And Bear In Mind
(Editor's choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
CRAZY IN ALABAMA, by Mark Childress. (Putnam, $22.95.) Southern American humor yet again, but in a novel that pounds every convention of the genre into submission; not even the dead bodies interfere with the funniness.
"DADDY'S GONE TO WAR": The Second World War in the Lives of America's Children, by William M. Tuttle Jr. (Oxford University, $30.) A historian finds that some "home front children" still feel indoctrinated in fright and hate, while others believe the war enhanced their understanding of this country and its culture.
EPSTEIN: Artist Against the Establishment, by Stephen Gardiner. (Viking, $35.) This polemical book defends at every point a major artist who all his life defied bourgeois conformity yet managed to die the proprietor of a knighthood.
FOXFIRE: Confessions of a Girl Gang, by Joyce Carol Oates. (William Abrahams/Dutton, $21.) A dark and troubled epic of women who revenge themselves on men, set in the slow-witted 1950's, before female bonding had been discovered.
THE KOMMANDANT'S MISTRESS, by Sherri Szeman. (HarperCollins, $17.50.) A powerful novel, forged from refractory materials: the personal narratives of a death camp commander and the Jewish woman he chose as his mistress.
LET THE SEA MAKE A NOISE . . .: A History of the North Pacific From Magellan to MacArthur, by Walter A. McDougall. (Basic Books, $30.) Lively narrative, bold analysis and prodigious research adorn this popular history of a vast sea surrounded by mutually mistrustful peoples.
SADE: A Biography, by Maurice Lever. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.) A life of the French aristocrat and novelist (1740-1814) so wicked they renamed wickedness in his honor, so to speak.
SECOND SIGHT, by Robert V. Hine. (University of California, $20.) A splendid, highly literate personal account by the fortunate recipient of a miracle, a distinguished historian who slowly lost his eyesight and suddenly got it back.
SIGNS OF DEVOTION: Stories, by Maxine Chernoff. (Simon & Schuster, $19.) Smart, antic short stories in which people understand new experiences by recalling old ones, and the trivial is examined until its importance transpires.
STRIP TEASE, by Carl Hiaasen. (Knopf, $21.) The author, a reporter for The Miami Herald, delights to foul his front yard in hilarious fiction. What a horrible place! One nice woman in the book only makes things worse, the poor thing.
THEIRS WAS THE KINGDOM: Lila and DeWitt Wallace and the Story of the Reader's Digest, by John Heidenry. (Norton, $29.95.) A hugely detailed, engagingly written history of a single bright idea and the preacher's kids who ran that idea into a multibillion-dollar global enterprise.
THE WRESTLER'S CRUEL STUDY, by Stephen Dobyns. (Norton, $22.95.) Probability has no place in this entertaining post-modern novel, governed by the presence of a wrestler's manager who talks and thinks like Nietzsche.

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio

 BODY:
The company's in trouble, the power brokers are ruthless, the players are greedy, and the investors are nervous. But hold on, here -- it's a Broadway show, not a brokerage house, that Annette Meyers is clobbering in MURDER: THE MUSICAL (Perfect Crime/Doubleday, $18.50), the juiciest of her five witty mysteries featuring Leslie Wetzon, the ethical half of Smith & Wetzon, a Wall Street headhunting firm.
Wetzon's friendship with a Broadway choreographer takes her uptown to the Imperial Theater for the gypsy run-through of "Hotshot: The Musical," a ritual rehearsal for industry insiders that we never get to see because the production stage manager is found murdered in the mezzanine. For her friend's sake, Wetzon sticks with the show during its tempest-tossed tryout in Boston, where two more murders inspire extravagant displays of artistic temperament from members of the high-strung company. 
 The show's producer-director, a flamboyant artiste described with affectionate malice as "selfish, manipulative, egomaniacal and not a little crazy" (not to mention "sadistic" and "notoriously ambivalent about women"), would easily win any Tony Award given for offstage tantrums. Ms. Meyers, who once worked for the director Harold Prince, provides plenty of dish to keep readers who are either in the know or out of the loop laughing up their sleeves.
In FOURSOME (Pocket Books, $20), the eighth detective story in a terrific series about a Boston private eye named John Cuddy, Jeremiah Healy uses a gruesome murder case to examine the territorial antagonisms of people who think they get along just fine with neighbors who have different beliefs. Called to Maine to help in the defense of a young executive who is accused of using a crossbow to kill his wife and the couple who were their best friends, Cuddy learns that everyone on the tranquil lake where his client kept a summer home loathed the foursome for exercising their yuppie values so conspicuously in this unspoiled place. The detective encounters more naked animosity in the Boston suburb where the two couples lived side by side, and at the defense plant on Route 128 where his client was working on a big weapons deal.
Mr. Healy's prose grows increasingly eloquent with each trip that Cuddy takes into the Maine woods, which are teeming with loons and eagles and herons and hawks, along with some taciturn natives who treat these creatures with more respect than they pay weekenders from Boston. Entranced by it all, Cuddy finds out the hard way that "nature for all her glory can be a damned dangerous thing."
Christmas in Yorkshire is a natural for Peter Robinson's polished descriptive style: the log fire in the hearth, the tree lights in the window, the Vivaldi cantata on the turntable, the body on the couch. "It was a shame," Chief Inspector Alan Banks thinks in PAST REASON HATED (Scribners, $20), "that such a glorious and transcendent piece of music should be associated with such a bloody deed."
Mr. Robinson's erudite detective tends to notice incongruities like a piece of music that is out of context or a bit of behavior that is out of character. Banks is methodical -- let's call it slow -- about finding out who killed Caroline Hartley, a pretty, vivacious young woman who was well liked by just about everyone in the market town of Eastvale, except her lesbian lover's former husband. But by collecting his thoughts on the odd, intriguing details of the case, Banks comes up with keen psychological insights into the dead woman and the secrets in her past.
The author's characterizations are unfailingly sharp and subtle. But even when he just seems to be taking us for a leisurely ride around Yorkshire, where Christmas carolers sing in the square and a winter sea batters the shore, Mr. Robinson is always looking for the little signs of evil that can give away a town like Eastvale.
Puzzle fiends who enjoy banging their heads against a good riddle should enjoy MURDER IN MINIATURE: The Short Stories of Leo Bruce (Academy Chicago, $20). Most of these 28 classic teasers, compiled by B. A. Pike, were written by Bruce (the pseudonym of Rupert Croft-Cooke, who died in 1979) in the 1950's for a London evening newspaper, which is probably why you can measure their reading time in quick subway stops.
As cunning as they are economical, these brisk little narratives illustrate clever ways to shed a spouse and ingenious methods for the premature collection of an inheritance. But the tales are as comforting in tone as they are disquieting in subject matter. "Women don't get murdered for their handbags in England," declares Sergeant Grebe, a village copper who acts with intelligence on his lamentably outmoded convictions. "I don't think that even now this country has reached a point where women can be murdered for the sake of a few pounds."
Although the plot's the thing in this collection, some stories are enhanced by the flat-footed appeal and common-sensical methods of a detective named Sergeant Beef. With his disdain for "your ritzy types with titles and private incomes," this "ordinary sort of chap" was the author's droll comment on the snob-sleuths of contemporaries like Christie and Sayers. Bully for Beef.
Funnier and sadder than a dancing bear, Paco Ignacio Taibo 2d's NO HAPPY ENDING (Mysterious Press/Warner, $17.95) makes merry reading, in William I. Neuman's snappy translation, until you get its political message and feel the existential pain of its hero. Hector Belascoaran Shayne, the private eye who calls himself an "independent detective" working for "strange and revolutionary reasons" in this remarkable series, suspects a macabre practical joke when he discovers a corpse, dressed in the costume of a Roman centurion, in the bathroom of his Mexico City office. After a second corpse turns up, Shayne traces the dead men to their onetime employer, an escape artist named Zorak who was killed while performing one of his daredevil stunts.
Shayne is intrigued and a bit charmed by the "uniquely Mexican" nature of Zorak's celebrity, "a glory bordering on the ridiculous: ephemeral, commercialized, prostituted." But Shayne sinks a little deeper into his customary state of melancholia once he connects Zorak to the Halcones, a para military arm of the Government long associated with violent repression and secretly growing in strength. "His only chance for survival," Shayne has always known, "was to accept the chaos and quietly become one with it." But this time his credo is not enough to keep this good man from plunging into total despair, and Mr. Taibo leaves us with the awful feeling that his hero and his country, like Zorak, may have fallen all the way to hell.

HEADLINE: Fishing With Presidents

BYLINE: By Howell Raines; Howell Raines is the editorial page editor of The New York Times. This article is adapted from his book "Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis," to be published this month by William Morrow.

 BODY:
George Bush invited me to go fishing.
It happened because I saw a report on CNN that showed him fly-fishing from a boat on a stream near Kennebunkport. It seems there are a few sea-run browns in the headwaters of one of the coastal streams there. I thought Bush threw a pretty good line, so in the middle of 1991, I wrote him and requested an interview about fly-fishing. The recession was just taking hold. I was curious, among other things, to see if Bush was going to develop a Hoover problem, casting happily while the economy and his political support went to hell. 
 I got back a very nice letter, dated Aug. 8, 1991.
"Dear Howell:
"I am flattered that you would like to have my experiences on fly-fishing -- flattered because I am not a good fly-fisherman at all. I like the sport, but I have only done it a couple of times: once with Jim Baker in Wyoming, and once with Alan Simpson, also in Wyoming. I've got some outstanding reels and fly rods, but what I lack is fly-fishing experience."
He went on to describe his fondness for catching bluefish off the Maine coast: "We take them on bait-casting reels and light rods and 12-pound test line." Bush said he would be happy to be interviewed about his "enthusiasm for fishing generally," but I should not take that film clip as evidence of expertise in my favorite branch of the sport. "The point of all this is that I would not be a good subject for even half a chapter for any book if the topic is fly-fishing."
The letter impressed me in one way and gave me pause in another. I admired the President's candor about his fly-fishing experience, his preference for light tackle and the general modesty of his tone. But I was taken aback by the news that Alan Simpson, the Republican Senator from Wyoming, was a fly-fisherman. So much for the ennobling influence of the sport. During Bush's term, Simpson established himself as the meanest man in the Senate. True, his hatefulness had a kind of Dickensian grandeur. But there was no way you could follow his rantings about women, the environment and civil rights and still believe that fly-fishing in the mighty temple of the Rockies is guaranteed to purify the soul.
SPEAKING OF SOULS, HERBERT HOOVER WROTE A book entitled "Fishing for Fun -- and to Wash Your Soul." He was a surprisingly spiritual man, but like Bush, he had a politically fatal attachment to the idea of the Presidency as a passive stewardship. I think history will remember both as well-meaning men who did not understand that the President must be an active guardian of the people's welfare, more attuned in hard times to the suffering of the poor than to guarding the economic pieties by which the wealth of their class is preserved. Neither seemed to grasp the lesson of Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency. The stability of American society depends less on defending the rich against imaginary threats than on providing a decent standard of living for the unfortunate. If Bush had been as worried about the fact that he could see homeless people in Lafayette Park from his bedroom window as he was about lowering the capital-gains tax, he would still be President. Similarly, if Hoover had been as concerned about hunger in Alabama as he was about the depth of trout pools on the Rapidan, he might have won a second term.
The fact is, the Rapidan is a river that can make people greedy. To see it is to want to possess it. So it was with Hoover when he first came in 1929 to the deep hollow between Fork Mountain and Double Top Mountain on the eastern flank of the Blue Ridge. This is where the Rapidan plunges through a hemlock forest and through gray boulders that jut from the ferny earth like the aboriginal bones of old Virginia.
In no time, a crew of 500 marines was splitting the silence with bulldozers and hammers. Camp Hoover became a layout of a dozen cabins, barracks for 250 men and riding stables. Hoover liked to think big. The marines carted in 51 tons of boulders for a single fireplace in the President's lodge. By 1930, plans were under way for a 100,000-trout hatchery on the river bank.
A few Democrats grumbled about this use of tax money to create a private, 164-acre playground, but Hoover assured them that he had done his part. He had paid $5 an acre for the land and chipped in $15,000 worth of lumber for the Marine carpenters. As for the road building, the White House explained that this was a training exercise that the President had generously allowed to take place on his land.
Hoover delighted in making members of his Cabinet and distinguished visitors like Charles Lindbergh join him in building rock dams in the stream. Their labor did result in better holding water for trout in a few pools. So far as I know, this was the only undertaking of the Hoover Administration that actually improved conditions in a Southern state. Except for his fishing camp, Hoover opposed, as a matter of principle, the spending of tax money on public-works projects in the South. His firmness in this regard allowed the region to enjoy an especially intimate experience with the Depression, and no doubt many older Southerners can identify with the sentiments expressed by my then-82-year-old father when I described Hoover's idylls along the Rapidan. "Yeah, we heard back then that Hoover liked to fish," he said. "We were hoping he would fall in and drown."
Hoover's book came out in 1963, near the end of his long, grumpy retirement. He died in 1964 at 90. The preface captures the tone of Hoover's last three decades. He had put together this slim collection of his speeches and magazine articles on fishing, Hoover said, because an editor suggested its publication would be a relief from "the daily grind of trying to find out why the Communists get that way."
It is a curious book, revealing Hoover to be both a fly-fishing elitist and a meat fisherman so dedicated that he made fish killing a political virtue. Americans believe "they have a divine right to unlimited fish," he said. "They have inherited this notion from 10,000 generations of free fishermen."
In an essay entitled "The Class Distinction Among Fishermen," Hoover put dry-fly fishermen at the top of his pecking order, followed by wet-fly casters, spin casters and, on the lowest rung, users of live bait. In what sounded like a personal confession, Hoover added that "toward the end of the day, when there are no strikes, each social level collapses in turn down the scale until it gets some fish for supper." In other words, fishing, in the final analysis, is about food.
Despite this retrograde tendency, Hoover made it clear in "Fishing Presidents and Candidates" that he was a snob about fly-fishing. He reported -- "with a slight egotism!" -- that only he, Teddy Roosevelt and Grover Cleveland "had been lifelong fly-fishermen before they went to the White House." A mixed lot of chief executives who leaned heavily to Democrats like Wilson and F. D. R. went after the "common fishes," he sniffed. With a surprising lack of feeling, Hoover needled his predecessor and fellow Republican, Calvin Coolidge, for failing to progress from worms to dry flies in his trout fishing.
The best part of Hoover's book is a few paragraphs in which he elaborated on his well-known remark, "Presidents have only two moments of personal seclusion. One is prayer; the other is fishing -- and they cannot pray all the time!"
In the book, he began by ruminating on the appeal of fishing for Presidents. Most are first drawn to it, he said, because of the "political potency of fish" as a signal that a candidate has the common touch. Once they are in the White House, something else sets in.
"That Presidents have taken to fishing in an astonishing fashion seems to me worthy of investigation," he wrote. "I think I have discovered the reason: it is the silent sport. One of the few opportunities given a President for the refreshment of his soul and the clarification of his thoughts by solitude lies through fishing. As I have said in another place, it is generally realized and accepted that prayer is the most personal of all human relationships. Everyone knows that on such occasions men and women are entitled to be alone and undisturbed.
"Next to prayer, fishing is the most personal relationship of man; and of more importance, everyone concedes that the fish will not bite in the presence of the public, including newspapermen.
"Fishing seems to be one of the few avenues left to Presidents through which they may escape to their own thoughts, may live in their own imaginings, find relief from the pneumatic hammer of constant personal contacts, and refreshment of mind in rippling waters. Moreover, it is a constant reminder of the democracy of life, of humility and of human frailty. It is desirable that the President of the United States should be periodically reminded of this fundamental fact -- that the forces of nature discriminate for no man."
HOOVER predicted the attractions of privacy and discipline that would draw Jimmy Carter to fly-fishing. But he was not so prescient when it came to George Bush. Here was a President who hated solitude, got itchy on any Saturday when his schedule allowed a quiet day in the family quarters with Mrs. Bush, and generally preferred gregarious pastimes to solitary sports.
Before considering Bush and Carter in detail, I should note that the sports and recreations of a President sometimes crystallize in the public mind as a controlling metaphor for his regime. There was Ike the genial golfer and casual fly-fisherman. With Carter, the attack of the killer rabbit on his fishing skiff in Georgia and his collapse while jogging created an image of haplessness that hardened into a governing electoral reality when the helicopters that were supposed to rescue the hostages in Teheran crashed in the desert. In the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton's decision to play golf at a segregated golf course in Little Rock fed into public doubts that he was a Democrat who espoused one set of values and practiced another. Could a few more sporting gaffes Carterize -- or Bush-whack -- the Clinton Presidency? Recent history suggests that Clinton might use a fishing trip now and then to take the curse off all that time on the golf course.
In his successful 1988 campaign, Bush demonstrated the lasting efficacy of Hoover's wisdom about the "political potency" of the fish as a symbol of the common touch. He cannily presented himself as a bass fisherman, a fan of country music and a muncher of pork rinds. But once in office, he reverted to his true enjoyments. My guess is that his decision to deliver comments from a golf cart as he dispatched American troops to the Persian Gulf helped produce the image of elitist detachment that crippled him in 1992. Similarly, Bush did not grasp that it was unseemly for a petroleum millionaire to be ripping along in his gas-guzzling cigarette boat when he was waging what many Americans suspected was a war for oil.
Bush detests any kind of psychological analysis of his motives, tastes or behavior. He calls it "being put on the couch." He once complained to Marlin Fitzwater, his press secretary, that Maureen Dowd of The Times was studying his golf game too closely. "I saw her giving me the Gail Sheehy treatment," he wrote in a memo to Fitzwater. "Indeed, she was trying to figure out what makes this crazy guy tick." It is not surprising, then, to read what Newsweek found in its post-election report on the 1992 race: "When campaign honchos Bob Teeter and Fred Malek told Bush more than a year ago that he should quit playing golf and riding in his speedboat because it furthered the image that he was out of touch with voters, Bush paid little attention."
Apparently, hubris and overconfidence are viruses that breed in the ventilation system of the Oval Office like some exclusive form of Legionnaires' disease. Even Carter, a religious man whose faith called for self-abnegation, sometimes slid over into self-congratulation. Yet in the course of his Presidency, he moved from amateur to expert status in fly-casting for trout and in fly-tying. In 1991, the museum of the Jimmy Carter Library in Atlanta mounted an exhibit called "The Tie That Binds." The displays included Carter's fly-tying desk. It was clearly the workplace of a craftsman. Plenty of people would argue that fly-tying is the ideal hobby for a micromanager and that, if the Hoover Presidency failed while he flailed the waters of the Rapidan, Carter lost the 1980 election by spending too much time at such a desk on the second floor of the White House.
Carter, of course, was a more sensitive President than the architect of the Depression, even if he did bring us Depression-level interest and inflation rates. Anyone who puts his book "An Outdoor Journal" alongside Hoover's can also see that he understands the mechanics and psychology of fly-fishing on a much deeper level.
"It levels people out," Carter said when I visited the exhibit at the library. "The trout don't give a darn if you're President of the United States or a local farmer or a high-school kid. It's a disciplinary thing, too," he added, noting the constant pressure to learn "a little more about how currents behaved, what kind of trout will take a certain kind of fly at a certain time of year or what the temperature of the water does or how a cloudy day affects it or how I can approach a pool without my shadow or silhouette being outlined against the sky. If you read a whole book on it and only come up with one suggestion, it adds to your repertoire and so you become increasingly effective. But then you realize that nobody can ever master the sport. Even Lee Wulff hasn't mastered the sport. He's still learning, he tells me."
Carter made this comment shortly before Wulff, a legendary fisherman who lived in upstate New York, died in a plane crash in 1991. He had used the Presidency the way any smart fly-fisherman would -- to get expert coaching. He fished with Wulff and George Harvey, who taught a well-known fly-fishing course at Penn State, and Dave Whitlock, a consummate fly-tier and fisherman who was hired by L. L. Bean to direct its effort to cut into Orvis's business. In 1980, Carter asked a number of experts, including Ben Schley and Ed Shenk, to Camp David for a fly-fishing clinic. He also invited Vince Marinaro as the featured speaker, providing at least one occasion at which the crusty old dry-fly innovator from Pennsylvania could feel he was getting the recognition he deserved.
I had first met Carter in 1973, when he was the Governor of Georgia and I was assigned to cover him for The Atlanta Constitution. Our fishing careers had many parallels. Both of us fly-fished for bluegills and bass in our youth and then became devotees of the sport upon moving to Washington. Big Hunting Creek near Camp David was a school for both of us, although Carter told me that as President he visited Camp Hoover and the Rapidan only once.
The arc of his career can be detected in artifacts in the Carter Library. They have there a picture of Carter splashing water with a boat paddle toward the infamous killer rabbit that tried to climb into his skiff when he was fishing on a farm pond near Plains midway through his Presidency. The photograph shows a spinning rod in the boat with a bobber attached to the line. The President as bait fisherman. The library has this photograph in its files, but it is not on display.
What is on display is a frame of varnished wood that is used as a drying reel for fly lines. Carter built it in his workshop on the day after he lost the 1980 election. The object bespeaks the therapeutic values Carter found in fly-fishing after a crushing defeat and his desire for top-to-bottom mastery of the sport that reshaped his attitude toward fishing.
"It's hard to talk without derogating other kinds of fishing, which I also enjoy," he said. "I really enjoy fishing with a plastic worm for bass in the warm-water areas in South Georgia and Florida. I don't want to derogate that, but at the same time, fly-fishing to me opened up just a new panorama of challenge. Because you had to learn the intricacies of streams, of currents, of water temperature, of different kinds of fly hatches, how to tie your own flies, which you wouldn't ordinarily do in other kinds of fishing, and then try to match whatever fly is hatching off and experiment. It's a matter of kind of stalking, a great element of patience, because the consummate fly-fishers really spend a lot of time observing a pool or a stream or current run before they ever put a fly in the water."
THIS BRINGS US BACK to my fishing trip with George Bush. It is hard to imagine Bush going into that kind of detail with his fishing. He is an active, rather than a contemplative, man. But let it also be said that while fishing brings out the testy side of some people, it was just the opposite with Bush. He was such a genial and considerate host that I found it hard to square that behavior with his lackadaisical performance and meanspirited policies. He was also, by every sign I know, a deeply snake-bit fisherman.
For one thing, by the time we got to the Washington Navy Yard and climbed into the bass boats that would take us down the Potomac toward Mount Vernon, the wind was really honking through the trees. It was early morning on a cold March Saturday, and out on the open water, the wind chill must have been in the teens or lower. Luckily, the guide in my boat, Bob Denyer, had a snowmobile suit in one of the storage compartments. Since the President was in the other boat, I did not have to worry about protecting the leader of the free world from frostbite. But there was not a word of complaint from Bush, even after our long run with the open boats banging unpleasantly across the chop and him with nothing but a light jacket for cover.
We fetched up in a cove that offered a bit of shelter from the wind. The boats were close enough for conversation among the three fishermen in each craft, and the President soon dispelled any idea I had that when the Chief Executive gets ready to go out, there is somebody from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to tell him how many layers of insulation he is going to need. Bush said he'd gotten up around 5 A.M. and asked his wife if he ought to wear his long underwear. She said no and rolled over and went back to sleep.
The wind kept building. The sun was weak. Bush's clothing looked inadequate, and the skin on his gloveless hands looked chapped and papery. I was now squarely up against a novel etiquette problem. If the President of the United States has been kind enough to invite you somewhere, it is difficult to say to him that this is not a very good day for it and you would really be just as happy going back to the White House and having a cup of tea. It is even more difficult to say what I really thought, which went something like this: "Sir, you are 68 years old, which is just old enough to be my father, if you happened to be an early breeder. I would not have my father out here in nasty weather with inadequate clothing."
Bush, for his part, seemed pretty content. He proved to be handy with both spinning and bait-casting tackle. To my surprise, the security forces did not get in our way or interfere with other fishing boats or with the joggers who passed along a trail on the shore. I caught the first fish, a small bass still pale from the long, dark winter. After an hour or so, Bush caught a fish. I think there was one other taken by the party, and after four or five hours, the President said we could go in.
It turned out that the Secret Service and their helpers from the District of Columbia police had run aground with the twin-screw police cruiser that was going to take us back upriver into the teeth of the wind. They got it unstuck, and I was happy to get out of the open boats and into the cabin. There were no seats, and Bush and I were standing side by side, chatting about the fishing. I could not help noticing a loud whomp-whomp-whomp sound when the pilot tried to open the throttles on his diesel engines.
"Sounds like you bent a shaft when you went aground," the President said. There was no reprimand in his voice. He had the matter-of-fact tone of an old Navy man who knows the sound of a bent shaft when he hears it. So we went back upriver at a fast idle.
I admit I lost my courage and did not ask Bush about the theories of Dr. Juice, a Minnesota physician who was interviewed in The Wall Street Journal in 1990. Dr. Juice, a.k.a. Gregory Bambenek, invented Dr. Juice Hand and Lure Cleaner. This product is intended to mask a fish-repelling amino acid called L-serine. It seems that Dr. Juice took a fingerprint from the President at a bass-tackle show that Bush visited in Springfield, Mo., during the 1988 campaign. The Journal's conclusion: "George Bush is a walking L-serine factory . . . his fingerprint on the bait will stink up the water with L-serine and send fish zooming in the other direction."
Maybe it was too cold on the Potomac for Bush's bass to smell the Presidential secretions. But that lone fish did little to dent the general air of pessimism that prevailed all day among Bush's attendants. They carried themselves like parents taking an insistent kid on what they know is a hopeless mission. Even so, I was surprised with the blunt consolation one of them offered to Bob Denyer when he said he regretted not having been able to put the President on to more fish on one of his rare days off.
"Oh, don't feel bad," a White House photographer told the guide. "The President never catches anything."
That day, he was lucky not to catch pneumonia. But he might have taken the weather and the bent shaft as an omen for the rest of 1992.

This Architect's Eyes Are Fixed Upon the Sea

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
When he was 10 years old, Der Scutt, the New York architect who designed Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, built model boats from orange crates at his family's home near Reading, Pa. While studying architecture in 1958, he began a decade-long project photographing every ocean liner that docked in New York Harbor.
"I rarely missed a ship," the 59-year-old Mr. Scutt said recently. 
 As passionate about vessels and collecting as he is, Mr. Scutt had never bought a model until four years ago. His first acquisition was a steel curiosity fitted with derricks and hoists that looked like an outsized tug designed to sleep 30. It was, in fact, a miniature of a craft built for use in oceanographic research by the United States Navy. The model cost $300 at a Manhattan flea market. A week later, Mr. Scutt returned to buy a hand-carved Norwegian trawler for $125.
Now his collection of 500 models, made between the 17th and 20th centuries, is one of the most comprehensive in the world -- especially when it comes to ocean liners. The smallest ships in his collection are six-inch cast-metal replicas of virtually every ocean liner and cruise ship ever built -- from the Titanic through the Queen Elizabeth II -- and the largest is a six-foot-long version of the pre-World War II German luxury liner Cap Polonio. They crowd his sprawling offices in a midtown Manhattan loft; the reception area looks like a flotilla of ships caught in a traffic jam. The conference room is choked with sailing vessels -- frigates, clippers, schooners, sloops and whalers. Flat-bottomed Dutch barges and sleek submarines cover the walls and desks in an office, and paddle steamers, freighters and yachts are displayed near drafting tables.
Mr. Scutt describes his collection -- which also includes books, posters, memorabilia and drawings -- as a private museum. And so far several hundred collectors and marine enthusiasts have filed through his office, while smaller groups have viewed the models of 150 or so sailing vessels displayed in his Upper East Side town house. Earlier this summer, many more people admired his models when they were on view at the Seamens Church Institute in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Scutt prides himself on the accuracy of the models he has commissioned from craftsmen from around the world. The 40 superliners and historic ships he has had built to an architect's scale of one-sixteenth of an inch to a foot are based mostly on the original shipbuilders' drawings. Emphasizing realism rather than romance, the focus is on the proportions and fittings. More often than not, the effect is visually riveting.
The prize of Mr. Scutt's collection is a model of the Normandie, one of the world's most beautiful ships. Built by Lebigre of Paris, the sleek five-and-a-half-foot black-hulled ship, topped by crisp white decks and red-and-black smokestacks, is the essence of French Art Deco elegance.
"That model was on the pier at Le Havre for the maiden voyage in 1935," Mr. Scutt said. "But its whereabouts later were unknown until last January, when the English owner advertised it in a trade magazine." By the time Mr. Scutt caught up with the model a month later, it had passed through the hands of two collectors and was in an antiques shop in Rouen -- at double the price.
At more than 1,000 feet long, 120 feet wide and 10 stories high, the Normandie was the world's largest ship in its day and was described as the Empire State Building lying on its back.
For Mr. Scutt, models of the Normandie and such other ocean liners as the Queen Elizabeth II, the France and the Nieuw Amsterdam are his favorites. But equally awesome to him are some replicas of sailing vessels, including a 20-year-old model of the Soleil Royal, designed in the late 17th century by Charles Le Brun, the court painter of Louis XIV. The broad-beamed model, with a seahorse figurehead on its prow, lives up to its reputation as one of the most impressive and powerful French warships then afloat.
Another handsomely detailed model, complete with fully stitched sails and a mahogany deck, is the 40-year-old Lilliputian copy of the Susquehanna. Admiral Matthew Perry commanded the original steam sloop on his 1854 trip to the Far East that ended Japan's isolation from the West.
While most of his ship models are historical replicas, Mr. Scutt was never interested in building copies. As a boy, he constructed yachts and motorboats of his own design, using slats from orange crates to shape the hulls after soaking them in water to make the boards pliable.
Two years ago the architect designed another ship -- this time a full-scale 70,000-ton ocean liner, larger than the United States but smaller than the Normandie -- to serve as a cruise ship. "The tonnage had to be limited so it could go through the Panama Canal," Mr. Scutt said. "Because of the world economy, this ship may or may not be built."
He is certain, though, that the tallest building he has ever designed, the recently announced 80-story Trump Tower Tokyo, will be built as planned in the near future.
And since his knowledge of ships has probably influenced all his architectural designs, especially compact interiors, Mr. Scutt expects that it will be put to use in the Japanese building, too. "On a ship, every square meter counts, so ingenuity is mandated throughout," he said. "Even though there's much more flexibility in buildings, there are times when site limitations and zoning pose some tight situations."
Surprisingly, Mr. Scutt owns no full-scale ships, not even a dinghy. "My boats are all out of the water," he said. "There's too much maintenance on yachts and sailboats. The most I want to have to do on any boat I own is a light dusting -- now and then."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Governments Take a Share

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY still has by far the highest taxes in the country on hotel rooms. When the New York State Legislature adjourned on July 8, the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau was vexed that the legislators had failed to repeal a 1990 state tax of 5 percent on hotel rooms costing $100 or more. The tax -- which is collected as part of general state revenues -- means that a visitor to New York City who rents a room costing $100 will pay $121.25 for the night: 8.25 percent state and city sales tax, 6 percent city occupancy tax, plus the 5 percent state tax, plus a $2 city tax for rooms over $40.
Visitors to New York have the biggest burden, but a multitude of other cities in the United States put a double-digit bite on overnight visitors, who come to enjoy and spend money, but are not there to vote or picket council members who decide to tax transients. The lawmakers' motives are not always so bald as in Denver, where the 12 percent bite on a hotel room comprises an 8 percent sales tax and a 4 percent levy called a "travelers' tax," but even elsewhere no one is deceived. 
 Of course, travelers pay more than room taxes. Airlines collect a 10 percent Federal airline ticket tax, an international departure tax of $6, a $3 "passenger facility charge" for arriving at or leaving 131 United States airports, a $5 fee for passing Immigration on return to the United States, a $5 fee for passing Customs and a $1.45 fee for Agriculture Department inspections. There are also restaurant meal taxes and taxes on car rentals.
 
More Charges Pending
 The Clinton budget does not give travelers any reason to rejoice either. Gasoline taxes affect Americans' principal mode of vacationing; Congress has been asked to raise the Immigration fee to $6 from $5, and to apply it to cruise passengers as well as air passengers. The Justice Department is also considering an Immigration and Naturalization Service charge of $1 or $2 a person for people driving into the United States from Mexico or Canada.
The Federal bite on airline tickets is no surprise; it's there when you buy, and most tickets now even have pink slips in them to insure you know the airlines and travel agents are not collecting all the dollars. Getting hit for a $3 passenger facility charge for a trip to or through a particular United States airport, or for a maximum of four of them on a round trip, will depend on how your trip is routed. But probably not for long; soon all airports are likely to have such a charge. What airport manager is going to pass up the chance to repair runways and build parking lots without a bond issue? Imposition of these charges, incidentally, was authorized by Congress in 1990 when it dropped its objections to airport head taxes, long common overseas; the Federal Aviation Administration approves individual airports' applications, so no local vote is involved.
Departure taxes from foreign airports may be a surprise, although travel agents may tell you in advance to save local currency to pay this tax when you leave. The tax may not be trivial: Bermuda levies a $15 charge per departing passenger, for example. Charges of $6 to $10 are more common. The 13-nation Caribbean Community is proposing a change in seaport head taxes for cruise passengers, to a minimum of $6 to $10; the range now is zero to $10. If these plans go through, the impact on a cruise itinerary was estimated by one shipline executive at $30 to $40. Unlike the foreign airport departure tax, this will be incorporated into the price of a cruise ticket and passengers will not be nickel-and-dimed to death along the way. Jamaica plans to raise its cruise head tax to $15 from $10 by 1997; the Jamaica airport departure tax is $8.
 
Hotels and Car Rentals
 The surprises thus lurk mostly in hotel and rental car taxes. The adjoining chart shows only some of the cities where state, city and even county taxes on hotel rooms add up to more than 10 percent. Car rental surcharges began with Florida, in 1989, where the charge was initially 50 cents a day; it is now $2 a day. Other legislatures saw the opportunity. Jan M. Armstrong, executive vice president of the American Car Rental Association, who tracks these taxes and surcharges, puts the count at 12, besides Florida, but acknowledges that others may have slipped through.
In Arizona, Maricopa County (Phoenix) has a $1.50-a-transaction surcharge above regular excise taxes, and Pima County (Tucson) adds $2.50 a transaction. In California, Lake Tahoe charges $4 a day. Connecticut charges $1 a day; Hawaii, $2 a day; Iowa, 4 percent; Minnesota, $7.50 a transaction, and New Mexico, $4 a day. In Ohio, Cleveland charges $4 a day. In Nebraska, Omaha charges $2 a transaction. Pennsylvania charges $2 a day.
An organization called the Travel and Tourism Government Affairs Council, sponsored by 33 tourism groups, notably the Travel Industry Association in Washington, D.C., has taken arms against the advancing sea of taxes, arguing that taxing the traveler will kill the goose. One survey used in this campaign said that New York State, because of a chill on tourism brought on by the occupancy tax, lost $962 million in taxes on visitor spending in 1992 in order to collect $463.2 million in the 5 percent room tax. The survey, conducted by the American Economics Group of Washington, D.C., was commissioned by the Hotel Association of New York City and the New York State Hospitality Association.
Aubrey C. King, the organization's executive director, said he saw some hope, despite the Legislature's failure to repeal the state hotel tax in New York. "Look at the good guys," he said. "Prince Georges County, Md., has had a 15 percent hotel tax, the highest in the Washington area. They voted in May to reduce that by July 1, 1995, to 10 percent."
"We are heartened by that success," Mr. King said. He acknowledged, however, that it was the only jurisdiction he knew of that had rolled back a hotel tax.

Condo Committees
 
Question: My condominium is run by a board of managers, which is assisted by committees that make recommendations to it. What entitles one to join a committee? . . . Marvin Kommel, Manhattan
 
Answer: According to Eric Davis, a Manhattan lawyer, as long as the board is acting with a legitimate corporate purpose and not in bad faith, it has almost unquestioned authority in selecting committee membership. "A condo board has expanded powers with regard to governing and running its operation," he said. "Generally, a legal battle where an individual is seeking membership on a committee is unlikely to be successful. Further, when someone is denied membership, it is usually based on the fact that a committee is filled." 
 To join a committee, Mr. Davis suggested approaching a board member, asking for a list of committees and voluteering your services.
 
Exchanging Property
 
Question: I own a vacation home. I understand that if I trade the property I will not have to pay a fairly large amount in capital gains tax. So, instead, I would like to trade my home for a similar one in the Sun Belt. Is there a newsletter, brokerage firm or some other vehicle to assist me in finding an appropriate "barter" property? . . . Arlene Suchotliff, Bridgewater, Conn.
 
Answer: To find out if your situation qualifies for as a "like-kind exchange" and a capital gains tax-deferment under Section 1031 of the Federal Tax code, send a self-addressed stamp envelope to the International Reciprocal Trade Association, 1913 Beach Mill Road, Great Falls, Va., 22066. Or place an ad in Barter News at P.O. Box 3024, Mission Viejo, Va., 92690. Or contact the Metropolitan Area Real Estate Exchange Network in Bedford, N.Y., at 914-241-1290. Also review I.R.S. Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispossessions of Assets, to make sure that your swap meets I.R.S. regulations. Call (800) 829-3676 for a copy of the publication.
 
Refinancing a Mortgage
 
Question: I bought a home, which I now rent out, in Sante Fe, N.M., last October, obtaining a 7.5 percent, 30-year-fixed rate mortgage on $112,000, and I paid two points up front as well as $50,000 down. I am paying $816 a month on the mortgage, plus an additional $100 a month toward the principal. Would it make financial sense to refinance now that rates have dipped below 7 percent, considering closing costs and such? What about variable rates?
Also, my mortgage is an impound account. I would prefer to pay my property taxes and home insurance directly. Can I change the existing mortgage to do so or ensure that a new mortgage would not be an impound account? . . . Kay Lockridge, Manhattan
 
Answer: "Don't touch it," said Patrick B. Niland, managing partner of First Funding, a mortgage brokerage company in Rochester. He said you could possibly do better by refinancing to another fixed-rate mortgage -- but only slightly better. Whether you want an adjustable depends on how long you intend to own the home, he added. If you keep the home for three years or less, an adjustable-rate loan at 5 percent or less with two points paid up front might save you some money.
"It is unlikely that interest rates will stay this low, so the blended rate over time will probably be higher than 7.5 percent particularly factoring in points and costs," he said. He warned, though, that again the saving with either type of loan might be so small that you should consider whether the time spent on the paperwork makes it worthwhile. "Why go through the aggravation," he said. "On an after-tax basis, the savings will be minimal."
As for impound accounts, Mr. Niland said they were more commonly known as escrow accounts. Generally, he said, secondary mortgage buyers require borrowers to pay taxes and insurance with their mortgage payments. There are some lenders, though, who do not have this requirement, and a mortgage broker can help you find one. "They are atypical," Mr. Niland said.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Tour Company Closes Its Doors

BYLINE: By Betsy Wade

 BODY:
Asti Tours, a New York wholesale operator specializing in tours to Mexico, has shut its doors after 38 years. Paul Kleepsies, the president, said that over the last two years, the recession, heavy competition in the Mexican tour business and consumer eagerness for discounts squeezed profit margins too tight to support the company. It stopped taking reservations Aug. 9.
Another specialist in Mexico tours, American Leisure of Houston, went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and closed in May. 
 Travel agents were notified that all Asti tours booked for August were to be fulfilled by Apple Vacations in Newtown Square, Pa. Refunds were sent for tours booked after that, and Mr. Kleepsies, who had been president for nine years, said late in August that all but two or three of the refund checks had been cashed.
Asti provided tours for 40,000 people in 1992.
The company's New York office is closed; mail inquiries may be sent to Post Office Box 274, Cranford, N.J. 07016.

HEADLINE: Hands-On Summer in a Science Lab

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER

 BODY:
SCIENCE has always been Enelyn Solivan's favorite school subject and this summer the 17-year-old New Haven high-school student put it to work.
Ms. Solivan was a summer research assistant at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, where she worked with scientists conducting genetic-engineering experiments in plants. She was one of four minority students from New Haven hired for the summer by the station, which does agricultural and environmental research and tests food, consumer products and other materials. 
 The students said they had gained experience they would not have acquired working in stores or fast-food restaurants. William Matthews learned laboratory skills while testing serum samples for the presence of antibodies against the Lyme disease organism. He also helped scientists seeking an alternative to insecticides for controlling gypsy moth caterpillars. The exacting procedure demanded precision and tested his skill in math.
"In college, I get the book work," Mr. Matthews said before returning to The University of Findlay in Ohio. "Here I get the hands-on experience. I can put that on my resume."
The station's practice of hiring summer research assistants goes back at least to the turn of the century, said John F. Anderson, the station's director. A total of 29 high-school and college students were hired this year.
Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, vice director of the station, said that although it had been difficult to find minority candidates interested in the work, the station had established contacts at high schools, colleges and social agencies, and the number of minority students hired had grown from one three years ago to four this year.
 
Enthusiasm Is a Factor
 While academic success is important in choosing a candidate, other qualities like motivation are essential, said Dr. Magnarelli, who has been interviewing applicants since 1987. "You must look at other things," he said. "Their enthusiasm and commitment in some situations overrides an academic problem."
Ingrid Johnson's eyes sparkled as she talked about her success on the job. An assistant in the analytical chemistry department, she analyzed the lead content in paint chips sent to the station by the New Haven Department of Health. The paint chips are taken from housing complexes, child-care centers and apartments in New Haven, Ms. Johnson said. The lead in the paint is dangerous to young children.
Ms. Johnson's supervisor, Dr. Mary Jane Incorvia Mattina, praised her work, saying, "I feel very confident about what she has done."
Ms. Johnson also worked with Dr. Mattina on a project involving taxol, an anticancer compound produced by the bark and needles of certain kinds of yew trees and shrubs. The purpose of her research, Dr. Mattina said, is to determine how cultivation practices affect taxol production in the plants. Ms. Johnson helped her by preparing the plant material for analysis.
The work in analytical chemistry has brought Ms. Johnson one step closer to her goal of studying medicine and becoming a physician's assistant in pediatrics, she said. "Some people don't get apprenticeships until later in college," she said. "I have one before college, so I have a jump on things. I am very happy."
 
A Meaningful Job
 Ms. Johnson and Ms. Solivan were paid $5.25 an hour under a United States Department of Agriculture program that awards summer jobs to minority high school students. Mr. Matthews was hired through the Private Industry Council in New Haven, which administers summer job programs for young people from low-income families, and was paid $4.27 an hour.
The chance to do meaningful work seemed more important than higher pay to the students, who said they enjoyed the hands-on experience and individual attention they received from their supervisors. "I'm doing things I wouldn't be able to do in any other setting," said Ms. Johnson, a student at the Cooperative High School in New Haven. "I can go as far as I want to go."
Being treated as a professional has helped her grow into adulthood, she said. "It's helping me break away from home, where I feel like a 17-year-old. I'm not a pupil here. I'm treated like an adult."
Ms. Solivan, who came to Connecticut from Puerto Rico four years ago and who is a student at Wilbur Cross High School, said her experience this summer had reinforced her desire for a career in biochemistry. The scientists she worked with are manipulating plant cells to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis. The result they are striving for is higher crop yields, said Dr. Israel Zelitch, director of the biochemistry and genetics laboratory. Ms. Solivan is an unusual student, Dr. Zelitch said. "I never had a person who learned so quickly and is so mature for her age."
The staff at the station has been an inspiration to her, Ms. Solivan said. "I am around people who went to college and want to make something of their lives," she said. "Four of my friends are married, pregnant or on drugs."
 
Parents Made the Difference
 Dr. Magnarelli said he would assign Mr. Matthews to a different project when he returns next year so he will be able to learn new skills. Dr. Magnarelli added that he tried to take the students' interests into consideration when placing them. "That way, their interest is high when they come on the job, and that translates into better performance."
Most of Mr. Matthews's friends did not work this summer, and when asked what made him different he replied: "My mother and father. They wouldn't put up with my hanging out on the streets at night. They always motivated me to go to school, get a master's degree and get a decent job. That's what got me through high school and my first year of college. They're very proud of me."
Many teen-agers did take summer jobs, although with low pay and little chance to learn substantial skills, according to Frank Milone, training manager for the Private Industry Council. The council received 2,800 job applications and only 1,890 were filled.
 
Fast Food and Retail
 Most of the openings were in fastfood restaurants and retail stores, which paid about $5 an hour. The higher-paying opportunities of previous years in banks and lawyers' offices were eliminated by the economic recession. Furthermore, cuts in Federal financing limited the number of jobs the council was able to offer, Mr. Milone said.
Dr. Magnarelli noted that some summer research assistants returned to full-time jobs at the station after graduation from college, and he added that he would like to see more students offered challenging summer jobs.
"The seed is planted, and the plant is coming up," he said. "If it were at all possible it would be better for everyone if it could grow a bit."
But even in hard economic times, there is opportunity, Mr. Matthews said.
His philosophy about success is simple: "There is a lot of opportunity out there, but people won't hand it to you on a silver platter. You have to go out and get it. You have to show people you can do it."

HEADLINE: As Schools Open, Many Ask if the State Knows How to Add

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
AS the 1993-94 school year opens this week, the focus is once again not on the classroom but on the more fundamental question of how much New Jersey should pay for public education.
To be sure, there will be a few differences in schools: 
 *The high school graduation test has been moved from a ninth-grade measure of basic skills to an 11th-grade level.
*Students will now face state-required assessments of their skills in science, in addition to the assessments of skills in reading, writing and mathematics already required.
*State monitoring of schools will resume after a two-year pause, and parents will receive report cards on their children's schools, detailing the scores on standardized tests, hours spent on instruction, incidence of substance abuse and other data. In the past, such information had been reported only for districts, not individual schools.
But these changes are tame compared with the implications that another potential major overhaul of school financing would hold for schools and taxpayers. The current system, under the Quality Education Act, has been under attack from the moment it was introduced by Gov. Jim Florio in 1990.
The act was Mr. Florio's response to a State Supreme Court ruling that called for spending in poor school districts to be raised to the level of wealthier ones.
The law has already gone through several major revisions, the most significant of which was to reduce the increase in state aid intended for 30 urban districts, known as special-needs districts. This, in turn, led to another constitutional challenge and a ruling last week by a Superior Court judge, Paul Levy, that the act as applied cannot meet the Supreme Court mandate.
This year's version of the act, a compromise package supported by Mr. Florio and the Legislature, guarantees that no school district will receive less state aid than it did last year. The accord also created the Education Funding Review Commission, a bipartisan panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees and education representatives. Its mission is to present a new financing plan for consideration after the November gubernatorial and legislative elections.
The commission's report was scheduled for release after the election to prevent the highly charged subject of school financing from becoming even more politicized. Even so, the issue is expected to play a large role in the governor's race, since Mr. Florio's school financing plan fueled more than $1 billion of the record $2.8 billion tax increase three years ago that created so much fury.
While other states have been cutting support for education, New Jersey's state aid to education under Mr. Florio has grown to $4.85 billion for the 1993-94 school year from $3.65 billion in 1990-91. School spending now accounts for more than 31 percent of the state budget. New Jersey leads the nation in education spending per pupil, averaging $9,192 last school year. That compared with $5,216 per student nationally, according to the National Education Association's most recent data.
But Mr. Florio's efforts have won him little political mileage, even from education groups. The New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union, has decided to make no endorsement in the gubernatorial campaign, underscoring a lack of consensus among its members on Mr. Florio's performance.
Voters, in addition to their anger over the tax increase, are saying they cannot see any value for the extra money that has been funneled into education. State officials concede that they have done a poor job selling the accomplishments of the financing plan.
"Part of the problem is that we don't define specifically for our stakeholders what we're trying to accomplish," said Dr. Mary Lee Fitzgerald, New Jersey's Commissioner of Education.
 
New Monitoring System
 To that end, Dr. Fitzgerald said her top priority this school year would be to oversee a new system of state monitoring of schools that holds individual schools accountable for the money they receive. If they do not spend it prudently, they face the possibility of closer scrutiny by the state.
"For the first time, report cards are being issued for each of the state's 2,200 schools, with a lot of data that attempts to measure outcomes," Dr. Fitzgerald said. "There is an increasing realization that the only real unit that can accomplish school improvement is the school itself."
Dr. Fitzgerald said urban districts had made important strides in the two years since the financing plan had been put into effect. Among the accomplishments she cited were lower class sizes, more guidance counselors, more science equipment and new early-childhood development programs.
"We're doing a lot of things right," Dr. Fitzgerald said. "But I just don't think we have been adequately explaining what we are doing."
The Education Funding Review Commission has been listening to background presentations on public school financing since the spring, but so far it has not addressed the hard part of its assignment: coming up with an actual financing formula to replace the Quality Education Act.
Albert Burstein, chairman of the commission, said that achieving consensus among the teachers' union, the New Jersey School Boards Association and other interest groups would be difficult.
"You go right down the line, in special education, vocational education and other areas," Mr. Burstein said. "Every one of them, if you add them up, would probably cost close to $1 billion over and above what we have now, just on a bird's-eye view of the requests. It's simply not in the woods."
The commission's recommendations, which are due by Nov. 15 -- a deadline Mr. Burstein said may not be met -- will carry no legal weight.
But Mr. Burstein, a lawyer and a former legislator who headed the Assembly Education Committee, said he thought the commission could come up with a solution that legislators could live with. One of the biggest challenges, he said, would be devising a formula that meets the Supreme Court mandate to finance urban districts adequately without compromising education in the state's 330 middle-income districts.
"They make a strong argument that the more we funnel off to special-needs districts, the less is available for them, and that there will consequently be far more of an imposition on their local tax efforts than is now the case," he said.
Now, state aid is distributed first to urban districts and specific programs, like special education and student transportation. Middle-income districts then receive their allotment from whatever is left over from the general appropriation.
Dr. Kenneth Hall, Superintendent of the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District, said that within five years middle-income districts would be left with almost no support.
"We're literally creating more special-needs districts by manipulating money at the state level," said Dr. Hall, president of an association of 100 middle-income school districts that is seeking revisions to the school finance law legislatively and through the courts. "There are a whole lot of districts who were decimated and are in exactly the same position."
In the last five years, the portion of money in Matawan-Aberdeen's budget coming from state aid has declined to 20 percent from 40 percent. Even with an equalized property tax rate that is substantially higher than the state average, the district has had to cut advanced placement and foreign language courses, virtually eliminate vocational education, increase class sizes and move from a nine-period school day to eight periods to save on teachers.
Frustration over the current system is not limited to middle-income districts. Urban districts charge that spending disparities between rich and poor districts have actually increased since the current financing plan was introduced. Judge Levy, in his ruling, determined that it "does not assure that funding for regular education for the 30 special-needs districts will be substantially equal" to that of wealthier districts within five years, as required by the State Supreme Court.
"Progress in providing programs to ameliorate disadvantages of pupils in special-needs districts is unacceptably slow," he added, concluding that "further judicial intervention at the highest level is necessary." He indicated that it would take at least $450 million more in state aid to close the gap between poor and wealthy districts.
Further complicating the issue for the Governor and the Legislature, wealthy districts are saying the law threatens their educational programs. Dr. Mark Smith, Superintendent of Westfield schools and president of the Garden State Coalition of Schools, a group of mostly wealthy suburban districts, said his organization was seeking to insure that aid for specific programs like special education continue to be distributed outside the formula and that caps on local school budgets be made more flexible.
In addition, the coalition is concerned about a bill recently introduced by State Senator John H. Ewing, Republican of Bedminster, who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee, that extends the deadline for the Education Funding Review Commission report until May 15 and outlines another one-year compromise for school financing.
"The language in the bill seems to suggest that local schools may have to share, mostly in the form of reduced aid, some of the increases in teacher pension and Social Security costs," Dr. Smith said.
As Mr. Florio confronts criticism by school districts of all socio-economic levels that it does not provide enough support, and by taxpayers for raising taxes to record levels, Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican opponent, is contending that New Jersey schools need leadership, not money.
Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's chief spokesman, said the candidate "is critical of the view that, to improve education, all you have to do is pour ever-increasing amounts of money into the system."
"It hasn't worked in the past, and it isn't working now," Mr. Golden said.
In her position paper on education released in April, Mrs. Whitman outlined her own initiatives, some of which have already been accomplished. Among the changes she wants are a return to a five-year term for the commissioner of education, instead of having the commissioner serve at the pleasure of the governor, and requiring students to pass their classes before participating in athletics.
Some of Mrs. Whitman's ideas, like grants to finance innovative teaching techniques, are reminiscent of themes that Gov. Thomas H. Kean sounded during his administration. That's not surprising since several Whitman education advisers were part the Kean administration's Department of Education. Also, a former Commissioner of Education, Saul Cooperman, reviewed her position paper before its release.
Because her children attend private schools and she has never voted in a school election, Mrs. Whitman has been dogged by the perception that she has taken up the cause of public education rather belatedly. Mr. Golden insists that charge is unfair.
"In this state one does not run for governor without an interest in and support of public education," he said. "The largest single item in the budget is aid to public education."
Mr. Golden said Mrs. Whitman was supportive of Dr. Fitzgerald as Commissioner and would want to sit down with her after the election to discuss staying on. But Dr. Fitzgerald said she might not be interested in the job if Mrs. Whitman pursued a pilot voucher program she has proposed. The program would allow inner-city parents to use public money to finance their children's education at parochial or private schools. The pilot city most frequently mentioned is Jersey City.
"I don't support vouchers and don't believe public money should be extensively used in private and parochial schools," Dr. Fitzgerald said, expressing a position shared by most of the state's education groups. "If that's a big part of her agenda for a commissioner of education, I would have some reservations about serving under that kind of governor."
On the other hand, Dr. Fitzgerald, a former Superintendent of Montclair schools, agrees that more money will not necessarily improve education. "The biggest problem now isn't money," she said. "It's managing money and focusing it on priorities."
Dr. Fitzgerald said the New Jersey Department of Education had been in part responsible for the high cost of education by imposing an array of unnecessary requirements. She said a review of state regulations now under way should eliminate many needless expenses.
While politicians haggle over a financing plan, many school districts are faced with the immediate problem of what to do with rapidly rising enrollments.
In the Flemington-Raritan Regional School District, which experienced an enrollment increase of nearly 10 percent last year, voters in June approved an $18 million bond issue for the construction of a new school and additional classroom space for a school that was opened just two years ago.
In the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, where enrollment has tripled in 10 years, voters will be asked to approve a $55 million bond issue in October to finance the construction of a second high school, another elementary school and an addition to a middle school.
Paterson, which expects to gain 500 students this year and will be busing its some children to an unused school in Ridgefield Park, is negotiating with a synagogue for space and hopes to build four more elementary schools.
Over all, public school enrollment in New Jersey is projected to rise by 25,000 students this year, to a total of more than 1.15 million. This is the fourth straight increase, a trend that is expected to continue into the next century.
At the same time, school officials are seeking to make their buildings safer. In December, a task force on violence and vandalism in schools is scheduled to recommend ways to protect students and faculty from disruptive students.
Specifically, the Department of Education is looking for ways to lengthen short-term expulsions beyond the period set by special education regulations.
"I'm much more interested in discussing student responsibility than has been debated recently," Dr. Fitzgerald said. "Public education is a right, but there are certain responsiblities you have being in school that I'm not sure we have effectively communicated to young people."

HEADLINE: An American Workplace, After the Deluge

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: LYNN, Mass.

 BODY:
This is the city where the General Electric Company was born a century ago. But its factories this Labor Day invite suspicions that the company might not be here much longer. Weeds grow in the fissured asphalt of the plants G.E. has closed around town, and most gates to the ones that remain open are chained shut because the gatekeepers have been dismissed. At G.E.'s main site here, the green stuff bordering the visitors' parking lot is not grass but a low-maintenance plastic coated with grit.
G.E.-Lynn has been reduced to a single business, making engines for small jet aircraft, and the work force here has been halved since the mid-1980's, to 6,200, with more cuts to come soon. 
 But within the somber old walls of the plants, a decade of upheaval is producing an extraordinary transformation. Here, as at much of G.E. and for that matter in much of American industry, the ways people work and the tone of the workplace have been altered by the brutally competitive environment -- the recessions of the past decade, the drift of jobs abroad and social changes like the surge of working women. People are working smarter, harder, more flexibly and more cooperatively -- and they're working scared.
Take working smarter. Here, as in Detroit and Buffalo, Cleveland and Scranton, Henry Ford's dumbed-down assembly line is fading fast; employees are being freed to use their heads.
Peter J. Baglioni, 53, is an example. For years an ever-more-bored operator of ever-more-automated lathes, he is the newly trained master of many machines. He can make aircraft engine parts from start to finish.
Then there's Laura A. Kozol, who has built bridges between the engineers who design the products and the machine operators who make them.
Here too, as at many "downsized" and "delayered" companies, the nonunion salaried staff has shrunk even more than the unionized blue-collar force. In some of G.E.-Lynn's plants, chains of command have collapsed to a single link between the plant manager and the worker. Operations managers like Joseph D. Reece have been routed from carpeted offices and stuffed into cubicles in cinderblock bunkers in the middle of the production floors. In the parts of G.E.-Lynn where foremen remain, they lead and coach the troops; they no longer command or discipline them.
 
The Cultural Changes
 Women, while still less than 10 percent of the work force here, are changing the culture. Catherine Lyons, 35, has broken a glass ceiling, having become a plant manager overseeing nearly 100 workers in a multiskilled shop like Mr. Baglioni's. Natalie Henry, a 23-year-old engineer a year out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supervises 36 workers, most at least twice her age. Standing at her cramped booth, her knapsack on the chair because there's no time to sit, she hands out work assignments with offers of cookies. Men, her boss says, return the favor, bringing cookies to her.
The culture is changing, too. The old pinups of scantily clad women are out. Ms. Kozol, a design engineer, came across one once. "I said, 'Whose is this?' " she said. " 'Whoever's it is better take it down.' He did, right away."
Like the pinup, the old shield of authority, the necktie, has gone. The head of G.E.'s operations in Lynn, Timothy J. Noonan, puts his on only for trips out of town. Hourly workers can now park inside the factory gates, once the privilege of salaried workers. G.E.'s new I.D. tags carry first names in big black type and last names in agate.
Perhaps the most striking change is in labor relations. Seven years ago, workers here stormed out in a six-week "strike for respect," in part over a foreman's alleged swipe at worker. Local 201 of the International Union of Electrical Workers, G.E.'s principal union, once routinely rejected the national wage agreements the parent union had negotiated with company headquarters, mostly for the fun of the fight.
Today Local 201, aroused by the continued disappearance of jobs, has mellowed. To let Mr. Baglioni take his new assignment, it agreed to set aside the rigid job classifications that restricted a worker to a single task, like running a milling machine.
"We have lowered our rhetoric," said Jeff Crosby, president of the local. "We can't afford the luxury of hot air."
Management is mellower, too. "Once it was, 'Do it my way, no arguments,' " said Randy Yetts, 54, who overhauls broken machines with three other men. This year, for the first time, they are working without a foreman and deciding for themselves how to schedule and perform their chores. "Now we have little meetings with management," he said, "and they listen to our ideas." Charles Ruiter, Local 201's business agent, said grievances have collapsed from 300 a year in the mid-1980's to 30 or so now.
There's a somber side to all these changes, however. In reducing its work force to survive and compete, G.E. must honor a seniority system that puts the youngest and newest workers on the street first. As a result, the women and minority workers who began landing unionized production jobs here in the late 1970's are losing them now. Walter J. Vick, a black benchworker, figures he will be laid off any day; the company has eliminated the training program that might have led to a better job that might have insulated him.
What remains is a blue-collar work force once again composed almost entirely of white men, most over 40. And with little probability of a significant expansion of jobs even if production of jet engines improves, women, blacks and anyone finishing high school in Lynn these days could wait a decade or more before retirements begin making room at what is still the city's biggest employer.
And while the changes seem to be improving quality and productivity at the plant, workers worry that however more skilled and efficient they become, the deck is still stacked against them.
Lynn has been looking vulnerable because of the cuts in Pentagon spending and the losses that are choking the airlines. From its headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., General Electric sells or buries ailing businesses and moves others around like ships, to wherever production is cheapest. How long will it be, wonders Wayne Starratt, a multiskilled machinist who earns about $16 an hour, before G.E. decides that Mexican workers who are paid $5 a day can learn the skills and do his work?
Hardly anyone here has not been touched by the upheaval in the workplace or had something to do with bringing it on. The experiences of the following six workers illustrate the changes sweeping American manufacturing.
 
 
PETER BAGLIONI
A NEW MAN OF MANY SKILLS
PETER J. BAGLIONI, 53, arrived at G.E.-Lynn 30 years ago. "You were set for life," he said. Or so he thought until G.E. began letting other workers go.
Then opportunity opened after the colossal failure last year of an experiment in workplace innovation. In the early 1980's, G.E. built a $42 million "Automated Factory of the Future" here. Robots shuttled materials to computer-driven lathes that made parts for helicopter engines.
But when orders slipped, the machines' lust for metal did not. They built up mountains of useless inventory because they were too inflexible to be switched to other tasks.
So a year ago G.E. closed the factory of the future and decided to use the plant to see whether people could work smarter than computers. It established a six-week course for machine operators so they could learn to run the gamut of machines -- lathes, milling machines, grinders, drills, polishing machines. It also taught them maintenance, and statistical process control so they could catch bugs in production, and inventory control to prevent waste.
Since December, when Mr. Baglioni completed the course, he and five other retrained machinists have been working in a rearranged factory of U-shaped "cells." Each of four cells contains all the gear needed to take a part from start to finish. Each worker can do all machining operations. And when orders slip, the cell can turn to other products.
There's no foreman. A "cell leader" on each shift oversees all four cells. The workers manage the job and call in help only when problems arise. The old shop-floor animosities have evaporated. "In the old days, they blamed the operator for a mistake," Mr. Baglioni said. "These days, they look at the process."
After he made a mistake recently, "I went to the office and got the manufacturing quality engineer. I told him about it. In this new environment, it's real easy to be honest. In the old days, I would have made up some yarn so I wouldn't get disciplined. I explained to him exactly what I did. He gave me coaching."
With the apparent success of this plant, the company has expanded the cell system to two others. And Mr. Baglioni has devised a Monopoly-like game to show how a cell works. "The corporation is using it to train other divisions," he said. "I got a $1,200 payment for it."
"I enjoy coming to work," he added. "In 30 years at G.E., I never thought I'd say that."

 
 
CATHERINE LYONS
WHERE WOMEN HADN'T BEEN
 IN G.E.'s truncated chain of command, Catherine Lyons, 35, is the manager of Building 64, which adopted the cell system in July. She supervises close to 100 salaried and hourly workers. As a woman in an overwhelmingly male culture, she says she has few complaints after 13 years with the company. But as a mother for 15 months, she is feeling a strain.
On the job, Ms. Lyons comes across as methodical and cool. She once had a job with a company that made solar collectors, and "I saw a lot of inefficiencies," she said. "It sparked my interest in manufacturing. I got a B.S in operations research and industrial engineering from Cornell. And once I was working at G.E., I got a master's in manufacturing engineering from Boston University. I went nights."
Working among men has come easily. "I have felt comfortable," she said. "There were comments here and there, but nothing that made me very uncomfortable. What you are is how you get where you're going to go. It doesn't really matter if you're female or male."
The top corporate and divisional management of G.E., like that of most companies, remains monolithically male. Down below, at the plant level, she has not come up against a glass ceiling. "I haven't seen it or felt it," she said, adding quickly, "but I wouldn't want to make that judgment for women who are closer to the top."
Right now, a tougher issue is family life. Five or six years ago, Ms. Lyons was in a class at G.E. with another woman, a manufacturing manager, and recalled a discussion they had. "We were talking about families," she said. "I said, 'It's really tough in manufacturing because every woman I know who had a baby ended up not coming back.' But that woman took three months off and came back into her job and since then has been promoted. That was a breakthrough."
Ms. Lyons and her husband, Michael Lyons, who owns an auto-glass replacement business, had their first child, a daughter, 15 months ago. "I planned to take 12 weeks," she said. But after eight or nine weeks, G.E. called. " 'There's an opportunity coming up that you might be interested in,' " she said she was told. "It was this job here. I was very interested." She cut her leave to 10 weeks.
But there has been a toll. "I feel the tug now to do everything the right way and not having enough time to go around," she said. G.E. does not provide day-care services in Lynn, so she makes her own arrangements.

 
 
JOSEPH REECE
THE CORNER OFFICE IS HISTORY
 ONE more step and Joseph D. Reece would have been the plant manager. Now 40, he started as a machinist at G.E. and, after earning a degree in manufacturing engineering, ascended in the hierarchy. He reached the level of operations manager of G.E.'s ill-fated factory of the future, with 11 people and more than 20 lathes reporting to him.
But Mr. Reece was swept into the "delayering" strategy of the corporate reorganization imposed by G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr. Today, all the rungs between machinist and plant manager have been removed. Mr. Reece is called the production leader of Plant 3.
It is a senior staff job overseeing procurement, production control, shipping and supplies. He says he has kept his salary, but no one reports to him. Everyone, including the sole clerk who works with him, reports to the plant manager, Jerry Labadini.
Rather than supervise the shipping crew now, for example, he advises it. "We break the schedule down for the guys," he said. "We say, 'Here's what's on the book for next week.' From that point on, the guys manage the shipping." And if Peter Baglioni's team feels a need to bypass Mr. Reece to procure some forgings, he said, "It's fine by me. We've never been burned."
He said he has put the pecking order behind him. "You have to look at the big picture," he said. "You can drive yourself crazy if you get hung up on 'Where am I in the organization chart?' and 'Who's reporting to me?' The only reason for managers is to give directions and orders. You don't need that anymore."
Mr. Reece now works at a desk inside a crowded cinderblock structure in the middle of the production floor. In his last job, he had a corner office on the second floor of the plant and an adjacent conference room. Except for Mr. Labadini, and his secretary, Joan Lattanzio, the floor today presents an eerie gray vista of vacant offices and cubicles with unattended computer terminals.
It was harder, Mr. Reece said, to lose another emblem of authority. "I stopped wearing a necktie in January 1992," he said. "That was tough." He had been wearing neckties since his days in Roman Catholic schools. "I got real comfortable with a necktie on," he said. But shedding the tie, like the office, has helped production by bringing the staff closer to the real work of the plant. "We were just isolated from each other," he said.

 
 
LAURA KOZOL
BUILDING BRIDGES OVER TROUBLE
 G.E.-Lynn had a crusty old practice that often delayed the introduction of new products and processes: Engineers who drew the designs for engine parts did not talk to the workers who had to read the designs to make the parts. Laura A. Kozol, 27, is fixing that.
Ms. Kozol, one of the few workers here whose speech is untouched by the broad a's of eastern Massachusetts, grew up in Ohio and got her B.S at Ohio State. After she joined G.E., the company sent her to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a master's in design engineering.
Ms. Kozol seems very rushed. Her walk is a run. She has a cubicle on the now partly vacant second floor of Building 69 but is rarely there. She is often downstairs, where there's a conventional production shop, a machine overhaul shop, an engine reworking shop and a cell of multi skilled workers who develop processes to pass on to other plants.
"I used to sit in a different building and have meetings with these management and manufacturing guys," Ms. Kozol said. "We would go over the introduction of a part or problems with a part, but we never talked about it with the people in the shop."
She would hear that the workers in Building 69 had difficulty adapting her designs to their machines. "I used to get mad at them," she said, "making these mistakes, requiring me to fix what were their problems."
Then she started coming over to Building 69. "Last summer, I came over full time," she said. "I can talk to the guys actually making the parts. That lets me see what they have to do to meet my requirements." Right on the spot now, she can fix a glitch in a design, rather than tie people up in meetings, paperwork and delay.
Unilaterally, said William A. Fitzgerald, the 32-year-old manager of the building, Ms. Kozol has introduced the concept of concurrent engineering to G.E.-Lynn. "She's the major driver behind concurrent engineering -- the designer-in-the-shop -- in all the Lynn plants," he said.

 
 
WALTER VICK
LIVING IN FEAR OF THE PINK SLIP
 
 
WALTER J. VICK, 35, went to an agricultural high school with the thought of becoming a veterinarian. Now he is a $14.45-an-hour bench hand on Building 74's huge production floor, and he is trapped.
In Building 74, cells of multiskilled workers have yet to displace the old manufacturing systems. But here, too, much has changed. The chain of command has been truncated, and Mr. Vick says the old climate of us-versus-them has nearly evaporated.
As a bench hand, Mr. Vick sits at a small counter removing burrs from machine-cut engine parts and sub assemblies. He has been doing it for five years. "I've just gotten bored," he said. "The mind goes numb some days, just deburring. But there aren't any jobs to advance yourself."
In better times, G.E. would post openings for jobs to which people like Mr. Vick could aspire. But with the work force shrinking, better jobs rarely crop up. G.E. also once ran a three-year program to train workers for better jobs. But the company has abandoned it because it could not find jobs for the graduates.
The only option now is assignment to a "multiskilling" class and joining a cell like Peter Baglioni's. But as a bench hand, Mr. Vick lacks skill in machining, so he is ineligible. Instead, he faces the one thing he fears more than the tedium of benchwork -- a layoff.
The company uses a process it calls "peer pairing" to identify salaried workers for layoff. Managers compare workers with similar jobs and shed those who compare least favorably. But under agreement with the union, the company dismisses hourly workers according to their seniority -- last hired, first fired.
Mr. Vick, like all production workers a member of Local 201 of the International Union of Electrical Workers, started out at G.E.-Lynn in 1979. He is black, and the affirmative action programs of the late 1970's helped open the job market for him. But the years of layoffs at G.E. have eliminated nearly all semiskilled workers hired since 1979. "Another big cut comes through here," he said, "and I'm right on the line to go."

 
 
WAYNE STARRATT
UNION MAN WITH A QUESTION
 A UNION steward and a newly minted multiskilled machinist, Wayne Starratt, 46, feels he has landed in blue-collar heaven. But he is wary of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr.
Sartorially, Mr. Starratt is an exuberant self-expressionist. Shanks of brown hair tumble past his ears to his shoulders, whiskers frame his mouth and one workday he was wearing trousers printed with stripes and dots and black suspenders with six buttons attached.
One button proclained: "Everyone needs a hero. I'm mine." Another said: "Enjoy life! This is not a dress rehearsal."
In Mr. Starratt's cell, a team of six men makes 40.929-inch-long drive shafts for the engines for the Navy's F18 fighters. "One operator can take that shaft all the way until it is shipped, where before it would take five or six people," he said. "It's a nice feeling."
He paused. "Then again, it's a means of reducing the work force. One of us can do the work of six." Like many workers here who have witnessed layoff upon layoff, Mr. Starratt fears that however efficient the plants in Lynn become, Mr. Welch will keep laying off people here or deem someplace else more efficient and shut down Lynn.
"I trust the people I work with, like Cathie Lyons [his boss]," he said. "I have faith in people who are part of this business, part of making aircraft engines. But I don't trust the upper-level management, people like Jack Welch. Those people scare me. They have never made anything themselves. They have never put blood, sweat and tears into the product. They don't see the product. To them it's just dollars and cents."
Maybe Mr. Starratt's concerns are overdrawn. The cells have been producing significant savings over conventional processes. "We can't say how much," said Timothy J. Noonan, head of G.E.'s operations in Lynn. "But you know the savings are there."
Indeed, because of the success here, G.E. has ordered some of the work done at plants in Evandale, Ohio, transferred to Lynn.

THE ECONOMY
 
Dr. Clinton Writes a New, Shorter Prescription 
 
Speaking of health care . . . (aren't we always speaking of health care these days?), Dr. Clinton is, once again, prescribing some different medicine. The diagnosis is still the same -- the nation's health care system is a mess -- but he keeps thinking up different solutions. You can't really blame him, though: unlike other doctors, he not only has to cure the patient, he has to figure out how the bill will be paid. Here's the latest bow to reality (translation: money): only so much mental health care will be covered, and only children will be covered for dental care. The Administration also came up with the revolutionary idea that if someone goes to the doctor before she gets sick, maybe a lot of sicknesses can be headed off. Preventive medicine, said Ted Kennedy, "is the stitch in time that can save billions." But when it all got sorted out, routine physicals were on the list of things that probably wouldn't be available until 2000.
 
The Bush Economy, Refigured
 
"What if" can be a soothing game. Last week a lot of gloomy Republicans may have dabbled in it on hearing that the economy -- you remember, the issue that brought back those tax-and-spenders -- wasn't in such bad shape after all back in the Bush days. The Commerce Department, which no sooner puts out a number than it thinks better of it, said gross domestic product had been understated for three years. And in 1992's fourth quarter, G.D.P. was a lot stronger. What if voters had known? Would a different golfer have graced August's front pages? Who knows.
 
Earning Less, Spending More
 
And now, new figures. Americans earned less in July but spent more -- but who balances a checkbook when it's so hot? The Commerce Department said last week that personal spending rose for the fourth month, even as income fell (the costs of the Midwest flood figured in that). But clearly people were thinking day to day in July: they weren't buying big things like houses (new-home sales dropped 5 percent), but spending for little things -- "nondurables," the economists call them politely -- shot up the most since April. And spending for utilities was up -- it isn't cheap running air conditioners all day. What does it add up to? Still, an economy neither fish nor fowl, just chug-chugging along.
 
Your Cable Bill, Volume 1
 
Among life's minor irritants, is there anything that causes such fury as cable rates? Why, some ask, do I have to pay to watch television? Why does the rate make no sense? Why is it always going up? Last week new rates went into effect, and the F.C.C., it seemed, had tossed all the rates in the air to land where they may. The new formulas are intended to save viewers more than $1 billion a year, but they've certainly added confusion, with bills peppered with odd new fees, like a few pennies for the remote control. How much time will people have left to watch after figuring all this out?
 
Payroll Jobs Take a Tumble . . .
 
On the job front, things do not look promising. First, the good news, such as it is: the unemployment rate fell slightly, the Government said last week, to 6.7 percent in August from 6.8 percent in July. But the number of payroll jobs fell too, by 39,000 in August, the first drop in more than a year. And if the Government's main forecasting index is correct, things will get worse: the leading indicators edged down a tenth of a point in July. But those on the job worked longer -- 12 minutes more a week, the data-gatherers insist.
 
 . . . and Interest Rates Follow
 
As they often do, investors licked their economic wounds by buying bonds, and that crash you heard at week's end was the 30-year Treasury bond plowing through a threshold that many young Wall Street types have read about only in science fiction. The rate fell below 6 percent for the first time in a quarter century, ending at 5.94 percent. So is it 1950's here we come, complete with 4 or 5 percent mortgage rates?
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
At the U.A.W., Ford Is Target 1
 
There was a changing of the guard, of sorts, in Detroit last week, as the U.A.W. chose Ford, not G.M., to negotiate with in the final push toward a Big Three contract. In return for this dubious honor, Ford will probably face a strike first if this "pattern bargaining" fails (the current contract ends Sept. 14). But it could spell trouble for G.M. too, because G.M. is in worse shape than Ford or Chrysler, and thus cannot be as generous as its rivals -- it does not want to be pressured to take a deal worked out by Ford. One hot issue, of course, is in those two highly charged little words: health care. It costs too much, bosses want workers to pay more of it, workers want bosses to keep paying. Sound familiar?
 
Canadian auto workers, meanwhile, picked Chrysler to bargain with, no doubt reasoning that since Chrysler makes some popular models in Canada, it would sorely hate to have anything gum up those assembly lines.
Mr. Chrysler Downshifts Again
They must have been hard words to say: "It's time to let the younger people do the driving." But Lee Iacocca, who got so used to the driver's seat at Chrysler it seemed he'd be chairman forever, also gave up his board seat last week -- more than a year early. Perhaps, nearing 69, he's finally turning his attention to enjoying his spoils from Chrysler's remarkable turnaround. He's got 2.9 million shares and, as a director, there were restrictions on his stock sales. So is this that historic moment when Lee Iacocca is actually off the Chrysler payroll? Not quite. He's still a "consultant," whatever that means (can you imagine a 10-year-old, asked her fantasy career, saying "consultant"?), making a token $500,000 a year -- not to mention use of a corporate jet.
 
Delta, American Think Smaller
 
The nation's airlines are getting serious about putting their houses in order. Delta, which lost half a billion dollars last year, said last week that it was considering starting a low-cost, no-frills airline. And while other Delta employees have accepted 5 percent pay cuts, pilots have balked -- and now that'll cost some pilots their jobs. And American Airlines said it might lay off hundreds of managers and other employees, and there were reports that it might spin off some units as separate companies. The company would not confirm that plan, though, saying only that it was "constantly searching for ways to enhance shareholder value."
 
Paying for Superexpansion
 
Barnes & Noble is on a roll. Ever since it got the idea that a bookstore should be nearly the size of the New York Public Library, but as inviting as a snug den, it has been opening "superstores" right and left. The one on the Upper West Side of Manhattan has been a particular success. The company, which for good measure also owns B. Dalton, Doubleday and Scribner's, already has 168 superstores, and it hopes to open about 100 more in the next year. But this expansion costs plenty, and last week Barnes & Noble looked to investors; it plans to sell more than 8 million shares to raise about $130 million.
 
A $1.2 Billion Litton Victory
 
It didn't sound like a billion-dollar matter -- a patent fight involving a process to coat mirrors used in "ring laser gyroscopes." But those gyroscopes are keys to airplane navigation, and it's a $400 million market. Several years ago, Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Honeywell of infringing its patented process, and Honeywell filed a counterclaim. A Los Angeles jury was given the unenviable task of untangling this dispute, and last week it did so -- in a big way -- awarding Litton $1.2 billion in damages. The judge will decide soon whether to accept that verdict.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Honda Walks a Fine Line
 
Honda faced a delicate problem in pricing its spiffed-up Accord (on sale this week). The Accord has suffered since losing its top spot to Ford's Taurus, so the price had to be low enough to get it back in the game. But if it was too low, protectionist cries would surely ring out from Detroit. Honda picked the low-price road last week, holding the base price to its current level, $14,330. But, knowing the hazards, it rushed to justify that price, saying it had used more parts that were interchangeable, thus cutting design costs.
 
Kodak Gets Tough on Fuji
 
Trade tensions stirred elsewhere, too. With Kay R. Whitmore, the chairman who has long favored free trade, heading for the door, a tougher Kodak is taking shape. The latest sign: Last week Kodak asked the Commerce Department to slap huge tariffs on some Fuji film-processing products, asserting that its Japanese rival was selling at unfairly low prices. So once again the strong yen could hurt Japan: a higher yen means a higher dollar equivalent for prices charged in Japan, so the numbers are on the side of any American company making a "dumping" charge.
 
U.S. and Russia Mean Business
 
As the cold war gasped its last, a cooperative spirit began to form, and last week, on two fronts, that spirit became reality. As starters, Texaco became the first beneficiary of a joint fund set up to encourage American companies to invest in Russia, receiving loan guarantees on a project to revitalize 150 dormant oil wells in Siberia. In addition, in a stunning turnabout for a space program born amid cold-war tensions, Russia and the United States agreed to work together on designing and building a space station.

HEADLINE: Bringing a Slow-Moving Auto Maker Up to Speed

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AT any other company a quarterly net profit of $889 million would be cause to open champagne. Not so, at the General Motors Corporation.
A reversal of horrendous losses, attributable mostly to a recovering United States economy and earnings from nonautomotive subsidiaries, surely was welcome when G.M. announced its second-quarter earnings this summer. Yet the biggest company in the country is by no means out of the woods. Despite cost-cutting, it remains slow, insular and ill prepared to contend with competitors like the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and even the much smaller, weaker Chrysler Corporation. 
 The current chief executive, John F. Smith Jr., has cut costs and streamlined management. But G.M. must still prove to the world that it can figure out what car buyers want and how to produce these models efficiently and with high quality.
From nearly a decade of interviews and reflection about what it would take to make this giant great again, a number of ideas stand out to this reporter as most sensible. G.M. knows these ideas well, and in some cases has slowly begun trying them. But the company will have to move more quickly and more pervasively if it is to right itself before the next recession squeezes it again.
Unfortunately, the G.M. penchant for studying issues copiously and trying to effect them humanely takes time. Ford and Chrysler have acted decisively because they faced immediate crises. G.M. did not deviate from its plodding style because its financial reserves obviated drastic, and sometimes risky, actions.
Among the ideas to revive G.M.:
1. Move faster to shrink the number of G.M. models and the distribution network. G.M. sells about 3 million cars a year in the United States, in 61 models and 7 brands. In 1978, when G.M. sold about 5 million cars, it offered 60 car models through 5 brands.
Sure, brand names have equity. But many G.M. models sell in such small numbers that they do not justify the costs of engineering and development, or those of advertising and rebates. For example, G.M. sold fewer than 13,000 of the Oldsmobile 98, which differs little from the Oldsmobile 88, in the first seven months of the year.
As for the distribution network, many G.M. dealers cannot make an adequate profit because of the competition from other G.M. dealers. Consider the average Buick dealership, which sold 181 new cars in 1992. That compares with an average of 654 new cars sold by every Honda dealership, 560 at Toyota and 337 at Nissan. The G.M. Saturn subsidiary is an exception: Each dealership sells more than 1,000 new cars a year, a big reason for the success of the franchise.
G.M. executives argue that state franchise laws prevent them from dropping dealers, even if they are marginal. But if G.M. was ruthless about reducing the number of its models -- cutting either the Buick LeSabre or Park Avenue, two similar midsize models, for example -- dealers would lose sales and the marginal ones might drop out, leaving healthier revenue and profit for the rest.
2. Create "platform teams" as the new paradigm for developing new models. G.M. has a number of groups with overlapping responsibilities working on the development of cars and trucks. Moreover, people in these groups rarely stay for the duration of a program. By contrast, Chrysler and some Japanese auto makers now assign platform teams that stick together and focus only on the creation of one vehicle.
Chrysler, for example, overhauled its engineering departments into highly focused teams of 800 or 900 engineers and planners so they would be more nimble and more closely attuned to customer desires. Each team is headed, start to finish, by a powerful leader who is immune to executive meddling. The highly acclaimed L/H family sedans were created by Chrysler's first truly independent team.
Despite evidence that this new system is very effective, G.M. in recent years has resisted independent teams, partly because it thinks they are inefficient for such a large auto maker. By most accounts this is a mistake.
3. Offer a new "mid-market" car. The heart of the United States car market is the basic family sedan, a category G.M. once dominated. The Buick Regal, Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans -- each built on the same "GM-10" chassis -- have been bitter disappointments compared with rivals like the Honda Accord, Ford Taurus and Chrysler L/H's.
G.M. could appoint a swat team of 900 top engineers and planners and its most talented leader with the mission of replacing the GM-10's in three years or less. The team's mission should be no less than to create a sedan that surpasses the Accord, Taurus and L/H.
4. End class distinctions among the employees. To convey the message that everyone is in the same boat, executives must erase distinctions that have historically divided G.M. workers.
For a start, executives could move their offices to the factories. If John O. Grettenberger, the general manager of Cadillac, worked from a desk at the Cadillac plant in Hamtramck, Mich., it would do wonders for esprit, shorten the lines of communication and probably sensitize the executives to the concerns of the workers.
Also, all workers, from the executives to cleanup crews, should be covered by the same health plans. G.M. complains about crushing health care costs, yet its union members still receive no-premium, no-deductible, no-copayment health plans. (They pay only for doctor visits.) Salaried workers, by contrast, pay a lot more out of their own pockets. G.M. may have to take a strike to pry that concession from the union. Then again, if a plan to make employees pay more for their medical benefits is part of a genuine effort to make compensation more equitable, the U.A.W. might go along.
5. Make pay more equitable. The enormous gap between what the top executives and factory workers earn alienates the groups from each other. Narrow the gap, but also make the compensation to every worker more dependent on the financial success of the company. This could be accomplished by substituting profit sharing or stock options for some straight pay. Because of the financial crunch, G.M.'s bloated executive pay packages of the 1980's have been suspended temporarily; they should be abolished until the company can afford to award every worker with proportionately more money.
6. Stamp out jargon, euphemisms and other impediments to clear thinking. In the G.M. culture, workers are discouraged from admitting that they have run into "problems" or "trouble." In G.M. language, an acceptable phrase would be something like "I'm facing a big challenge."
Until G.M. workers are eager to report trouble and offer creative solutions, important mistakes will not be corrected. These days, for example, the company talks about the "challenge" of keeping up with the demand for its light-truck models. This kind of talk is intended to make a shortage seem almost beneficial -- an outgrowth of popularity -- when it is actually harmful.
G.M. has consistently misread customer tastes. Consequently, it has planned for too many cars and too few mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles. As long as G.M. views such situations as "challenges" rather than problems, it will not look for their deep causes and try to correct them.
7. Seek more suggestions from workers, and act on them. Any factory that has not fully involved its work force is at a serious disadvantage. The United States factories of Honda and Toyota have made a religion of encouraging workers to make suggestions. The Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., counted more than 40,000 suggestions in 1992 -- about nine per employee and more than G.M. receives at all its North American plants combined.
Even more stunning than the number of suggestions at Toyota is the percentage it puts into effect -- 98 percent. Many were submitted after discussions by teams of workers, a practice that weeds out fanciful or impractical ideas. Toyota rewards most suggestions with gift certificates worth $10 or $15; serious money savers earn more expensive rewards.
As the workers receive more training in disciplines like statistical process control, suggestions will yield even better results.
8. Get rid of the old-fashioned Detroit mindset. The company's view on many topics, from the appropriateness of air bags to tastes in upholstery, is shaped mostly by white, male, middle-aged graduates of Midwestern engineering schools. To be sure, G.M. is trying hard to recruit more women and members of minority groups.
Transfer some of the important decision-making groups out of Detroit. To understand the California market better -- and maybe pick up ideas about style -- move one division to the West Coast. Perhaps another should relocate to the Southeast. More of G.M.'s most talented people should learn Japanese and study Japanese consumers, rather than complain about the impenetrability of the Japan market.
9. Hire agents of change. After the debacle involving Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, wherein Dr. Lopez jumped ship for Volkswagen, it might be tempting for Mr. Smith to avoid iconoclastic personalities who might further rile the G.M. constituencies. But Dr. Lopez cut costs and raised esprit after others had failed. As the head of worldwide purchasing, he smashed the cozy relationships between G.M. and its suppliers that for years meant G.M. was paying too much for materials.
G.M. has always had a deep-seated aversion to outsiders. But the few outsiders who have held important positions there have ultimately helped stir the company from its complacency. Ross Perot, for example, served on the G.M. board and spurred scrutiny of the performance of the top executives at the company.
10. From the chief executive down, require every employee who plans to drive a G.M. car to buy it just as ordinary customers do -- from a dealer at the best price that can be found. Now thousands of top executives and managers are given company cars and trucks at little cost. Executives will never address the hassles and disappointments of shopping for a car until they experience them.
The same goes for repairs and maintenance; Some G.M. executives now get it for free at company garages. A few top G.M. executives still use drivers, so they do not even have to feel how their cars drive.
Do not stigmatize employees who decide to drive non-G.M. or even Japanese brands. Most employees would probably want to patronize G.M. But if they do not, the focus should be on finding out why not and what it takes to satisfy them.

The Internet

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
WHAT: The Internet. An unbelievably dense global matrix of 1.7 million computers, woven together by telephone lines, undersea cables, microwave links and gigabit fiber-optic pipes. Touching down in 137 countries, linking 15 million to 30 million people and growing by a million users each month, it's a super data highway that carries the freight of the information age -- electronic mail, digital video and sound, , computer viruses and more. 
 Forget Elaine's. Internet is currently the world's most fashionable rendezvous.
WHO USES IT: Well-known nerds like Steve Jobs and William Gates, pop folks like Todd Rundgren and Billy Idol, cyberpunks and yuppies, your mom.
WHY: It was really Vice President Al Gore who got the ball rolling. For the last six years Mr. Gore has told anyone who would listen that a nationwide high-speed computer network would create an economic revival. As more users have joined Internet, big business has paid attention. Last week, the News Corporation, owned by Rupert Murdoch, bought Delphi, a Boston on-line service that is connected to the Net. The goal: To publish interactive versions of his newspapers and magazines.
WHY ELSE?: What it's really about is cyberspace. Cyberspace describes a new kind of computer geography that maps the digital rather than the physical world. Jack into the Net (i.e., log in to your computer network) and you'll be transported into the cybernetic world that Marshall McLuhan was talking about when he conceived the idea of a global village. Right now, it's mostly displayed as text on your computer: as electronic streams of consciousness, odd 10-way playlets, you name it. Three-dimensional graphics are on the way.
HOW: To take a ride on the Internet you need a PC and a modem. Then subscribe to any of the dozens of local and national services offering an Internet connection. Hourly rates range from $1 to $4; monthly charges from $10 to $50. Software Tool and Die in the Boston area charges $20 for the first 20 hours each month; (617) 739-0202. Netcom in Santa Clara, Calif., charges $17.50 a month; (408) 554-8649. Others include: Panix in New York, (212) 787-6160, and the Well in Sausalito, Calif., (415) 332-4335.
THE ADDRESS: Signified by the "@" or "at" sign -- an Internet mail convention used to separate the user's name from his or her location (or "domain" in techie talk).
THE MOST EXCLUSIVE ADDRESS: president@whitehouse.gov.
THE LEXICON: ftp -- a k a file transfer protocol -- is the software that lets the user transfer software or documents from one computer to another. Telnet is a program that lets the user connect to another computer anywhere in the world. MUDs or MUSEs -- a k a multi-user dungeons or multi-user simulated environments -- are interactive adventure games that can be played by many people at once. Flame is an electronic tirade on one subject or another. Gopher is a software tool that retrieves from electronic libraries.
THE HIGHWAY PATROL: No longer a wild frontier, the Internet now has its own police and fire departments. The fire fighters: the Computer Emergency Response Team at the Software Engineering Institute, a group of programmers in Pittsburgh ready to respond to attacks by computer rogues and viruses. The police officers: Both the F.B.I. and the Justice Department have computer crime squads with links to Scotland Yard and the Canadian Mounties.
BED AND BREAKFASTS: The best haunts on the Internet are cozy little Unix computers. You can connect to the Well, a convivial gathering spot for the San Francisco Bay Area's digerati. The Well has dozens of computer conferences on just about every subject you can imagine. It's a keyboard stream-of-conciousness conversation that's a little like having an electronic chat with your neighbor over the back fence.
ROAD MAPS: John Quarterman's "The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems Worldwide" (Digital Press, 1990); Ed Kroll's "The Whole Internet: User's Guide and Catalog" (O'Reilly & Associates, 1992) and "The Internet Guide for New Users" (McGraw-Hill Inc., 1993) by Daniel Dern.
INSIDER'S GUIDES: Road maps are fine, but if you want to understand what the Internet means rather than where it goes, try the three science-fiction classics: William Gibson's "Neuromancer" (Gibson invented the term cyberspace), John Brunner's "Shockwave Rider" and Vernor Vinge's "True Names."
POTHOLES: Gigabits are great, but only those users who are logged into one of the nation's supercomputer centers in San Diego or Champaign, Ill., for example, have them. Most of the rest of us are still looking for the ramp to the freeway. The ramp is supposed to be built by the phone or cable companies who are planning to run high-speed fiber-optic cables right to your living room. Then you'll have plenty of bandwidth (billions of bits of data). The question is, will you use it to browse through the digital Library of Congress, or will you just get on line with the interactive home shopping channel?

'What I Didn't Get to Do This Summer'

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
BE glad no one can see under your bed. For beneath it likely lie all the broken promises you made to yourself this summer -- all those things you said you were going to do and never quite got around to. Labor Day is designed to commend labor; yet, it also inspires guilt over not having had enough . . . something all summer. Following are the regrets of a random sampling of Manhattan subway riders:
BOBBY CARMAN , 35, photographer: "I didn't meet a nice companion. I placed a personal ad and I got some responses, but nothing good came." 
 JEFF GREEN , 28, musician: "I didn't break 100 on my golf game. I got close, but I need to work on my putt."
GABRIELLE BLAKE , 23, advertising assistant: "I didn't run every morning like I said I would."
NATALIE GORDON , 66, doctor: "I didn't clean out some of the stuff I've had in my house for 30 years. It's time for me to toss out articles I'll never read and clothing I should have given away years ago."
DIANE ROBERTS , 34, sales manager: "I didn't go on vacation. I wish I went to Italy to eat."
ANDREW GROSSMAN , 25, political organizer: "I didn't go to the beach once. It was terribly disappointing. I spent the whole summer shut up in campaign offices."
DAVID AXELROD , 78, Queens resident: "I didn't learn the fundamentals of bridge." (His wife, Ida, nodded in sad agreement, saying, "I'm the one who had to listen all summer to his bidding.")
HAZEL SILVERA , 40, nurse: "I didn't do enough reading. I wanted to read some science fiction, but I was too busy with daily life."
JASON RAMIREZ , 25, teacher: "I didn't get to see the Yankees once this whole summer. I try to get to five or six games a year, but the recession had hit us hard this time."
ANDY CAMERON , 35, auditor: "There were certain reports for work that I didn't do, so I'll be busy in the fall."
DONALD McHUGH , 33, police sergeant: "I wanted to go out to Southampton at least two or three times, but I didn't have the discretionary income. Root canal took its place."
DEE WOLFE , 54, art therapist: "Get done? I didn't even get in touch with summer. It went by so fast that I didn't get to do the things I wanted, like take a long walk home, see friends, seal my skis with wax."
TIFFANY ALEXANDER , 16, high school student: "I didn't get to go to Disney World because I got a job as a library pager."
 TIM SUTTON , 26, unemployed writer: "I didn't find a job."

HEADLINE: West Can Compete With East in Skilled Labor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a visitor from Britain, I have been interested to observe the debate over the minimum wage and other aspects of labor market regulation in the United States. At a time when Secretary of Labor Robert Reich is proposing an increase in the United States minimum, the British Government is altogether abolishing Britain's minimum wage system. For the first time in many years, the United States and Britain are moving in opposite directions on labor market policy. Which of them is correct? 
 The evidence of David Card and Alan Kreuger, the Princeton economists who are the subjects of your Aug. 22 "Conversations" (Week in Review), suggests that an increase in the minimum wage could create, rather than destroy jobs. There is no mystery to why this might be the case: when Winston Churchill first set up the minimum wage system that is now being dismantled, he did so in the belief that "decent conditions make for industrial efficiency and increase, rather than decrease competitive power."
He was also concerned that, without minimum wage regulation, "the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst" (quoted in Hansard's parliamentary debates for April 22, 1909).
As your Aug. 8-12 series on Europe made clear, the question of whether welfare and labor market regulation help or hinder economic prosperity is at the top of the agenda within the European Community. Britain accounts for one-quarter of the Community's poor. It is now also the only advanced industrialized country in the world without pay protection for the poorest.
Although Britain already has the lowest hourly wage costs in the European Community, it has almost the highest unemployment rate in the Community, according to your Aug. 9 and 12 Europe articles. Yet, to compete with Taiwan and South Korea on a labor cost basis, costs in Britain will have to fall a further 60 percent. United States labor costs, to compete on the same basis, would have to fall even more than that.
The lesson is surely that the only effective way for Europe and the United States to compete is as high wage, high productivity and high efficiency economies. Perhaps Churchill was right all along.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Schools Open Soon (With Luck), To More Trouble Than Usual

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
IN these last days before school starts, the news has been less about innovation than desperation: New York City schools will not open on time because a previously botched asbestos inspection left them unsafe; a New Jersey state judge ruled that income gaps between rich and poor school districts are still unacceptable; and the absence of a balanced budget may delay the opening of schools in Chicago.
In what seems to be a collective throwing up of hands, the proferred solutions to the problems of American schools reflect both exasperation and radical reaction. Facing growing anger about the cost of education, Michigan will no longer use property taxes as a source of education money by 1994 -- but what will replace them is so far unclear. 
 In November, California voters will consider a voucher proposal that would give parents $2,600 in tax money that would be taken from public schools to spend on tuition in private schools.
Such solutions, which were politically unacceptable just a few years ago, are being contemplated today precisely because many have concluded that most public schools are ungovernable and hostile to change.
 
Why Systems Flounder
 Certainly average scores for students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test did rise modestly in 1993, for the second year in a row. And even if those indicators are imperfect, many individual schools have improved remarkably, keeping more students in the classroom and bringing them more success. But most school districts that have tried to extend innovations to all their schools have been stymied.
A recent study of four geographically diverse school districts suggests why: Most systems are top-heavy with bureaucrats, mired in regulations that discourage risk-taking, buffeted by politics and filled with special interests. The study, entitled, "Divided Within, Besieged Without: The Politics of Education in Four American School Districts," was by the Public Agenda Foundation, a privately funded research group.
The status quo has few defenders of any political stripe.
"Gridlock is normal," said Terry M. Moe, a political scientist at Stanford University and a proponent of vouchers, which would allow schools to compete for students.
Educators almost universally agree that the system has to change. But they disagree about whether it can be changed from within or whether they have to start fresh: throw out the school boards and districts and substitute vouchers that would allow each school to operate independently.
The changes educators seek have been elusive in part because they are trying to do what American schools have never done before: hold every student to high standards. In the past, only a relatively small elite excelled in school, but even those who dropped out could find well-paying unskilled jobs. In a high-tech economy, those who fail in school are more likely to remain unemployed or in dead-end jobs.
Now educators want to raise expectations for every student and close the gaps between rich and poor, whites and minorities. They want to set standards for children, but free teachers and principals to choose approaches to meet them.
But the same educators agree with a basic finding of the study: The politics of reform are as important as its content. In New York City, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez lost his job because of political deadlock, parental anger at measures like condom distribution, and failure to win support among lower-level administrators. He was replaced last week by Ramon C. Cortines, the former superintendent of San Francisco's schools, who vowed to stick with educational basics.
In Los Angeles, rank-and-file teachers union members are rebelling against a broad initiative to change schools. In Rochester, where officials seven years ago agreed to pay some of the country's highest teaching salaries, the public is furious at the slow pace of change. They blame teachers who will not agree to link pay with student performance; teachers blame leaders for unrealistic goals.
Some educators, like Theodore R. Sizer, who heads the Coalition for Essential Schools, a consortium of 200 schools pledged to education reforms, believe that radical change is possible from within the system. "I'm more optimistic than I've been in years," he said. "I sense a real surge at the grassroots level -- from principals, superintendents, governors' aides. The policy people say reform has failed, but meanwhile there's this brushfire."
 
Dried-Up Financial Sources
 In Michigan, a new law abolishes property taxes as a source of money for schools. Indeed, how to finance schools remains one of the thorniest problems in American education. Property taxes have long come under fire as unjust to poor school districts. The resulting wide gaps in spending between rich and poor districts have been ruled unconstitutional in at least 11 states. But voters have also rebelled against raising taxes in many communities around the country. Michigan has a year to find another way to raise about $6 billion and the teachers union has already challenged the new law.
Other places, like Kentucky, Vermont, San Diego, Memphis and Los Angeles, are attempting to transform their schools both financially and philosophically. They share a different vision of a school system, one where parents, teachers and principals at individual schools make most decisions about teaching and money, and call upon a much smaller state and local bureaucracy for help and advice.
"The school should be the client, and you only have a client as long as you serve them well," said Judy Codding, who won a reputation as an innovative principal at Pasadena High School in California.
Britain is trying this idea, christened there "local management of schools." Schools receive 85 percent of their budget directly, with 15 percent paid to the district for certain administrative costs. Schools are free to buy services like curriculum development or teacher training. Bureaucrats' salaries are only paid, in effect, if schools really need them.
Some educators in the United States are embracing what could be a middle ground -- creating what are called "charter schools," public schools that will be exempt from most state regulations. If they don't attract enough students or meet stated performance goals they may go out of business. Six states have such laws, and legislation is pending in nearly a dozen others.
Another group believes the only hope for change is to dismantle what they call a monopoly answerable to no one -- and substitute marketplace competition in the form of vouchers. Parents would get tax money directly to spend on public or private schools. Schools, freed from bureaucracy, would compete for students.
 
The Voucher Debate
 In California, opponents of the voucher proposal say that public schools already staggering from budget cuts would be destroyed if parents could get tax money to pay private school tuition. They also say that vouchers abandon those students whose parents are unwilling or unable to choose good schools. Advocates say vouchers are the only way to break gridlock.
David Hornbeck, a former Maryland state schools superintendent, argues that a marketplace system will not guarantee that popular schools are good ones that produce students with needed skills. "If the point is to create rewards and penalties reflecting what we say schools should do, then just create them directly," he said. Kentucky's law includes rewards if schools meet standards and penalties if they fail.
Professor Moe said most educators simply cannot accept the ultimate logic of their critiques. "People don't want to draw the next conclusion," he said. "What they want to do is go back to the system that doesn't work and rely upon it to start working, and it's not going to."
In Britain, radical changes were imposed on schools by Government fiat. The open question in the United States remains whether those groups who would lose some power in the proposed changes -- teachers unions, school boards, state departments of education and local administrators -- will voluntarily cede it.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Nicaragua Has No War, And No Peace, Either

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
AS Nicaraguans fought a civil war in the 1980's, family gatherings at the Chamorro home here were often uncomfortable affairs. One of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's sons was editing the newspaper of the governing Sandinista Front, the other working in exile for the American-backed rebels who fought to overthrow it. One daughter was a Sandinista diplomat, the other an editor of the family's anti-Sandinista newspaper, La Prensa.
Since Mrs. Chamorro was elected President in 1990, defeating the Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, the tensions have eased. Pedro Joaquin, the son who joined the contra rebels, is back at La Prensa. Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and Minister of the Presidency, worked out an accommodation between her Government and the Sandinistas that sometimes allows her other children to support both. 
 "When people are not dying," said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, who still edits the Sandinista newspaper Barricada, "the political disputes are softer."
But for Nicaragua as a whole, reconciliation has been painfully elusive. After a peaceful ending to the hostage crisis in which former rebels and former Sandinista soldiers had each seized dozens of prominent captives, Mrs. Chamorro tried last week to open broad negotiations with the right and left. Within hours, her former allies on the right were demanding bitterly that she first address a long list of their demands. By Thursday, when Mrs. Chamorro took a step toward doing that by saying she would replace the Sandinista Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra as chief of the army, his brother, former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega, was all but screaming at her.
"You are not the owner of the country!" Mr. Ortega was reported to have shouted.
Despite all of the killing over the last 15 years in Nicaragua, it often seems that peace should not be so hard to come by. The country is tired to its bones of fighting and death, and the Chamorros are a mirror for its intimacy: families splintered by the war have been rejoined; old enemies have gotten used to seeing one another on the street again.
Nicaragua should at least have an easier time of it than El Salvador, where a dozen years of civil war ended more recently. Compared to El Salvador's governing party, whose founding hero, Roberto D'Aubuisson, helped formed the death squads that tortured and murdered thousands of suspected leftists, many politicians on the Nicaraguan right think like social democrats. Their Sandinista opponents have also tended to be more moderate than those who fought on the Salvadoran left.
But the two wars came to very different ends. In negotiations that stuttered over eight years, the Salvadorans reached a settlement on issues from the creation of a new police to the redistribution of peasant lands. When the rebels in Nicaragua agreed to a cease-fire in April 1990, Mrs. Chamorro's election two months before was their principal guarantee.
That left unresolved a series of complex and difficult issues, like the former combatants' land and security problems and the rights of people whose property was confiscated by the Sandinistas. The results have been a rearming on both sides, ambushes and assassinations in the countryside and endless fights over who owns what.
Such hatreds have been played out in the capital by Sandinista leaders and representatives of those they pushed into opposition or exile. In principle, the Sandinistas have fought to save some of the political power and social policies of their revolution from what they see as devastating economic policies demanded by foreign lenders. Their opponents have fought to keep the Sandinistas from "taking control," as Alfredo Cesar, one of their strongest adversaries, described it.
But after years in which revolution and counterrevolution were made to channel all of Nicaragua's energies, its politics have atomized. Walls that were once Sandinista or anti-Sandinista now seem to be covered by the graffiti of obscure political street gangs. Like a century's worth of Nicaraguans before them, groups like Mr. Cesar's have turned to the United States for help.
"The Sandinista period and the contra war emphasized what has been a long pattern," Kenneth Sharpe, a political science professor at Swarthmore College, said, referring to the years when the Reagan Administration created and re-created the contra armies to bring down the Sandinistas. "That makes it very difficult for people in Nicaragua to sit down now and settle their differences."
After fighting for a decade to defeat the rebels in El Salvador, the United States threw its weight behind peace and mostly left details to the Salvadorans. In Nicaragua, American officials mistrusted Mrs. Chamorro's alliance with the Sandinistas from the start and have increasingly fought to break it.
American pressure appeared to have been important in pushing Mrs. Chamorro toward the tough stand she took Thursday, and might come to be seen as an acceptable price for greater civilian control over the Sandinista People's Army. But if there were any doubts that that inflamed the Sandinistas, her exchange with Daniel Ortega after her announcement answered them.
"The gringos twisted your arm!" he was reported to have shouted at her before a group of diplomats and Government ministers.
"Nobody twists my arm, and don't yell at me," she answered.
In trying to consolidate its peace, El Salvador has at least had a growing economy. Nicaragua -- after two wars, an American blockade and wild management of state resources by the Sandinistas -- is bankrupt, its economic machinery a shambles. Trying to shrink the bloated state, Mrs. Chamorro's Government has left more than half of all Nicaraguans with little or no work. Most of those still salaried earn less than $50 a month.
Foreign economists say any recovery will take not only severe austerity but heavy private investment and great generosity from abroad. With the United States threatening to cut off $98 million in aid out of frustration with the Sandinistas' continuing power, and with growing concern that some Nicaraguan officials may have aided terrorists, potential investors, already skittish, are said to be stepping back. The question, then, is how much more turmoil Nicaragua can afford.

HEADLINE: Conversations: Robert M. Kimmitt;
An Envoy Departs Germany Upbeat Despite All the Sturm und Drang

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
THE Bush Administration sent Robert M. Kimmitt to be the United States' Ambassador in Bonn two years ago, but he has only just left the post because it took the Clinton Administration until this summer to name his successor -- Richard Holbrooke, who hasn't yet been confirmed by the Senate.
Mr. Kimmitt, a West Point graduate and ex-Army officer who spent most of his teen-age years in Germany growing up in a military family, has seen German euphoria over reunification turn to deep disillusionment as the economy has faltered and right-wing violence against foreign asylum-seekers has flared alarmingly. 
 But in a talk in the Ambassador's office on the Rhine before he left, Mr. Kimmitt made clear that he did not share many Germans' gloom over the future, nor the doubts of many people around the world about whether the demons of the German past have been exorcised after all.
"I don't think we're in Weimar again," he said as barges laden with coal and industrial products chugged past outside. "Democracy in my view is firmly rooted here."
Nevertheless, he acknowledged, he had felt shock and dismay at the upsurge in violence against foreigners that began a year ago in the eastern city of Rostock and has continued undiminished so far this year despite a crackdown on neo-Nazi parties by the German police and prosecutors.
"It must be clear to all right now that violence is a national concern," he said. Unlike many German critics of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who faulted him for not speaking out more strongly after the worst violence and charged him with trying to play to right-wing voters, Mr. Kimmitt diplomatically said he believed the Chancellor and other officials reacted properly for the most part.
"I have always been skeptical of the notion that there is some inherent anti-foreigner bias here in Germany," he went on. "On the day in 1989 when the Berlin wall fell, there were already over five million foreigners living in Germany. That number has risen sharply since unification. One million foreigners arrived in Germany in 1992 alone -- 70 percent of all migration into Europe, including nearly 450,000 asylum applicants, 250,000 Yugoslav refugees, 150,000 ethnic Germans claiming the right of return, and roughly 100,000 illegal immigrants.
 
Third Postwar Period
 "Yet Germany has at most 25 percent of the European Community's population and 20 percent of the total European population," he said. "I think Germany is prepared, as they've shown in the case of Yugoslav refugees, to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of migration in Europe, but whether it's fair to ask them to take three times as many people on a per capita basis as other countries raises to me a number of questions. This is a country that had enough challenges internally, and I think they're shouldering this additional challenge quite well."
Though the Germans changed their asylum law this year to keep more people out, they still have regulations that are as liberal as any in Europe, he said, adding that extremist right-wing political parties were insignificant, not on the rise. He said he expected that as the economic situation improved, the violence would eventually be quelled by the recent introduction of better and more efficient police methods.
After Rostock and subsequent incidents showed that there was disproportionately more violence against foreigners in the formerly communist east than in the western part of the country, he said, he was particularly insistent on reminding the people in the east that it was their peaceful mass demonstrations in the streets that had brought down communism. "My point to them was: Don't let the thugs and ruffians take those streets back from you," he said.
As for how long it would take the east to find prosperity, the Ambassador said, "The initial thought that we could see a tremendous turnaround in three to five years is now recognized by all the people as being too optimistic. It's going to take seven to 10 at least before some sort of parity exists. But the success of unification is only a question of when, not whether."
Mr. Kimmitt is a lawyer by training who served on the National Security Council staff at the White House from 1978 to 1985, first as an Army officer and later as a civilian; later, he was Under Secretary for Political Affairs when James A. Baker 3d was Secretary of State. He views Germany's present troubles in the perspective of history.
"I really do think we are in a third postwar period, in both Germany and Europe," he said. "My feeling is that they face a number of challenges, particularly over the next 18 months, but I think that they are now coming to grips with those problems."
Over the next year and a half, he said, he expects some "difficult transitions" -- for instance, painful cuts in social welfare programs the German Government plans to make in coming years to bring down public-sector debt. This swelled to $140 billion this year, 7.5 percent of gross national product, because of the recession and the huge costs of unification.
Germany is also finding it hard to come to grips with all the implications of the full sovereignty it won with unification. It would like a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, for example, but it also protests that its history and its special situation should exempt it from contributing to peace forces that could be involved in combat.
"We would expect that Germany should be in a position to discharge its obligations to multilateral organizations of which it's a member, whether that be NATO, the U.N., or something else," Mr. Kimmitt said, adding that the United States should consider Germany as its most important European ally.
"No bilateral relationship in the world, and certainly not in Europe, is more important than the U.S.-German relationship," he said. "To a considerable degree, as goes Germany, so goes Europe"
He said the United States has learned the hard way that it turns its back on Europe at its own peril. "We made an absolutely wrong set of decisions after World War I, returning home and turning isolationist and protectionist," he said. "And these decisions contributed to the Great Depression and the Second World War."
 
'Europe Whole and Free'
 Now, he said, "Our strategic interest here is to insure a Europe whole and free in the long term, and in the near term, a Europe that goes through this period of transformation in as peaceful a manner as possible."
But Mr. Kimmitt said that with only 100,000 American uniformed personnel likely to remain in Europe after 1995 -- a third of the number here in 1989 -- Germany's relationship with the United States, which has already lost the pupil-teacher character it had during the first years of postwar occupation, is bound to keep changing.
He said that in the future, private contacts, exchanges and business relations would be more important than the American military presence. Increased German investment in the United States will also produce more jobs for Americans, he said.
Mr. Kimmitt plans to work for that as an investment banker or lawyer in Washington. Explaining his optimism, he points to the prevailing German attitude: "There's a very quiet determination to succeed."

HEADLINE: At Riot's Epicenter, Housing Market Is Thriving

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4

 BODY:
It is only a few minutes' walk from the infamous corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central Los Angeles, where last year's racial disorders started, to the two-bedroom green bungalow Estella and Jose Otero recently bought as their first home.
But to Mr. Otero, a 30-year-old immigrant from Honduras, the house behind a waist-high cyclone fence and a big ficus tree on quiet West 69th Street is the ideal place to raise his two little children. "I got my American dream already," he said with a broad smile in halting English. 
 The Oteros help explain what might seem the oddest paradox in troubled Southern California: Even as a punishing recession has devastated real-estate prices in such affluent districts as West Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades and Malibu, the housing market remains comparatively strong in the poorest parts of the region: South-Central Los Angeles, Compton, East Los Angeles and other mostly black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
The reasons speak volumes about the complex social topography here. They have to do with the huge demand for affordable housing by working-class families, with the heavy influx of Hispanic immigrants in recent years and with an underlying stability that is at odds with the headlines about murderous gangs and drugs.
 
Prices Rose in Poor Areas
 According to a recent study by the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles, the median price of homes dropped by as much as 51 percent in richer areas of Southern California between the first quarter of 1990, when the recession started, and the first quarter of this year. For example, prices were down by 37 percent in Santa Monica, where even two-bedroom cottages were fetching $700,000 at the height of the superheated California boom.
But over the same period, the study found, prices increased in poorer urban neighborhoods, by 62 percent in heavily Mexican parts of East Los Angeles and by 43 percent in the ZIP code 90062, which includes some of the worst riot damage in South-Central Los Angeles and where one can still buy a three-bedroom house on a plot of land with a clump of orange trees for less than $150,000.
Brokers who work these areas say that the market has slowed in recent months as the recession deepens here and foreclosures mount. Even so, they say, prices have remained fairly steady, or dropped only slightly, because most of the people who live in the South-Central neighborhood have few other choices if they want to buy. And they are seeking basic shelter, not status symbols; not having inflated like prices in richer areas, prices did not have as far to fall.
"These are first-time buyers; they are buying out of necessity," said Ted Brass, a broker with the Service Company, a Century 21 affiliate in Inglewood, who sells homes mostly in black and Hispanic areas. "We are not talking about people moving up to a 4,000- square-foot house with a pool in Bel Air."
Helping to drive the market is a new infusion of loan money by banks that had tended to ignore the area before the disorders, low interest rates and higher loan limits for Government insured loans.
 
Growing Hispanic Clout
 But probably the the most powerful leavening force has been the growing economic clout of Hispanic families, who are increasingly replacing black residents. Nearly all brokerages serving the area have hired Spanish-speaking agents and advertise in Spanish-language newspapers. "Latinos are willing to buy," said LeFrancis Arnold of Arrow Realty, who is black. "They are good for the market and the community because they've brought in homeownership. During the last recession, you could not give property away in Compton. Now there is a high demand created by Latinos."
Norma Patton, a loan officer with the Funders Mortgage Corporation, said the Hispanic buyers often come up with down payments through "family clubs" that pool resources. Lenders, she said, often bend verification rules for Hispanic buyers who tend to shun banks and often come up with thick wads of what she called "mattress money" for their down payments.
Fairly typical of such first-time buyers are Estella and Jose Otero. She came from El Salvador 20 years ago, and works as an office clerk at a gym; he came from Honduras 10 years ago and is employed as a punch-press operator. Until last February they lived in a second-floor rented apartment near downtown Los Angeles that had become increasingly cramped with two youngsters, Ashley, 5, and Jason, 3.
For five years they saved their money and finally started to search for a house of their own. That search led them to the notorious Florence and Normandie area, which, despite its reputation, is coursed with quiet side streets of modest, well-kept owner-occupied homes, mostly by blacks. Before buying, Mr. Otero came every night and looked around until midnight.
"I saw it was a quiet neighborhood, very friendly," he said. "When we moved in, the black neighbors came to my house and gave me their phone numbers. They said, 'We protect each other.' They are very happy with us. We do not make any noise." The Oteros paid $120,000 for the two-bedroom, one- bath house, which may seem like a lot in the Midwest, but is cheap in California.
 
Fleeing Gang Warfare
 The other side of this coin is that homeownership is diminishing for younger blacks in the area. "When I sell my house, it will probably be bought by Hispanics," said Cleve Freeman, a black man who is the neighborhood block captain on West 75th Street near Crenshaw Boulevard and a veteran employee of the Southern California Gas Company.
Still, many of the more stable pockets of the South-Central neighborhood are considered havens by black families fleeing the gang warfare of the projects. And that is what drew Sharon Robinson, a home health aide and single mother of two, to West 75th Street. In July, she bought an 11-room Spanish-style stucco house for $250,000, just down the street from Mr. Freeman's well-kept bungalow behind a new cactus garden.
Before, she said, she lived in a more dangerous area farther south, where one could "stick your hand out" and touch a gangster. She feared for her 13 year-old son, DeLorean.
Still, like everywhere else in the South-Central area, 75th Street is not far from danger. The houses are mostly well kept, landscaped with oleander and bougainvillea. But there is a sometime crack house nearby, and drug dealing in the alley behind Crenshaw Boulevard, a commercial thoroughfare that suffered considerable damage in the riots.
Constantly vigilant, Mr. Freeman and his neighbors -- who include police officers, teachers and a real-estate broker -- keep a sharp eye out for trouble. They take turns trimming the foliage in front of the one vacant house, and there is seldom a burglary. "I feel safe here," said Ms. Robinson.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Campaign for Free-Trade Agreement Creates Capital's New Power Couple

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Maybe it was the August blue moon, but romance and policy making, it seems, are suddenly in convergence.
Representative Bill Paxon proposed on the House floor last month to a fellow New York Republican, Representative Susan Molinari. (She accepted.) Senator Bob Dole this summer filibustered a national service plan backed by his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the president of the American Red Cross. Mary Matalin, the political director of the Bush Presidential campaign, announced her engagement to Bill Clinton's chief campaign strategist, James Carville, during her cable television talk show a couple of weeks ago. 
 But aside from the Clintons, no political couple may be so prominent this autumn as Doris O. Matsui and her husband, Representative Robert T. Matsui. They have emerged as the season's hot couple because they are campaigning from opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue for the latest hot issue, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mrs. Matsui is a White House deputy director of public liaison in charge of rallying grass-roots support for the accord. She must figure out how to explain to business groups and the public why they should love the agreement, which, if approved by the House and the Senate, will gradually eliminate trade and investment barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States.
 
Division in House
 Mr. Matsui, a California Democrat, is the chairman of the House Nafta Liaison Group, a bipartisan coalition of 30 legislators who favor the deal. The liaison group has become important because the 60 Democratic whips whose job it is to round up votes in the House on important legislation are deeply divided on the issue, while Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the chief Democratic whip, is using the staff, computers and other resources of the whip's office against the agreement.
Mr. Matsui is now trying to create a new whip organization from scratch, turning the liaison group into a team that can count votes accurately and put pressure on wavering members when the final House vote comes, most likely in early December. "You basically pick like-minded people" for the group, he said. "This is really going to be a member-to-member operation."
Seven years ago, Mr. Matsui set up a similar temporary whip organization for Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to push an overhaul of the tax laws through Congress, when the Democratic leadership was similarly fractured.
The Matsuis' campaign this year is already producing some odd coincidences. When 100 top retailing executives came to Washington several weeks ago to lobby for the agreement, for example, they headed first to the White House for a pep talk from Mrs. Matsui, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative.
 
'Tag-Team Effort'
 Two hours later, the same executives attended a lunch on Capitol Hill before fanning out to lobby senators and representatives from 20 states. The speaker at the lunch was Mr. Matsui.
"It was really a tag-team effort" by the couple, said Robin W. Lanier, the lobbyist who arranged the executives' visit.
The Matsuis' link has also proved a little awkward at times. During the spring and summer, Mr. Matsui occasionally criticized the Administration and business leaders for not taking the political risk of pushing the agreement more aggressively.
Mr. Matsui said on Thursday that he was now satisfied with the White House's current efforts, which will expand further in coming weeks.
The Matsuis and the Administration say the agreement would create American jobs by eliminating Mexico's barriers to American exports. Opponents contend it would move jobs and polluting factories to Mexico, where wages are low and enforcement of environmental laws is lax.
 
Groups Opposing Accord
 Mr. Matsui's outspoken advocacy of the agreement has won no friends in several traditional Democratic constituencies, including labor, environmental and consumer groups that are opposing the agreement.
"Matsui sounds more and more like a Republican, and he's carrying water for the corporations that are pushing the same deregulation agenda that the Republicans are," said Craig A. Merrilees, the director of the California Fair Trade Campaign.
The free-trade agreement's opponents have threatened to unseat some representatives if they vote for the accord. But Mr. Matsui has received no such threats because the redrawing of Congressional districts after the 1990 census left him representing downtown Sacramento, where only 23 percent of the voters are registered Republicans.
"He has one of the safest districts in the state, and that makes it difficult to oust him -- much as I'd like to," said Craig K. Powell, chairman of the Sacramento County Republican Party.
Mr. Powell said any serious threat to Mr. Matsui could only come in a Democratic primary. But the free-trade agreement has stirred limited interest among Sacramento's government workers, who would be less affected than manufacturing workers, while labor unions are generally less influential in California than in other states.
Environmentalists also tend to be weaker in Sacramento than along California's coast, said Bruce E. Cain, associate director of the Institute for Government Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
 
An Advantage Is Seen
 Opponents of the agreement warn that the Matsui marriage may give the Administration a small edge in coordinating its push for Congressional approval.
"It's to their advantage," Mr. Bonior said. "They're lovely people and I wish them all the bad luck in the world on this issue. It's probably not a great help, but they talk, they share information."
Yet in a town where people spend hours at dinner parties discussing the political arithmetic and economics of trade agreements, the Matsuis are not sure they have an advantage at all.
Sitting next to each other at home on a love seat, they already sound a little weary of the issue. "After doing what we do during the day, most of the time we don't talk about it because we're so tired of it," Mr. Matsui said.
The Matsui marriage is nonetheless becoming a favorite subject of gossip in Washington trade circles. Few ethical questions have been raised.
A former ethics official in the Bush Administration said the Matsuis did not appear to violate any Federal laws because neither of them had a financial stake in the agreement's fate. "There's no private interest here," the official said.
Charles R. E. Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a research group here, said the Matsuis were unusual because "normally with these spousal things, they rarely work on the same issue."
But Mr. Lewis, an outspoken critic of the Mexican Government's lavish lobbying on behalf of the deal, said the arrangement did not create an image problem. "There are a lot of things I object to, but this probably isn't one of them," he said.
 
Lobbying Effort
 The White House is assembling an interagency group to try to persuade Congress to approve the agreement this fall. William M. Daley, named by President Clinton on Aug. 19 to lead the group seeking passage, said he saw no problems in the Matsui combination and did not foresee any need to move Mrs. Matsui to another issue.
"If they don't see that as a problem, I don't -- she's very talented," Mr. Daley said.
For Mrs. Matsui, who has served on community service organization boards for many years, the current struggle offers a chance to emerge as a Democratic political operative in her own right. For Mr. Matsui, House passage of the agreement could propel him a long way toward eventually becoming chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a job now held by his mentor, Mr. Rostenkowski.
Mr. Matsui is the committee's eighth-ranking Democrat now, but at 51 years old he is a decade younger than most of the members ahead of him. While he refuses to discuss his political future, he acknowledges that the issue "gives me a visibility that I did not have or would not have had on this committee."
The Matsuis have faced a difficult battle this year, with scant support until recently from President Clinton. Opponents and defenders alike predict the Senate will approve the agreement, but a splintered House Democratic Caucus has cast the future of the accord in doubt.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, leans toward supporting the agreement but said two weeks ago that the chamber's Democratic leadership was too divided to set a party line on the vote. The majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the second-ranking Democrat, leans toward opposing the agreement. Last month, he vehemently criticized it and the accompanying labor and environmental side agreements.
Mr. Bonior, the third-ranking Democrat, has emerged as the agreement's most senior Democratic opponent. "I feel very strongly that this is not in the interest of workers, either American or Mexican workers," he said.
 
Similarity of Views
 Yet, after 26 years of marriage, the Matsuis seem well matched for an uphill political struggle, with no policy differences that they can recall. "I'm sure we have differed, but we probably forgot about them," Mrs. Matsui said. "We've been married a long time."
But their new roles have exposed a few differences on political tactics. Asked about the Administration's priorities this fall, Mrs. Matsui started with health care, mentioning that all 15 employees of the White House public liaison office would be working on the issue this fall.
Mr. Matsui quickly leaned forward on the love seat, unable to contain himself. Interrupting his wife with a gesture, he complained to a visitor, "I can't even get her to say she'll make Nafta No. 1!"

HEADLINE: Senator Breaks With Clinton on Trade Pact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
In an uncommon break with President Clinton, Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania said today that he would oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement, adding that he had concluded it could damage his state's shaky economy.
In an interview, Mr. Wofford, a freshman Democrat, said that his state had lost thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs in recent years and that under the trade agreement the enticement of low-cost labor in Mexico could mean more lost employment for the United States. 
 "To add to the loss of jobs at this time, even for some long-range strategy is wrong," Mr. Wofford said, adding that it was "a bad time to take a risk like this, a short-term risk for long-term hopes."
Mr. Clinton, who plans to present the 2,000-page trade package to Congress on Sept. 14, has described it as a gateway to new markets that would enhance the American economy. Over 15 years, the agreement would phase out most barriers to the movement of goods, services and investment among the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Senator Wofford, who has strong ties to labor groups opposed to the deal, said the risk of job losses was especially troubling because of his state's lackluster economic recovery. Pennsylvania's unemployment rate was 7.5 percent in August, nearly a percentage point above the national average.
Union leaders have argued that if the trade agreement is adopted, American firms could be inclined to move to Mexico, where labor can cost as little as $1.15 an hour. They also fear that companies could use a threat to move to extract concessions from unions.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls Packed Agenda 'One Goal'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Responding to criticism that he is trying to do too much at once, President Clinton said today that the proposals he planned to send Congress this month to overhaul the nation's health care system, remove trade barriers within North America and make the Federal bureaucracy more efficient were aimed at the same target, a stronger economy.
"Health security, expanded trade and reinventing government really aren't separate goals," the President said in his weekly radio address. "They are part of a comprehensive strategy to promote long-term growth, increased incomes, more jobs and a stronger American community." 
 Congress and the public are not used to the pace with which Mr. Clinton plans to tackle these issues.
 
Waiting in Wings
 On Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore will release the Administration's recommendations for streamlining the bureaucracy. The next week, the White House plans to begin its drive to win Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And the week after that, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to present his health care proposals.
Many politicians have questioned whether so many important measures can be absorbed at the same time.
In his radio address, Mr. Clinton appealed to his listeners to think of the relationship between the issues facing the Government in terms of the way their families deal with important matters.
"In our own lives," he said, "we understand that we often have to do several things to reach one goal. Think about the talk at your kitchen table, when you discuss the challenges facing your own families. You might be talking about whether you can afford to buy a home or send your youngest child to college or whether to build a new business of your own or go to night school to learn a new skill. Of course, these are separate questions, but they all add up to one challenge -- building a better life for you and your family."
 
Mention of Labor
 The President continued: "It's the same with building our country's future. These pieces must all fit together. To control the deficit, we have to reform health care and give families more security. To create new jobs for our workers, we have to open new markets for our companies and our products. And for government to be a help and not a hindrance in economic growth, we must make it less bureaucratic and more productive."
Mr. Clinton concluded his address by stressing his view that "a free society needs a strong and vibrant labor movement."
The President's relationship with organized labor is particularly strained this Labor Day weekend. On the one hand, he needs the unions' support to get his health care plan enacted. On the other hand, the labor movement is leading the opposition to the trade pact.

HEADLINE: Giving Aliens New $10 Bills Loses U.S. Subsidy as 'Art'

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4

 BODY:
In the face of ridicule from its critics, the National Endowment for the Arts has withdrawn its backing from a project in which three conceptual artists hand out $10 bills to illegal immigrants near the Mexican border.
Noting that United States currency is neither supplies nor materials as specified in the grant to the sponsoring museum in San Diego, the endowment announced late Friday that the $4,500 in cash handouts was an "unallowable expense." 
 One of the artists, Elizabeth Sisco, was quick to respond today, saying the decision was politically motivated and accusing the endowment of creating a fictional list of artistic materials that excludes cash.
"The $10 bills are the materials of the project," Ms. Sisco said. "The conceptual network we have created showing the link between all taxpayers relies upon those $10 bills. They are like the bucket of paint that a muralist would go out and purchase, like the slab of bronze a sculptor would use."
Josh Dare, a spokesman for the endowment, responded, "We don't have a listing of supplies and/or materials; nor do we have a definition of supplies and/or materials." But, he added, "We do not consider United States currency a supply or material."
He also said, "This decision was made outside of the political climate and does not have anything to do with the controversial nature of the project."
 
Crisp New $10 Bills
 The project, called "Arte-Reembolso/Art Rebate," is being carried out by Ms. Sisco, Louis Hock and David Avalos and involves handouts of crisp new $10 bills to illegal aliens, generally day laborers, just north of the Mexican border.
The artists say it is intended to demonstrate that these immigrants, who are coming under political attack as a burden on the economy, do, in fact, contribute through their labor and through sales taxes. The project also shows, the artists say, that the immigrants are linked through a chain of dollars with the rest of the economy.
The project received a $5,000 grant this year from the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, as part of an exhibition called "La Frontera/The Border." The artists spent $500 of that on supplies including formal receipts signed by the immigrants, an expense that the endowment did not challenge.
"The Border" is, in turn, part of a four-year project called "Dos Ciudades/Two Cities," which received a $250,000 grant from the Federal endowment. That grant was to be matched by $750,000 from other donors including the State of California, the city of San Diego and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Thus, in principle, just one-fourth of the artists' giveaways come from Federal money. Mr. Dare noted that nevertheless it was only the endowment, a longstanding lightning rod for conservative critics, that had drawn criticism.
Hugh Davies, director of the museum, said today that he stood by the artists and would not ask for any money back or interfere with the one remaining handout of money that they plan.
"We just can't use N.E.A. money for that part of the project," he said. "It means we'll have to do some budget shifting."
 
Scrutiny for the Endowment
 He said he regretted that the dispute arose at a politically sensitive time, diverting attention from the project's focus on immigration issues to questions about the endowment itself.
"It was never our intention of jamming the N.E.A.," he said. "It's regrettable that the N.E.A. is under such microscopic scrutiny. I know of no other agency that is under such scrutiny."
Confirmation hearings are scheduled this month for President Clinton's nominee to head the endowment, the actress Jane Alexander. And Art Rebate is looming as a focus for Congressional critics.
Mr. Dare said that although the agency's review of the financing for the project was routine, it had been accelerated by criticism raised in recent weeks.
A chief critic was Representative Randy (Duke) Cunningham, a Republican from San Diego, who taunted the agency in a series of letters, calling the handouts a "contemptuous use of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars."
In a letter last month to Ana M. Steele, the acting chairwoman of the endowment, he wrote, "Americans will not long support Government funding for the arts if those funds are known to be converted to cash, then handed out to illegal aliens."
Mr. Davies, the museum's director, said: "We believe we have done nothing wrong. We do not intend to back away from that position."
He said he believed that the endowment's decision "could have been politically motivated by people who want to destroy the N.E.A." He added, "It is unfortunate that people like Duke Cunningham can intimidate artists' freedom of expression."
 
'Looked for a Technicality'
 Ms. Sisco did not appear to be intimidated today.
She said the artists planned to hand out the last of their $10 bills and then begin a series of exhibits of the receipts and other documents from their project.
"The N.E.A. is operating on a tactic of political expediency to get through the confirmation, reauthorization and reappropriation," she said. "They looked for a technicality to get that money returned. Their decision throws into question their ability to provide leadership for the arts at the turn of the century."
Mr. Dare made a point of praising the museum and called the overall enterprise paid for by the endowment "an exemplary project."
Speaking in what he said was his personal capacity, he also gave a nod of admiration to Ms. Sisco and her two colleagues.
"Those three artists are very good at, and I give them credit for, choosing art to create public dialogues," he said. "If art is supposed to create discussion and dialogue about the issues of the day, then touche."

HEADLINE: Against All Odds, France Likes Its Premier

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 3

 BODY:
It is the sort of case to put political pundits out of work. France's economy is in the doldrums, unemployment is still growing and relations with Germany, the country's main ally, are in disarray. Yet Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's popularity continues to rise.
The presumption was that by now, after five months as head of France's new conservative Government, Mr. Balladur's economic recovery program would have to be showing results or the 64-year-old Gaullist could expect disenchantment to be setting in. 
 Instead, while the economy remains in recession, polls show that Mr. Balladur is the public's strong favorite to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in the May 1995 elections -- preferred not only over the likely Socialist contenders, but over his own party's official candidate, Jacques Chirac.
Polling experts say they have to go back to 1970 and Jacques Chaban-Delmas to find a Prime Minister who was more popular after five months in office. After one month in his job, "satisfaction" with Mr. Balladur stood at 56 percent; today, it is 61 percent, the polls say.
Yet so many things have gone wrong for him. Not only has the economy not responded to his prodding but, having pledged to defend the French currency as a matter of national honor, Mr. Balladur was forced to see the franc devalued -- the euphemism was "flotation" -- last month.
This in turn led to a crisis in relations with Germany -- high German interest rates were blamed for undermining the franc -- that has now expanded to include a squabble over French opposition to a farm trade agreement between the Europe and the United States that Germany supports.
At home, where he faces a huge budget deficit, Mr. Balladur has raised taxes, frozen social security benefits, increased the amount that patients must pay for medicine, trimmed state pensions and increased from 37.5 to 40 the number of years the French must work to be eligible for a full pension.
He has also had the embarrassment of seeing two of his principal initiatives -- to make the country's central bank fully autonomous and to restrict the rights of third-world immigrants and political refugees -- partly vetoed by the Constitutional Court.
His conservative backers have in turn been annoyed by his decision to manage a smooth "cohabitation" with the country's Socialist President, avoiding the open wrangling that disrupted Mr. Mitterrand's last cohabitation between 1986 and 1988, when Mr. Chirac was Prime Minister.
The arrangement has even boosted Mr. Mitterrand's own popularity, so much so that Alain Duhamel, a political commentator, has noted that the President should now be able to end his second seven-year term "with dignity," something that seemed improbable a few months ago.
So what is Mr. Balladur's secret? Experts attribute his success to his personal style of government -- calm, direct, modest, self-confident and somewhat aloof.
It is this very presidential manner that has turned Mr. Balladur into such a strong presidential contender should he choose to oppose Mr. Chirac, the man who nominated him to be Prime Minister after the conservatives swept the Socialists from power last March.
Mr. Chirac, who is Mayor of Paris and who until five months ago looked set to enter the Elysee Palace in 1995, has good reason to be nervous. A series of recent polls showed that while Mr. Chirac would narrowly defeat both possible Socialist candidates if a presidential election were held now, Mr. Balladur would do so by a wide margin.
The Ipsos poll said Mr. Chirac would beat both former Prime Minister Michel Rocard and Jacques Delors, the head of the European Community's executive commission, by 52 percent to 48 percent. But Mr. Balladur would defeat Mr. Rocard by 69 to 31 percent and Mr. Delors by 67 to 33 percent.
Pundits of course continue to predict that unless the economy bounces back in the coming months, Mr. Balladur's appeal will inevitably fade. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself has often anticipated that "painful" economic measures would soon end the honeymoon. So far, he too has been wrong.

HEADLINE: Volleying Over Queens Tennis Center Deal

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD

 BODY:
In recent weeks, Rudolph W. Giuliani has used the proposed expansion of the United States Tennis Center to chide Mayor David N. Dinkins about his fondness for the sport but also to question whether the city got a good deal in its agreement with the United States Tennis Association.
The U.S.T.A. moved the tournament from Forest Hills to the center, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in 1978. Tennis officials say the size of 20,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, a shortage of practice courts, tight parking and limited space for walking reduce the opportunities for growth of the event, one of the top four international tennis tournaments. 
 The tennis association wants to more than double the size of the National Tennis Center site, to about 47 acres. A 23,500-seat stadium would be built, and two others, including Louis Armstrong, would be renovated and downsized.
The new site would have 47 tennis courts, eight more than it now has. Eleven courts would be available free for holders of city parks tennis permits, which cost $50.
The lease would be for 25 years, with options that could lengthen it to 99 years. The association would initially pay the city $400,000 a year base rent, up from $280,000, and 1 percent of all revenues over $25 million. The association's revenues this year are projected at $70 million. The association also would pay $8 million into a trust fund for Flushing Meadow-Corona Park, and expand its public tennis programs.
 
City Would Be the Owner
 The Dinkins administration supports the plan because the city would own the site even though the $172 million expansion would be paid for, operated and maintained by the tennis association. The city also would share in the U.S.T.A.'s revenues, which have increased by at least 13 percent annually for several years.
The city also would retain the prestige of hosting the U.S. Open, gaining what it says would be about $131 million a year in economic benefits, and have state-of-the-art tennis courts available to the general public for the 10 months a year it is not used for tournaments.
The city would allow the tennis association to finance the project through tax-exempt Industrial Development Agency bonds. The city also has agreed to make $11 million in road improvements around the park, which it says are needed anyway.
The most controversial part of the agreement is a provision penalizing the city up to $325,000 if there are excessive flyovers from LaGuardia Airport during the Open.
Critics, like Councilman John D. Sabini of Queens, think it is wrong that the city could be financially penalized for something that is under Federal, not city jurisdiction. They also have questioned whether the agreement might prompt others -- like the Mets, who play in Shea Stadium, adjacent to the tennis center -- to ask for the same consideration.

HEADLINE: A Paternalistic Employer Bids a Generous Farewell

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Sept. 1

 BODY:
For someone who has joined the nation's downtrodden mass of unemployed executives, James E. Smith was surprisingly upbeat as he sat in the waiting room of a job training center for workers laid off by the International Business Machines Corporation.
At 57 years old, Mr. Smith is a consummate "I.B.M.-er." He spent 27 years rising through the company's hierarchy, and, for most of the last decade, he traveled the globe to coordinate software development projects in Australia, India, Singapore and Europe. 
 That made his fall to the Poughkeepsie waiting room particularly hard. He was one of 7,700 I.B.M. workers who were forced out of the company, mostly through layoffs here and in Kingston and in East Fishkill, the towns strung along the Hudson River north of New York City that are the largest manufacturing center for a company that remains the world's largest computer maker.
"In a way, I'm lucky," said Mr. Smith, whose severance package includes a full year's pay and medical benefits, and who is now considering career options that have little to do with computers. He said he might return to college to study foreign languages, or become a travel agent, tax preparer or paralegal.
"I am interested in an avocation and not just a job," he said. "This could be a golden opportunity."
If Mr. Smith seems remarkably at ease for a man who is out of work, he has good reason. Although I.B.M. is far from unique among American manufacturers that have been shedding workers, for decades it has ranked among the nation's most paternalistic employers. And now, even for those forced to leave the company, I.B.M. stands as a bastion of corporate support.
 
$100,000 Per Worker
 Industry analysts say the benefit packages received by the former workers, including severance pay, medical insurance, and help in finding new jobs, are costing the company an average of $100,000 per worker, and stand out as the most generous of any large company.
"I.B.M.'s problems are far from unique, but its generosity in offering service to its people is incredible," said Camille Primm, manager of a career counseling center in Kingston that I.B.M. hired to provide its former workers with newspaper help-wanted ads from around the country and computerized job listings, help in writing resumes and coaching for job interviews.
But the depth of the generosity has its limits. In July, with its mainframe computer business continuing to lose ground to competitors who concentrate on personal computers, I.B.M. said it would eliminate another 35,000 jobs from its global work force by the end of 1994. With the company struggling to cut costs, it said the severance pay and medical benefits it would offer to those workers would be sharply reduced.
The company's problems are certain to create more hardship in the Hudson Valley, where I.B.M. still employs 13,800 people. And for now, according to those who were pushed out in the first round of job cuts, even the extraordinary company benefits are doing little to avert the need for sharp, sometimes painful, career changes.
 
'What Do We Do Next?'
 "The company is obviously trying to help," said Kenneth Franklin, 46, who was laid off in May after 25 years. "The question now is, 'What do we do next?' "
In Mr. Franklin's case, the question looms particularly large. On the same day that he received notice of his layoff from I.B.M.'s Poughkeepsie plant, where he supervised a line devoted to ceramics manufacturing, his wife, Marlene, a line supervisor at the company's semiconductor plant in East Fishkill, was laid off after 19 years.
For most departing I.B.M. workers, the transition started in the spring, soon after they lost their jobs, in the Fishkill office managed by Ms. Primm or two others set up in Poughkeepsie by her employer, Drake Beam Morin, a job counseling and outplacement firm hired by the company.
The counseling firm said that more than half of the 7,700 displaced I.B.M. workers have used its services. In addition to computerized listings of thousands of job openings around the nation, each of the Drake Beam Morin offices offersthe I.B.M.-ers free use of telephones and personal computers.
The firm's counselors also help former workers condense their complex and sometimes highly technical career experiences into concise resumes, and prepare them for interviews. Many of the workers had not applied for jobs in decades.
Ms. Primm said the firm has not attempted to keep track of how many of the Hudson Valley workers have found new jobs. In the Kingston office, where more than 1,000 have sought help, a bulletin board, intended in part to bolster morale, lists 150 names of those who have obtained new jobs, started their own businesses or returned to school.
 
Most Remain Out of Work
 Now, with Drake Beam Morin's six-month contract with I.B.M. about to end, the focus of job assistance is shifting to the Federally funded Employment Training Center opened in downtown Poughkeepsie last month.
There, it was clear this week that most of the dislocated I.B.M.-ers remain out of work.
Those who have found jobs "are the exception," said Wally Libenson, an employment counselor and manager of the new Poughkeepsie center.
"It is obviously an employers market, and these people have to take the initiative," he added.
Mr. Libenson's office, with 16 counselors, is to remain open until at least the end of 1994. Financed under a grant of $6 million from the Labor Department, it is similar to training centers established over the last two years in the New York region for workers laid off by Pan American World Airways and the Pratt & Whitney Company.
Although some job-seekers have been guided into programs in electronics and personal computer repair, Mr. Libenson said the focus of the center is to help the former I.B.M. workers become trained in "demand occupations." High on the list are commercial truck driving, nursing and radiology, rather than such things as plumbing and aviation engineering, which are considered glutted. The Government program is in addition to a company pledge of $2,500 for each employee to help with tuition or training.
 
Expecting to Help 3,000
 So far, 950 displaced workers have sought assistance from the center, and Mr. Libenson said he expects to help at least 3,000.
Mr. Franklin, one of those attending a recent counseling session, said his wife had already taken advantage of the combined job training benefits from I.B.M. and the government. She will begin classes in bookkeeping here next week at Dutchess County Community College, with her tuition covered.
That has left Mr. Franklin at home, responsible for the care of the couple's daughter. But beginning next year, he said, if a new job has not materialized, he too plans to seek retraining. Among his interests are medical and pharmacological technology.
"Of course, I'd love to get back into a job like I had at I.B.M.," he said. "But things like that just don't come around."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Faults Dinkins on Economic Issues

 BODY:
Standing in a steady rain and citing Federal labor statistics showing New York City lagging economically behind the rest of the country, Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday faulted Mayor David N. Dinkins for sidestepping questions about the budget, saying he hopes to draw attention away from the city's poor economic performance.
"It's a city in which job losses are going up and a campaign for Mayor in which the Mayor's fund-raising seems to have dried up," he said in a reference to a report showing Mayor David N. Dinkins lagging behind Mr. Giuliani in fund-raising. 
 Drawing an analogy to the management of the city's budget, Mr. Giuliani suggested, "It's kind of interesting that in August he spent more money than he raised, which is about the way he runs the City of New York."
Meeting with reporters during a campaign stop in Brooklyn, where he was attending a baseball tournament sponsored by the Hispanic-American Sports Coalition, Mr. Giuliani challenged the Mayor to release his long-term budget plan during the campaign. He accused the Mayor of trying to distract voters from "what has been a very bad day" because of the new economic report and the lackluster fund-raising figures.
He then deflected questions about his retreat from an earlier commitment to exempt from cuts those services involving children, public safety, parks and cultural affairs. Mayor Dinkins had accused the Republican-Liberal candidate of backtracking after Mr. Giuliani was quoted in a television program to be aired today that those services would be part of an overall budget review process.

HEADLINE: Health Care and High Cost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It amazes me that Mr. Baumol has so little understanding of a physician's workday. His underlying assumption is that physicians spend 100 percent of their time delivering patient care. I, as do most primary care physicians, devote part of each day to paperwork. On one frustrating day, I spent one half-hour on the phone arranging a preapproval from an H.M.O. for a polysomnogram. This chore took so long because the H.M.O. employees were not familiar with the test nor with their company's particular requirements for preapproval. 
 In addition, more and more physicians, after having received the great investment from society of four years of medical school and three years of government-subsidized residency training, then go into administrative positions. Thus, there is still a great deal of room for improved physician productivity by reducing the administrative work of an incredibly inefficient medical care system.
President Clinton apparently benefited from a campaign sign on the wall: "It's the economy, stupid." As we begin the legislative process for health care reform, I hope he adopts a new sign, "Keep it simple, stupid."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Paris, for the Few

 BODY:
New Yorkers gush when they roam Paris. The visitor is awed by the user-friendly Metro, the excellent buses and the tidy streets, complete with recycling bins and spotless public toilets. As before, a truly bad meal in Paris is as rare as a tasteless tomato. Granted, Paris has its slums and its homeless, but by comparison with New York, it seems an urban Eden, a metropolis that works.
Still, in some respects a visiting Yank can feel a parochial pride in America's civic democracy. France's Eden has a turnstile. Though exceptions are made for students, pensioners and the press, admission fees at museums are high (up to $7). Even that republican shrine, the Pantheon, burial place of Voltaire, Rousseau and Hugo, costs $5. Imagine the uproar if such a fee were charged at the Lincoln Memorial. 
 That the delights of Paris are not intended for the many is most apparent in the Bois de Boulogne, where birds are more welcome than people. Originally a royal forest, the Bois was presented to the capital by Napoleon III in 1852. But the Bourbon past still pervades its 224 acres, which enclose an exclusive club, pricey restaurants and what is arguably the world's best rose garden.
The garden is in the Bagatelle, an enclosed paradise within the Bois reachable after a hike from a Metro station. Admission is $3, which is fair enough; my wife and I were beguiled by roses still blooming in late August, by the Japanese water garden, and a curious mansion built in three months on a bet by the brother-in-law of Marie Antoinette. But at the one available restaurant, the price for two coffees and an order of toast was $14.
In taking the mile-long walk to the adjoining enclave, Pre Catalan (named after a court minstrel murdered in the reign of Philip IV) we noticed two bus stops, but service was only on Sunday. It was a fine park, boasting a Shakespeare garden (admission $2), and clean public toilets (40 cents). But though we were hungry, we could only stare in wonder at the Pre Catalan restaurant, whose prix fixe menu was 690 francs, or about $120.
Next loomed a line of luxury cars near the entrance of the Racing Club de Paris, whose elegant sports compound is strictly for members. It was as if the New York Athletic Club occupied a corner of Brooklyn's Prospect Park, and offered the only automobile access. A two-mile walk brought us to a Metro stop, and the first visible restaurant within the average visitor's budget.
The difficulty of access, the absence of popular cafes, the admission charges -- all that no doubt discourages visits by trampling hordes, a point rather stiffly made by an English friend in Paris ("How else would you preserve the place?"). But exclusion, especially on economic and class grounds, is hard for an American to accept, and difficult to reconcile with France's avowal of liberty, equality and fraternity.
The explanation may lie in the term "cognitive dissonance," the mental trick of acting on seemingly contradictory beliefs. France is a republic, with a Socialist President, yet it still boasts a titled aristocracy and three pretenders to the throne. Even libertarian Parisians seem to accept the proposition that if you can't afford the Bois de Boulogne, you don't belong there.

HEADLINE: West Can Compete With East in Skilled Labor;
De Facto Maximum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Conversations: Two Economists Catch Clinton's Eye by Bucking the Common Wisdom" (The Week in Review, Aug. 22) shows how precious is a sense of how markets work, and how hopeless for even the best and brightest to try and outsmart them. 
 David Card and Alan Krueger, economists, wondered if there was really an inverse relationship between Government-mandated wage minimums and entry-level employment. So they tracked 400 fast-food restaurants and found that to "raise the minimum a little" in New Jersey brought more teen-agers "out looking for jobs," so that otherwise vacant positions became filled.
Apparently, these two economists ignored everything in the market -- a market being all the ways people interact -- except for the dollar amount of the state minimum wage. They even ignored the question of what happens when no mandated minimum wage exists, and so missed the most interesting result of their own work: If a minimum wage exists, their study seems to show, the managers of fast food restaurants won't pay a nickel more, even if the refusal of teen-agers to work so cheaply results in staff vacancies those managers would prefer to fill.
Perhaps this is because the managers are so required by higher executives, whose policies are under review by directors and shareholders -- who are in turn insulated from the microeconomics of the case. The managers must thus treat any Government minimum as also a de facto maximum wage for entry-level help.
One may readily conclude from this study by Professors Card and Krueger that to raise the pay of teen-agers, while also increasing employment in fast-food restaurants (or at least the ones in their sample), we need simply to abolish the minimum and let each business set entry-level wages at whatever level it believes will result in the most efficient operation.

HEADLINE: Mideast Accord: The Secret Peace/A special report;
How Oslo Helped Mold the Mideast Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 4

 BODY:
At the time, in April 1992, the somewhat gray and academic meeting in Tel Aviv hardly seemed a place where dreams might be built. But if the tentative and potentially momentous new agreement reached by Israel and the P.L.O. could be said to have a birthplace, it was the gathering in Tel Aviv.
 There, Yossi Beilin, then an opposition Labor member of Parliament, got to know Terje Rod Larsen, head of a Norwegian institute researching conditions in the Israeli-occupied territories. If Mr. Beilin wished, Mr. Larsen said, he could put him in touch with senior Palestinian officials. 
The Israeli did not leap at the opportunity, in part because he had more pressing matters on his mind, like the approaching national election in June. But he was interested enough to ask a university professor friend to keep in touch with the man from Oslo.
 
Norway Takes Secret Role
 By mid-July, the Labor Party was voted into power, Mr. Beilin was Israel's new Deputy Foreign Minister, and Mr. Larsen was back in Jerusalem, renewing his offer. What in April had been an uneventful meeting of policy researchers led directly in September to another gathering in Tel Aviv, where this time a senior Norwegian diplomat proposed to Mr. Beilin that Norway become the secret passage for direct talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership, which is based in Tunis.
 That was the start of the Oslo Connection.
 
A Variety of Sites
 In the months to follow, on elegant country estates and in ordinary hotel rooms, representatives of Israel and the P.L.O., enemies to the death for three decades, met secretly and stitched together a set of principles that is supposed to lead them out of their long struggle. The core of their plan has been known for the last week:
 Assuming that the two sides can get past difficulties that have popped up in the last few days, they will soon formally recognize each other -- something that seemed almost impossible only weeks ago -- and set in motion a shift of authority in the territories from Israel to Palestinians, starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.
 As radical a change as this is, its thunder built gradually. Officials and others interviewed in Israel, Norway and the United States -- knowledgeable P.L.O. officials were not available -- say there was no single turning point, no startling pronouncement that suddenly made it happen.
 Rather than high drama in Norway, participants say, there was a more subtle combination of relaxed settings, home-cooked meals, mutual esteem, a knack for telling the right joke to ease a tense situation and, more important, an ability to keep secrets. "That was the difficult part -- keeping our mouths shut," said Professor Yair Hirschfeld of Haifa University, Mr. Beilin's academic friend and a key go-between from the start.
 No more than a dozen people knew exactly what was going on at all times, participants say. The regular delegations to the Middle East peace talks were kept in the dark. So were local Palestinian leaders and Israeli Cabinet ministers.
 While the Norwegians kept the United States informed almost from the start, the Americans were never actively involved, sticking instead both to the episodic talks in Washington and to their policy of not dealing with the P.L.O. or its chairman, Yasir Arafat.
 In Washington, senior Clinton Administration officials said the United States would be ready to resume its dialogue with the P.L.O. when it met Israel's terms of renouncing terrorism and unequivocally recognizing Israel's right to exist.
 Administration officials said that they would begin sounding out lawmakers on Tuesday about removing the legal barriers to the dialogue, which was broken off in 1990 after a P.L.O. faction's abortive raid on an Israeli beach.
 
The Motivation
On Both Sides, Thirst for Progress
 Perhaps even more critical than tight lips and country homes was the fact that Israel and the P.L.O. both badly wanted their meetings to succeed, each for its own reasons.
 The P.L.O. was in disarray. Mr. Arafat was scrambling to hold onto power, the organization's once-fat bank accounts were drying up, in large measure because of its own political miscalculations, and its loyalists were losing ground fast in the occupied territories to Islamic militants gathered under the banner of Hamas. Mr. Arafat needed a deal that would leave no doubt he was still on top.
 The Israelis were also eager. They had lost faith in the negotiations stumbling along in Washington with Palestinians from the territories who, it became painfully clear, could not deliver the goods. Knowing he would ultimately be judged on whether he fulfilled his campaign promise to come to terms quickly with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin endorsed the secret contacts, even if he was not persuaded they would work and even though, as he said the other day, it meant dealing with enemies he detests.
 In suspending his skepticism, he worked in tandem with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who had become involved in the Norwegian dialogue in early spring and then guided it along until he himself met secretly with a senior P.L.O. official in Norway, capping the talks with a draft agreement initialed on Aug. 20.
 Throughout their political lives, Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres have fought nasty battles for Labor Party supremacy. It is axiomatic among Israelis that anything one of them does is intended at least in part to undercut the other.
 But starting in spring, the two politicians worked closely together, cementing an odd symbiosis that they had formed through the years of rivalry. Mr. Peres, a man with grand ideas but fragile public support, and Mr. Rabin, more of a nuts-and-bolts analyst but also a tough ex-general who can persuade Israelis that he will not sell them out to the Arabs, found that they could not succeed without each other. This time, jealousies shriveled before their task.
 "Look, we're grown-up people," Mr. Peres said this week. "We're not searching anymore for power. We're leading the nation toward the future, to save ourselves from being Balkanized in Israel and the territories, to spare us a Yugoslavia-like situation."
 
The Beginning
From Tel Aviv To London to Oslo
 None of this seemed dimly on the horizon when Mr. Beilin and Mr. Larsen shook hands in Tel Aviv and discussed daily life in Gaza and the West Bank.
 Mr. Larsen is director general of FAFO, the Norwegian Institute for Applied Social Science, which was preparing a report on living conditions in the territories and was looking for Israeli cooperation both in and out of Government. Mr. Beilin, a close Peres associate, was interested in the project but otherwise engaged. He put the Norwegian in touch with Yair Hirschfeld, who teaches Middle East history at Haifa University.
 Right after the elections, Mr. Larsen came back. His focus now, officials say, was not research so much as an attempt to put the new left-leaning Israeli Government in direct touch with senior Palestinians who might be able to reach an agreement that had eluded official delegates in Washington. Again, the Israeli said the Haifa professor was the best contact.
 But he clearly was interested in exploring new possibilities.
 
Norway's No. 2 Envoy
 On Sept. 10, 1992, Mr. Larsen returned once more, bringing with him Norway's No. 2 diplomat, State Secretary Jan Egeland. They sat down with Mr. Beilin and Professor Hirschfeld at the Tel Aviv Hilton. Mr. Egeland's offer was straightforward:
 Norway could be a bridge between Israel and the P.L.O., not as a mediator but as an expediter, one graced with diplomatic sophistication, familiarity with the key figures and distance from the region and prying cameras.
 Not that Norway's relations with Israel had always been smooth. They were especially strained after an Israeli hit squad gunned down a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway, in July 1973. They thought he was an agent of the Arab guerrilla group that killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. They shot the wrong man.
 As an additional sign that the Norwegians meant business, Johan Jorgen Holst, the Defense Minister and seven months later Foreign Minister, supported the idea. By no coincidence, his wife, Marianne Heiberg, was the author of the FAFO study that got these negotiations started.
 Yes, he was intrigued, Mr. Beilin said. Actually, he later told associates, he had no solid reason to believe that this effort could produce anything -- a doubt that would persist for months. And he wanted to be personally removed; it would be politically damaging if word leaked out that he was secretly meeting officials of the outlawed P.L.O. Once again, his point man was Professor Hirschfeld.
 On a December morning, the 49-year-old professor walked into the Gallery Lounge of the modern Forte Crest St. James's hotel in central London. He was to have breakfast with Mr. Larsen.
 But after a brief conversation, the Norwegian slid out of his seat and left the room. In his place sat Ahmed Suleiman Khoury, a senior P.L.O official in charge of finances and better known by the nickname Abu Alaa.
 
'No Blood on His Hands'
 Abu Alaa, a highly educated businessman in his 60's, belonged to Mr. Arafat's Fatah group -- "brilliant and tremendously tough, elegant and polished," as Mr. Larsen described him. To the Israelis, he was an acceptable partner, high-ranking but with "no blood on his hands" as an active participant in anti-Israel terrorism.
 From this first talk, Professor Hirschfeld said, "it was very clear that the P.L.O. felt it had to make moves now, that Hamas was getting stronger in the territories and that the 'outside' people in Tunis felt they had to bring about successful negotiations."
 But he added: "It was an exercise to see if an agreement was possible. It wasn't a negotiation. And they felt the same way on the other side."
 Technically, Professor Hirschfeld was committing a crime at the London hotel. Israeli law prohibited such private contacts with declared terrorist groups, including the P.L.O. But the law was repealed a month later, and officials say that gave extra impetus to the secret discussions.
 On Jan. 20 the Haifa professor and the P.L.O. finance chief moved their talks to Norway, the first of 14 sessions in that country. At the start, Abu Alaa had only an assistant or two. Professor Hirschfeld was accompanied by a colleague, Professor Ron Pundak of Tel Aviv University, who shared the tasks of taking notes, typing papers and making plane reservations because secrecy requirements ruled out secretaries.
 
Residence of Kings
 The first talks were near the town of Sarpsborg, 60 miles east of Oslo, where the Borregard paper company owns a mansion that during the Middle Ages was the summer residence of Norwegian kings. It is a grand estate surrounded by acres of fields and forest -- the perfect place, the Norwegians thought, for the Israelis and Palestinians to take off their jackets and ties, sit in front of the fire and get to know one another.
 And no one else.
 "We told the staff that it was a meeting of eccentric professors who would talk all hours and order up sandwiches at three o'clock in the morning because they were working on a book," Mr. Larsen said. Private cars were used instead of official black limousines to bring them from hotels in Oslo. And Foreign Minister Holst was present, as he would be at all the meetings, not actively joining the discussions but standing by to lend a hand when snags developed.

 
Progress
From Setbacks To Living Together
 They indeed did develop, sometimes in relation to outside events, most times not.
 After Israel had expelled 415 accused extremists to southern Lebanon in mid-December as a response to a series of killings by Hamas, the Washington talks broke down, not to resume for four months. But the Oslo Connection held.
 In March, however, another wave of killings in Israel led to a sealing-off of the territories, and the grim atmosphere spread to Norway. "There was a feeling that we were somewhat lost and couldn't get ahead," Professor Hirschfeld said. But the crisis passed, he added, in part because United States officials who were aware of the contacts since early November had encouraged them to continue.
 At this point, neither Mr. Peres nor Mr. Rabin reportedly was in the picture.
 Yet Abu Alaa and Professor Hirschfeld -- as early as their second Norway session in February -- had already drawn up a draft agreement, what would prove to be the first of many.
 By this point, the concept of linking Gaza and Jericho had been introduced.
 Transferring a limited form of self-rule to Palestinians in Gaza first was no problem for the Israelis. Increasingly, they viewed the overcrowded coastal strip as nothing but a political and financial headache, a seething source of terrorism and a death trap for Israeli soldiers forced to patrol its towns and refugee camps. Give it up, a large majority of Israelis said.
 But to whom?
 For Mr. Arafat, Gaza alone was no prize. If he were to agree to Israel's demand that for now he put aside discussion of Jerusalem's future and the final status of the territories, he wanted more: a foothold in the West Bank to underline the point that the territories are a single unit forming his hoped-for Palestinian state. A Compromise: Jericho
 Small and sleepy Jericho seemed the right place, but it was hardly without problems. For one thing, the Israelis insisted that during an interim self-rule period they remain in control of the bridge links to Jordan. For another, they rejected Palestinian demands for a "corridor" of their own across Israel to connect Gaza and Jericho. Arguments on these and other points would consume another half-year.
 Still, there was a piece of paper, and that was something. "We had mapped out the geography of the Rubicon," Professor Hirschfeld said.
 In March, Mr. Beilin, who himself never went to Norway, decided that he had to take what he knew to Mr. Peres. According to knowledgeable officials, the Foreign Minister expressed interest but was far from overwhelmed. He took several weeks to read the draft.
 It proved to be an important period for Mr. Peres. He has an active mind, and was known to be frustrated by Mr. Rabin's tight personal hold on responsibility for the direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and neighboring Arab nations. If he were to supervise the back-channel talks in Norway and not tell the Prime Minister, it would look to many like another attempt at an end run in the eternal Rabin-Peres rivalry.
 Besides, Mr. Rabin would know something was up from intelligence reports. "Yitzhak is informed twice about every one of Peres's actions," an unidentified Government official told the newspaper Yediot Ahronot this week. "Once, Peres tells him about it, and a little earlier he learns about it from the security services."
 In April, having read the Abu Alaa-Hirschfeld draft, Mr. Peres went to the Prime Minister. Officials say they coordinated their efforts from then on. If anything, they say, Mr. Rabin was more skeptical than the Foreign Minister. Nevertheless, losing patience with the regular Washington channel, he decided the secret talks were worth a try, regardless of his personal feelings about the P.L.O.
 
Bracing for the Pain
 "I am ready for painful compromises," he said this week. "In general, peace is not made with friends. Peace is made with enemies, some of whom -- and I won't name names -- I loathe very much."
 It was also decided in April that the Norway talks had to be raised to an official level. Abu Alaa reportedly had begun to insist on dealing directly with a Government official as a test that Jerusalem meant business and was not engaged merely in an academic exercise.
 The designated official was Uri Savir, recently installed as Foreign Ministry director general, a senior job rarely given to someone so young, only 40. "He's a brilliant diplomat, very charming and also deeply committed to the cause of peace," said Professor Hirschfeld, who remained on the Israeli team throughout.
 Another important addition was Yoel Zinger, an Israeli lawyer who had moved to Washington to join a law firm there. Mr. Zinger was an expert on international law and had drafted agreements that ended Israel's invasion of Lebanon a decade ago. Perhaps as significant, he was an army reserve officer who had Mr. Rabin's respect and trust. Indeed, a knowledgeable official says, it was Mr. Zinger who ultimately persuaded the Prime Minister in early summer "that this was a serious arrangement, that if the other side knew Israel was serious, it could lead to vital concessions."
 From the end of April when Mr. Savir took charge to late August, there were 11 meetings in Norway, with Abu Alaa joined by a P.L.O. legal adviser, Taher Shash.
 These sessions moved from place to place: another country estate, in Grinsheim, near Lillehammer; a labor union hall north of Oslo; several hotels in downtown Oslo, and Foreign Minister Holst's roomy house in Hoff, on the outskirts of the capital.
 
Drinking and Chatting
 In each location, participants say, the key was a relaxed atmosphere. Israelis and Palestinians lived together in the same house for days at a stretch, taking all meals together, drinking and chatting well into the night. At the Holst home, Mrs. Heiberg, the Foreign Minister's wife, served home-cooked meals and Chilean wines.
 "We had to take dietary rules into account," Mr. Holst said, "and we ate a lot of lamb."
 And there were the jokes passed back and forth.
 "They shared a sense of humor," Mr. Larsen said of Abu Alaa and Mr. Savir. "Each time tension rose, it was broken off by some joke or by a cryptic reference to a joke they all understood."
 "It was an informal relationship -- intense, complex, characterized by passionate and silent poetry," he said.
 During the discussions, a form of verbal shorthand developed in which people like Mr. Peres and Mr. Holst were called the fathers, top leaders like Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat became the godfathers, and officials at Mr. Beilin's level were the sons.
 "Has the father talked to the godfather about this?" one would ask.
 "Yes," came the reply. "He told the son yesterday that he would like to have another meeting."
 "We had hundreds of such calls," Mr. Egeland said.
 
Final Issues
The Agreement Is Concluded
 But jokes and shared meals, officials say, did not camouflage the fundamental difficulties involved in hammering out an agreement between two peoples whose mutual suspicions and hatreds had not miraculously disappeared by a Norwegian fireside.
 "All of us were skeptical throughout," Professor Hirschfeld said. "The potential for failure lasted throughout, and there were lots of ups and downs in July."
 He declined to say what they were. But officials say problems remained over control of the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan, the "corridor" issue and a persistent resurfacing of Jerusalem's status, an issue that the Israelis insisted was absolutely not negotiable at this stage.
 
Recognition Is Broached
 During the summer, another issue arose: mutual recognition by Israel and the P.L.O., on condition that the Palestinian group abandon terrorism as a tactic and drop sections of its covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
 With Israeli recognition, the United States is considered likely to resume its talks with the P.L.O. This central issue is apparently one reason that the expected P.L.O. approval of the draft agreement has slowed down in the last few days.
 As the Israeli officials in Norway fielded each of these new problems, they asked for guidance from Jerusalem, where Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres reportedly put together the replies in secrecy. But there was also a perceived need here for "reality checks."
 One such check was a trip to Cairo in June by Nimrod Novick, a close Peres associate. There, he learned of Mr. Arafat's favorable response to the Gaza-Jericho plan through Osama al-Baz, foreign affairs adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
 Another check was a meeting in Cairo in late July between Environment Minister Yossi Sarid and Nabil Shaath, a senior P.L.O. figure. The same month, yet another session was held in Jerusalem by Health Minister Haim Ramon and Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab who is close to Mr. Arafat.
 None of these contacts altered the fact that the real channel was in Norway.
 In August, Mr. Savir told Mr. Peres that a deal was at hand. Gaza-Jericho and mutual recognition were in the plan, as were Israeli control of the borders and an outline for economic cooperation. Gone were the Jerusalem question for now, the Gaza-Jericho corridor and the Allenby Bridge dispute.
 
Peres Climbs the Stairs
 On Aug. 19, Mr. Peres flew to Oslo, ostensibly as part of a routine trip to Scandinavia. Late that night, after all the dinner guests had gone, he climbed the stairs of the government guest house. Waiting for him in a large room was Abu Alaa. The two men shook hands as they met for the first time.
 Officials say the actual initialing of the agreement was done by Abu Alaa and by Mr. Savir. Mr. Peres could not act since his fellow Cabinet ministers had not given their formal approval. But the Foreign Minister's presence there in the early hours of Aug. 20 affirmed that it had the blessing of the Israeli Government at the highest levels. Early that morning, the newspaper Maariv reported, Mr. Peres phoned Mr. Rabin at home, awakening him.
 "We signed," he said.
 "Mazel tov," the Prime Minister reportedly replied. "Good work."
 There was still much to be done. The Washington-oriented Mr. Rabin sent his Foreign Minister to California last week to show the agreement in secret to the vacationing Secretary of State, Warren Christopher.
 
U.S. Keeps a Distance
 Israel also wanted the Americans to overstate the role they had played in the negotiations, on the theory that Israelis might be persuaded to accept the plan more easily if they viewed it as something Washington really wanted. But the Americans balked at that idea.
 Now, the formal signing of the accord has been delayed by disputes within the P.L.O. But the man who was there from the beginning, Yair Hirschfeld, is convinced that it is only a matter of time.
 He has already crossed his Rubicon, he said: "If I understand anything about politics, we reached the point of no return."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Labor Day Message No One Asked to Hear

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHAT do you do?
Drive a bulldozer. Bend the steel and weld the seams to make the bulldozer. Supervise and feed and mend the driver and the welder. Bring home the bacon. Keep up with the Joneses. Buy Chevrolets and Frigidaires and make the economy turn. 
 Work is what I do.
In a nation born of a Protestant glorification of toil and thrift, work is a pillar of stable government. Just before another Labor Day, President Lyndon Johnson promised a Great Society in which "the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor."
In the former Soviet Union, Josef Stalin celebrated socialism for transforming labor "from a shameful and heavy burden into a matter of honor, matter of fame, matter of valor and heroism."
Yet today, work in America, in Russia, indeed throughout the industrialized world, has drifted a long, long way from the Marxist and capitalist ideals. For all but the elite, work holds less promise, less purpose, less security and less dignity than it did a generation ago.
Americans don't topple Morgans and Rockefellers, the philosopher Thorstein Veblen said, because they believed that with work, they, too, could be Morgans and Rockefellers. But that dream is a bigger stretch than ever, as Americans at citadels of enterprise like Procter & Gamble, Eastman Kodak and IBM lose jobs in multi-thousand-worker sweeps.
And in all their wrangling over budgets, taxes and the economy's growth, neither industry nor the Government has much to say about what it means when the economy's castoffs no longer buy Chevies and Frigidaires, or who is entitled to a decent life, or why bad jobs drive out good jobs, or what the devaluation of work means for democracy.
President Clinton may scratch at these questions in his summit conference on jobs, probably in February. For now, the Government attempts quick fixes -- summer jobs, tax breaks for businesses that hire and train the unemployed and buying weapons no one needs any more because, as the Administration allowed last week, making the weapons at least provides work.
In other quarters, however, concern about something more than another cyclical relapse of the world economy is rising -- starting with workers themselves.
In the early 1980's Katherine Newman, an anthropologist at Columbia University, interviewed people who were shattered by losing jobs but still had faith in the American system. In the late 1980's, she interviewed job-losers for her book "Declining Fortunes" (Basic Books) published in May. "I was now seeing people who don't believe anybody has any solid answers anymore," she said. "Some serious issues of dignity are involved here, not only dignity but identity. If you lose your place in the world of work, you lose your soul."
In an article in Harper's entitled "The End of Jobs," Richard J. Barnet, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, writes of a "global job crisis." It raises a fundamental question, he says: "What are we doing here?"
Around the world, just getting work has become a mean business. A political axiom of the Europe of the 1960's promised rioting in the streets if the unemployment rate ever exceeded 3 percent. Today it is 10 percent and climbing. Layoffs of the magnitudes of American industry just couldn't happen there. But Mercedes-Benz has let 22,000 people go in two years and said last week that 14,000 more will be going next year.
In the nature of work, the most striking changes are afoot in the United States. Among all American workers, Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, identifies a tiny core of 500,000 "supernovas" earning vastly more than their peers in Europe and Japan.
But America is also the place where comparatively light regulation of worker-employer relations has produced the disposable job. It comes with little or no health or pension coverage, with hours the employer can change at will, and often with no assurance that the job will still be around next week. Two of every five jobs in the United States are temporary or part-time.
These workers are the nation's data entry clerks, telemarketing sales agents, bank tellers, warehouse workers, janitors, fast food, supermarket and convenience store clerks and cashiers. Around 20 million work in low-wage stores and restaurants -- 2 million more than in higher-wage factories. In America, whole communities of people go to work selling things to people on their breaks from selling things.
For most workers wages have been stable or sinking for 20 years. The center of the labor force has been hollowing out, Mr. Levy says, as the top and bottom have grown. Eighteen percent of American workers do not earn enough to keep their families out of poverty. Minimally educated men have suffered the sharpest declines in wages. To support families, they, like single mothers, choose between food stamps and moonlighting and send the kids to work to pay for their clothes.
Many economists assume that these problems will ease with recovery, but they also note stickier trends. One is the old ogre of automation. Fear of robots and computer-run factories reared up in the 1950's, only to fade as new industries ignited the '60's boom and propelled American factory workers into the middle class.
These days, too, automation roars ahead, letting industries grow and prosper. But no one sees the emerging industries that can take on the workers they are letting go. Last week, when the Government reported the August unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, the number of factory jobs was still falling. Automation is also invading the lower-wage services, which accounted for much of the last decade's job growth.
Bank tellers share work with automated teller machines. Insurance and credit card companies keep barns full of $5-an-hour clerks who type data from forms and receipts into computers. It can be hard and painful work, a source of the rise in wrist-crippling repetitive stress injuries. But it is work, and soon there will be less of it. Uncomplaining machines called optical character readers are coming along to displace the typists.
"I have a feeling," said Robert L. Heilbroner, economic journalist and author of "The Worldly Philosophers," "that technology is taking a course that is much more threatening."
Wassily Leontief, Nobel laureate at New York University, said: "Modern technology will put very great pressure on employment and wages. It's unavoidable."
Another stress is intensifying competition from Asia and Latin America. Their workers are paid in a day what Germans and Americans earn in an hour, in factories whose products sell for vastly less than competing American products.
To survive, American industry installs factories in Brazil or Malaysia, making goods abroad to sell to American workers who in buying them put themselves out of jobs. The same is happening in services; data entry clerks can work just as efficiently in Jamaica or Ireland as they can in Wichita.
A mismatch between the American school system and industry, many people think, also impedes the creation of high-wage, high-skill jobs. Thomas Geoghegan, a pro-union labor lawyer in Chicago, sees the United States breeding armies of unskilled workers and driving them into a third world grave. "We have made a decision," he said. "Rather than compete with high-wage countries in a big way, we're going to take on China and Mexico." He said the proposed trade agreement with Mexico would be less threatening if unions and the Government, like those in Germany, worried more about rearing workers for good jobs, not just any job.
These trends in the workplace are tearing up the grain of the economy. "We're at a watershed period in our postwar industrial experience," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley. "This is not a transitional or temporary or cyclical problem of job deficiency. This is a lasting and structural problem that hits economies like ours every 50 years or so."
 
The Class Structure
 There is a threat to social cohesion, too, when people lose hope for jobs, particularly in a society including chief executives paid 100 and 200 times more than they pay the shop-floor workers, a middle class that can't rely on the chief executive to keep it aboard and an underclass of urban youths whom no one will take aboard.
"Clearly, we have this division of skilled and unskilled people," said William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute and a former Reagan Administration economist. "Some other things are still more disturbing. Black and white teen-age male unemployment was the same in 1950. Since then it has doubled for blacks. These are internal twists in the labor market over 30 or 40 years that are dramatic and troubling."
Economists caution that cyclical winds of recession account for some of the pain. "We've been through these periods of chin-stroking doubt before," said Henry J. Aaron of the Brookings Institution. "What's going on now and has gone on in the past is a tendency to draw apocalyptic visions from the confluence of problems."
Reunifying Germany, the inflation-fighting policies in Germany and Japan, the constraints on the American economy from the budget deficit and cuts in military spending are dampening growth now, he said.
President Clinton can't deploy the old Keynesian tools of Government spending because the Government is still choking on the deficits amassed in the 1980's. "There's a guy riding a horse in Santa Barbara," Mr. Levy said. "He's the guy who gave the tools away." Still, economists say growth will resume, brightening the outlook for jobs. It always does.
But even as the economy strengthens, the changes in the nature of work are likely to persist.
The Clinton Administration wants schools and industries to teach and train people better for high-wage, high-skill jobs. Labor Secretary Robert Reich is promoting a national system of apprenticeship programs.
From the right come urgings to leave the discovery of new skills and industries to the markets and leave business free of burdens like taxes for health care so it can invest in growth. The left would help chose the skills and new industries.
But nagging questions remain: What will those industries be? Will they have jobs enough for America's 130 million workers? Might the earth, at some point, set a limit on work-driven growth?
People like Professor Leontief say they just don't see enough jobs coming along, particularly for the many who cannot be supernovas. Shorter work weeks and shorter careers would let industry spread the work around. Scarcer, richly paid supernovas would be richly taxed to subsidize a new, low-wage leisure class and, Professor Leontief says, "a civilized existence."
Maybe Americans could be happy riding bikes to four-hour jobs.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: Readers' Questions;
The Beekman Theater, a French School, Old Initials

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
This is another in a series of columns answering questions from readers about New York's changing streetscapes.
 
The Beekman Theater
 Q. Who was the architect of the Beekman Theater, on the East Side of Second Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets? It is similar to the 1952 Manhattan House across the street, designed by Mayer & Whittlesey and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. . . . Thomas Mellins, Robert A.M. Stern, Architects, Manhattan.
A. Like Manhattan House, the two-story-high store, theater and bank building was built in 1952 by the New York Life Insurance Company. But its architects were Fellheimer & Wagner, often identified with bank design.
New York Life apparently decided on a low-rise development it to protect its investment in the apartment house across the street; the company also bought the entire northerly blockfront and key parts of the blockfronts on the west and south.
 
161 West 75th Street
 Q. My apartment house at 161 West 75th Street, like a number of others on the Upper West Side, has two intertwined initials over the door, an "A" and something else. Whose initials? And was it the architect or developer? . . . Ivan Berger, Manhattan.
A. Your building was built in 1924 to 1926 by Anthony Paterno -- they are his initials -- and was designed by Rosario Candela. Paterno was one of four brothers, all developers, who generally worked separately. Other brothers also used their initials on buildings they put up.
Joseph Paterno's architect on 905 West End Avenue, at 104th Street, designed an elaborate cartouche with "JP" over the door and annotated the 1917 drawing, "Architect is to approve the plaster model of this ornament before execution." Other developers, like the Halls, the Campagnas and the Crystals, also left such traces of their ownership.
I have never seen written accounts of this practice by developers, but after the turn of the century the architectural press often urged architects to "sign" their creations. However, only a few architects, usually designers of speculative apartment houses, regularly did this.
The Paternos started building modest walk-ups around 1900 but by the 1920's had become one of New York's reigning builder-families. Joseph Paterno built buildings like 1220 Park Avenue, at 95th Street, and 30 Sutton Place, at 58th Street; Charles put up luxury apartments as well as Hudson View Gardens and Castle Village, north of the George Washington Bridge; Michael built 775 Park Avenue, at 72d Street, and 2 East 67th Street, and Anthony built 1040 Fifth Avenue, at 85th Street.
Generally the Paternos' legible presence on their buildings decreased as their product ascended the economic ladder. On Michael Paterno's 1105 Park Avenue, built in 1922 at the corner of 89th Street, there is only the letter "P" and even such modest inscriptions largely vanished on their top-grade buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. This is consistent with the development in the 1910's of a general upper-class preference for apartment houses known by their street addresses rather than by a name.
 
126 East 24th Street
 Q. In 1945 the real estate broker Charles H. Voorhees had dinner at my apartment at 126 East 24th Street. Mr. Voorhees said that as a child he had attended a French school in the same building and that it was converted to apartments only later. Was he right? . . . Kathryn Guyler, Manhattan.
A. Yes. What is now a single structure at 126 East 24th Street was originally built as a string of four-story rowhouses in 1847 by Lawson Carter, a lawyer. They were at first occupied as private houses, but in 1856 Elie Charlier moved his "French and English Institute for Young Gentlemen" to at least one of the buildings.
Voorhees was born about 1860 so he could have attended the Charlier school, which accepted boys at age 7. In 1875 Charlier moved up to Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and the Carter family hired the architects Renwick & Sands to add a floor and change the building into modest apartments.
Frances Nightingale lived there from 1904 to 1909, just as she was establishing what became the Nightingale-Bamford School. In 1939 the architect Samuel Lichtenstein modernized the ground floor and the building now has a definite tripartite effect from three different eras -- a Moderne ground floor, the original Italianate middle section and a top section with an elaborate Victorian brick cornice.
 
3 East 81st Street
 Q. There is an interesting building (very tiny) wedged just behind 998 Fifth Avenue. Could this have been an old carriage house? . . . Sylvia Steinbrock, Manhattan.
A. The first building at 3 East 81st Street was one of a row of brownstones completed in 1879. In 1908 the actress Maxine Elliott bought the house and had the architects Hunt & Hunt redesign it with a limestone front. She occupied it with a cousin and five servants. Miss Elliott's obituary in The New York Times in 1940 described her as "one of America's most noted actresses," with a 30-year career beginning with her debut in 1890.
She retired around 1920 and moved to France.
In 1928 she sold the house to the owner of 998 Fifth Avenue, the apartment building at the corner. The house was then demolished but the first-floor facade was retained with a garden behind, apparently as a light protector for the larger building. This structure, with Maxine Elliott's doorway, is what survives on the site.
 
910 Fifth Avenue
 Q. Is it true that the white brick apartment house at 910 Fifth Avenue at 72d Street is really an older structure? The ceilings are pretty high for a postwar building. . . . John Foreman, Halstead Property Company, Manhattan.
A. You're right. Another giveaway clue is the surviving trace of limestone on the easterly lot line wall, toward Madison Avenue. In 1920 the developer Fred F. French put up a limestone-front apartment house of simplexes and duplexes of up to 18 rooms with a sheltered driveway. In 1955 the architects Sylvan and Robert Bien filed plans to add four new floors and rebuild the interior according to "new concepts of space utilization" as The New York Times put it in 1959.
These concepts meant apartments of three and a half to eight rooms renting for $500 to $1,415 a month. Robert Bien, now a partner at Eggers & Higgins, says changes in window patterns required the changes in the facade, which would have been done anyway.
"In those days," he said, "we wanted it to look like a new building, adding that "white glazed brick was the most expensive, and the most elegant" material available in the industry at the time.

 CORRECTION:
The answer to a question in the Streetscapes column on Sept. 5, about the redesign of the apartment house at 910 Fifth Avenue in the 1950's, referred incorrectly to the architectural firm in which Robert Bien is a partner. It is the Eggers Group, no longer known as Eggers & Higgins.

HEADLINE: Always a Market For Luxury Housing

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHO buys those multi-million-dollar spreads in Bedford and those waterfront estates in Larchmont so enticingly pictured in glossy magazines? Japanese businessmen? Hollywood producers? Occasionally, but most often such well-heeled buyers come from no more than 30 miles away, say the people who know the market best.
"In Westchester, within a 40-mile radius of Manhattan, we have the highest concentration of luxury homes worth $1 million or more than almost anywhere else in the world," said Lisa Harness, director of previews, the Coldwell Banker division that markets upscale and antique properties for the Katonah office of Coldwell Banker Schlott Realtors and nine other of its offices in Westchester. "What's more," Ms. Harness continued, "88 percent of the buyers live in the state and almost all come from Manhattan." 
 "These are busy people who are buying second homes for weekend places in the country, but they want them to be accessible and be able to get to them quickly, not spending hours on the road," Ms. Harness said.
"They also value privacy and they want enough land so they don't have to see another house," she added. "The beauty of the land with its rolling hills and wonderful old trees is a strong selling point. Where else can you have a home on 40 acres with a pool, a tennis court such as the Sugar Hill estate in Bedford, which is easily within commuting distance to Manhattan, and feel as if you're thousands of miles away?"
In assessing the current market for high-priced homes, Ms. Harness said that although 1993 got off to a slow start, recently there has been "an incredible increase in sales."
 
A $2 Million Average
 Ms. Harness said that it has been "an odd year." "Perhaps buyers of luxury homes are finally feeling more sanguine about the economy because at the beginning of the year, in February and March, we hit an all-time high in the number of inquiries we received and so we predicted strong sales for April, May and June. The rationale being that 25 percent of inquiries normally translate into sales. But sales failed to materialize. Business was flat.
"I think that buyers were afflicted with a fear of the unknown. They didn't know what President Clinton had in store for them. Uncertainty is bad for business. But after the Administration's tax proposals were finally announced, sales began to increase and in July the average sale price for a luxury home was $1.5 million and rose to $2 million last month, which is a figure that has not been seen since the boom days of the 80's."
Ms. Harness emphasized, however, that the high prices of houses in the 80's have dropped considerably.
"The average listing price, $2 million, buys so much more house than it did in 1986 and 1987," she said. "There are real values to be had today and buyers are responding. The times seem better. In 1990, you could not get a buyer to the table on a $6 million home, even if it was appraised at $12 million. Today, while it is taking an average of 370 days to sell higher-priced houses, at least they are selling."
 
Waterfront and Traditional
 There are more houses in the million-dollar-plus category on the market than there have been in recent years, she noted.
"We have a $300 million inventory in luxury homes listed with us, which includes Sugar Hill, which is listed at $4.5 million and a $22 million asking price for a really fabulous home and an island on the Sound in Southport, Conn.," she said. "Most of our listings are for one-of-a-kind houses."
The houses that have retained the highest value, she said, are waterfront properties and traditionally designed houses.
"There are 10 buyers for a traditional home to one buyer for a modern one."
Ms. Harness said higher-price houses need higher-price marketing programs.
"Our specialized marketing program over a two-year period will cost sellers anywhere from $5,000 to $35,000," she said. "Eventually most will sell for about 80 percent of their asking price."
 
Upgrading in the Same Area
 James M. Whittemore, a partner in Burbank/Whittemore in Larchmont, noted that Burbank has 25 houses listed for sale at $1 million or more in the Larchmont-Mamaroneck area.
"Sales of higher-priced homes are keeping pace with 1992, which was a good year," Mr. Whittemore said. "I have my fingers crossed, but we may do even better in 1993, which is especially encouraging since business was slow during the first two months of the year."
Although buyers in the high end of the market are sophisticated in looking for values, Mr. Whittemore said: "There are no distress sales out there. Those houses that came to market because their owners lost their jobs have already been absorbed."
A profile of buyers of high-priced houses done by Burbank, he said, revealed that most buyers come from the immediate area.
"When a desirable luxury home, a waterfront Mamaroneck or a large house in Larchmont Manor for instance, comes on the market, inevitably we have found the buyer will be someone from the community," he said, citing as an example the recent sale to a family who owned a house on Beech Avenue in Larchmont Manor and then bought a spectacular waterfront property on Flagler Drive in Mamaroneck with the thinking that their teen-age children would be going to the same school.
"When customers are ready to upgrade, our clients rarely move more than two or three miles away," he noted.
 
Bidding Wars
 When asked if buyers were not put off by the high real estate taxes in Larchmont and Mamaroneck -- which can run as high as $30,000 for waterfront houses -- Mr. Whittemore, although conceding that the taxes were considerably higher than those for comparable properties in Fairfield County, said that for many buyers pluses still outweigh minuses.
"These are people who understand what they are getting. They pay the taxes because they value the community, the schools and the easy commute and they want to stay in the same neighborhood they have been living in," he said, adding that recent buyers have been orthopedists and executives in Wall Street investment firms that have the hefty incomes necessary to live where they choose.
"Overall, our business is good," he said. One indication is that bidding wars are taking place for the first time in years. We had two recently, for houses priced at $800,000 and above. Three buyers were bidding on one house, two on the other. All tendered sealed bids, which were opened at the same time and the owners took the ones that gave them the most favorable terms. Interestingly enough, three of the would-be buyers were on Wall Street."
P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors in White Plains, said the number of sales of houses for more than $1 million reported by his members has remained steady even through the recession year of 1990.
 
Always People With Money
 "Year in and year out, sales of very high-priced houses in the county have averaged 20 sales a quarter, or 80 to 90 a year," Mr. Mercurio said. "Which indicates that in good times or bad, there are always people who have money."
In terms of activity in sales, he added, the overall single-family market was strong during the last quarter.
"Pent-up demand on the part of buyers and relatively soft prices on the part of sellers, resulted in high volume -- 982 closings in the second quarter," he said. "The median $275,000 sales price was 7 percent below the 1992 second-quarter median," he added. "And the 172 condo sales were the second-highest total recorded by us. The median $160,000 sales price was the same as for the second quarter last year."

HEADLINE: Pressures on School Districts Continue

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
AS the school year begins Long Island districts face the continuing challenge of trying to maintain and improve programs and services with fewer resources and more students.
There were no significant cutbacks in state aid this year, and in some cases, small gains. But most districts are still feeling the effects from the drastic reductions in 1991. 
 The president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association, Dr. Bruce Brodsky, said that Island school boards were feeling pressure to keep their budgets down and that few districts had restored programs and services that had been reduced or eliminated in the last two years.
There are 127 districts on the Island. Eighteen of the 71 districts in Suffolk County and 7 of the 56 in Nassau County will start the school year on contingency budgets, leaving many uncertainties.
In Commack a vote on a revised budget, after its defeat in the spring, will be held on Thursday to decide on pupil transportation. Superintendent Joseph J. DelRosso said a bus company had agreed to donate buses for the first two days of school, until the election. If the budget is defeated, transportation would cease immediately. He added that the defeat of the budget would also mean the loss of interscholastic athletics, some activities, new computer equipment and new textbooks.
The Sachem School District, the largest noncity district in the state, with 14,500 students, will also open this week on austerity for the first time in its history. Superintendent James A. Ruck said there would be no transportation in state-mandated boundaries, two miles for pupils in kindergarten through the 8th grade and three miles for students in the 9th through 12th grades. In addition, he said, athletes have to finance their interscholastic programs, and no equipment will be bought.
"We've already had three budget votes," Dr. Ruck said. "We are a high-tax low-wealth district, and the community is saying no more tax increases. Because of the size of the district, having no transportation is a big problem. But we're working feverishly to get the school year started as well organized and safely as possible."
In Nassau the Hempstead School District is also starting the year on austerity, as it has for five years. Superintendent Eddy Bayardelle said the absence of an approved budget was just one of many problems. Hempstead High School and Middle School remain on the State Education Department list of the worst-performing schools in the state.
"It's been a tough year," said Dr. Bayardelle, who became superintendent last year. He had been administraor in the New York City schools.
"When I came here," Dr. Bayardelle added, "the district was in a crisis state and was cited for just about everything from mismanagement to not providing mandated programs for handicapped and non-English-speaking students. There was no organization and tremendous negativity."
The district had many staffing changes in the last school year, Dr. Bayardelle said, to try to improve performance. The district obtained additional money from the state for programs to upgrade services for students and began an adult-education program with an expanded program graduate-equivalency degrees, offering day and night classes and classes in English as a second language.
The newest hope for Hempstead is an early childhood center, financed by private donations, scheduled to open this month in a vacant parochial school. Dr. Bayardelle said it would include programs for children 16 months to 3 years old, a prekindergarten and kindergarten for 4- and 5-year-olds and a family center.
"The outlook in Hempstead is beginning to change," Dr. Bayardelle said. "But we certainly have a long way to go."
 
Optimism in Longwood
 The outlook is more positive in Longwood, which passed its budget for the first time in several years. After a 15 percent reduction in staff, the level stabilized this year, said Superintendent Candy Swenson. Although the district was unable to restore programs, administrators are optimistic.
"When you lose things, you have a unique opportunity to create something new and different, rather than to recreate the past," Dr. Swenson said. "This year we'll be developing long-range plans, studying what we need and where we should be going."
 
Shrinking Resources in Massapequa
 In Massapequa a revised and reduced budget approved in midsummer allowed the district to open this week on a normal basis instead of on austerity. To maintain programs despite shrinking resources the district offered a retirement incentive for teachers and increased classroom responsibilities for department heads.
"It's a tough time for all districts," Superintendent James Bruccia said. "We are all facing the continuing battle for support and resources."
A few districts look forward to restoring and even adding some programs. In Herricks four new electives will be offered in the high school, and the elementary schools will receive new computer laboratories. Superintendent Sidney Freund said the district could finally catch up on buying equipment. "The theme for this year," he said, "is looking to the next century and examining the relevance of what we're teaching."
In Syosset, new courses include Japanese, study skills for all 6th graders and a mandatory fitness and nutrition class for all 9th- and 10th-graders. Superintendent Carole Hankin said that after a conservative three years the district could buy additional computers, supplies and equipment and restore interscholastic sports in grades 7 and 9.
"If there are no new surprises on the state level," she said, "we're hoping next year to computerize the elementary schools, return class trips to the budget and do some other very exciting things."
 
More Instruction in English
 Enrollments on the Island have been slowly rising in recent years. The State Education Department says total enrollment in Nassau and Suffolk counties for 1991-92 was 387,734. Last year it rose, to 391,407. The projected number for this year is 397,356, and enrollment for the 1995-1996 year is projected at 404,741.
Although enrollment is slowly climbing, the significant increase in enrollment is among immigrants, especially from Central and South America, said Dr. Brodsky.
"We've seen a major influx of kids in their early teens who are totally illiterate," he said. "Many 12-year-olds are coming into the school districts not speaking or reading the language, and we must start them at the kindergarten level.
"This is a significant factor in driving up the costs of education, because under state law we must hire someone to teach them in their native languages."
In Brentwood minority members are the majority, said a spokesman for the district, Jerry Steiner. Of 12,000 students 45 percent are Hispanic, 39 percent white, 15 percent black and 1 percent are members of other groups. There are 59 languages that have to be taught in the bilingual program in the district, he said.
"One of the most difficult things we have to do is to find the staff to work with the kids in their native languages," Mr. Steiner said. "But aside from the language barrier many of these kids have other special problems. Some are 10 and 12 and have never before been in school. Their families are in an economic depression, and these factors compound the language barrier."
Glen Cove, one of the two cities on the Island, has also seen a swelling in the number of students from minorities. A spokeswoman for the district, Marjorie Linn, said the schools ran a program this summer for entering and current kindergarteners with little or no English skills. The district also added teachers of English as a second language and a social worker and psychologist to work with non-English-speaking students.
An influx of non-English-speaking students in Long Beach, the other city on the Island, prompted the creation of a language-immersion program to integrate Hispanic students into American culture and the school as quickly as possible, said Superintendent Elliott Landon. The program, financed by the state, pairs English- and Spanish-speaking students, he said, adding that the program, which has a waiting list, started with prekindergarten children and will be expanded to include students up to the second grade this year.
Multicultural education has become a growing focus. A student-exchange program with Russia created a new link for high school students in the Port Washington, Farmingdale and Hewlett-Woodmere districts. The youngsters will travel to Russia in the spring. The project was financed by a grant from the United States Information Agency, in cooperation with the Nassau Board of Cooperative Services, which operates special schools and training courses.
 
 Problems With Prejudice
 A number of bias incidents in the 1992-93 school year prompted educators to introduce more programs to combat prejudice. After several displays of anti-Semitism in the spring Commack began to develop a program aimed at reducing bias and encouraging multicultural appreciation for the curriculum by the spring, Dr. DelRosso said. A committee will plan staff workshops and explore the possibility of community meetings, he added.
The need to reduce prejudice is also a growing focus in Herricks, where a coalition of school and community leaders is involved in multicultural events.
"Prejudice reduction is not just a school issue, but a community issue," Dr. Freund said. "We've got to attack the problem from all angles."
Another new effort, the Longwood Diversity Institute, has been formed to train students as leaders in reducing bias. The program was financed by a $2,000 grant from the State Education Department. A group of fourth graders chosen by their peers was trained by a team from the State University at Stony Brook and Suffolk Community College.
"We've had our share of incidents that highlight the bias that exists," Dr. Swenson said. "We're hoping that this project will be a springboard for other activities."
Dr. Landon said the weak economy had contributed to conflicts. "When the economy is in a tailspin," he said, "you always see an increase in bias-related incidents. As educators we must be more sensitive to developing programs to reduce levels of intolerance and to try to sensitize our teachers and students to work with these issues."
 
Countering Violence
 Discipline is on the minds of many educators as the year begins. Concerns include the proliferation of graffiti, isolated but disruptive pranks and the increase in violence.
The State Education Department recently surveyed school safety and security and is collecting the data from a statewide sampling of districts. A spokesman for the department, Leonard Powell, said the survey was an attempt to understand violence and weapons possession in the schools and determine what programs had been successful. The results are to be published in the fall.
Violence is no longer confined to cities, Dr. Brodsky said. Local school districts are recognizing that there is a pressing need to deal with the problem. "Some districts will be drawing up stricter disciplinary codes," he added. "Others will increase security detectors and security guards. More districts will be implementing conflict-resolution and mediation training and trying to teach their kids racial and ethnic sensitivity."
In Syosset a handful of pranks at the high school last year, including bomb threats and false fire alarms, prompted tougher security measures. A new alarm and security system was installed in the summer, with cameras throughout the building and a two-way public-address system in every classroom. All incoming telephone calls to the district are recorded. The principal, Jorge Schneider, said the tougher policy helped make students and teachers feel more secure and would deter inappropriate behavior.
To fight the growing problem of graffiti Massapequa is participating in an adopt-a-building program with Oyster Bay. Dr. Bruccia said students would be assigned to keep an eye on different buildings. If graffiti are found on "adopted" buildings, he said, the students will be responsible for repainting it. The program is part of a townwide plan for tougher enforcement and stricter penalties for graffiti.
 
Beyond the Schoolhouse
 Community involvement has become a priority in many districts. The state's blueprint for education, the New Compact for Learning, calls for all districts to develop and adopt plans by February for parents, teachers and administrators to participate in planning and making decisions.
In Hempstead more than 60 partnerships have been formed between the district and businesses, bringing business leaders into the schools to teach courses, and providing internships for students in the community.
In Longwood the theme for the year is "Community Unity -- Be a Part of the Pride." A district is often the center of a community, Dr. Swenson said. "It is our responsibility to create opportunities to bring people together," she said. "Every school district and community have problems. Our goal is to work cooperatively to solve these problems together."

HEADLINE: County and State Offer Aid to Buy Hastings Site

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
WITH the announcement last week of a county and state plan to help local officials preserve Hillside Woods here, this tiny Hudson River village moved a step closer toward reaching what has been an elusive goal.
The county has offered to contribute one-third of the $3.35 million cost of purchasing the 48-acre woods, and the state has indicated that it would contribute another third. That leaves the village with the task raising the other third through a bond issue, which is much less that it had originally thought it would have to pay. 
 The land was owned by Henry Gross, a New York City developer who purchased the property in 1987 and planned to build 82 homes on it. But when the real estate market fell upon hard times and Mr. Gross's corporation agreed to sell the site for about $5.5 million, the village was unable to raise the funds to buy it.
The property, thick with trees and hiking trails and much loved by residents here, will form part of a larger publicly owned greenbelt area in lower Westchester, where open land is scarce.
 
Calling In a Trust
 Under the plan, the woods will be jointly owned by the county and village, and access will be open to all Westchester residents, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said when the proposal was announced last week. The site of a former Algonquin trail will create an open-space link between the Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway along the Hudson River and the county-owned Putnam Right of Way near the Saw Mill River Parkway.
As in other southern Westchester communities, development pressures have been great in this village, where 8,000 people live in a two-square-mile area. The Fund to Preserve Hillside Woods, a grass-roots organization of local citizens, was formed six years ago, and its members raised some money to protect the woods through bake sales and special events.
There was little real hope, however, that the property could be saved until the San Francisco-based Trust for Public Land was called in three years ago. Late last spring the not-for-profit organization negotiated to purchase the woods, contingent upon its eventual sale to either the village or county, or both.
The mortgage on the property is currently held by Recoll Management Corporation, a collection subsidiary of the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I., and an agent for the Federal Deposit Insurance Company, which took over the loan following a series of bank failures. Because Mr. Gross's company had defaulted on the loan, the public trust was able to negotiate a purchase price lower than the one the firm was originally asking, said Phyllis M. Reich, a project manager for the trust.
She said that the depressed real estate market has provided "a wonderful economic opportunity for trusts" to save open-space land.
 
Lobbying Efforts Pay Off
 Since 1989, the Trust for Public Land has worked in the county to acquire more than 520 acres of open- space property. Its acquisitions include the Kitchawan Preserve, a 208-acre site in Yorktown near the Croton Reservoir, which had been owned by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and 164 acres surrounding Pocantico Lake in Mount Pleasant.
In Westchester, 46,000 acres of the county's 288,000 acres remain as open space, with the county owning 16,000 undeveloped acres, said P. Lynn Oliva, Commissioner of Planning. Mr. O'Rourke has calculated that there are about 18 acres of county-owned greenspace for every 1,000 residents, one of the highest ratios in the nation.
With the trust's deal for Hillside Woods close to completion last spring, Hastings-on-Hudson officials sought increased commitments from the county and state. As a result of the village's recent lobbying efforts, the county -- which a year ago said it would contribute only a fourth -- increased its share of the purchase price to a third.
State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, Republican from Yonkers, has pledged to secure $1 million through the state's Environmental Quality Bond Act, which is double the amount originally promised.
The last sticking point will be residents' support of an Oct. 12 bond referendum authorizing the village to raise the money for its share of the purchase price, will come to about $1.1 million.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
British Rockers Trot Out the Flag

BYLINE: By Simon Reynolds; Simon Reynolds is the author of "Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
In rock-and-roll just as in politics, the United States and England have a special relationship. Together, they have dominated global pop. Over the decades, rock's center of gravity has shifted back and forth between each nation. In the 60's it passed from swinging London to San Francisco, in the 70's from Southern California's soft rock to British punk. The rest of the planet has never had much of a look in.
Musical innovations generally originate in America, and in particular from black music (rhythm-and-blues and soul in the 50's and 60's, funk and disco in the 70's, rap and house in the 80's). But usually it's British bands that respond quickest to black American innovations, adding a vital element of art-school conceptualism, style and attitude, then promptly selling this repackaged black American music to white America. This is what happened with 60's white blues or 80's New Pop (funk given a video-friendly gloss). 
 But just as the special relationship in politics often engenders anxiety among the British, similarly the trans-Atlantic traffic in pop is fraught with rivalry and resentment. Right now, the British pop scene is convulsed by one of its periodic fits of anti-Americanism. All year long, there have been murmurings of discontent, which has swelled into a "Yanks go home!" uproar, in reaction to the deluge of music from Seattle grunge bands.
From the late 80's until quite recently, British indie bands had looked to American hard-core and alternative rock, envying and admiring the likes of Sonic Youth and Big Black. American underground bands seem to have an un-self-conscious and intuitive approach that was felt to be preferable to England's traditionally overtheorized and premeditated take on rock-and-roll. The best British bands of the late 80's, like My Bloody Valentine, took the slacker spirit and neo-psychedelic sound of Dinosaur Jr. and Husker Du, giving them an androgynous spin.
The explosive success of Nirvana changed everything. What was once cool and a trifle exotic became commonplace, oppressive. Even more resented are the home-grown plague of slacker-wannabes who've struggled to emulate the invaders, growing their hair shaggy, mumbling their lyrics, grunging up their guitars. As 1992 turned into 1993, a wave of bands emerged that reject the notion of an "English curse" (of pretentiousness and preciousness) and instead embrace the idea of being literate, self-conscious, stylized and ironic. The most successful and most volubly anti-American of the new patriots is Suede. The band is currently trying to conquer America with its first full-scale tour, which reaches New York on Sept. 18.
Suede's roots are the British art-rock and the glam of the 70's (David Bowie, T. Rex, Kate Bush) and the English nostalgia of the Smiths. Its front man, Brett Anderson, sings in an exaggerated London accent, a defiant gesture against a pseudo-American slacker drawl that so many British bands still mimic. His fey, flamboyant image and gender-bending lyrics are a resurrection of the English tradition of sexual ambiguity, a concerted reaction against grunge's machismo.
Other bands flying the flag for the imperiled legacy of English pop include Denim, Pulp, the Auteurs and Saint Etienne. The Auteurs herald a return to wordy songcraft. The group's singer Luke Haines worships what he calls the "wryness and dryness" of quintessentially English songwriters like Ray Davies of the Kinks. The band's debut album, "New Wave," released in America last spring by Caroline, even contained an anti-grunge anthem called "American Guitars." Saint Etienne is a stylish dance pop trio whose delightful, irony-drenched songs with titles like "London Belongs to Me" and "Avenue" often seem like reinvocations of 60's London.
The anti-American mood was prefigured by that most England-obsessed singer, Morrissey, formerly of the Smiths. On his 1992 glam-rock-tinged LP, "Your Arsenal," the song "We'll Let You Know" mourned the fact that "we look to Los Angeles for the language we use . . . London is dead." He also incited controversy when he draped himself in the Union Jack during a performance.
If there's a sociological backdrop to this mini-movement of bands that are proud to be British, it's that England is in the throes of political, social and cultural crisis. Economic recession, rising crime and the deterioration of public service have all fueled unease about where Britain is heading as a nation, and what it means to be British. On the one hand, Britons are nervous about merging with their neighbors on the Continent in a greater European Community; on the other, they feel inundated with American culture, from grunge to Hollywood blockbusters to television shows like "American Gladiators."
THE DEFIANT ENGLISHNESS OF this new crop of indie bands is a sort of perversely parochial response to global pop culture -- everything from Nintendo to sample-based music like techno (a truly international and rootless music). Since the future would seem to promise the loss of national cultural identity, these bands turn their backs to the future and rifle the back pages of England's pop glory.
This trans-Atlantic antagonism often cuts the other way, too: there's a long tradition of American skepticism toward the latest British trends. For some, Britain produces an endless stream of overhyped "haircut bands" that are seen as videogenic and weighted with conceptual baggage withoutmusical substance. Suede, for instance, has received a mixed reaction in America. While the college rock audience, which has always been Anglophile, has responded favorably, indie hipsters remain skeptical.
American critics have often suggested that the British lack a natural, "organic" relationship with rock-and-roll. There's an Anglophobic tradition that stretches from the critic Dave Marsh, who in the early 80's celebrated Bruce Springsteen's all-American populism while decrying the British New Pop invaders like Culture Club and Human League, to Joe Carducci's recent, influential polemic, "Rock and Pop Narcotic." In his Anglophobic theory of rock, Mr. Carducci argues that British bands quickly lost touch with the blues roots of rock-and-roll, and after Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they made little contribution to the evolution of the form.
In recent years, only a handful of Britons have been given the critical red carpet in America. One is Teen-Age Fan Club, an Americanophile Scottish quartet that is influenced by the likes of Neil Young and Big Star. Another is My Bloody Valentine, which also initially took its bearings from American underground bands like Sonic Youth before radically transforming its sources.
The trans-Atlantic traffic in musical ideas often works by a process of innovation through misrecognition. This syndrome of unsuccessful imitation leads to all manner of ironic developments, like the way the northern English band the Fall has suddenly and inexplicably emerged as a major influence on a breed of lo-fi indie bands in America like Pavement. In a similar fashion, the Sex Pistols have been adopted by American metal bands, with everyone from Guns 'n' Roses to Megadeth to Motley Crue remaking their songs.
Misappropriation and miscegenation is the way that pop evolves. In view of this, the attempts of bands like Suede and the Auteurs to safeguard the purity of English pop seem shortsighted and futile. Insularity and inbreeding may ultimately condemn British pop to extinction.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
The Search for Jobs That No Longer Exist

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
It is not an easy time to be a senior manager. Terms like "trim corporation" sound trendy, but they really mean you can now get fired even if you have done a great job.
"The first thing you have to learn is that nothing is forever anymore," said Sid Wilkins, president of the outplacement specialist Wilkins & Wilkins International in Palo Alto, Calif. "There is no such thing now as job security." 
 Mr. Wilkins is often used by companies in Silicon Valley to help laid-off chief executives and other top managers find new work. And until recently, Mr. Wilkins had a proven technique for these executives: get them through the depression and grief over losing their jobs, then start them down the path to finding new employment. The program updated resumes, taught job interview skills -- even found the client new clothes. It was a systematic process, and at the end was a new job for the client.
But Mr. Wilkins has noted a fundamental change lately that has forced him to rethink his business: For many of his clients, the new jobs are no longer there.
As an organizational revolution has swept one American industry after another, many firms have undergone management layoffs -- and the odds have grown longer against executives finding other job openings in their fields.
That was what Tim Hillary discovered when the claims administrator Adjustco closed its offices in Walnut Creek, Calif., in 1991 and moved Mr. Hillary's human resources management job to the East Coast. Mr. Hillary quickly discovered he was trapped in a buyer's market. "Recruiters either didn't have any jobs available or demanded seven very specific qualifications -- and knew they could get them," he said. "It was not a pleasant time for me."
A consolation, Mr. Wilkins said, is that in Silicon Valley at least, executives no longer seem surprised at being laid off, but take it as part of a career in high-technology. There is less post-firing depression, Mr. Wilkins said, although he said he had found that he must deal more with his clients' frustration down the line when no new jobs can be found.
In San Francisco, Sharon Gadberry, president of Transitions Management, the local office of Outplacement International of Chicago, found that her clients like Mr. Hillary, who were from more traditional companies, were getting a double whammy: shocked at being fired and depressed at being unable to find new employment. Like Mr. Wilkins, she rethought her work.
What both specialists discovered offers a path for executives nationwide:
* Realize that nothing is forever. Said Ms. Gadberry: "Get security out of your head. Think about it: is there really one company you can guarantee will always be profitable, that will never reorganize?" Added Mr. Wilkins: "You are totally responsible for your family's security. You can't delegate that. And until you recognize that fact, you can't be helped."
* Get involved. Start looking for your next job while you are still employed. Ms. Gadberry recommended becoming active in professional groups in your field and building networks you can contact for work if you need it. Mr. Wilkins recommended joining the United Way or the YMCA: "Rub elbows with people in other professions. See how other folks make money. "
* Know yourself. "Take a specific look at what you do best," Ms. Gadberry said. "The problem with most general managers is that they have lost their skills. You need a backup talent with which you can make money, even if it's by the hour."
* Dream. "Figure out what you'd like to do if you weren't doing this," Mr. Wilkins said. "Maybe you want to teach, or start your own business. Visit the career development center at your local community college or your alma mater and spend a hundred bucks on aptitude and interest tests. It might give you some alternative career ideas." Mr. Wilkins had one client, the former vice president of a bank that had been acquired by another, who decided that he really wanted to own a shop in a small town. He now owns a hardware store in a village in Northern California.
* Talk to your family. Often your spouse knows more about your needs than you do. Recalls Ms. Gadberry: "I worked with a guy with high blood pressure from beating his head against the corporate wall. I called his wife in who told me 'I don't want him doing this anymore.' The man was shocked. Turned out he was doing all of this for her."
* Cut the best deal. When you are fired, hold out for the best severance package. For compensation, the rule of thumb is still a month's severance pay for every $10,000 in salary. Ask for open-ended outplacement support until you find a new job. And ask for your benefits to continue for the duration of the severance.
* Do not panic, but work fast. Contact your outplacement person the instant you are fired. Start the ball rolling and then relax. You will probably have months of severance pay, and if you pace yourself you will have fun and a new career at the end.
* Be creative. Mr. Wilkins has his clients imagine what they would like to be. Ms. Gadberry has her more traditional clients look at mid-sized companies that want people with experience at big companies, even if only as a "rented" executive who is hired for a few months or so.
In the end, it usually comes down to the inventiveness of the unemployed executive. Mr. Hillary helped found a support group for unemployed human resource executives called HRx. They swapped notes on interviews and shared resume tricks. HRx now has two branches and 60 members. And Mr. Hillary, now the manager of corporate human resources for the health maintenance organization Take Care Inc. in Concord, Calif., remains in the group. After all, he said, "you never know when you'll be looking again."

HEADLINE: Somalis Work to Rebuild Their Country

 BODY:
To The Editor:
Michael Maren's "Good Will and Its Limits in Somalia" (Op-Ed, Aug. 27) is not an accurate reflection of the work being undertaken by CARE, the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere, and other humanitarian agencies in Somalia. It also does a disservice to the Somalis who are struggling to rebuild their country. 
 Less than a year ago, each day as many as 3,000 innocent Somalis, mostly children, were dying horrible deaths from starvation. Thanks to the international relief effort, support by military intervention and the efforts of the Somali people, starvation ended. Life is slowly returning to normal for millions of needy people, but hunger is still a major problem.
Last spring, CARE distributed seeds and tools to thousands of farmers, who are now harvesting a good crop of sorghum. But domestically grown food is not enough to provide for even half the Somali population.
Also, in a country virtually lacking employment opportunities, our programs are designed to provide jobs and further economic rehabilitation.
Through the targeted sale of wheat -- a commodity not readily available in the Somali marketplace -- to a select group of local traders, CARE has raised the equivalent of about $1 million. We have channeled $564,000 into rehabilitation projects in water, health, sanitation and construction. These programs employ thousands of Somalis in rebuilding their country.
Some of our projects are the cleaning and repairing of the irrigation systems connected to the Juba and Shebelle Rivers. As a result of these projects, for which we pay people with food and provide them with tools, cement and other supplies, we will increase the agricultural output in these areas, providing permanent employment opportunties.
I lived in Somalia for months as United Nations coordinator for humanitarian relief at the height of the famine and into the beginning of rehabilitation efforts. Having witnessed Somalia in the famine, and now seeing the fragile regeneration, I urge you and your readers not to let irresponsible charges keep us from following the moral imperative to help the Somalis as they move toward self-sufficiency.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S ADVISERS STUDY NEW MOVES TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Stuck with a tight budget and uncertain economic prospects, top economic advisers in the Clinton Administration are eyeing the same types of measures to stimulate the economy that the Bush Administration used during the Presidential election campaign last year.
The measures on the drafting table, which, by and large, would not require Congressional approval, are being discussed by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and other high-level aides. The plans include speeding work on military contracts or easing regulations on Government lending. 
 Such steps are supposed to provide small but concentrated doses of job stimulus for selected industries, groups of workers and regions -- California, in particular -- in the event that the economy stalls or job growth fails to pick up.
"Several of us are developing ideas and exchanging memoranda with an eye toward advising the President on this matter," Mr. Reich said in an interview last week.
 
Should Affect Spending Schedule
 The measures are intended to affect the timing and the target of spending, loans and tax collections without changing the overall budget totals, as well as to stimulate private business activity by rewriting banking, airline and other regulations.
Since the defeat of the Administration's stimulus package by Congress, the economics team has been frustrated by the Administration's lack of fiscal tools to bolster the modest and uneven economic recovery. "Given defeat of the stimulus plan, given slow growth," an Administration official said, "the question became: What could you do? Are there ways to stimulate the economy with little or no on-budget effects?"
 
Still in Draft Stages
 Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader who worked to defeat the Administration's stimulus package during the spring, said Friday: "It's fine with me as long as they don't overreach. They've got the authority."
While the broad outlines of a plan have been spelled out, the specifics are far from final. "This has not reached the level of the full N.E.C.," said Mr. Reich, referring to the National Economic Council. "The President has made no decisions yet."
Last year, the Bush Administration used its discretionary authority to cut income tax withholding and to hasten Pentagon purchases of military hardware, both actions intended to lift confidence and economic growth. At the time the Clinton camp derided the moves as gimmicks, but now the Clinton economic advisers say the measures were effective in temporarily lifting growth and that their earlier criticisms had more to do with President George Bush's motivation -- re-election -- than with his methods.
Among the economic advisers involved, a range of views exists about when the contingency measures might be needed. With unemployment at 6.7 percent, some advisers said they did not think the contingency measures would be necessary, while others said they thought California's 9 percent unemployment rate justified the action now.
According to several officials, California is a focal point of the planning. The state's high unemployment rate is responsible for three- or four-tenths of a percentage point of the national unemployment rate. And, not coincidentally, California, with its large number of electoral votes, is the state without which the Democrats cannot hope to win a majority in the 1996 Presidential election.
"California is a special case," Mr. Reich said.
Indeed, both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have used discretionary spending authority to aid California. After the Los Angeles riots, for example, the Bush Administration eased the terms for Government small-business loans.
Joseph Stiglitz, one of the three members of the Council of Economic Advisers, has been the main aide responsible for laying out the principles of the contingency plan and coming up with a list of promising actions.
 
Accelerate Job Creation
 According to several people familiar with the memorandums being circulated, the options being considered include accelerating spending that has already been authorized in the budget, like military procurement, research and operations outlays. That kind of spending, these people said, could also be arranged to, for instance, step up spending on programs that can create jobs faster than others, like highway resurfacing rather than highway construction, which requires more planning.
Mr. Reich spoke of using his discretionary authority over some fraction of the Federal training funds to expand the programs in California and other states with high unemployment.
The Administration might also ease the rules governing direct Government lending and banking regulations. That could encourage private-sector borrowing or spending. Altering tax rules is another option.
An advantage of trying to manipulate tax collections is that they can be used to affect incomes quickly, but the effects are very diffuse. Other measures, like providing temporary breaks that encourage businesses to spend now rather than later, may be effective, but would require Congressional approval.
One option under review, which would also need Congressional approval, is the widening of an existing capital gains rollover provision for sellers of stock who apply the proceeds to invest in poor urban areas.
But as the planners acknowledged, the potential impact of the possibilities they are considering is overshadowed by the slowing of Government spending and the tax increases in the 1994 budget.
As the budget official said, "The Government in its contractionary state doesn't have a lot of capacity to provide that kind of stimulus."
 
Leveraging a Limited Influence
 The rationale of the planners is to be prepared and to make better use of what they have to help the economy, parts of which are clearly struggling.
"It does make a lot of sense to have a contingency plan in place," said John Taylor, a Stanford professor who served on President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
But they are less sure that tinkering with timing and rewriting a few rules would have a significant effect or whether it would be worth it. For one thing, the scope might be smaller than the advisers think.
"I have a little less confidence on tax collections having much effect than the timing of defense expenditures," Professor Taylor said. "But both of them, relative to $6 trillion economy, are fairly small."
Tinkering with timing could come back to haunt the economy, as in fact it did in the case of the Bush Administration measures. In retrospect, they bolstered the economy as it was already gathering steam and then hurt it this spring as military procurement plunged in the first quarter and income growth stalled in the second.
"It's pretty clear that the Bush people tried to goose up defense and they did get faster growth for a quarter or so," said Jonathan Makin at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington. "The problem with doing that is that more now means less later."

For Jefferson, the Presidency Held Second Place

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Thomas Jefferson
A Life
By Willard Sterne Randall
708 pages. Henry Holt & Company. $35. 
 Writing his own epigraph, Thomas Jefferson omitted the fact that he had served as President of the United States for two difficult terms. Instead, he listed as his achievements that he was author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia statute of religious freedom and father of the University of Virginia. To some modern historians, Jefferson doesn't quite make the summit of the very greatest American Presidents. In their view, Jefferson's true greatness -- his ideas about an enlightened people's government -- preceded his Presidency.
We learn why in Willard Sterne Randall's welcome one-volume biography, "Thomas Jefferson: A Life." It was hardly possible to surpass the language and power of the Declaration, written a quarter of a century before Jefferson became the third President. Have there ever been more idealistic phrases than "all men are created equal" or "the pursuit of happiness"? Both defined the new nation's aims.
Mr. Randall's frequently repetitious book shows that no President was better prepared for the job. Jefferson was a delegate to the first Continental Congress, the drafter of the Declaration of Independence and of a draft of a constitution for Virginia, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Governor of Virginia, the Minister to France, an advocate of a Bill of Rights for the Constitution, the Secretary of State, a founder of the Democratic-Republican party, the Vice President of the United States and the president of the American Philosophical Society (an honor that gave him greater pleasure than the American Presidency). His succession to the White House almost came naturally.
Yet Mr. Randall, a popular historian whose previous books include "A Little Revenge: Benjamin Franklin at War with His Son" and "Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor," points out that Jefferson was elected only after a vicious political campaign. He was pilloried for his unorthodox religious views, his scholarly interests, his devotion to democracy and his cultured tastes. The charge of atheism in a nation still dominated by its clergy was most devastating. The mudslinging included printed and whispered charges that Jefferson, a slaveholder, maintained a "Congo Harem."
Any life of Jefferson written today must confront the question of Sally Hemings. How much credence should be given to the theory that the slave girl was Jefferson's concubine and that he was the father of her children? In "Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History," Fawn M. Brodie attempted to prove the rumors to be true by deduction and guesswork and, in "Sally Hemings," Barbara Chase-Ribaud wrote a novel that turned the theory into fiction.
Mr. Randall gives the fanciful tale of a Jefferson-Hemings sexual relationship the right amount of space: very little. In less than two pages, he argues that the original accusations were politically motivated and the "evidence" was built on a house of canards. "She was only 8 when Jefferson last resided at Monticello and was mourning his wife's death," he writes. "Unless Brodie was suggesting that Jefferson consoled himself by having an affair with an 8-year-old child, the whole chain of suppositions is preposterous."
On the far more controversial subject of Jefferson's ownership of slaves, the biography descends into hagiography: "Jefferson's views on slavery had evolved over the years as he wrestled with America's worst problem. As a young lawyer, he had argued in court the birthright of freedom of all men that he had imbibed from his study of the classics. As Governor of Virginia, he wrote in his 'Notes' racist views of blacks as inferiors who would need to be treated like children once they were freed gradually. Now, an old man, he worried about the growing dissension over slavery that had flared into angry debate in Congress over the admission of Missouri as a slave state."
After decades of public service, Jefferson was broke and in debt at the end of his life. Unlike Washington, who had been able to free his slaves in his will, Jefferson as a debtor had lost the ability to grant his slaves freedom as his dying wish. But he pleaded with his creditors to be generous and grant his deathbed request to free his personal servants, to give them the tools of their trade and to build houses for them near their work.
Mr. Randall's biography strikes a balance between Jefferson's personal and public life. His five years in France are filled with interesting facts; he was an intellectual match for France's philosophes. To be sure, the author devotes a good deal of attention to Maria Cosway, Jefferson's great amour in Paris. The secret letters that passed between them, their carriage rides, rendezvous and romance are described in loving detail.
But Jefferson worked hard as a diplomat; when he became President, his knowledge and contacts abroad enabled him to be, in effect, his own Secretary of State and led to his greatest triumph, the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Jefferson's political opponents said it was unconstitutional, but the new western lands doubled the size of the United States and brought greater freedom and economic independence from the Old World that Jefferson -- America's preeminent aristocrat of the mind -- so distrusted.
The most original section of Mr. Randall's book describes Jefferson's underestimated years as a lawyer on the frontier and in many trailblazing court cases. According to his perfectly preserved casebook, Jefferson handled nearly a thousand cases between 1767 and 1774. Without Jefferson's training and knowledge of the law, the Declaration of Independence might not have been written with its brilliant legalistic as well as humanistic design.

HEADLINE: Chamorro and Foes Settling Disputes, Smoothing Way for Talks With Sandinistas

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In negotiations to resolve the political crisis consuming Nicaragua, the Government and its conservative opponents are reaching agreements on issues that have divided them for months.
The talks, which began last week, turned today to some of the most serious differences between the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and the center-right coalition that supported her election in 1990, then broke with her last year. 
 If some key issues are resolved, officials say they will join in a three-way "national dialogue" on the country's most pressing political and economic problems as early as Monday. The third party involved is the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front.
"The pressure of the people, the church and the international community is forcing us to move forward," said Nicaragua's Finance Minister, Emilio A. Pereira, one of the Government representatives to the talks.
Nicaraguans, impoverished by years of economic decline, have been demanding that politicians end the bickering that has destabilized the Government and scared off potential investors.
The infighting dates from early 1991, when the center-right alliance that brought Mrs. Chamorro to power began to withdraw its support, complaining of a continuing Sandinista presence, the Government's failure to return properties confiscated by the Sandinistas, and other issues. Conservative parties abandoned the National Assembly altogether last fall, forcing Mrs. Chamorro to govern with the help of Sandinista legislators.
Pressure for a political settlement rose last month when former rivals from the country's civil war each took dozens of hostages in a standoff that lasted nearly a week. But what appeared to have quickened the pace most was Mrs. Chamorro's sudden assertion of control over the Sandinista-dominated armed forces.
On Thursday, Mrs. Chamorro outraged Sandinista leaders by announcing that next year she would remove their main representative in her Government, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, as chief of the army.
A handful of Latin American and European Governments have been prodding the factions for months to work out their differences. The United States, which has threatened to cut $98 million in aid pending an investigation of possible Nicaraguan ties to terrorism, has also begun pressing for a settlement.
Heightening the uncertainty over the aid was an announcement by Nicaraguan officials late Saturday that they had found a safehouse outside Managua where hundreds of weapons and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition were stockpiled. Officials linked it to the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, the alliance of small rebel armies that has been fighting the Guatemalan Goverment since the 1960's.
It was the most recent of 24 safehouses and arms deposits to be found in Nicaragua since one belonging to former Salvadoran guerrillas blew up on May 23 beneath a Managua auto-repair shop. Documents found in the cache suggested that Sandinista security officials may have aided foreign guerrilla groups involved in kidnappings and terrorist activities.
Mindful of the high stakes for Nicaragua, the Presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica are sending senior envoys to Managua on Monday for the start of the three-way dialogue. The Secretary General of the O.A.S., Joao Baena Soares, is to arrive on Tuesday.
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations have agreed to join the Latin American envoys in overseeing the dialogue and verifying any agreements that emerge from it.
After agreeing to terms for the international verification, Mrs. Chamorro's Government and the center-right National Opposition Union reached an accord Saturday on expanding the country's Supreme Court to dilute the control of Sandinista justices. They have also made progress on plans that would give the coalition greater representation in the administration.
But negotiators have yet to resolve the most contentious issues, including a demand by the coalition for the resignations of nine centrist legislators who split from it last year to support a working alliance between Mrs. Chamorro and the Sandinistas. Mr. Pereira said Mrs. Chamorro had no legal autority to compel such resignations.

HEADLINE: From Signs to Pistols, Cash-Short Cities Sell Past

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Souvenir toe tags from the coroner's office. Espresso bars in libraries. Used manhole covers for sale as coffee tables. Inch-thick steel bars from an old jail, priced at $5 each. And a sheep parade.
As government budgets shrink in hard times, many cities and towns are looking for new ways to raise money, and they are finding them. 
 Old parking meters, traffic lights and fire hydrants that once were sent to the dump are becoming surprising sources of revenue as souvenirs. Government records and data like zoning maps that used to be provided free now often carry a price tag.
The concept of the "city store," pioneered in San Diego, is catching on, with items like old voting machines, stop signs or fire helmets on sale.
 
Bullet-Riddled Signs
 In the San Diego store, bullet-riddled signs reading "Discharge of Firearms Prohibited" sold out so quickly that replicas are now being manufactured and sent to a police firing range to acquire bullet holes.
Among the best-selling items at the City of Chicago Store are bricks from the old Comiskey Park, where the White Sox once played. Among recent customers, Bill Williams, a restaurant owner, bought one for $19.95 as an investment, saying, "When these things are gone, they're gone."
Doug Peterson, a senior policy analyst with the National League of Cities in Washington, said, "Cities and counties are discovering that consumers and businesses are willing to spend big money on things they never before thought they could sell."
The idea is to get away from taxes, said Dr. Costas Toregas, director of Public Technology Inc., a nonprofit company in Washington seeking to improve technology in municipal governments. "Instead of taxing individuals," he said, "the idea is to create economic activity which enlarges the revenue pile."
 
Cat and Dog Products
 In Los Angeles, a county official, Dusty Brogan, has received a grant to help create money-making schemes for agencies that include the Public Defenders office, which markets a new video conferencing system, and the Animal Control Department, which has begun selling carrying boxes for cats and designer dog tags.
"In the early 80's a lot of government agencies didn't want to touch this stuff," Ms. Brogan said. "But as the fiscal crisis continued, they've had to start thinking not just about spending money but about making money. It's the key to our survival."
Many municipalities have not yet ventured beyond tried-and-true auctions of stolen vehicles and "garage sales" of surpluses, including computers or library books or snowplows.
And some money-making schemes are drawing criticism. For example, police departments are selling off thousands of used revolvers as they upgrade weapons, buying semiautomatic pistols to match firepower with criminals.
 
Risks for the Taking
 But traditionally cautious bureaucracies must begin taking risks like companies in the private sector, Ms. Brogan said.
Her star example is the office of the Los Angeles County coroner, which has been overwhelmed by the demand for its $5 personalized identification toe tags reading "This could be you," its $20 beach blankets with the outline of a body and its $5 gold-and-white lapel pins bearing the coroner's seal.
The success of the sales may help keep alive a program, threatened by budget cuts, that gives educational tours of the morgue to teen-agers convicted of drunken driving.
Marilyn Lewis, executive secretary of the coroner's office, said that success had fired the imagination and that workers were considering expanding into body-bag sleeping bags, boxer shorts with the logo "the undertakers" and T-shirts that read, "When your day ends, ours starts."
She said departments around the country had called for ideas about starting similar programs.
 
Success in Atlanta
 Atlanta has had an unexpected success in selling tens of thousands of souvenirs bearing the "Whatizit," an odd-looking blue mascot for the 1996 Olympic Games, which are being held in the city.
In Arkansas, the little town of Evening Shade, 100 miles north of Little Rock, is capitalizing on being the namesake for a television series and has raised $430,000 through the sale of 195,000 cookbooks and 1,000 T-shirts.
The cookbooks have rescued the school district, which serves 300 students, after a cut in state financing left it with a $45,000 deficit. They have also paid to build a new gymnasium.
In keeping with the new spirit of municipal entrepreneurship, the 73-year-old Kanawha County jail in Charleston, W. Va., is being sold off in pieces after it was closed last July.
The county Administrator, Richard A. Atkinson, said the sale, scheduled to begin late this month, would include 100 brass cellblock keys, made in 1920, at $20 each; 170 steel doors weighing 350 pounds each, at $25, and "an infinite supply" of inch-thick steel bars, at $5.
"A fraternity could use it for their bathroom," Mr. Atkinson said of the doors. "Some people might want to wear the keys as jewelry. Someone who spent some time there could wear the key as a necklace and say, 'Wish I had this when I was in jail.' "
Some enterprising officials have converted their government agencies into thriving businesses. In San Leandro, Calif., a city of 75,000 people south of Oakland, the main library recently opened a 60-seat cafe in an outdoor atrium where bookworms can relax with coffee and pastry.
"Government libraries are all suffering," said David R. Bohne, director of the San Leandro library. "The money I make in the cafe we'll plow right back into books and tapes."
The cafe has been so successful that the library has hired two employees to run it, despite a $30,000 budget cut. And Mr. Bohne has begun branching out into a catering service and plans to open a for-profit business services center at the library in November.
Espresso is also saving a government program in Seattle. Operating in government buildings, young people from inner-city areas sell coffee from carts that have been donated by private companies.
Since June, the carts have been earning about $1,000 a week, which is being used to keep alive programs that provide inner-city recreational centers.
 
Stopping Street-Sign Theft
 Several cities are finding that replicas of street signs are big sellers. For example, New York's program, begun as an effort to pre-empt street-sign theft, has become a significant money-earner for the Department of Transportation, generating $60,000 over the last two fiscal years.
The most popular signs, said Joe DePlasco, a Transportation Department spokesman, are Broadway, 42d Street and Wall Street. The last, coincidentally, is also the most stolen street sign in the city, he said.
Smaller towns have their own approaches to raising money. In Reedpoint, Mont., home to just 90 people, citizens held a sheep drive today at which 2,000 sheep were paraded down the main street. Last year, booth fees and an auction at the sheep parade netted the town $9,000, which was used to buy a water truck for the volunteer fire department and double the size of Reedpoint's library.
All of this innovation may look a little laggard to the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, which has been turning its own detritus into profits for the last decade.
To avoid escalating costs of waste disposal, it began composting its daily tons of manure into "Zoodoo" and selling it to gardeners. The program pays for itself, said Lanayse Cipolla, a spokeswoman for the city, and contributes $20,000 a year into the general fund.

HEADLINE: Auto Talks Hang on Health Costs But Workers Are Loath to Chip In

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Since learning last year that he had multiple sclerosis, Andy Torok has become less and less steady on his feet, and his worries have accumulated along with the hand prints on his apartment's white walls.
But as Mr. Torok has shuttled among specialists, sampling different steroids and undergoing test after test, he has not had to give a single thought to how much his health care costs. 
 Mr. Torok, who had to stop working in March, is a member of the United Automobile Workers union, so he has paid nothing.
"Not a dime," said Mr. Torok, 39, who lives in Davison, Mich., just north of here. "I'd be downright scared to know what it's costing."
 
 
The Biggest Private Spender
 The automobile companies, which have kept careful track of the cost of caring for their workers, profess to be plenty scared. Mr. Torok's employer, the General Motors Corporation, is the largest private purchaser of health care in the United States, having spent some $3.7 billion last year. Just for its union members, G.M. health care costs amount to $711 for each car and truck that it builds in North America, or about what G.M. charges for air-conditioning on a small Chevrolet.
A total of more than a million hourly workers, retirees and family members from G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation pay little or nothing for almost all of their treatment, from an examination for a sore throat to open-heart surgery.
Now, as the Big Three negotiate a national labor contract with the U.A.W. this fall, the companies are insisting that workers chip in -- a proposal the union steadfastly rejects.
Union leaders say that their members paid for their benefits by accepting them instead of wage increases. For the aging workers, existing health benefits are not only a prized financial cushion but a stirring symbol of their union's accomplishments. In fact, union officials argue that their system -- which has held the rate of growth in health care costs for auto workers below the national rate -- could serve as a national model.
If there is a strike this year, union and company officials and financial analysts say, health care is the issue that will provoke it. "When the company says co-payment, a lot of U.A.W. members hear strike," said Harley Shaiken, a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in labor relations. "We may be backing into a serious dispute."
The issue is how best, given existing benefits, to limit costs. The companies insist that asking workers to contribute each time they seek care will force them to be more selective. The union contends that the companies can better control costs by using their leverage as huge purchasers of health care -- much the way the Canadian Government controls prices.
Already, the union and the companies have made some progress controlling costs by encouraging workers to move into managed care plans like networks of doctors and hospitals or health maintenance organizations.
Meanwhile, the eyes of health care reformers are upon them. "Everyone interested in health reform is watching these negotiations," said Dr. Paul Elwood, president of the Jackson Hole Group, an influential coalition of health care industry executives and analysts. "It indicates how flexible the unions are going to be about health care reform" -- an important factor, he said, since the Clinton Administration has paid close attention to organized labor's health care concerns.
Health care experts, Dr. Elwood said, have long viewed the U.A.W.'s benefits package as contributing to rising health care costs because of its lack of controls. Without some mechanism for encouraging workers to choose the cheapest plan available, he said, costs would continue to grow.
As it is shaping up, the Clinton plan would have no effect on the auto workers' benefits during the term of the next contract. Down the road, it would force them to pay Federal income tax on benefits that exceed those in a standard package guaranteed to all Americans. In addition, in another sharp departure from current law, employers could not take tax deductions for money they spend on the extra benefits, Administration officials have indicated.
"The Clinton plan would not require auto workers to share in the cost of health insurance," Dr. Elwood said. "It lets labor off the hook."
The companies have repeatedly said they cannot wait for national health care reform to control their costs.
"It's the fastest-increasing item of our employment cost," said a top Ford executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the contract talks are under way. Ford is leading negotiations with the U.A.W.
On average, the Big Three pay about $5,700 a year per worker for health care, according to the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. In 1992, the national average health care cost per employee was $3,968, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins & Company. While no reliable figures exist for Japanese auto makers' average health care costs, they are believed to be far less than those of the Big Three.
Some form of cost-sharing, the companies argue, will discourage unnecessary doctors' visits by workers. But the union predicts that that approach will only generate greater costs later on -- when that slight chest pain, ignored by the penny-pinching worker, turns into cardiac arrest. Bargaining with providers and encouraging workers to go to health maintenance organizations, union officials point out, has helped the companies hold the rate of growth in health care costs for auto workers below the national rate in recent years. At G.M. for instance, where 36 percent of the work force is in some form of managed care, the annual increase in health care costs has averaged 8.7 percent since 1985 compared with 12.7 percent nationwide.
Union leaders and members are adamant that they will never pay more. "We fought too damn hard for health care," said Mr. Torok, who spent most of his 17 years with G.M. assembling housings for air filters.
And the comprehensive benefits, he said, were necessary, particularly for workers who spent many years laboring in conditions that can be miserable. "They're a lifesaver, there's no other way I can say it," he said. "Because of them, I'm getting the care I need."
Mr. Torok is young for an auto worker, and his generation, he said, is often criticized by older workers for taking their union and its hard-fought gains for granted. "But people my age are about to find out what it's like to fight for what we have," he said.
 
No 'Gift From Heaven'
 In a meeting with reporters last week, Owen F. Bieber, the president of the U.A.W., bristled when asked how he could expect the average American, with less generous benefits, to understand the union's ironclad position on sharing costs.
"This wasn't just a gift from heaven, or a gift from the companies," Mr. Bieber said. He argued that workers had paid for the benefits over many years, in effect, by taking them in lieu of wage increases. "If the American public understood that we paid for this, then I hope they would accept the fact that we're entitled to it."
Furthermore, Mr. Bieber pointed out, the union has been pushing Washington to institute national health coverage.
 
Wages Among the Highest
 The companies counter that while union members may have sacrificed for the benefits, they are nevertheless among the nation's best-paid manufacturing workers. At Ford, for example, the average assembly line worker makes about $17.01 an hour, or $48,065 a year, with 35 paid days off.
Mr. Bieber and other union representatives are now closeted with Ford negotiators, trying to replace the current three-year contract, which expires at 11:59 P.M. on Sept. 14.
The companies have taken steps to try to control costs on their own. Ford, for example, has used its influence as a big buyer of prescription drugs to try to cut drug prices, the company's fastest-growing health care expense.
But Big Three auto executives worry that they may have exhausted their ability to extract such savings.
Increasingly, these executives and union officials say, the union has cooperated in efforts to control costs, and their efforts have at least succeeded in slowing the rate of increase. Despite its blanket condemnation of co-payments, the U.A.W. has recently permitted minimal co-payments -- $2 or $5 -- for prescription drugs for many workers.
The union has also encouraged workers to join plans in which the companies can negotiate with the providers over prices. Mr. Torok, for example, can consult a specialist only after his primary-care physician has seen him and given him a referral.
 
 
Panels of Doctors
 The union and the companies have also held down the costs of foot care by setting up panels of doctors who perform specific treatments at set rates. Workers who go elsewhere must pay part of the cost. A similar approach has limited the cost of treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.
But the union has refused to force workers into more such programs. And many of the managed care programs that are in place have not come cheap; G.M. has found that most of them cost more than traditional coverage.
Efforts at the local level to root out the source of high costs have often been equally unsuccessful. "It's about like trying to grab an octopus -- he's going to grab you back," said Jim King, president of U.A.W. Local 663 in Anderson, Ind.
Mr. King spent two years on a joint union-management task force examining health care costs in Anderson, but the group finally disbanded. "I guess with the frustration of not being able to make a dent in it, it kind of gave out," he said.
Still, he added, "We do share management's concern, and we are working to try to get it down."
 
 
Shared Sacrifice
 For G.M., the need to control health care expenses is particularly urgent. Last fall, the company imposed co-payments on its salaried workers, and John F. Smith Jr., the company's president and chief executive, indicated he would see that the sacrifice was shared by the blue-collar workers. If the new contract includes no cost sharing, morale among G.M.'s salaried workers may suffer.
G.M. also has a far greater economic burden than Ford or Chrysler, according to an analysis by the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. Because G.M. has so many workers and retirees relative to the number of cars it sells, it pays more than twice as much for health care per vehicle as Ford: $711 compared with $309.
"It's not the U.A.W. workers' fault that it costs so much more," said Sean McAlinden, a research scientist who worked on the study. "It's the fault of people who design cars that don't sell."

His employer, the General Motors Corporation, is the largest private purchaser of health care in the United States, having spent some $3.7 billion last year.

Table: "THE CLINTON HEALTH PLAN: COSTS AND COVERAGE"
 On Saturday, senior Administration officials presented an outline of the health plan President Clinton is to propose later this month. The plan would extend a standard package of health insurance benefits for all Americans.
 The standard package would be paid for by employers and employees through premiums averaging $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 a year for families. Employers would be required to pay 80 percent. Subsidies would be provided for small businesses with low-wage workers.
 Businesses would be able to offer more generous packages, but the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income to employees, and companies could not use them as tax deductions. This measure may be phased in over eight to 10 years.
 Employees would have a choice between high and low cost-sharing plans -- between traditional fee-for-service coverage vs. health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. Those choosing the high cost-sharing plan would pay deductibles of $200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of most services beyond that up to a maximum of $2,000 a year for an individual or $3,000 a year for a family. The patient's share would be higher for some services, like psychotherapy. In the low cost-sharing plan, there would be no deductible, and comparatively small fees for some services.
 Here are the benefits, limits and costs for consumers under the two plans:

The Economy
The Administration's top economic advisers are considering the same types of measures to stimulate the economy that the Bush Administration used during the election campaign last year. Stuck with a tight budget and uncertain economic prospects, the White House may speed up work on military contracts or ease regulations on Government lending, among other steps. The White House hopes to provide small, concentrated doses of job stimulus for selected industries, groups of workers and regions -- California, in particular -- in the event that the economy stalls or job growth fails to pick up as expected. [Page 1.]
As the Big Three negotiate a national labor contract with auto workers, the companies insist that workers chip in for health care benefits. If there is a strike this year, union and company officials say health care is the issue that will provoke it. [1.] 
 Black-owned banks are reaching out to people in other communities as they face new competition for their traditional customers. Paradoxically, a main factor in the competition is a Federal drive to improve banking services to minority communities. [33.]

Others see it as a sport that indulges a primordial urge in a generation uneasy about hunting. [33.]

HEADLINE: Black Bankers Seek Broader Market

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
Citizens Trust Bank, the largest black-owned bank in Atlanta, for the first time in its 72-year history is aiming at white, Korean and Hispanic customers.
Using a new advertising campaign with the slogan "Look to us . . . we listen," Citizens put up 13 billboards in English, Korean and Spanish in minority and predominantly white areas last year. Citizens said it also planned to open two branches next year in predominantly white areas. 
 "We are trying to diversify our base," said William L. Gibbs, the president of Citizens. "It's one way for us to gain a competitive edge."
Citizens is far from alone. In the shadow of growing competition, more black-owned banks are "reaching out for mainstream status," said Samuel L. Foggie, the president of the National Bankers Association, a trade group in Washington that represents minority-owned banks.
A principal factor in the competition, oddly enough, is the Federal drive to improve banking services to minority communities, an effort that some black bankers argue could hamper their efforts to expand and threaten their survival.
The black bankers said they were concerned about heightened enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which mandates lending in underserved areas, and a Clinton Administration proposal to create a network of 100 community development banks. Under an Administration proposal disclosed in July, the existing community development corporations, loan funds and credit unions would also be able to compete for grants from the $382 million pool allotted over four years.
Sylvesta L. Jennings, the chief executive of First State Bank in Danville, Va., said community development banks "could be a problem to us."
"They target the people we have always served," Mr. Jennings said, adding that no provisions were made that "would give banks like mine the capital we need to reach the same people."
Some industry experts, however, said black-owned banks had been slow to develop methods of doing business with large companies and slow to see the potential in affordable-housing loans.
"They tend to wait for loans and deposits to come through the front door," said William M. Cunningham, the president of Creative Investment Research, a Washington-based company that monitors minority-owned financial institutions.
 
'A Very Profitable Niche'
 Community development banks, like South Shore Bank in Chicago, which is not black-owned, exist specifically to provide capital to rebuild low-income areas. These banks found a "very profitable niche in making loans in a black area," Mr. Cunningham said, "and proved that some black banks were not adequately meeting that need."
Indeed, many black-owned banks have tended to aim at the wealthiest and most creditworthy black customers while turning away poorer applicants for fear of losing money on risky loans.
Citizens, which had $127 million in assets in 1992, experienced problems with bad loans over the last three years. "We were slow to recognize the problems," Mr. Gibbs said. "People just were not paying their bills."
The challenges for Citizens highlight the precarious position of many black-owned banks. These banks were founded to serve low- and moderate-income blacks who were often ignored by mainstream banks, but they are now increasingly competing with the larger banks, which are responding to pressure from Washington to invest in inner cities.
 
Using Untried Ways
 In response, black-owned banks are turning to previously untried methods to gain strength. Founders National Bank of Los Angeles began aggressively seeking capital from large corporations. Seaway National Bank of Chicago recently entered the municipal bond trustee business, and United Bank of Philadelphia introduced a national credit card in July.
And some are now copying the trends of the larger banks: interstate mergers.
Omnibanc Corporation, the owner of Omnibank in suburban Detroit, said last month that it would acquire the Drexel National Bank, the fifth-largest black-owned bank, and Independence Bank, the third largest, both based in Chicago.
The acquisitions would make Omnibanc the largest black-owned bank holding company, with $288 million in assets, and the only multistate black-owned banking company.
William T. Johnson, the president of Omnibank, said black-owned banks must "gain a wider base of customers, offer more products and lower their costs" to remain competitive.
 
Profits Nearly Doubled
 There are signs of progress. According to Creative Investment Research, the profits at black-owned banks nearly doubled to $14.7 million in 1992, from $7.4 million in 1991. And nonperforming loans at black-owned banks decreased to $36 million in 1992, Mr. Cunningham said, from $43 million in 1991.
In 1992, the 39 black-owned commercial banks in the United States held assets of $2.3 billion and deposits totaling $2 billion, up slightly from $2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits in 1991. In addition, loans grew to $969 million in 1992, from $838 million in 1991.
The top 10 black-owned banks had return on assets last year ranging from a low of a negative 0.28 percent at Boston Bank of Commerce to a high of 1.59 percent at Seaway. That compares with an average return on assets of a little more than 1 percent for banks with less than $500 million in assets in 1992.
 
Loan Quality Problems
 Still, Mr. Cunningham said, while the banks are stronger financially and have "gotten a better handle on their loan losses," many continue to "experience some management and loan quality problems."
Banking services have gradually disappeared from inner cities. Between 1977 and 1989, for example, the number of banks in low-income areas declined 10 percent. Savings and loan institutions shrank by nearly a third, and mortgage companies declined by nearly a half.
And some large urban areas are without a major black-owned bank.
Since the collapse of Freedom National Bank in Harlem in November 1990, for example, there has been no black-owned commercial bank in New York. Carver Federal Savings Bank in Harlem, the largest black-owned financial institution in the country with $321 million in assets, is the sole savings and loan.
 
Criticisms From Fed
 That is particularly worrisome to black would-be borrowers aware of the longstanding criticisms of mainstream banks accused of not providing home loans in minority areas.
A report released by the Federal Reserve Board last year found that of the 7.9 million mortgage applications in 1991, more than a third of the applications from blacks were rejected, compared with 17 percent of those from white applicants. Even among blacks with high incomes, 23 percent were rejected, compared with 10 percent of wealthy white applicants.
In response, some large banks have increased their lending to members of minority groups. Chemical Bank and Bank of America reported recently that a larger percentage of their home loans went to minorities in 1992. But Citibank, which tightened its lending requirements last year, said that one result was fewer loans to minority-group members. It turned down 67 percent of all black applicants and 63 percent of Hispanic applicants for mortgage loans in 1992, Citibank said.
Gilda Haas, the founder of Communities for Accountable Reinvestment in Los Angeles, says black-owned banks have the clear advantage because they are "closer to the street and can act faster." Ms. Haas, who is white, and her husband obtained their mortgage loan from a black-owned savings and loan.
The bankers "know the community," Ms. Haas said. "And the community knows and trusts them. The banks aren't these huge bureaucratic voice-mail operations."
 
Cautious Lenders

 
 But that does not mean the institutions are quick to lend. Drexel National Bank, with $128 million in assets, for example, had a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 28 percent during its first quarter, which ended March 31, according to Ferguson & Company, a financial data publishing and consulting company. Independence Bank, with assets of $137 million, had a ratio of 31 percent. The loan-to-deposit ratio for all Chicago banks with less than $500 million in assets was 60 percent.
Jacoby D. Dickens, the chairman of Seaway, the largest black-owned bank with $202 million in assets, said it often lost loans in a fierce battle for the best black customers.
"The bigger banks get them because of their exposure and big advertising budgets," Mr. Dickens said. "That puts us at a great disadvantage."
He added: "The big banks can out- market us and out-advertise us in every way. When an individual thinks about a mortgage, they don't necessarily think about Seaway, they think about Citicorp."
Bruce A. Gottschall, the executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, agreed that Seaway lost some potential customers. But he said he felt "there needs to be more outreach and more counseling assistance to lower-income people who may have situations that need more attention, such as past credit problems or unstable employment."
 
Capital Is a Challenge
 Mr. Gottschall added that there was enough business to go around. "The costs need to be spread across the board," he said.
Maintaining adequate capital is a challenge for black-owned banks, said Carlton J. Jenkins, the managing director at Founders, because "none of the traditional sources of capital, such as investment bankers, large black corporations, high net-worth investors, pension funds and mutual funds have ever seriously focused their resources on minority banks."
Corporations have only recently focused on certain banks for deposits.
In December, the Atlantic Richfield Company invested $1 million in Founders in return for nonvoting preferred stock and said it would match new capital investments made by other corporations this year. Bank of America also recently purchased $1 million in nonvoting preferred stock in Founders.

HEADLINE: Coping With the Endless Summer;
Parents, Teachers and Students Are Left Scrambling

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
Thursday, the day school was supposed to begin, looks pretty good for the Watson family of Brooklyn: Terry Watson, a 45-year-old music therapist, has to work only three hours that day, so she figures she will take Peter, her 8-year-old son, along with her. For a few hours, Adam, 11, could fend for himself.
Friday gets trickier: Mrs. Watson's schedule that day prevents Peter from going with her again, so he might have to go with his father, David, to his job at Dun & Bradstreet, a financial information company. But Mr. Watson is uncertain how the bosses would feel about a third grader, whose temporary snake tattoo is flaking off his tanned arm, mingling with men in suits. So Peter could possibly go to work with Mrs. Watson's sister, or in a pinch, to the office of Mrs. Watson's mother. No one is sure.
 
Rush for Child Care
 Adam, however, would likely stay with a friend, Josh Pomerantz. Josh's mother is a public school teacher, and in this time of confusion and frustration brought on by the asbestos crisis and the delay of school, she will definitely be at home.
"I don't know," Mrs. Watson said this weekend at the family's home in Ditmas Park. "Maybe I'll send them all to Mayor Dinkins's house." 
 Around New York City, nearly a million children cheered last week at the news that school's opening would be pushed back at least until Sept. 20, as workers try to complete the monumental task of inspecting and cleaning up schools with exposed asbestos. But for parents and some students, the delay means trouble: a rush for child care, a few days off from work, worry about missing classes as exams for college or prep school loom or the prolonged anxiety of a new school year.
And among teachers, there is confusion about how the asbestos inspections are progressing at their schools, long-term concern about their health and more immediate questions about their paychecks. With little definite information but plenty of word-of-mouth, many are outraged at how the Board of Education has handled what some call the asbestos mess.
 
From Inconvenience to Chaos
 "What are we supposed to believe?" asked Claire E. Sylvan, a teacher at International High School in Long Island City. "The central board has done a typically ridiculous job informing people. It's unbelievable that they waited until three days before people were supposed to report to tell them not to report."
Until school opens again, pools will stay open, summer recreation programs will be extended, museums and zoos will offer free admission. But in ways large and small, the postponement -- the first in two decades -- has disrupted the rhythms and routines of hundreds of thousands of families. For some, the delay is inconvenient. For others, like the Watsons, it is a logistical nightmare.
 
A Mother's Worries
Disabled Son Will Miss Therapy
 Camelia Flye loves her three boys dearly but is quickly reaching the limit of tolerance. An unemployed single mother, Ms. Flye remembers a hot day in July when she passed through the entrance of her building in Morningside Heights -- scribbled with graffiti announcing "Crime Pays" -- and walked up five flights of stairs to her apartment.
Inside were more children than she could count. They were everywhere, listening to hip-hop, playing video games, being as loud as children are. The possibility of two more weeks, maybe more, of her children out of school in their cramped apartment, seems like more than she can take.
"I'm telling you, I'm looking for a rest," said Ms. Flye, 45, who moved to New York City 20 years ago from St. Louis. "With three boys, it gets to be kind of rambunctious around here."
Tired as she is, her main concern is her 10-year-old son, Jamil, who has emotional problems and is on medication for hyperactivity. He was enrolled this year at Public School 188 in a new program for children with special needs. And like many parents of children with disabilities, Ms. Flye worries about the effects of his missing two weeks of therapy.
As she sees it, the recent problem is just one more sign of neglect in the public schools, a problem that she said ranges from a poor curriculum for special needs children to lead. Now it is asbestos that endangers already tenuous futures, she said.
"Nothing surprises me anymore with the schools," said Ms. Flye, whose other children are 11 and 17 years old. "Most public schools are dominated by blacks and Latinos, so who cares? Most of us are poor, so who really cares?"
"What I'm hoping is that when school starts, the schools are safe, that the repairs are done and nothing like this happens again," she said. "Because what has happened is like attempted murder on children."
 
Fears of Two Teachers
Years in Classroom With Asbestos
 Edie and Shel Haas grew up in the Bronx and have happily taught public school there nearly their entire adult lives. Now, a week after asbestos inspectors sealed off 18 rooms in Mrs. Haas's elementary school in Parkchester, she is looking back with a little worry at her 26 years there.
"A lot of adults have been there for a very long time," said Mrs. Haas, 55, who seems concerned, yet determined to brush it off like a good New Yorker. "I don't have the breath that I had 26 years ago. It could be age. It could be asbestos. We can't tell. I also have allergies I never had. Is that because of asbestos? We don't know."
Her health had never been an issue until last week, when the rooms at Community School 47, including room 213, where she taught for eight years, were closed because of asbestos. She is "not terribly worried," but outraged because she said the central board had issued a report about asbestos in the school two years ago.
"All of a sudden to make this big thing, it's ridiculous," she said, sitting in her home in Fort Lee, N.J. "Everybody knew about it and that's making people angry."
"This is part of a larger problem -- the upkeep of the schools," said Mr. Haas, 63, who last year was an acting assistant principal at Intermediate School 116.
The delay has not been a problem for the Haases, who said they had a relaxing summer of trips and visits with their three grandchildren. But like most teachers, they wonder how it will affect their students. Mr. Haas is concerned especially about students who must take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests in October.
"It hasn't inconvenienced us," Mrs. Haas said. "But we're also in a state of limbo. When can we get into our rooms? When can we start our planning sessions? How are the kids going to react? That's our worry now."
 
A Mother's Doubts
Size of Problem Fully Recognized?
 This much was certain as Lillian Lopez set out on a school shopping expedition with her two sons on Saturday: Julian Albert, 12, needed a pair of high-tops, and Conan Albert, 8, needed scissors and construction paper. Less clear, after a roller-coaster week for Ms. Lopez, was exactly when school would start.
Ms. Lopez, who lives in Sunset Park, is a member of the Parents' Asbestos Steering Committee, a group that attends meetings of the officials directing the inspection. Last week, she received dozens of calls from frightened mothers and fathers. But even she had few answers.
"I seriously doubt that schools will open Sept. 20," she said as she ate at a diner with her sons before going shopping. "I've been to all the meetings, and let me tell you, nobody realizes the magnitude of this problem."
It is a problem that affects Ms. Lopez, a single working mother, as much as anyone. Even before the asbestos crisis, she wondered: Could she beg a friend to take them swimming? Could her daughter Sheri, 16, buy groceries and cook dinner?
"Now it's 100 times worse," said Ms. Lopez, director of a group providing technical assistance to parent groups in the city. "I can't believe that school's not going to start yet."
And she is not sure what to do for the next two weeks. She cannot afford a baby sitter so she may take a few days off, or take them to work or find spaces in a public recreation program. Either way, it will not be easy.
But her sons are overjoyed. As Julian piled french fries on top of his pizza burger, he ticked off his plans. "I can go to work with my mom and write stories on her computer," said Julian, an eighth grader at I.S. 136.
"I can watch TV," shouted Conan, who will be in third grade at P.S. 1. "I can mess around!"
By the time he finished eating, Julian had second thoughts. "If you want to know the truth, I'm sick of being with Conan," he said, giving his brother a gentle shove. "I'd rather be in a war than stay home with him for two more weeks."
 
A Teacher's Concerns
Will Postponement Affect Paycheck?
 Stacia Robbins, a teacher at International High School, was pleased with a two-week orientation for new students, many of whom do not speak English. Youngsters from countries like Poland, China, Colombia and Russia started out shy and withdrawn, but by Friday, the last day, they seemed comfortable.
Then she had to tell them that school would not start for at least two weeks. "They were disappointed," she said. "I think it's hard on the kids because they are psyched up."
But Ms. Robbins has her own worries: A payroll problem has held up money she earned teaching summer school, and she has to pay $500 for a course to keep up her state teaching certificate. And she doesn't know if the delay in school's start will also mean a delay in her paycheck.
"I have to pay this and I don't have the money now," said Ms. Robbins, 55, who began teaching eight years ago. "I'm concerned about our paychecks. I'm a single mother and I live check to check."
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said teachers will still be paid as if school were in session. But Ms. Robbins's apprehension seemed to underscore the general lack of information echoed by parents and teachers alike about the asbestos inspections and when school will begin.
Ms. Robbins, who lives in Park Slope, counts herself generally lucky in this problem. Financial worries aside, it means she will get to spend a little extra time with her 15-year-old daughter, Alycen, who attends Edward R. Murrow High School. But she hopes the delay does not drag on.
"I just want them to stick with the 20th as the starting date and not move it back again," she said. If so, she said, "it would make everybody really angry and really crazy."
 
Student's Boredom
Eager to Return To Math and Plays
 Andrea Vialva, 12, has had it with summer. She is plenty upset that she will not be returning on Thursday to I.S. 227 in East Elmhurst, Queens, where she gets good grades, likes math and participates in plays.
"I want to get back to school," said Andrea, of Jamaica, Queens, who will be going into seventh grade. During summer vacation, she said, "you have fun for like two weeks and then you start getting bored."
Her parents are also upset, not for boredom, but because they want their daughter to get the best education possible. Her mother, Anne, said she thinks especially about the entrance exams to preparatory school, which Andrea plans to take to get into St. Francis Prep in Queens.
The exams are a year away, but with competition stiff from other students, some in parochial schools, which are not closed because of asbestos, Mrs. Vialva feels that every day of instruction counts.
"My whole concern is that she gets all that's due to her in the seventh grade," said Mrs. Vialva, a native of Trinidad. The family also has two other children, both in college.
The delay in school has also thrown off Mrs. Vialva's own extensive preparations for school. She already bought her daughter a new pair of dress shoes, new Nike sneakers, two book bags (one for strength and durability, the other because it was a little more fashionable), two flannel shirts and six pairs of pants. She also had to change plans because she intended to take off the first day of school to get to know her daughter's bus driver.
Now she said she feels a sinking confidence in public schools, which she said have long been the victim of neglect and poor administration. Echoing the opinion of many parents, she said asbestos is just one problem.
"I blame the whole school system," she said. "They had the whole summer to take care of this. It's nothing that just happened yesterday."

HEADLINE: Running for Governor As a Spectator Sport

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Governor Jim Florio and his Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, are paying consultants big money, so they probably won't be seeking free advice on how to run their campaigns for governor this year.
But if they did . . . 
 Mr. Florio would be told that he should loosen up, and Mrs. Whitman would hear that she should stop listening to her family and be more confident. Although their subjects vary, fashion consultants and former governors give advice that sounds remarkably similar.
Both candidates scheduled visits to the shore on the last big holiday weekend to meet voters and to say goodbye to what former Gov. Thomas H. Kean called "summer training" for the "tough, tough grind" of long days crisscrossing the state until Nov. 2.
As the gubernatorial campaign begins in earnest the Whitman strategists hope to revive voter anger over the $2.8 billion in new taxes that Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature a few months after taking office in 1990. The Florio campaign wants to portray Mrs. Whitman as being out of touch with New Jersey voters and lacking the experience and the policies that could solve state problems.
 
Big Taxes vs. Big Wealth
 In her stump speech, Mrs. Whitman says the Governor showed poor judgment in raising taxes as the state was heading into a recession. She said his decision killed jobs and elevated the unemployment rate.
The ensuing tax revolt enabled Mrs. Whitman to come within a few percentage points of upsetting Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, even though she was little known.
The Florio campaign is determined to define Mrs. Whitman's image this time, and to make it unflattering. Mr. Florio has called her both soft on crime and the candidate of the National Rifle Association. He also frequently refers to her wealth.
 
Style Tips for the Road
 Voters still expect to be wooed in person by the candidates, even though television ads are supposed to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to molding opinion and building support. And as long as they must take their campaigns on the road, Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio might benefit from some tips on how to improve their appearances, keep their energies up and sharpen their campaign strategies.
Both Neil Upmeyer, director of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues, a nonpartisan public interest group in Princeton, and former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, a Democrat, said Mr. Florio should interject more humor in his public appearances.
"My advice to Jim is to lighten up and try a little self-deprecating humor, to smile more and to try to make government more understandable, something people can relate to," Mr. Upmeyer said.
"He should try to not be so formal and serious. He also should avoid sloganeering, which he seems to be a master of."
 
The Wit of Brendan Byrne
 Mr. Byrne, who in two terms acquired a reputation as a master of the one-liner, often aimed at himself, also urged Mr. Florio to try a bit of humor. "I remember in one of my campaigns I visited a sewage treatment plant in Camden that had a concrete floor and I said, 'I'm finally standing on my opponent's platform.' "
Mr. Upmeyer said his first piece of advice to Mrs. Whitman "is to stop listening to the family kitchen cabinet and start following your own instincts." He said that Mrs. Whitman, who has been under withering attack by Democrats in recent months because of her wealth and the tax breaks she received on her rural estate, should try to avoid being put on the defensive by the Governor.
Mr. Upmeyer attributed the perceived overreaction to Florio tactics, in part, to the influence of her brother, Webster B. Todd Jr., who is her campaign manager. He said some of her gaffes could have been avoided if she had made more decisions herself.
"She has to be more self-assured about how she would run the government and exhibit confidence in her ideas about the direction she would lead the state," he said. "She should lay out ideas and defend them."
Mr. Byrne said his advice to Mrs. Whitman would be not to be too detailed and specific, something he said hurt the campaign of his 1977 Republican opponent, Raymond H. Bateman, the former State Senate President. Mr. Bateman spent much of the campaign explaining a 17-point plan to replace the state income tax signed by Mr. Byrne.
 
It Worked for Annette
 "If she gets too specific it will just be a setup for Florio," Mr. Byrne said. "He knows the job and how to pick it apart." The former Governor also said that the state's clean beaches were the first thing people mentioned when they said they told him they intended to vote for Mr. Florio. "He should get his picture taken on the beach and use it often," he said.
But analysts and ex-governors aren't the only people with ideas for Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman. Domenic Santucci, owner of the Leading Man and Woman hair salon in Montvale, said Mrs. Whitman should adopt a different hair style. "She a very attractive woman, but her hair style makes her look older," he said. "She needs to be softened up a bit."
Mr. Santucci said, however, he wouldn't change a hair on Mr. Florio's head. "He has what we used to call a sculpture cut," he said. "It's the brush-back, conservative style, an image that is very, very corporate, stylish and businesslike. It helps him and, along with the way he dresses, improves his credibility."
Wardrobes that resist wrinkles and can be mixed and matched are important during long days on the campaign trail, said Joan Phillips, the personal shopper manager for the Nordstrom Menlo Park store.
 
'8 Easy Pieces'
 Ms. Phillips said Mrs. Whitman should think of "eight easy pieces" built around a jacket, two skirts -- straight and pleated, a pair of trousers, a casual shirt, a blouse, a sweater and a string of pearls. Throw in some scarves and belts to change color accents and a candidate could survive days of campaigning without going home for a wardrobe change.
Cynthia Wheeler, Nordstrom's Northeast regional fashion director, said sturdy, comfortable shoes are a must for both candidates and said newer models of women's shoes have stronger heels that should make it easier for Mrs. Whitman to endure long hours on her feet.
Ms. Wheeler said the Governor should consider wearing a vest as the weather turns cooler to cover shirts that may become wrinkled. She also suggested that he buy heavier ties to hold knots better and those with a woven and not a printed pattern.
Before they leave home each day the candidates should eat a good breakfast high in carbohydrates and low in fat, said Kathy Tigue, a registered dietician at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, "like a bagel without the cream cheese, whole-wheat bread or cereal and fruit instead of juice to get some fiber."
 
And Skip the Junk Food
 Also, get some exercise, even in short bursts, like a walk around a building or up and down a couple of flights of stairs. And, skip the junk food and doughnuts, she said.
Still, appearances can only go so far, and Mr. Kean voiced the hope that the two candidates would take a serious approach to the issues, saying the state's problems with school financing, taxes, housing, and government integrity need to be resolved. "They have a lot to talk about."
Dr. Clifford Zukin of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University used the analogy of size, depicting the campaign as a contest to see which candidate is taller or bigger in ability, with Mr. Florio's stature being better known.
"The only way for him to be bigger than she is on Election Day is to make her smaller, to go after her credibility, to cut her down," he said. "He's pretty fixed on how tall he is in the eyes of the voters."
 
'Is She Acceptable?'
 Mrs. Whitman's task is to show she is a credible alternative to the Governor, and can do the job.
"If the question is 'Do I like him for four more years?' and the answer, as in Reagan's case, is, 'Yes,' then he has no problem," Mr. Zukin said. "But if, as in Bush's case, the answer is, 'No,' then the only question remaining is, 'Is she acceptable?' "
"She's should campaign on the gut level and not be distracted by bond investigations -- people don't understand bonds -- or school formulas," Mr. Zukin said. "She should say he made bad decisions and the economy is bad; he used bad judgment and I can govern."
"Florio should say, 'I stood up to the N.R.A.; some people may not like what I've done, but I'm a tough guy and I'm right for New Jersey'," Mr. Zukin said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Drops by Queens On the Endorsement Trail

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins took his campaign to the far northeastern corner of Queens yesterday to pick up an endorsement and to try to sell himself to a somewhat skeptical crowd.
Mr. Dinkins received the enthusiastic endorsement of Borough President Claire Shulman, speaking to a white, largely Jewish audience at the Deepdale Gardens Community Center Pool in Little Neck. Ms. Shulman said Mr. Dinkins "has integrity, he has decency, he has honesty and he really cares about the people of this city." 
 The endorsement by Ms. Shulman, a longtime supporter and ally of the Mayor, was expected. It followed what has become a pattern in the Dinkins campaign, a strategy of rolling out almost daily one prominent public official or union leader after another to endorse the Mayor and cultivate the image of a bandwagon of support.
For the Mayor, such endorsements have been virtually the only source of favorable coverage in recent weeks, during which he has been hit with a succession of crises.
Last week, for example, Fire Commissioner Carlos M. Rivera resigned and defected to the camp of the Mayor's opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, accusing unnamed mayoral aides of being anti-Hispanic. Before that, the Mayor was reeling from troubles over a contract in the city's Parking Violations Bureau, an uproar that led to the resignation of his budget director and the demotion of another aide.
 
Carefully Timed Support
 Leah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Dinkins campaign, said that the endorsements were mostly unsolicited. But she added that the campaign has been involved in their timing, placing them close together, day after day. That timing, she said, was intended to remind the public that Mr. Dinkins has a broad appeal.
"The idea is to build momentum," Ms. Johnson said. "It's a show of support, a show of the diversity and the breadth of support he has around the city."
In recent weeks, endorsements have come from such officials as former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone. And more endorsements are scheduled, Ms. Johnson said.
At yesterday's endorsement, the Mayor received polite applause from about 200 people, who sat in swimming attire beneath large, colorful sun umbrellas on a deck below the pool. He offered his stump speech about how crime had diminished during his administration, how the libraries were open six days a week for the first time in decades and how he had made difficult budget choices during a bruising recession.
Before the Mayor's arrival and even during his talk, many in the audience quietly criticized the Mayor for what they considered a deterioration of city services and dismissed his visit as a meaningless attempt to get votes.
But Mr. Dinkins took what was, for him, the unusual step of spending nearly two hours chatting informally with people on a leisurely stroll through the pool area. The Mayor not only engaged in the typical campaign rites of kissing babies and shaking hands, but he also took questions about crime, services and the racial disturbances in Crown Heights.
Some who said they had been inclined to vote against the Mayor said they were nonetheless impressed that he had spent so much time in their community.
"This is precisely what the Mayor needs to be doing here," said Sheldon S. Leffler, a Democratic City Councilman who accompanied the Mayor and whose district includes the Little Neck area. Mr. Leffler, who said he had not yet made an endorsement of a mayoral candidate, said that "there is some skepticism about him here, but this might help a little bit."

HEADLINE: Deal Seen For Renault And Volvo

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Renault of France and Volvo of Sweden are expected to announce on Monday that they will merge, seeking to forge a combined operation strong enough to weather a deep downturn in the European automobile industry and intensifying worldwide competition.
Industry executives said that the two sides continued to meet today and that the long-rumored deal had yet to be completed. But the companies scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon at Renault's headquarters outside Paris.
 
Fourth Biggest in Europe
 News reports from Stockholm and Paris said Renault, the much larger company, would have a 65 percent stake in the merged venture, to be known as Renault-Volvo Automotive. Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, would hold the title of executive chairman and wield primary control over the new company. Volvo's chairman, Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, would become chairman of the supervisory board. 
 Assuming it does not fall victim to a last-minute snag, the deal would create the world's sixth-largest car company and the fourth largest in Europe, after Volkswagen, General Motors and Peugeot. The merger will be the latest example of a trend that has seen smaller auto makers like Volvo seek links with the largest manufacturers.
 
 
U.S. Sales Are Down
 The merger, however, would have little impact on car sales in the United States. While Volvo continues to enjoy a reputation for safety and durability, its sales in the United States have fallen by nearly half in the last five years. Last year, Volvo sold about 65,000 cars in the United States, giving it a market share of less than 1 percent. Renault withdrew from the United States car market in 1987, when it sold its stake in a joint venture with American Motors to Chrysler.
Renault and Volvo have been closely linked for three and a half years through investments in one anotherand a strategic alliance intended to capitalize on their respective strengths. Volvo is stronger in larger, more expensive cars and is most established in northern Europe. Renault is stronger in small and midsize cars; France, Italy and Spain are its core markets. The companies have put particular emphasis on using their combined influence to reduce costs in buying components from suppliers.
 
 
Rivals in Trucks
 The fit is not so neat in trucks, a big business for the two companies. They are fierce competitors in many markets, including the United States, where Renault owns Mack trucks and Volvo controls 83 percent of a truck-making venture with General Motors, the Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation. It was unclear whether the overlap in trucks would raise antitrust concerns in the United States or Europe.
The deal comes at a time when European auto makers are scrambling to survive the steepest downturn they have suffered in decades. Sales of passenger cars are expected to fall at least 16 percent in the European Community this year. European auto makers have been laying off workers and seeking to squeeze more efficiency out of their production lines, components-purchasing operations and design programs.
If the cyclical downturn alone were not enough to motivate them, European auto makers also face a competitive onslaught from Japan. Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor have invested heavily to build plants in Britain to make cars for the European market and have been able to capture 11 percent of the market despite an agreement by Japan to limit its auto exports.
Under the agreement with the European Community, however, restrictions on Japanese cars will be lifted in 1999, giving auto makers like Renault and Volvo even more urgency to search for lower costs and more design, marketing and distribution might.
For Renault, the merger would be the last big step in whipping itself into shape for privatization by the French Government in the next several years.
After years of losses that left its survival in doubt, Renault has turned itself around since the late 1980's. The company holds a little more than 10 percent of the European market and has had particular success recently with two new models: the Espace mini-van and the Twingo, a mini-car designed for the crowded streets of European cities.
While Renault has revived, Volvo has been growing sicker. At home, Volvo has suffered from the worst recession in Sweden since the 1930's. Abroad, the auto maker has found itself increasingly uncompetitive on price because of its high labor costs and low production volumes.

HEADLINE: Textile Talks With China Stall Amid U.S. Warning

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Two days of talks here have failed to make any progress toward a textile agreement that could cut an estimated $2 billion in Chinese exports to the United States.
On Saturday, Jennifer Hillman, chief textile negotiator for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, warned that without a trade agreement to replace the one that expires at the end of the year, the United States could unilaterally and substantially reduce quotas for Chinese textiles. 
 In addition, Ms. Hillman said at a news conference here, if the United States was confronted with unabated quota cheating by Chinese manufacturers using Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao or other "transshipment" ports to hide the origin of their goods, the United States could in each case reduce China's overall quota by three times the value of illicit shipments.
 
U.S. Threat
 Chinese officials reacted strongly today to Ms. Hillman's warning, reported by the New China News Agency, that the United States would not sign a textile agreement that did not include stiff penalties for quota violations.
"The Chinese Government resolutely opposes the U.S. action to unilaterally reduce quotas for China without consultation with the Chinese side and without presenting clear evidence," Shi Guangsheng, the vice minister of the Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation, said in a statement carried by the agency.
"The illegal transshipment of textiles is a complicated issue involving importers, exporters and middlemen," he added, "and many such cases are plotted and conducted outside China. China and the United States, therefore, need to seek cooperation from third countries to crack down."
Ms. Hillman's comments cast doubt on whether China has been genuinely pursuing the quota violators who are among China's new tycoons. In many cases, these businessmen work hand in hand with public officials cashing in on the country's manufacturing boom.
She said United States officials had yet to see results from Chinese efforts to stanch the growth of quota violations and added that the Chinese "must do more."
"We very much believe it is in China's interest to get an agreement," she said, but no date has been set for the next round of talks.
 
$6 Billion in Exports
 Last year, China exported about $6 billion in textiles to the United States, of which $4.57 billion were allowed under a 1988 agreement. Ms. Hillman estimated that $2 billion in Chinese textiles reached the United States by passing through one or more of 40 countries or territories where transshippers could obscure the country of origin to help their Chinese supplier avoid quota restrictions.
Mr. Shi, the vice minister, said China had banned quota cheating and had formed investigation teams to deal with factories, trading companies and individuals involved in illegal shipments.
As for the talks themselves, the American negotiators tabled a proposal that called for cutting China's textile quota by 25 to 35 percent and eliminating all annual growth and flexibility clauses that have led to large increases in Chinese exports to the United States. The American proposal was described by Zhou Keren, the director of trade administration in the ministry.
Mr. Zhou, quoted by the official news agency, said Washington's demands for enforcement violated existing trade agreements as well as "the principle of cooperation" and "are definitely not acceptable to China."

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Disputed New Role for Polls: Putting a Price Tag on Nature

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
How much is a Pacific sea otter's life worth -- not someone's pet, but a wild animal that will never be studied by scientists or frolic in front of tourists? Could the Government find out by asking people in Plattsburgh or Peoria how much they would voluntarily fork over to keep the otter safe from unnatural hazards?
Until recently, such abstract questions have mostly been grist for academic debate. But now Federal regulators are under orders from Congress and the courts to figure ways to measure losses to people not directly affected by environmental problems like oil spills or haze in national parks. The first set of guidelines, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is due later this month and is widely expected to support the use of survey-based techniques. 
 So with little fanfare, "contingent value" measurements of "passive uses" of the environment are on the verge of becoming an accepted tool in the making of public policy. They may also become a potent weapon in large pollution-liability suits.
For three decades, scholars and environmentalists have suggested that failure to account for benefits for "nonusers" could lead to systematic underprotection. If passive uses are ignored, said Alan Randall, an economist at Ohio State University, it would encourage "the riskiest enterprises in the most pristine environments."
What is new is the ambitious use of opinion surveys to measure passive-use benefits. In 1989, a Federal appeals court ordered the Department of the Interior to rewrite regulations for assessing damages under the Clean Air Act and the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup program. The loss of passive-use value, the court said, was to be included if it could be "reliably calculated."
The subsequent drive to bring survey-based measurement into the corridors of power is drawing praise from environmental groups and has even gained the cautious imprimatur of some prestigious scholars. "You can learn quite a lot from a well-done contingent-value study," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who is advising the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the use of such studies.
 
 
Bitter Division
 But the approach has bitterly divided professionals. "Economists just don't want to admit there is stuff that cannot be measured," argued Zvi Griliches, a teacher of statistical methods in economics at Harvard University and a consultant to the Exxon Corporation.
Such surveys are anathema to industries that produce, use or transport toxic substances. If damages are measured by contingent-value surveys, warned Charles J. DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, "junk science will gain a companion -- junk economics."
But plaintiffs in big environmental- damage suits suspect that a pot of gold is waiting under the contingent-value rainbow. The State of Alaska commissioned a $3 million study of what Americans who will never visit Prince William Sound lost from the Exxon Valdez disaster, teasing out the numbers by asking more than 1,000 people in a random sample how much they would pay to avoid a similar accident over the next decade.
When pressed, the typical respondent put the figure at about $30. The state thus inferred that Americans would collectively be willing to pay about $2.8 billion. If that was true, Alaska argued, Exxon should be liable for $2.8 billion beyond the billions spent to restore oil-soiled beaches.
While the survey drew praise from some quarters -- Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future in Washington, called it "far and away the best contingent-value study I've seen" -- Alaska's tactic was never tested in the adversarial setting of a courtroom; Exxon settled the liability suit for $1 billion before the survey was introduced as evidence. But the sums at risk focused businesses' attention on the threat posed to them by such surveys.
The oil industry, in particular, is sparing no effort to get across its message that contingent value is at best a gravy train for consultants, at worst a legal bomb that will blow apart the Great American Prosperity Machine. "If you applied this methodology to any human activity, you could stop it dead," Mr. DiBona said.
 
 
Saying, Not Doing
 Are the critics right? Most economists are indeed inclined to look at contingent value with a jaundiced eye. They have traditionally relied on market transactions to reveal value, and for an obvious reason: anyone who buys bananas at 39 cents a pound must think they are worth at least 39 cents a pound. Survey techniques, by contrast, are inherently limited by the fact that the conclusions are based on what people say they would do -- not on what they have done.
To demonstrate that contingent value does not reveal what courts and policy makers want to know, Exxon hired an army of brand-name economists to test its mettle. While the sponsor's bias must be kept in mind, the newly published research certainly does touch on a variety of widely acknowledged pitfalls in the technique.
Peter Diamond and Jerry Hausman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology point to the public's inclination to be overly generous with hypothetical outlays. They note, for example, that a mail survey found 6.6 percent of fishing-license holders in Montana would be willing to pay to protect healthy water flow in two rivers. But just 1.1 percent selected randomly from the same group actually responded to a request for donations.
 
 
Wide Range of Responses
 Another flaw is the extreme sensitivity of the results to the way the questions are asked. In particular, people seem willing to pay implausibly large sums if they are not carefully reminded of the broad range of possible environmental damages and the practical limits of their own incomes.
Walter Mead of the University of California at Santa Barbara points out that one major study pegged the nonuse value of saving old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest at $119 billion to $359 billion. Sparing the whooping crane from extinction was valued at $51 billion to $715 billion.
 
Tough Standards Proposed
 Still another pitfall is the apparent irrationality of survey respondents. If a little preservation is worth something, both economic theory and common sense suggest that a lot ought to be worth a good deal more. Yet William Desvousges and a team of colleagues from the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina found the public's willingness to pay to save 2,000 migratory birds from oil-coated ponds -- a well-documented pollution hazard -- was as great as their willingness to save 20,000 birds or 200,000. "No matter how you skin this cat, you get incredible anomalies," Mr. Hausman of M.I.T. concluded.
But practitioners are not about to fold their tents. "There are good contingent-value studies and bad contingent-value studies," insisted Raymond Kopp, an economist at Resources for the Future who worked on Alaska's study of Prince William Sound. "The technique works as well as any other empirical methodology."
And earlier this year, fans of contingent value got a big lift from a blue-ribbon panel of economists with no financial stake in the issue -- a lift that assures the technique will be treated with respect by the courts.
Acting under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to write damage-assessment rules for oil spills, the agency invited six economists, including two Nobel Prize winners, to advise it on contingent value. Their January report lays out tough standards for credible surveys -- standards virtually no survey to date would meet -- and urges the Government to conduct benchmark studies of its own. The economists concluded, however, that "contingent-value studies can produce estimates reliable enough to be a starting point for a judicial process of damage assessment."
The regulators are not obliged to adopt the panel's recommendations when they issue rules. But it would be the bureaucratic path of least resistance. And if, as is widely expected, the agency does follow the recommendations, the Interior Department would probably adopt parallel standards for damage assessment on toxic waste and air pollution violations. Indeed, the failure of either agency to defer to the panel's expertise would open it to legal challenges from one side or the other.
 
 
Courts Are Reluctant
 The impact of the new rules is anyone's guess. Opponents take heart from both the heavy burden of credibility imposed by the panel and the reluctance of Federal courts to carve out precedents. Where big money is involved, moreover, defendants will have every incentive to hire experts to punch holes in the evidence. "I believe that no contingent-value study will ever meet the courts' standards," said John Seddelmeyer, associate general counsel of Exxon USA.
But Mr. Seddelmeyer may be whistling in the wind. "I see great potential for mischief here," conceded Mr. Portney of Resources for the Future, who was a member of the blue-ribbon panel and, in principle, supports the contingent-value approach.
Mr. DiBona of the petroleum institute is not shy in speculating about the potential consequences. While the chances of getting hit hard with a damage award for lost passive use may be low, he argues, the sums involved are so large that they are bound to affect commerce. At the least, the legal exposure would raise insurance premiums, he said, and the risk might well render it impossible for some industries to obtain insurance.
That might lead Congress to rethink the very idea of linking damage awards to the pain felt by Americans when they learn a wilderness has been sullied or a species endangered. But then again, maybe not.
"I can think of no instance in which Congress has relaxed environmental regulation," said Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. "It's just not politically correct."

HEADLINE: No to a Higher Tax On Capital Gains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Raise Capital Gains Tax and Cut Deficit" (letter, Aug. 20), Harold Pepperell's plan to increase the capital gains rate to 40 percent, would have the opposite effect from what he forecasts. What incentive is there to sell an asset to take advantage of a 28 percent capital gains tax rate when you will have to reinvest your diminished proceeds with the happy prospect of having future capital appreciation, if any, taxed again at 40 percent? This is a losing game. 
 More likely, a lot of the "liberated" capital would disappear abroad to friendlier climates, such as Germany and Japan, where there are no capital gains taxes. Alternatively, the capital gains would stay unrealized and pass through the investor's estate, where there also are no capital gains taxes.
And what would Mr. Pepperell say to all those homeowners who might think of selling homes that over the years appreciated in value. This is the average American's most important asset. Like common stocks, it has been a hedge against inflation. Should homeowners have to hand the Government 40 percent of their inflation-induced gain? That isn't taxation. It's capital confiscation.
Perhaps the most distorted of all Mr. Pepperell's statements is that "raising the capital gains tax does not hamper economic growth." The incentive to invest is the prospect for profit. New money constanty comes into the market, seeding investment opportunities, but if the profit incentive is removed, new money, as well as profits generated by old money, will seek employment in other places.
If Mr. Pepperell wants to find a way out of the deficit morass, he should think of how to stimulate economic growth through attracting new saving and investment. The prescription for this is to eliminate the capital gains tax entirely or, at least, index capital gains on all types of assets, so that savers and investors are not taxed on upward valuations that reflect only the impact of years of inflation.

HEADLINE: Health Care -- By-And-By

 BODY:
The autumn leaves won't be blowing across Lafayette Square for a while yet, but Washington is already aflutter with contradictory advice for President Clinton on his legislative agenda.
Some of it is malicious. The Republicans would like to scuttle health care. The Perotistas and a peevish lot of Democratic House members would like to humble Mr. Clinton on the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Some of it is confused. Senior economic aides want a big push on Nafta while the top political advisers want Mr. Clinton to stick with his health care mandate and not get sidetracked on a trade bill inherited from President Bush.
And on every side, one hears warnings of a rough new beast from Congress that lopes alongside the dread monster known as Gridlock. This new critter, called Overload, is said to batten on the unselective yearnings of an Oval Office novice.
So what's a President to do? Well, it wouldn't hurt to take another look at the worst-of-all-worlds agenda being pushed by his top advisers. Their plan calls for Mr. Clinton to put his prestige on the line to press for Nafta as the main must-pass legislation for the fall. His big health care address in late September would be used not to introduce legislation but to initiate deliberations that would not produce a vote until mid-1994. Some essential parts of the Clinton campaign package, like reforms to reduce the role of special interests, do not have a prominent place on this agenda.
Do history and current political realities suggest that this is a sound approach? Not really.
First, consider Nafta. The treaty is worth passing, but not at great cost. It could wind up looking like a Clinton version of President Carter's treaty on the Panama Canal. Mr. Carter spent huge political capital on the treaty. The problem was that no one really cared about the canal, except possibly Ronald Reagan, who used its surrender as a club against Mr. Carter.
So who cares about Nafta? Certainly not organized labor or environmentalists or the Democrats who represent them. This is, after all, Bush legislation rooted in the tradition of Republican free traders. A canny decision would be to let Senator Bob Dole and his fellow Republicans do some heavy lifting and to saddle House Speaker Tom Foley with the responsibility for the troubled House. Mr. Foley, after all, is supposed to keep order among the Democrats, and right now his whip, David Bonior, is rounding them up to oppose their President.
The next task is to get health care on a faster track. This issue, not trade, is where Mr. Clinton should risk defeat. We have just finished eight months of largely secret talks about how to reform health care. To promise another 12 months of deliberation invites public disenchantment. Yet the current plan is to use Mr. Clinton's health care speech to outline the principles of the program rather than its legislative design.
Something is amiss here. Mr. Clinton has a passionate commitment to create a health care system that would stand as a monument of American social legislation. The American people want that to happen. So by what logic does it follow that he should be gambling his less than abundant supply of prestige on Nafta rather than health care?
Here is one answer: Some White House aides fear that Mr. Clinton does not have the votes to pass his program. They hope that a victory on Nafta, with Republican and Democratic votes, will make him look like a bipartisan muscle man.
But it is really a strategy for the faint of heart. If Mr. Clinton sticks to it, that speech on health care better be a doozy. In it, he will have to explain why it was smart to throw out a do-nothing Republican for a by-and-by Democrat.

HEADLINE: In the Council's Court

 BODY:
New York's City Council will begin earnest consideration tomorrow of a proposal to expand the present National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. The U.S. Open belongs in New York City and every effort should be made to keep it here. That said, this is a huge and complicated transaction. The actual lease has been available for study for only a few days. The Council must therefore approach the deal in a genuinely agnostic spirit.
The two main questions are these: Does the deal represent a wise use of valuable public land? And is it free of political logrolling? 
 There's no disagreement on one point: The Open generates more than $100 million for the city in economic activity annually and several million more in direct tax revenues. But what about the deal itself? The city will allow the United States Tennis Association to lease and develop 42 acres on the present site -- a small footprint in a park of more than 1,000 acres altogether, but a considerable investment of valuable public land. The city and state will also put up $15 million for roadway and other improvements.
For its part, the U.S.T.A. would provide the entire $172 million to build the facility and put another $8 million into a trust fund for the park. It would raise the money mostly through tax-exempt bonds and would be solely responsible for the repayment of principal and interest. Carl Weisbrod, the city official who hammered out the deal, says that this is an unusually attractive feature: Most new sports facilities are largely underwritten by host governments, at some cost to taxpayers.
The U.S.T.A.'s estimated tournament revenues are $74 million, from which it will pay debt service, other costs and rental fees to the city that will amount to about $1 million a year. Mr. Weisbrod says that's a fair price for the two months the U.S.T.A. will actually use the place. But the Council needs to press Mr. Weisbrod about the revenue downstream and to ask for figures from comparable deals.
There's also one troublesome catch -- a provision requiring the city to rebate part of the rent if the Federal Aviation Administration fails to divert the noisy air traffic above the center. In the past, the noise has led to threatened player boycotts, and tennis officials want protection. The F.A.A. has been redirecting traffic since 1990. But what if it changes its mind?
Numbers aside, the proposal is regrettably caught up in the backwash of the Parking Violations Bureau scandal. The main reason is the involvement of Sid Davidoff, a crony of the Mayor and a lobbyist for the U.S.T.A., and Ellen Baer, who was recently demoted from her job as chief of staff to First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel for allegedly improper behavior during the parking mess.
Ms. Baer is also a close friend of Mr. Davidoff and her resume describes her as the "primary liaison" in the tennis negotiations. Mr. Davidoff has taken the wholly unacceptable position that he will not talk about his dealings. The Council has an obligation to determine that Mr. Weisbrod was in fact the main negotiator and that Mr. Davidoff did not use his friendship with Ms. Baer to secure a cushy deal for the U.S.T.A.
The Open has brought and will continue to bring economic and psychic benefits to a city in considerable need of both. The Council's duty is to make sure those benefits are real; it should take this lease as the starting point for its inquiry, not the final word.

HEADLINE: Congress Facing Heavy Schedule Of Tough Issues

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Congress will return from vacation on Tuesday to confront the heaviest variety of complex legislative issues it has faced in many years, while hoping to improve its standing with the public by seeking solutions to the nation's toughest problems.
None of this fall's issues may prove to be as challenging as the budget bill, which barely passed in both houses last month. But the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement may be as close, and the health care overhaul may be even more complicated, even though both may well attract a level of bipartisan cooperation all but unseen in the 103d Congress.
 
Heavy Fall Schedule
 The scope of the agenda awes many lawmakers. Even without health and trade, Congress will have a heavy fall schedule with commitments to act on these issues: 
 *Additional spending cuts, which will be needed because in August Congressional leaders fell $4 billion short of their goal of $500 billion in deficit reduction.
*Crime and handgun control, which will be back after a Republican filibuster killed the legislation in the Senate last year. The House passed the measure 205 to 203 in 1991.
*Campaign finance, with neither party wanting to give the other any possible advantage and incumbents generally seeing the current system as satisfactory because it elected them.
*Procedural changes within Congress itself, but like legislation on lobbying and campaign spending, this seems to many legislators like pandering to noisy reformers.
*Immigration, but while there is widespread agreement on the need to tighten up on phony claims of asylum, the agreement begins to unravel with the tugs of civil liberties claims.
The priority list does not stop there. The savings and loan cleanup still needs money. The extension on unemployment benefits is about to expire. Republicans fear that education legislation is aimed at too much national control. And abortion is almost certain to cause sharp legislative battles.
One reason the 103d Congress faces so many contentious issues is that once the Clinton Administration was in office, Congress quickly disposed of the easy ones -- all the bills that it had agreed on last year but that President George Bush had vetoed, like family leave and simplified voter registration.
Once the Senate passes the final version of the national service bill on Tuesday or Wednesday, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut, a chief deputy whip, said, "I don't think anything easy is left, even appropriations."
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, worries that if all the Clinton Administration priorities are acted on, "You're going to have us fighting battles all over the Congressional map."
 
Drowning Other Issues?
 Attracting sufficient public attention for issues beyond trade and health is the frequently voiced Congressional concern.
Among those expressing concern is Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is seeking action on crime, immigration and access to abortion clinics. "I just hope the whirlpools of Nafta and health care won't drown everything else," he said.
One of the capital's serious students of Congress, Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution, said he thought legislators might be selling themselves short. Mr. Mann said that while it would have been impossible to do the budget and health care simultaneously, the current agenda is not too big.
"Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time," he said. "The Congress always handles many things at once."
Although "the media is all hyped to the story of 'overload,' " Mr. Mann said, "Congress is a decentralized body, capable of processing a whole lot of things at once."
An internal view of the problem of "overload" was offered by the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who said last week that he had just returned from climbing Maine's mile-high Mount Katahdin.
"You were up so high and it was so forbidding," Mr. Mitchell said, "so if you looked beyond the next rock, you might not take a step." He said the lesson that veteran climbers gave him to take back to the Senate was, "Take it one step and one handhold at a time."
If Republicans are true to their word, some of the steps this fall may prove less slippery than the legislative terrain Mr. Mitchell had to tramp through this spring and summer with President Clinton's economic stimulus and budget bills. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said home-state residents he had been talking with were "pleased that we have some issues we may work together on."
The trade agreement is one. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, said of the pact, "The President can count on more support on our side than his side."
It is more than an opportunity to appear cooperative, although Republicans have been concerned that their antagonism to many Clinton programs was stamping them as obstructionists.
The trade agreement, basically negotiated by Mr. Bush, is a measure that Republicans can approach with enthusiasm. Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said that the last six months were "a real downer," but that the trade agreement would show "it's a good thing to have Republicans engaged in the business of governing."
Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said of the trade agreement: "It's good for the nation, and it's good for jobs. There is a certain wry pleasure we will get out of seeing the Democrats lash their President."
The trade agreement is a special case in bipartisanship because of its Republican origins.
On health care, Republicans will be responding to a Democrat's proposal, and Mr. Chafee says he believes there is enough "commonality" in Mr. Clinton's ideas and those of Republicans to offer hope of success. Among those who seem to share that hope is Mr. Dole, who said, "I've been telling everyone to keep their powder dry" so there would be an atmosphere conducive to compromise when the time comes.
Some House Republicans have been less diplomatic, criticizing the program in advance as one that will raise taxes and cost jobs.
Even some Democrats are wary. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said he would prefer to deal with welfare legislation before health care. Although he accused some Administration officials of treating welfare reform like "bait for the bubbas," he said it was a manageable issue that the public really cared about.
Cooperation will not be realized without political gamesmanship. For example, when Congress gets around to considering more spending cuts, as leaders promised before the budget vote, Republicans will be ready to score points by proposing things like changing the law that keeps payments for Federal construction projects high and keeps unions happy.
But something more may happen with spending cuts. And even internal changes, once derided as eyewash, may actually get a push from House leaders.
There are hints of a lesson in the August reception of Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, the freshman Democrat from a Republican district outside Philadelphia who cast the 218th and decisive vote for the budget bill.
At the time, Republicans mocked her by chanting, "Bye, Bye Marjorie," and they ridiculed the promise she had extracted from the President before voting with him: that a conference would be held on how the big-benefit programs could be cut.
But she said the reaction from her constituents had improved as the August recess wore on. After news reports of how one member or another had sought a tax break or some special consideration for constituents, she said, "To exchange a vote for what amounts to principle is not what people readily expect of us."
She said, "It surprises people that I would put my seat on the line" by casting an unpopular vote for tax increases and spending cuts. But the current large group of Congressional freshmen, far more than its elders either now or when they were freshmen themselves, does cast risky votes.

HEADLINE: INVESTMENT SOARS IN MUTUAL FUNDS, CAUSING CONCERNS

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As millions of Americans pour money into mutual funds at a record rate -- nearly $1 billion a day -- concerns are growing that the funds are bringing new risk to the savings of many people and instability to the markets in which they invest.
A whole generation of savers, seeking alternatives to the 2 and 3 percent returns available at banks, is now being transformed into investors. Since the start of the current bull market in stocks, at the end of 1990, more than $450 billion has poured into mutual funds -- which include stock, bond and money-market funds -- bringing their total assets to nearly $1.8 trillion.
 
 
First-Time Investors
 But as the money mounts, so do the concerns. In large part, people putting their money into mutual funds are middle-income and often first-time investors -- betting a larger part of their savings on increasingly uncertain and unstable markets. One in every four American households invests in mutual funds and nearly half of all fund owners earn less than $50,000 a year. 
 "Mutual funds are becoming increasingly responsible for people's savings," said Arthur Zeikel, president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management, the nation's second-largest mutual fund group. "This is a cultural change. There are so many unknowns. Given the huge flow of dollars, more of these people's savings will become more volatile and less stable."
 
Stock Market's Gorilla
 Most of the money for mutual funds has come from the banking system. Nearly $350 billion has been drained from banks since mutual funds took off. And unlike bank deposits, which are Government insured and guaranteed never to lose a penny, mutual funds are bets on the far riskier financial markets, where there is no certainty that investors will ever see all their money again.
There are now twice as many mutual funds -- about 4,300 -- than stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the demand for funds has brought many more into existence, 1,000 in the last year alone. Mutual funds are the biggest buyers of municipal bonds and are an important source of capital for corporate America and for emerging companies, and they provide billions of dollars to the home mortgage market.
But on Wall Street, the worry is growing that mutual funds have become the gorilla of the stock market. Statistics compiled by Laszlo Birinyi Jr., head of his own market analysis firm in Greenwich, Conn., show that the major reason for large price changes in the stock market in recent months has been investments of mutual funds, pushing up prices, rather than the fundamental health of the economy or of the companies whose stocks are traded.
During the 1980's, the stock market was propelled by two dominant players -- pension plans investing on behalf of future retirees and corporations buying back their own stock through leveraged buyouts and takeovers of other corporations.
But that has changed since 1990, as mutual funds have invested nearly $140 billion in the stock markets. Mutual funds account for as much new money going to the stock market as do pension funds and individuals combined.
While mutual funds account for about 10 percent of all stock ownership, they account for 30 percent of the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Birinyi said, and, on hectic days, for more than 40 percent of all trades.
This high volatility results from a troubling aspect of mutual fund behavior: unlike pension funds and individuals, which tend to buy and hold, mutual funds are generally short-term traders. Pressured by yield-hungry investors, mutual funds are more prone than pension funds or individuals to sell a stock when it begins to drop and buy those on the rise -- lest they miss the latest trend and investors flee.
"Funds jump in and funds jump out of the market," Mr. Birinyi said. "This is creating a major degree of stock volatility because all these funds are doing it together. Funds face real pressure on daily performance and this leads to a great deal of short-termism."
Adding to this is the fickle nature of many mutual fund investors. Panicky shareholders can overwhelm a mutual fund with redemption orders, forcing fund managers to sell shares to raise cash, even if they do not think it is wise. Market analysts worry that investors' demands can force more stock sales, pushing down stock prices and fueling the demand for more redemptions, promoting a destructive downward spiral.
"I worry about 1-800-redemption," said Richard Hoffman, chief investment officer at Cowen & Company. "In the old days, an individual stock buyer would go to a broker, who would be a buffer and slow the process down. Now, if the market hits an air pocket, they can run helter-skelter and take the investment decision- making out of the hands of portfolio managers by overwhelming him with redemptions."
Mutual funds are in effect pools of capital that enable an individual investor to divide a single investment among many stocks or bonds, which can be safer than choosing one particular company to invest in.
 
 
Congressional Hearings
 The shift into mutual funds has not gone unnoticed: Congress is holding hearings examining this explosive growth. While this inquiry is described as a "checkup" of an otherwise healthy patient, it is the first time in recent years that Capitol Hill has examined the industry.
Mutual fund leaders have been calling on Congress to increase inspections by the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect an industry that so far has been tightly regulated and free from scandal -- despite infrequent inspections. The industry fears that the explosive growth may entice marginal players into the business, bringing shoddy products and scandal with them.
Industry executives are also worried that the average investor who is benefiting from -- and causing -- the mutual fund boom, may be in for a rude awakening when the markets turn sour. Just as these investors suffered when crumbling real estate prices diminished a large portion of their net worth, the same thing could happen with mutual funds, in turn shrinking their personal net worth.
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the S.E.C., said: "It is essential that individual investors understand what they are investing in. But I worry."
 
 
'They Get Mad, Too'
 And John Bogle, chief executive of the Vanguard Group, based in Valley Forge, Pa., the third-largest mutual fund seller, commented: "Not enough people are aware of the risks. And if investors don't understand risk, they not only lose money, but they get mad, too."
In a series of hearings headed by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, members of Congress, industry representatives and regulators appear to have agreed on an approach to better police the industry, and protect investors by hiring 150 new inspectors -- pending Congressional financing. Now, 107 inspectors oversee the entire industry, or one examiner for every $16.8 billion of assets. The industry wants more. It contends that it pays $81 million to the S.E.C. in fees, but only $18 million of that goes to mutual fund inspection.
Because of scarce resources, inspections are generally limited to only the top 100 mutual fund families. Many smaller and medium-sized funds -- the ones with fewer resources and, hence, the greater chance for intentional or unintentional wrongdoing -- have their books inspected by the S.E.C. only once every four or five years.
 
 
Worry Over 'Fringe Player'
 "There is a lot of concern that new entrants in the business have not been brought up in the mutual fund culture," said James S. Riepe, managing director at T. Rowe Price Associates, based in Baltimore. "We're worried about some fringe player coming in and blowing it. I'm not worried about Fidelity or Merrill Lynch."
One reason for the industry's clean history is that it is the most tightly regulated player in the securities business. The Investment Company Act of 1940, which applies specifically to the mutual fund industry, is considered one of the most comprehensive and successful pieces of regulatory legislation.
Unlike other Federal securities laws, which protect investors primarily through disclosure requirements, the Investment Company Act is far more comprehensive in specifying what mutual funds can and cannot do. Mutual funds face more public reporting, stricter prohibitions and more independent board oversight than other types of securities, and the law gives them a very detailed road map on how to manage day-to-day operations.
Last year, the S.E.C. undertook a major study of the act and concluded that no significant changes were necessary -- although the industry is vocal in its demand for more inspectors.
 
 
'Chilling Effect'
 "Any negative publicity about any fund could have a chilling effect on the warm feelings that the investing public has for the mutual fund industry today," said Mr. Zeikel of Merrill Lynch. "For this reason, S.E.C. resources should be increased."
But the biggest worry for policy makers and the mutual fund industry is that when financial markets go down, new investors will be shocked.
No one, of course, knows when the stock and bond markets will go down and by how much. But all know that they will. "It's like everything else," Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation, said. "You know it's coming, you just don't know when. You can't avoid bear markets forever."
No one in the industry feels that the October 1987 market crash was much of an indicator of future behavior. Redemptions of mutual funds soared but were tempered by clogged phone lines and, within three months of the market drop, stock prices were back at pre-crash levels. Besides, less mutual fund money was in the market in 1987. The industry worries far more about a long-term bear market that grinds down agonizingly and whose downward slide is accelerated by the rush to sell the huge number of mutual fund shares bought since 1987.
"The 1987 experience was not a good prototype," Mr. Zeikel at Merrill Lynch said. "It was a one-time shock to the system. My concern is what happens if you have a long-term bear market like 1973-74." During the 1973-74 bear market, stocks lost about 40 percent of their value, on average.

Municipal bond insurers bask in the glow of falling interest rates.

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
FALLING interest rates have created a warm feeling through the bond market that has spilled over to companies that specialize in insuring municipal bonds.
Shares of MBIA Inc. and Ambac Inc., the largest and third-largest companies respectively in the municipal bond insurance business, rose sharply Friday to close at their highest prices in a year. 
 For MBIA, the gain on Friday of $2.125, to $79.125, extended a streak in which it has increased 16.6 percent, from $67.875, on Aug. 6, the last business day before it held meetings with stock analysts. Ambac stock has been lagging in that period, though it rose $2, to $48.50, on Friday, an increase of 11.5 percent from $43.50 on Aug. 6.
The second-largest bond insurance company, the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, is owned by GE Capital of Stamford, Conn., a subsidiary of the General Electric Company.
The benefit of falling interest rates for bond insurers is twofold.
First, lower rates have led local governments to issue bonds at a record rate. Through August, $194 billion of municipal bonds have been issued this year, up 27 percent from last year's record pace, according to The Bond Buyer, a trade publication. At the same time, the demand for insured bonds has grown to about 40 percent of all new issues, from 15 percent in 1993, largely because the individuals who buy three-fourths of new tax-exempt municipal bonds seem to crave the triple A rating and extra level of protection from default that insurance provides.
Steven Schwartz, an analyst at the Chicago Corporation, said the additional business could be handled with very small increases in staff and expense. At Ambac, whose stock he recommends, expenses in the second quarter were only 17.4 percent higher than a year earlier, while premiums collected from new bonds rose by 74 percent.
Second, about two-thirds of the new bonds are being issued to refund older, higher interest bonds. Bond insurers collect premiums when bonds are issued but they count as income each year only that part of the premium that matches that year's share of the bond issue's principal and interest payments. Ordinarily that means premiums are counted as income over a period of 20 years or more. But in the case of an insured bond that is refunded, all the remaining premium counts as income in the year of the refunding.
At Ambac, which had about 28 percent of the new insured bonds in the first half, refundings made up about a third of its profit, analysts said. At MBIA, with 39 percent of new insured bonds, refundings accounted for about 20 percent of profits.
The greater prominence of profits from refunding at Ambac is one reason its stock is not valued as highly as MBIA, said Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who has a buy recommendation on MBIA. "They both are very attractive companies," she said, but the potential slowdown in earnings at Ambac is greater.
While the decline in bond yields has clearly been a catalyst for the recent gains in profits and stock prices, bond insurance executives are keen to explain -- and many analysts agree -- that refundings are only part of the story. They claim that the future earnings from the rapidly increasing pool of insured bonds, plus the interest from MBIA's $2.8 billion investment portfolio and Ambac's $2.7 billion, are enough to assure investors of gradually increasing earnings.
"We look at the refunding activity as simply the frosting on the cake that makes a good year even more spectacular," David H. Elliott, the president of MBIA, said.
Looking beyond the furor created by declining rates and refunding, analysts at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers said bond insurers stood to benefit in coming years from their central role in a security -- tax-exempt municipal bonds -- that local governments would continue to issue in large amounts and which would be in greater demand from individuals facing higher tax rates.
That condition, as well as expectations of continued low losses from defaulted bonds, and the steady income from investments and insurance premiums collected in the past, has led many analysts to predict that insurers' stock prices should rise to a higher multiple of their earnings. Even after recent gains, MBIA's stock is only about 14 times its expected earnings in 1994; Ambac's about 11 times. Stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index trade at about 16 times the next year's earnings.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT TAKES PLANS TO VOTERS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 6

 BODY:
His Administration under strain and his leadership questioned over his efforts to advance several sweeping and disparate initiatives simultaneously this fall, President Clinton opened a public relations campaign today to portray the diverse aims as interlocking parts of one grand plan.
"In the next few weeks, you're going to see the Congress deal with an enormous number of issues, but they all have one thing in common," the President said here in a brief speech that was styled and delivered like a campaign address. "We've got to deal with them to pull our country together and move our country forward." 
 Mr. Clinton linked passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement with several other Administration measures -- the health care program, the recently announced crime bill and the plan for government assistance in college tuition and job training -- with a rhetorical flourish he repeated four times.
If any of the measures fails to win approval, he said, "we will never be the nation we ought to be."
 
Ambitious Legislative Agenda
 Mr. Clinton's speech echoed the message of his national radio address last Saturday, but today was the first time the President had developed his argument in a campaign-style stump speech. Delivered to a small audience under a broiling sun at an apartment complex in South Miami Heights, the speech was intended to set the theme of the Administration's fall push to win its ambitious legislative agenda.
Lorraine Voles, a White House spokeswoman, said that over the next few weeks the Administration would try to weave a thematic whole out of the free-trade pact, the health care program and the "reinventing government" plan, which is to be unveiled on Tuesday by Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
"We're working on three very important things that we know some people regard as disparate, but which we think are unified in the way they affect the economy," she said. "What the President will try to do over the course of the coming month will be to try to talk about how all three things fit together and to make the case that they aren't disparate."
The plan to streamline the Government may get the bulk of the attention this week, beginning Tuesday, when it is presented at a White House ceremony. Mr. Gore will go to New York on Wednesday to talk about the plan on "The Late Show" with David Letterman on CBS television, and the President and Vice President will travel together later in the week to promote the proposal.
Ms. Voles said that White House strategists were aware that persuading the public to focus on several initiatives at once and in relation to one another was difficult, but that it was essential. "If we don't, the danger is that people will begin to focus on one thing or the other, that they will say, 'There's the Administration focusing on Nafta when they said they would focus on health care,' " she said.
With his relations with organized labor strained over his support of Nafta, the President eschewed an appearance at the Labor Day parade of the sort that is traditional with Democratic leaders, and instead used his speech here to send a friendly message to labor.
He cited a program between his Administration and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Housing and Building Partnership that is being used to rebuild 102 apartments at the Caribbean West apartment complex here as an example of "a new partnership between government and labor." The apartments were damaged last summer by Hurricane Andrew.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton met with residents of Homestead, Fla., the city that was at the heart of the hurricane damage. There, he listened to generally warm thanks for government assistance that has totaled more than $3 billion, numerous suggestions for more aid, and a few minor complaints from more than a dozen residents selected by the White House to participate in a campaign-style "town meeting" with the President, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and the Housing Secretary, Henry G. Cisneros.
 
Waiting in the Heat
 Afterward, Mr. Clinton toured a few blocks in a neighborhood that had been heavily damaged and then spoke briefly to a hundred or so residents who had waited several hours in the oppressive heat to hear him speak.
"I just want to say to all of you, we are all in this for the long run," the President said. "I heard today about some things that still need to be done. And we will not have our work done until everybody in this part of our country who wants a job has one, until people are back in their homes, until these communities are rebuilt."
While much of the area that Mr. Clinton visited today has been rebuilt since his last appearance here, in the hurricane's aftermath, it was clear much remains to be done.
The hurricane destroyed 100,000 homes and left 250,000 people homeless. Mr. Clinton's motorcade, leaving Miami Beach for Homestead early in the morning, passed through a countryside still strewn with headless trees and roofless homes, past unplanted farms and abandoned apartment buildings. Local officials said more than 100,000 people remain displaced and 27 percent of the pre-storm population had left southern Dade County.
 
Debate on a Street
 By and large, Mr. Clinton received a pleasant welcome on his two-day visit to the Miami area, although his Labor Day crowds were surprising for their modest size. But if Mr. Clinton thought he could emulate his fellow citizens and leave the ways of his work behind for a day, he was disappointed.
As the President shook hands among the crowd gathered along a rope line in Homestead, a man who declined to be identified as anyone other than "a disgruntled voter" initiated what soon turned into the Presidential equivalent of a street-corner fight.
"Can you name one country that taxed and spent itself into prosperity?" the man shouted at the President, using a line that Rush Limbaugh, the talk show host, often suggests that listeners ask the President.
Mr. Clinton shouted back, "Can you name one country that has borrowed and spent itself into prosperity, went from a one- to a four-trillion-dollar debt?"
He then moved on, shaking more hands as the man shouted rejoinders at his back. Clearly irritated, Mr. Clinton could not resist returning to the engagement. "Let me ask you a fact question," he shouted. "One fact? One fact? Did the last two Presidents or the Democratic Congress recommend the largest amount of spending and the biggest deficit in the last 12 years? Answer: the last two Presidents."
The opponent hollered: "The Democrats did! The Democrats did!"
Mr. Clinton moved away, then turned to toss off another comeback, then moved on and turned back again, as the argument degenerated into the sort of did-so-did-not spat familiar to mothers of young children and viewers of "The McLaughlin Group."
"You didn't answer the question," the President shouted. "Answer the question. The Presidents or the Congress? You never answered the questions. The Presidents did."
As Mr. Clinton turned away for the final time, the man said: "Good luck, sir. Good luck."

HEADLINE: Midsize I.B.M. Line Upgraded

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. will introduce more powerful minicomputers today in the company's latest effort to defend its profitable midsize computer business against increasing competition.
The three new models of the I.B.M. AS-400 minicomputer will be up to 80 percent more powerful than the current machines. The International Business Machines Corporation will also introduce new software and disk storage features to make the AS-400 better able to operate as a "server" -- a central machine feeding and collecting data to and from many work stations linked by a computer network. 
 The arrangement, known as client-server computing, is the technological support structure for the new style of team-based work that is increasingly popular in Corporate America. To enhance the AS-400's appeal as a server, I.B.M. also plans to introduce a special model of its Valuepoint personal computer, called a "graphical work station," which can be a client machine linked to an AS-400, according to analysts who were briefed by I.B.M. last week.
 
Fortifying Against Rivals
 The I.B.M. introductions are part of an effort to thwart the stiffening competition in the mid-range computer market, broadly defined as machines that cost from $10,000 to $1 million each. Traditional rivals like Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and NCR now offer minicomputers with the Unix operating system, an industry standard software, or "open" system. New companies like Sequent Computer Systems and Pyramid Technology have entered the minicomputer market with machines based on lower-cost microprocessor technology.
Like the rest of the industry, the minicomputer business is inevitably converting to microprocessor-based machines, and the only real question is how quickly the transition will occur. Making the transformation to the microprocessor world is a huge challenge to I.B.M.'s minicomputer business, and a real threat to one of the company's few recent bright spots.
The I.B.M. minicomputer business, including related software, storage disks and maintenance fees, generated revenues of more than $13 billion last year and pretax operating profits of more than $2 billion, according to estimates by ADM Consulting Inc., a research firm in Cheshire, Conn.
"The AS-400 is one of those horses that I.B.M. is going to have to ride into a more prosperous future," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix. "And these moves in the client-server field are evidence that it is going in the right direction to sustain its minicomputer business."
 
Recent Recovery
 Even before the announcements, analysts say I.B.M. started to see a recovery in its minicomputer business from the falloff in the second half of last year and early in 1993, down a disturbing 10 percent in the first quarter. Helped by a previous round of product improvements and economic recovery in some crucial markets, the business is growing slightly again, even gaining market share.
"I.B.M.'s minicomputer business is doing well in a very difficult environment," said Peter Burris, a senior analyst for the International Data Corporation.
I.B.M. is also beginning to tell customers of its strategy for moving to new generations of microprocessor technology. Its next-generation minicomputer, with the code name Superior, will have a 64-bit operating system and use the PC Power chips the company is developing with Motorola and Apple Computer. These chips are advanced microprocessors employing a technology now used only in work stations called RISC, for reduced instruction set computing.
Some I.B.M. microprocessor-based minicomputers are scheduled to reach the market by next year, with the remainder to be ready by 1995, analysts say. The AS-400, they add, will be able to handle 64 bits at a time -- a bit is the smallest unit of data -- without rewriting large amounts of its operating system. "That could give I.B.M. a real advantage in that next generation of computing, if they manage it and market it properly," David Andrews, a managing partner of ADM Consulting, said.

HEADLINE: 'National Dialogue' in Nicaragua Hits Obstacles

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Plans for internationally supervised negotiations to end Nicaragua's political crisis foundered today as conservative leaders refused to join talks with the Government and the leftist Sandinista Front.
The planned "national dialogue" was to have begun this afternoon, and senior envoys from other Central American nations and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Joao Baena Soares, all arrived in Managua today to oversee it. 
 But at a news conference this morning, leaders of the country's center-right political coalition, the National Opposition Union, said the talks would not go forward until the Government met some longstanding demands.
Most important, they insisted that the Government restore the control they won in the National Assembly in the 1990 elections that brought their candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, to the presidency.
To do that, they said, Mrs. Chamorro must compel the resignations of nine legislators who split from the Opposition Union and threw their support to the improbable alliance that Mrs. Chamorro fashioned with the Sandinistas after the Opposition Union turned against her. Before he was ousted last year, Nicaragua's Comptroller General reported that aides to Mrs. Chamorro gave large bribes to the nine legislators to pry them loose from the opposition union.
Government officials said today that they could not possibly meet the demand because the executive branch had no authority to force the legislators to resign. The center-right coalition leaders respond that the Government must resolve the problem and that they will not budge until it does.
The pressure for a broad settlement has risen steadily in recent months as the fighting among political groups has dragged on and economic problems have grown more severe.
Some 60 percent of all Nicaraguans are now jobless or underemployed, and many social programs have dried up as the Government has cut spending. By most estimates, Nicaragua's poverty is now rivaled only by that of Haiti and Cuba.
"The politicians debate their problems on and on, but they aren't the problems of ordinary people," said a European diplomat who has sought to bring the contentious political groups together. "It is as though they live along parallel lines that never meet."
The Clinton Administration, which has threatened to suspend $98 million in American aid to Nicaragua in part because of the continuing influence of Sandinista officials in the Government, called on all sides to press ahead "vigorously" with the dialogue.
Government and Sandinista leaders did not dispute the argument of the Opposition Union, which is known by its Spanish acronym as the UNO, that changes needed to be made in the Assembly. But after offering to continue Government-UNO talks simultaneously with the dialogue, this afternoon Mrs. Chamorro called Government and Sandinista leaders to a meeting with the foreign observers anyway.
"The moment compels us to put aside our differences for the good of the fatherland," she said in remarks that were broadcast live on television and radio. "I am ready and I hope both political forces, the Sandinista Front and the UNO, are as well."

HEADLINE: Nigerian Union Of Oil Workers Suspends Strike

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Leaders of the Nigerian oil workers' union today suspended their 10-day-old strike, which has paralyzed factories and businesses across Africa's most populous nation.
But the Government did not give in to the main worker demand, which was to publish the results of last June's presidential elections, which were annulled by the former military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. 
 The annulment of the election, widely believed to have been won by Moshood Abiola, a wealthy publisher and industrialist, has thrown Nigeria into its worst political crisis since the Biafran civil war of the late 1960's.
Still, union leaders insisted that they had scored a symbolic victory by demonstrating their ability to cripple the nation's economy. And they vowed to strike again if their demands continued to be ignored.
 
Millions Backed Strike
 The oil workers' strike, which millions of Nigerians supported by staying in their homes, transformed normally teeming towns into ghostly places.
Indeed, virtually all gasoline pumps in Nigeria's biggest cities have been dry since tanker drivers, who belong to the oil workers' union, refused to carry petroleum products from depots.
The wide adherence to the strike across ethnic and regional lines suggested that many Nigerians opposed the largely civilian but unelected interim government that was created by General Babangida and is headed by Ernest Shonekan.
The attitude of the oil workers is of great importance because their industry earns more than 95 percent of Nigeria's hard currency.
"If today, we are suspending our present nationwide strike," the union said in a statement, "let it be seen as a tactical withdrawal, because we believe that this period of truce" will allow the authorities to reconsider the decision to annul the election.
On Sunday, Nigeria's largest human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy, said it planned future actions to force the government to hand over power to elected civilians.
On Sunday night, security agents at the international airport here confiscated the passport of Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel Prize laureate. Mr. Soyinka, an outspoken critic of Nigeria's military authorities, was returning from a trip to the United States.
In recent days tens of thousands of Nigerians, particularly from the East, a region dominated by the Ibo ethnic group, have fled Lagos, Ibadan and other major southwestern cities, fearing outbreaks of violence.
But while the strike and the exodus from the southwest have dominated news reports here, perhaps the most talked about topic is the continuing absence of Mr. Abiola from Nigeria.
Mr. Abiola hastily left Nigeria in early August after what his aides said were reliable reports that he might be killed. Since then he has toured Europe and the United States in an effort to rally opposition to General Babangida.
There is growing talk now, however, that Mr. Abiola has stayed away too long, and is squandering the political capital he has built up in recent months. He should be at the forefront, his supporters say, of the movement to oust Mr. Shonekan, whose interim government is widely regarded as a puppet regime created to perpetuate General Babangida's grip on power.

HEADLINE: Defending the Nonprofit Motive;
Tenants Decry Sale of Troubled Buildings to Private Owners

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Maria Fernandez wants control.
The open door to her building at 2312 Loring Place North in the Bronx constantly reminds her how out-of-kilter things have become: drug users slip up to the roof at night, leaving behind trashed mailboxes and strewing garbage and human waste under stairwells. Inside her apartment, brown spots dot the living-room ceiling from a steam leak last winter, cheaply made doors are falling apart and leaks plague the bathroom. 
 She and her neighbors tried to get the building's former owner, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, to sell it to a community group, thus assuring local control. Instead, the five-story brick building ended up in the hands of a private landlord who tenants say has overcharged them on rent, reneged on promised repairs and allowed the building to deteriorate.
"We wanted to maintain the building ourselves," she said. "To have control ourselves. To control who enters."
 
A Cautionary Tale
 Community-based housing groups say that 2312 Loring Place North is a cautionary tale of the difficulties the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation faces in administering the 150 buildings in New York City that it has been forced to take over after their owners defaulted on loans.
Over the last three years groups affiliated with the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition have lobbied Freddie Mac to sell them the buildings, saying that local control is the best way to insure a neighborhood's vitality.
After the original landlords defaulted, the buildings were taken back by Freddie Mac, a stockholder-owned corporation established by Congress in 1970 to buy mortgages and repackage them as marketable securities. Freddie Mac, after putting the buildings into the hands of a court-appointed receiver, makes some improvements before trying to sell them again.
And while Freddie Mac officials say that they are willing to sell the buildings to community organizations -- and have, in fact, sold five buildings to Bronx-based groups -- they say they usually get a better price on the open market. Moreover, because Freddie Mac is a publicly traded company, officials say they have a responsibility to shareholders to get the best price for the properties.
The agency is also concerned about whether the neighborhood groups can put together financial packages not only to buy the buildings, but also to make necessary repairs.
 
Community Groups' Skills
 Ron Shiffman, the director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, which helps local development efforts, dismisses such concerns, saying they represent a persistent attitude among some lenders that community groups are less capable than private landlords.
"If you have a community improvement motive, they look at it as somewhat suspect," Mr. Shiffman said. "A lot of bankers have been addressing that issue, but Freddie Mac and others have been somewhat isolated from what's been going on."
He said that, over the years, community-based housing groups have developed the skills to buy, renovate and manage properties in the areas hardest hit by abandonment and decay. They have also involved tenants in managing buildings through associations active in tenant selection, maintenance and building patrols.
Freddie Mac officials said they were heartened by some improvements made by community-based housing groups. But they said that some private landlords had also turned around problem buildings, most recently at 1800 University Avenue, which had been overrun by drug dealers.
The building, which once had more abandoned apartments than occupied ones, has been scrubbed clean, with new windows and security gates. The drug dealers have been forced out and the apartments repaired.
Members of various Bronx community groups said they first approached Freddie Mac about three years ago, when landlords started defaulting on buildings whose mortgages were held by the agency. The pattern was familiar: repairs went undone, crime crept in and hard-working tenants moved out.
 
Financing Problems
 H. L. Van Varick, director of Freddie Mac's New York office, said the agency financed about 2,500 buildings throughout the city in the mid- to late-1980's, with about 150 winding up in foreclosure. Of those, a third were in the Bronx.
He acknowledged that overfinancing had been a problem, with landlords borrowing more than they should have, hoping that the economy would turn around. The buildings became financial burdens, he said, when the co-op market soured and growth stalled, or when other publicly financed housing projects lured tenants away from older buildings.
Mr. Van Varick said that most of Freddie Mac's transactions are in cash, and that prospective buyers are screened both by his agency and a network of local brokers.
"We're interested in making sure the rest of our assets in a neighborhood survive," he said. "It doesn't make any sense to unload one property when we have 10 others on a block and that sale would drag down the other buildings on the block."
Several neighborhood groups affiliated with the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition thought they had a way to insure a block's viability: sell the buildings to them and allow tenants a say in how the building was run. They approached Freddie Mac with a list of a dozen foreclosed buildings.
Dalma de la Rosa, the coalition's president, said officials at first were cool to the idea.
"They thought we didn't know what we were talking about," she said. "We figured the tenant had been victimized first by the landlord, then by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac owed them the chance to buy the building."
 
Demonstrators' Victory
 Their breakthrough came in 1991, when a busload of Bronx residents demonstrated at Freddie Mac's offices in McLean, Va. A smaller group met with Freddie Mac's chairman, who promised to sell them three buildings.
In what is seen as a pilot program, Freddie Mac has sold five buildings to coalition-related groups over the last two years, with officials saying that future deals hinge on the community groups' ability to obtain adequate financing.
But James Buckley, the director of the University Neighborhood Housing Program, which has helped package some of the deals, complained that the Freddie Mac buildings were overpriced and in worse condition than expected.
He said that while Freddie Mac sets a price of about $17,000 per apartment, his group often offers less than $10,000 per apartment, limited in part by city loan program guidelines and a desire to keep rents reasonable.
"We look at it from what is going to be affordable and what people living in the apartment can afford to pay," he said. "A private owner can look at it from a different perspective and does not need to be as sensitive to the rent people pay."
Mr. Van Varick said the coalition was depending too much on public loan programs and had not yet shown it could line up other financing.
"We can't afford to sell the properties at severely reduced prices," he said. "We are a stockholder corporation and we look at what they're valued at. We have a fiduciary responsibility not to give stuff away."
Members of several Bronx community groups said the result is that foreclosed buildings sometimes end up in the hands of landlords with poor track records. In the case of 2312 Loring Place North, the building was sold by Freddie Mac to a landlord who in turn sold it to Jacob Selechnik, a landlord whom Freddie Mac had already declined to do business with.
Since his purchase, several tenants have complained about the building's maintenance, citing a lack of radiators in some apartments, leaky ceilings and poor security. Two tenants, including Mrs. Fernandez, who filed rent overcharge complaints with the state, said the landlord tried to trick them into dropping the complaints by having them sign a form that an associate of his claimed was an authorization for repairs. The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal is investigating.
Mr. Selechnik did not respond to repeated requests for comment, including one left during a visit to his office.
Mr. Van Varick said that while his agency was not pleased with the way Mr. Selechnik had obtained the building, there was no way to prevent it.
"We try to determine if an individual is a decent landlord," he said. "If he turns around and sells the property again, there's not much we can do in that case."
While most of the tenants who had wanted to buy the building have since moved, those who remain said the experience left them bitter.
 
A Renovation Success
 That is in stark contrast with the situation at 1985 Creston Avenue, which Freddie Mac sold to the Mount Hope Community Housing Corporation. At the time of foreclosure the building was a virtual wreck, according to Pelqin Pinales, the building's superintendent for the last four years.
The roof leaked so badly that when it rained, water cascaded down the stairs. In some apartments, floor beams were near collapse and radiators leaked constantly.
Intruders often entered the basement at night, splicing into phone lines to make long-distance calls, while some tenants tapped into others' electric lines. Drugs were often sold and used in the hallways.
Since the community group took over, said Steve Yacullo, the construction manager overseeing the renovations,, repairs have proceeded on schedule, with new walls, shored-up floors, new appliances and security systems in place. Rents have been kept in line, although a slight increase may be needed.
"We achieved a lot and we're happier and calmer," said Felix Nunez, a member of the building's tenant association. "And we got away from Freddie Mac."
Tenants said repairs were now done quickly, and that the dealers whom the previous landlord had tolerated have been pushed out.
"You can look up to going into the building and coming home," said Melvin Scott. "You don't have to worry about if you're going to make it to the third floor."

HEADLINE: China Riddle: Life Improves Though Repression Persists

SERIES: A Giant's Evolution: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; The writer of this article recently completed nearly five years as chief of the Beijing bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
What is intellectually irksome about China, for anyone who values human rights, is that a Communist Party that is often brutally repressive should be so stunningly successful in raising living standards.
The party torments many of the nation's bravest and boldest thinkers, sometimes locking them up in insane asylums or imprisoning them with criminals suffering from infectious diseases. Yet at the same time, the party is presiding over one of the greatest increases in living standards in the history of the world. 
 The Government fights leprosy as aggressively as it attacks dissent. It inoculates infants with the same fervor with which it arrests its critics. Partly as a result, a baby born in Shanghai now has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in New York City.
 
Annoying to Democrats
 For those around the world who cherish democracy, China's success in generating prosperity and well-being is just a bit annoying -- and certainly challenging to explain. It offends Western humanitarian values to think that a repressive Communist state can do more for its people than a democratic Government like India's.
Yet a Chinese woman is almost twice as likely to be literate as an Indian woman, and the risk of her baby's dying in the first year is less than half as much as in India. As a matter of priorities, many people would probably prefer a healthy baby to a meaningful vote.
"The first measure of any Government or administration is to ask, 'Is there any period in our previous history in which you would prefer to live,' " said David M. Lampton, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. "And I think the answer for the overwhelming majority of Chinese would probably be no."
This makes moral condemnations of China much trickier than denunciations of the former East bloc, which impoverished its citizens at the same time that it repressed them. The Clinton Administration periodically complains about the Chinese Government's abusing its citizens, yet there is no question that the Communist Party is overseeing a far greater rise in prosperity and general well-being than any Democratic or Republican administration has ever achieved in such a short time.
This is not to say that criticism of Communist repression is necessarily misguided.
"When Hitler held power, the German economy enjoyed a boom," Zhang Weiguo, a dissident journalist now living in California, noted drily. "And Japan grew very quickly during the militarist years before World War II. So we shouldn't regard economic development as our sole objective."
The point is simply that with China's economy the fastest-growing in the world, moral judgments about the Communist Party's role become more complex. Particularly in the Chinese countryside, the issues sometimes seem more textured, the assessments more nuanced, than they do to casual observers abroad.
From afar, it sometimes seems as if the fundamental dynamic in China is brutal repression of dissent. In reality, political dissent plays an inconsequential role in most people's lives, particularly in the countryside. Three quarters of China's population of nearly 1.2 billion lives in the villages, and it is a world of its own.
 
One Village
Big Grievance Is Corruption
 Take K. G. Sun's little village at the end of a winding dirt road in northern China. Chickens rush across the path, and a few cows and goats are tethered to the trees. It is a peaceful little place, although there was a bit of excitement in January when someone celebrated Chinese New Year by heaving a brick through the village chief's window.
Mr. Sun and the other peasants have their complaints, of course. Everyone hates the man in charge of enforcing restrictions on births, and eight different people reported him anonymously to the township when he tried to shield his son who was trying to have an extra baby.
A lean and muscular man in a ripped tank top, Mr. Sun seems to have stepped out of a painting by a Chinese Norman Rockwell. Asked his age, he says he was born in the Year of the Dog, 1958. As for his children: "I don't know which one's what age. I just know one's a 'dog' and one's a 'pig.' "
For peasants like Mr. Sun, the big grievance is corruption, including the way the village and township cadres take bribes and squander public money to live it up.
"The big officials eat big, and the little officials eat a little," a middle-aged man said, using "eat" as slang for taking bribes or misusing public funds. "And if you're not an official, you don't eat."
The peasants knew enough to be suspicious when the village chief abruptly took 12 acres of the village's best land out of production last fall and announced that a brick factory would be built on the site. The rest of the village's land was redivided so that everybody got a bit less.
 
Flurry of Protest Letters
 The peasants protested, particularly when it became clear that the brick factory would be privately owned by the village chief, a police official from the county seat and a few other outsiders. The villagers wrote letters to everyone they could think of: to provincial leaders, to Prime Minister Li Peng, to People's Daily, even to The New York Times.
When an American showed up -- the first Westerner ever to visit the village -- the peasants delightedly poured out their complaints. Unfortunately, the village chief noticed and took his revenge.
The next day, the township police station summoned the peasants who had talked to the American and subjected them to a full day of grueling interrogation. They were told that it was illegal to make contact with foreigners and that in the old days they would have been beaten to death for the offense.
The police accused them of "leaking state secrets" and suggested that they were "counterrevolutionaries." The county police have summoned the peasants for interrogations in the county seat, and officials there apparently are still deciding how to punish the villagers.
Those peasants, in other words, have plenty of reasons to be furious at the authorities. And yet one of them, interviewed later in secret, has this to say of the mood in the village:
"Overall life has gotten much better. My family eats meat maybe four or five times a week now. Ten years ago, we never had meat."
"Now the peasants can go into the cities and earn 18 yuan a day doing odd jobs," he added, referring to the equivalent of about $3.15, a munificent sum in such places. "Of course the peasants are content."
In the Chinese countryside of the 1990's, Communist Party officials often bully and cheat the peasants, yet life is getting better so rapidly that many still support the system. Most Chinese say that if the Communist Party were suddenly to announce free elections, it could count on the votes of peasants to win overwhelmingly.
 
Progress
Sufficient Food And Better Goods
 The improvements are greatest in the most obscure sector of society: the poor mountain villages of central and western China where peasants still live in mud hovels and are lucky if they can send their children to elementary school for more than four or five years.
Life in those villages is still awful, but not so miserable as it used to be. Women may not give birth in clinics, but at least they are likely to have a trained midwife so that mother and infant alike have a fighting chance of surviving. Poor peasants may not be able to afford luxuries like brick houses or wrist watches or toilet paper, but at least they have enough rice so they do not have to choose which of their children to feed.
The World Bank reported in a study published this year that the proportion of Chinese living in absolute poverty -- lacking decent food, housing and clothing -- dropped from 220 million in 1980 to 100 million in 1990. In other words, a group of people equivalent to almost half the population of the United States can now potentially enjoy life instead of merely fight to subsist.
"What the peasants need above all is to fill their bellies," said a Chinese journalist who is often critical of the Government. "Only when they've got food to eat and a place to live will they start demanding political changes."
He cited an ancient Chinese proverb that only when men have enough to eat and a place to sleep do they run after women. The same, he said, holds for their desire for democracy.
 
Consumer Economy Emerges
 One of the huge gains in the quality of life over the last 10 years is also the most difficult to quantify: the emergence of a consumer economy in which Chinese no longer have to stand in line everywhere, no longer have to wear shoes that pinch because the right sizes are unavailable, no longer have to put up with the scorn of rude shop clerks, no longer have to endure the indignity of pants that split or zippers that break.
"In a shortage economy, you always have to struggle for life; you have to struggle to get your daily necessities," said Huang Yasheng, a political scientist who grew up in Beijing and is now conducting research about China at Harvard. "It makes a tremendous difference if you can spend half an hour a day shopping instead of four or five hours."
Though Chinese no longer spend much time waiting in lines these days, no easy calculus is available to weigh that gain against the torture inflicted on Catholic priests. This reflects a broader issue. The improvements over which the Communist Party has presided tend to be in material and sometimes mundane areas, while the party's abuses touch directly upon issues of human dignity and freedom that the West says it cares most about.
The torture of a protester pressing for democracy arouses more empathy in the West than, say, the deaths of the 2,000 to 3,000 Chinese peasants who drown in floods in an average year.
 
The Party
Publicizing Its Worst Side
 One of the Communist Party's problems is a phenomenal incompetence in self-promotion. Not since coup leaders in Liberia, in West Africa, invited journalists to watch and photograph the execution of 13 ousted Cabinet ministers in 1980 has a Government shown off its worst side with such relish.
"They are incredibly inept at public relations," said John T. Kamm, a Hong Kong business consultant who has campaigned to free political prisoners.
On the other hand, what the party does well it does quietly. For instance, a comprehensive system of prenatal checkups and free maternal health care has sharply reduced the infant mortality rate over the last decade. In 1980, for every 1,000 live births, 56 babies died in their first year of life. Now only 38 die in every 1,000 live births.
That amounts to saving the lives of 378,000 babies each year. But that is a statistic, while the Government's repression is usually an anecdote -- and sometimes a highly publicized one at that.
In a typical such anecdote, last month the authorities banned the country's most prominent independent labor leader, Han Dongfang, from returning to China. The authorities had earlier imprisoned him, tortured him by running a needle through his hand, and intentionally locked him up with tuberculosis patients until he became infected himself.
 
Which Is the Real China?
 So which is the real China? Is it the nation where police deliberately expose Mr. Han to the tuberculosis that almost kills him? Or is it the country that offers free prenatal check-ups and infant inoculations?
For four decades, Westerners have been debating that question. But no sooner does a consensus emerge about which is the real China than the other one emerges to confuse everyone.
In fact, it is difficult to describe either vision of China as the fundamental one. Both exist side by side, the yin and yang of the China of the 1990's.
"Both faces of China are real ones," said a Chinese woman who has ties to the leadership and yet is privately critical of the party. "You can't pick out one element and say this is the important one."
All countries and all people contain some mix of good and bad, but in China the gulf between the two sides is particularly striking. To come up with a meaningful judgment is a bit like assessing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Why is it that the party tries to destroy people the way it attacks disease?
 
Analyzing Deng Xiaoping
 To answer that question, it helps to try to enter the mind of Deng Xiaoping and other Communist leaders. As far as anyone can make out, Mr. Deng, the paramount leader, is not just out for himself. He has genuine and profoundly held hopes for China, but these concern collective prosperity and national strength rather than individual freedom.
This is not surprising, for Chinese thinkers traditionally have emphasized the common good rather than individual rights. The expressions in Chinese for "democracy" and "freedom" were coined only 100 years ago, and terms like "human rights" have been used in a positive context by the Government for less than five years.
Mr. Deng has a desperate fear of chaos and conflict, inspired in part by his memories of the wars, famines and upheaval of the first part of this century. By some accounts Mr. Deng's father was beheaded by bandits in 1938, and two other family members were killed or driven to suicide during the Cultural Revolution that began in 1966 -- and that, to people like Mr. Deng, sums up the terrible price of disorder.
The combination of this mental orientation and practical experience is that Mr. Deng places a huge premium on order and that he is willing to destroy anyone who he believes might unravel it. Dissent, in his view, challenges not just the Communist Party but also China's best hope for modernization. In a talk to other leaders in 1987, he warned that if the proponents of democracy were not crushed, then China would again become simply a "dish of loose sand."
So if the price of saving China from disorder is that dissidents and their families are destroyed -- or that demonstrators are mowed down by machine gun fire near Tiananmen Square -- well, Mr. Deng has never been a squeamish man.
Still, many young Chinese believe that Mr. Deng is making a colossal miscalculation. They see his stability as that of a pressure cooker: when the top comes off, as it must some day, the explosion will be all the greater because the lid was so tight.
In any case, one open question is how much credit the Chinese Communist Party should get for the increase in living standards. One reason China is growing so rapidly is simply that it lagged in previous decades, and furthermore the boom seems to have more to do with private initiative than with public policy.
The problem of assaying virtue is not, of course, limited to China. Even child molesters can be polite and caring 99 percent of the time, as their mothers tearfully point out at sentencing. Iraq, Libya and the former Soviet Union all raised living standards for a time, yet none got much credit for it because they were simultaneously engaging in what much of the world regarded as repulsive behavior.
On the other hand, most of China's neighbors -- Taiwan and South Korea, among others -- have also had their share of massacres and repression, yet the brutality gradually abated and a measure of democracy has begun to bloom in each place. In retrospect, one can make a case that the crucial historical process unfolding in each place a dozen years ago was not the torture of democracy campaigners but the emergence of a middle class that demanded and supported a more democratic system.
In the long run, then, recollections of China in the 1990's may depend on how the country develops in the coming years. If it manages to follow the East Asian model and transform itself into a prosperous and pluralistic nation along the lines of Taiwan or South Korea, then historians may regard the economic boom and the growth of a middle class as the crucial developments in China in the latter part of the 20th century.
On the other hand, if China collapses into chaos and civil war, historians are sure to find that this was predictable. They will argue that the biggest victim of the repression was ultimately the Communist Party itself, for in stifling criticism the party lost its bearings and its ability to correct itself.
 
Focusing on Repression
 In that sense, repression may not be nearly as peripheral as it seems initially.
In the Soviet Union of the 1960's, for instance, dissidents were also on the fringe of society. Yet in retrospect, their voices turned out to be prophetic, and it was clearly worthwhile to focus attention on them instead of on infant mortality rates.
Repression is important in a larger sense as well: dictatorships are often more aggressive and militaristic than democracies. An authoritarian China might be more likely than a democratic one to try to "liberate" Taiwan, or "recover" Mongolia, or "secure" the South China Sea.
Mr. Zhang, the dissident journalist now living in California, suggests that in this respect the political repression, even if it directly involves only a small proportion of people, is still of crucial importance in understanding China. For all the economic strides of the last 15 years, Mr. Zhang said, the nation could lurch into chaos -- or threaten its neighbors -- unless the party opens up and turns to more democratic methods.
"If China develops its economy rapidly but fails to carry out political reform, there will also be a fundamental problem of safety to the international community," he warned. "In the past, we've seen the examples of Germany and Japan."

HEADLINE: More Diversity Than Harmony at Religious Assembly

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In a world where violent conflicts in dozens of nations are stoked by religious differences, it is easy to make the case for greater understanding among religious groups. But the road to such harmony, as the organizers of a Parliament of the World's Religions discovered last week, is filled with pitfalls. Even the word "God" can raise objections.
The parliament, which closed Saturday with an open-air address by the Dalai Lama, drew hundreds of religious dignitaries and more than 7,000 enthusiastic participants from around the world. Most appeared to leave stimulated by the dizzying array of spiritual wares displayed in hundreds of lectures, meditation sessions and performances of ritual dance and music. 
 Organized by Chicago-area religious leaders to commemorate a landmark World Parliament of Religions held at the Chicago World's Fair a century ago, the parliament met at least one of its goals: Nearly a hundred spiritual leaders from more than a dozen faiths signed a declaration outlining a common "global ethic."
 
Rifts and Hurdles
 But a series of deep rifts, some very public, some behind the scenes, demonstrated the obstacles in the way of some participants' ambition of putting interreligious relations on a new footing.
Evangelical and fundamentalist Christian groups were absent from the gathering, and more liberal Protestant denominations took a back seat.
In the course of the week, Eastern Orthodox Christians and four Jewish groups disassociated themselves from the gathering, the former protesting the participation of self-styled "neo-pagans" and goddess-worshipers, the latter upset by the inclusion on the program of Louis H. Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, whom they characterized as anti-Semitic.
 
The Spiritual Wares
 The parliament's public face was a kind of spiritual bazaar. There were more than 700 sessions at the Palmer House Hilton hotel, where eminent Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh and Jain masters were on the program along with enterprising but less recognized gurus and even an investigator of abductions by unidentified flying objects.
Meanwhile, much of the parliament's most important activity was occurring several blocks away at the Art Institute of Chicago where an Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, a group of about 100 eminent figures, deliberated for three days in closed sessions.
On Saturday, reporters were invited to witness a formal signing of the Declaration of a Global Ethic by nearly the entire assembly. But several members reported that the preceding session had been tense and chaotic, with representatives of one religious group after another vying to get the body to recognize their grievances, from attacks on Muslims in the former Yugoslavia to the subjugation of American Indians.
 
Many Months, Few Words
 The Declaration of a Global Ethic itself illustrated the difficulties of interreligious agreements.
"I never worked so many months for so few words," said the Rev. Hans Kung, the Catholic theologian who spent more than a year preparing the nine-page, 5,000-word document.
The statement does not claim to be creating a new ethic but extracting a common one from existing religious traditions. It argues that ethical or legal principles must be sustained by the kind of change in attitude that religions can inculcate.
Much of the declaration restates the commandments not to kill, steal, lie or commit adultery, but does so in general terms of nonviolence; economic justice and respect for the environment; truthfulness in politics, culture and the media, and an end to sexual discrimination and exploitation.
The declaration condemns genocide, torture, "ethnic cleansing" and the use of religion to stir hatred, but it avoids specific examples. It also avoids issues like abortion and euthanasia.
It does not use the word "God," coming closest in one reference to "Ultimate Reality," a step necessitated, Father Kung said, to respect Buddhism and other faiths that recognize a spiritual dimension but not a personal divine creator.
Asked whether the demands of reaching consensus made the document too general to be meaningful, Father Kung replied, "We have here a minimum ethic," a baseline to which all religions could hold themselves and others accountable.
After being circulated for comment to a number of religious leaders, the declaration was submitted to the assembly here as the basis for an exchange of ideas but it was not open to revision. Leaders could simply sign or not sign. That restriction was unavoidable, the organizers said, because of the limited time for discussion and the fact that the assembly was not meant to be a voting body.
But with assembly members vocally chafing under this constraint, the organizers agreed to present the declaration publicly as simply an initial step toward a common global ethic, one that might be revised or refined in years to come. That halted the growing irritation about the declaration, but it did not curtail the rush on Saturday to win assembly backing for particular causes in a session where the rules of procedure were unclear.
"It was bedlam," commented one member.
 
History's Complications
 For example, Thomas Yellowtail, a Crow Indian leader, introduced a statement that attributed the deaths of 145 million indigenous people in the Americas to a 1493 papal statement granting extensive rule over newly discovered lands to Christian monarchs. The Yellowtail statement was approved by a show of hands, although Dr. David Ramage Jr., chairman of the Council Parliament and presider over the assembly, later overruled the vote.
To some religious leaders, who questioned the historical accuracy of this claim, the incident illustrated the dangers of dealing with a complicated historical question in a body that lacked information and experience in interreligious discussions.
Sunday, at a post-parliament meeting, the organizers ruled that all resolutions passed in that session had no standing, since the assembly was meant to be strictly a body exchanging insights, not taking group actions.
Woven through the tensions at the assembly was another delicate question: Would the parliament give birth to some permanent forum for cooperation among world religions? Some of the organizers clearly counted on such a development, but veterans of interreligious discussions, mostly outside Chicago, raised objections.
They asked whether another organization would siphon off resources or replicate the efforts already being devoted to interfaith work by groups like the World Conference on Religion and Peace, which has offices on four continents.
In an interview on Sunday, the Dalai Lama was asked whether the parliament would have an impact beyond the personal enrichment of the thousands of participants. "At this moment, I don't know," the Tibetan leader said. He had repeatedly appealed to people to carry on the parliament's work, he said, but now he could only add, "We will see."

HEADLINE: New Catalogue Company Banks on House of Windsor

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
As a prospective brand name, the House of Windsor might seem a bit tarnished, what with the late unpleasantness about Charles and Di, Andy and Fergie, the Queen's taxes and so forth.
But a new British-American company is convinced that at least to consumers in the United States, the royal family is still synonymous with class and quality. Later this month the company will introduce the House of Windsor Collection, a catalogue to be distributed in the United States through which it will offer British glassware, picture frames, jewelry, knick-knacks and the like, at prices ranging from $50 to several thousand dollars. All the merchandise will be made by holders of the Royal Warrant, a designation indicating that members of the royal family consider the manufacturers to be the best in their field in Britain. 
 As marketing ploys go, this one might be easily dismissed, except that the House of Windsor Collection has the backing of the House of Windsor itself.
Although neither the Queen nor any other member of royalty stands to profit from the venture, the family has agreed to let its name be used, and Prince Michael of Kent, a cousin of the Queen, will conduct a promotional campaign in the United States later this month to introduce the goods.
The royal family's involvement is an attempt to help British exports and promote the tradition of craftsmanship represented by the Royal Warrant holders, most of which, as small businesses, have never before tried to sell their products abroad. But for the profit-seeking owners of the venture, the royal family's involvement, and support from the British Government, is a marketing coup of notable proportions.
"This is something the royal family can do in a tangible way to help the economy," said Bradley R. Larschan, an American who left his law practice in Washington to become the president of the company, E.A.C.C. Ltd. "They believe it to be in the public interest. We, of course, are in it for purely commercial reasons."
Of course, the Windsor name itself is something of a marketing invention. It was adopted by the royal family in 1917, when George V was on the throne, because the family name, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, sounded too German at a time when British troops were fighting in World War I.
The family is by no means unaware of the money-making potential of its name. To raise money for the renovation of Windsor Castle, badly damaged in a fire last year, Queen Elizabeth II has opened Buckingham Palace to tourists for limited periods for the next several years, charging admission of about $12.
The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, has sold to a cartoon producer the rights to "Budgie, the Little Helicopter," a children's book she wrote. Merchandise, including "Budgie" toys, will be available in the United States next year.
Before proceeding with plans for its catalogue, to be sent initially to 300,000 homes in the United States, Mr. Larschan said the company tracked the perceptions of the Windsor name among American consumers carefully over the last year or two, and liked what they found, screaming tabloid headlines about the royal family's travails notwithstanding.
"The American people still take a highly romanticized view of the English monarchy," Mr. Larschan said. "Despite the blips that various members of the royal family have experienced, I believe the American consumer will say that if it's good enough for the Prince of Wales, then I ought to give it some consideration."
In the "all publicity is good publicity" vein, Mr. Larschan said that recognition of the Windsor name -- not synonymous with the royal family among all consumers in the United States -- increased last year after the Windsor Castle fire.
"Our sales will benefit, unfortunately, from the publicity," Mr. Larschan said.

A House of Windsor Collection will put all authorized merchandise together. (Jonathan Player for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Black Baptists Gather to Rally the Faithful Against Social Ills

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES

 BODY:
The nation's largest black religious organization will gather in New York City this week, filling the halls of Madison Square Garden with song and sermon and proclaiming a message of self-empowerment that its leaders hope will filter throughout black America.
Up to 50,000 members of the National Baptist Convention, USA Inc., are expected to attend the 113th annual gathering, which starting tomorrow will bring together ministers, ushers and others among the faithful for five days of communion and celebration. National Baptist officials expect the meeting to be one of the biggest in the group's history. By comparison, the Democratic National Convention last year drew 20,000 participants. 
 The convention comes in the midst of a continuing transition for the National Baptists, who in the last few years have evolved from a conservative group whose leadership once disagreed with the tactics of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to a more progressive organization that opposed the Persian Gulf war and actively sought to address social ills plaguing blacks.
 
Backing Dinkins's Bid
 This is the first time since 1935 that the National Baptists have convened in New York City, and organization officials said reasons for the choice ranged from the pragmatic to the spiritual.
One major factor was Mayor David N. Dinkins, whom the organization is supporting in his bid for a second term, and whose presence made the city and its bureaucracy less daunting, said the convention chairman, Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson. He is the pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
"We feel he knows us, he'd be sensitive to our concerns," Dr. Richardson said. "His leadership was crucial, symbolically and literally."
By bringing their membership and message to the media center of the nation, Dr. Richardson said the organization hoped to put the country on notice that its 8.5 million members are a force to be reckoned with.
"It's time the largest black organization has a large presence," Dr. Richardson said. "So we come to New York hoping the message of the gospel will have a better airing than if we had not come here."
The organization, first organized in 1880, has more than 33,000 churches and is the third-largest Protestant denomination in the nation. Its officials say it is the largest black organization in the world.
During general sessions, informal gatherings and official meetings, convention organizers say the assembly will provide an opportunity for ministers to share advice on how they and their congregations are addressing issues like drug addiction, homelessness and AIDS.
The group's leadership hopes to re-emphasize its message that political and economic self-empowerment are critical to the survival of blacks. "The next frontier for black people is economic empowerment, and the black church must make economic empowerment its agenda," Dr. Richardson said. "The issues of paramount importance are how dollars get invested, and how corporations that get black money use black accountants and advertise in black magazines."
Dr. Richardson also said the organization wanted to emphasize the need for blacks to show their power at the ballot box. "The church must not decide for the people who to vote for, but they must make sure that every black person who can vote, does," he said.
Pomp and circumstance will be among the week's activities. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is scheduled to speak, a breakfast and shopping spree is planned at Bloomingdale's and the group will present its highest honor, the Cross and Crown, to Mr. Dinkins and to the former N.A.A.C.P. executive director, Benjamin Hooks.
 
Politics Within the Church
 But though the official speeches and dinners will take place in midtown, the National Baptists went to Harlem, where on Sunday they held a march and worship service decrying drugs, violence and the waste of black lives through crime, poverty and other problems.
As informal campaigning heats up in anticipation of the organization's presidential election next year, Dr. Theodore J. Jemison, president of the organization since 1982, said yesterday that he had not yet decided whether to run for a third term. If he does, his support of Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, during the boxer's rape trial, is very likely to raise controversy. In July 1992, Dr. Jemison was indicted on perjury charges for denying an allegation that he offered Mr. Tyson's victim $1 million to recant her testimony. The charge was later dropped.
Another controversial element is the construction of a $12 million organization headquarters in Nashville, which was opened in 1989. Some critics felt the headquarters was unnecessary and a waste of money. About $4 million remains to be paid on the headquarters, Dr. Jemison said.
 
Politics Aside for Others
 Among Dr. Jemison's critics was the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who questioned whether Dr. Jemison's support for Mr. Tyson hinged on the boxer's pledge of $5 million to the orgnization.
Such political questions were the last thing on Grace Cobbs's mind yesterday. As Mrs. Cobbs, 72, sat in the lobby of the New York Hilton hotel, selling tickets to a gospel concert at the convention, she expressed love for her organization's leaders and concern for black children.
"I know the black church has got to speak out more to our young people, and let them know God's way is the best way," said Mrs. Cobbs, the organization's assistant musical director. "And if we don't take a stand, we're going to lose them."
Some others thought that the black church was losing sight of its primary mission, that of helping people find salvation through Jesus.
"We've lost our focus," said the Rev. James Waller of Philadelphia. "We are to go and tell people that they can be reconciled to God. That's our mission. Not to build hospitals, not to build schools."
Social problems should be addressed, Mr. Waller added, but secondarily to the task of spreading the Word. "There are social agencies," he said. "If the church does not spread the gospel, will the lawyer? Will the school teacher?"
But Dr. Richardson believes it is important that the church reinforce black Americans' moral fiber and show them solutions that are within their grasp.
Dr. Richardson reached into the Scriptures to explain. He spoke of Moses leading his people to the Red Sea, asking God how to get across, and being told to use the rod in his hand to part the waters.
Those are words to live by, Dr. Richardson said, and the message of this convention. "What we have in our hand is the dollar," he said. "What we have in our hand is the vote. We must use what we have in our hand."

HEADLINE: Smiling and Relaxed, Giuliani Puts Polished Image Forward

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
In his 1989 campaign for Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani was a political rookie who struck many New Yorkers as both stiff and unpredictable, an unnerving mix for a man who wanted to lead the city. Now a veteran, he is more relaxed and less defensive, dancing the two-step at a hoedown in SoHo, grinning without end through countless parades, and even, disarmingly, poking fun at himself.
As Mayor David N. Dinkins reeled in recent weeks from one crisis to another, Mr. Giuliani offered a bit of advice that he could have used himself in his last bid for City Hall: "You know," he said, stopping just short of condescension, "the Mayor should really take some time out, cool out and relax a little bit."
 
Learned the Hard Way
 Is this mellow politician the same man whom hard-edged veterans of city politics dismissed in 1989 as not ready for prime time, a candidate visibly stunned in the klieg lights of his first campaign who screamed "shut up" at supporters as they booed the newly elected Mayor while Mr. Giuliani was conceding defeat. 
 Indeed he is.
Recast since his agonizingly narrow 1989 defeat, more polished on the stump, more measured and self-confident, Mr. Giuliani has been tested in the flames of city politics and comes to this race as a candidate who has learned the hard way -- through losing. And though he is still sometimes booed by detractors as he was yesterday during a stop at the West Indian-American Day parade in Crown Heights, the improvement shows in television appearances, in radio interviews and in person.
His intensity is muted. His pallor is gone. He sports a tan now and even his hair, which one political consultant called the "radical forward comb" of 1989 rests more easily across his balding head.
"I have been amazed at the change," said Tanya Melich, a veteran of Republican politics in New York. "Last time you could just see that he wasn't ready for it. It showed every day in 1989. But I have been watching him this time, and, honestly, I've been impressed with what I see. He's more mature. I've been surprised."
It has been a major change. Orchestrated by David Garth, the political consultant who has helped in five of the last seven mayoral elections to move a candidate toward victory, Mr. Giuliani's new polish shows in high relief against the image he cast in 1989.
"Last time he just flipped out," said Kathleen Severin, the president of the Republican consulting firm Severin Aviles Associates. When allegations about past business links between Mr. Giuliani's law firm and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega were revealed in the course of the campaign, Mr. Giuliani snapped. "He called Dinkins a liar," she said. "And then, of course, it turned out that it all was true."
This time he steps with caution as the administration battles criticism over the awarding of city contracts, the troubled cleanup of asbestos in city schools and the blow of losing one of its own, Carlos Rivera, the Fire Commissioner, to the Giuliani camp. So far, he has been careful to neither gloat nor add much fuel to the fires, instead preferring to let local headlines do his work.
But Mr. Giuliani's new style is made of more than the good luck of having the wind of City Hall's troubles at his back. He has made a conscious effort to reach across the five boroughs, to soften his bitterness, never to shout and to smile, smile, smile.
He has been helped in that by a campaign team assembled early last spring and dedicated to avoiding the chaotic jump-start of 1989 in which he did not really get organized until late August. And he has been helped by having an operation so coordinated that it has already opened branch offices throughout the city and expects to meet its fund-raising goals within the month.
 
'Personality Transplant'
 "He is like one of those cartoons," said Mrs. Severin's husband, Jay, a partner in Severin Aviles, "where the lump of mud becomes a monkey and the monkey becomes a man and the man gets up and walks and then is on a skateboard with a Walkman. He is a fully equipped modern-age candidate this time."
Not everyone has been convinced by this conversion. "He's trying to effect a personality transplant," said Douglas E. Schoen, a partner in an independent polling firm, Penn & Schoen Associates, and watcher of city politics for more than 20 years. "I don't think he's changed that substantially. But whether it will be convincing to the undecided, that's all that counts. Now, he just has to keep it up for the next 60 days."
It has been a long road and a long time since November 1989. Although Mr. Giuliani declined to be interviewed on the subject, he admitted during conversations between campaign stops in June that in 1989 he had a lot to learn and that he had spent much of the time since then studying issues and image.
Despite his inexperience and mistakes, Mr. Giuliani lost by only two percentage points and briefly considered challenging the results. But the loss was crushing. "In his work," said his wife, Donna Hanover Giuliani, "he had always seen himself as protecting the innocent and vulnerable." The acid bath of that campaign cut deep. "There was a problem last time with people not feeling they knew him," she said. "They had a character picture of him as this stern guy."
 
Is He Really Mean?
 She says he never fit that mold and that on the night of his defeat he crumpled at the foot of the bed and asked, "Do they really think I'm mean?" It is a question he has been trying to answer for voters ever since. And it is, perhaps, the motivation for his campaign overhaul.
Yet this time voters may be more in the mood for the "tough guy" of 1989. No longer seduced by Mr. Dinkins's promise of New York City as a "gorgeous mosaic," they are instead watching an embattled incumbent deal with immense problems and are giving the opposition a serious second look.
"He has compassion and pragmatism at the same time," said Fran Reiter, the state chairwoman of the Liberal Party who has become one of his deputy campaign managers. "Compassion without leadership results in failure."
There have been some awkward moments. His epithet-filled outburst at a raucous police rally last year raised fears among some New Yorkers that Mr. Giuliani has a wild side. The campaign is aware of that and has worked hard to avoid rekindling those concerns.
 
Staff Is Not So Suave
 Inside the campaign headquarters, staff members blame the press for voters' long memories and belittle reporters as incompetent, irresponsible, biased and unfair. Even at a time when Mr. Giuliani is showing a smoothed out style in public, his staff is less suave, joking with one reporter that they will answer specific issues questions on Nov. 3 -- the day after the election -- and then threatening to choke off communications altogether.
Bitterness toward the press may be a holdover from the last campaign. And it goes to the core of where many people think he lost it. "I think he was bewitched, bothered and bewildered by the media," Mr. Severin said. In 1989, he said, Mr. Giuliani "telegraphed his uneasiness."
"He didn't know what to do with his eyes," Mr. Severin said. "He didn't know what to do with his hands."
Voters, he said, "saw a guy who seemed uncomfortable, and I think that made New Yorkers uncomfortable." He said Mr. Giuliani believed then that he could win by being right, not by being convincing. "He was naive enough to think that substance was everything," he said. "In America that's not true. And in New York City it's grotesquely not true."
 
Scrutiny Intensifying
 But now, in a campaign that has swept restlessly from one borough to another (though seldom touching down in the predominantly black neighborhoods expected to broadly back Mayor Dinkins), Mr. Giuliani is often well received.
"Yeah, he's a little stiff," said Anthony Kalabacas, a 36-year-old video shop owner from Queens. But, he added: "It's New York! People are going to walk all over you if you're not."
While undecided voters wrestle with their choice in the coming weeks, Mr. Giuliani and his staff hope to keep attention on issues. But as they do so, they are bound to come in for some harder knocks than they have yet.
Last spring, Mr. Giuliani endlessly made the rounds, munching through chicken and paella and pork, telling voters he wanted a city with more jobs, better education, less crime and improved health care. Nobody could disagree.
Now that he is being pressed to back those promises with plans he is more likely to face the kind of scrutiny and attack that caused some of his outbursts last time. "His biggest risk," Mr. Schoen said, "is that something will happen and he will make another gaff as he did in 1989." As he takes a slight lead in the polls, that scrutiny intensifies as voters consider the four years ahead.
 
Having a Little Fun
 So far, though, he has met that scrutiny with good humor. When Mayor Dinkins's office tried to deflect blame for the Parking Violations Bureau trouble onto him, Mr. Giuliani made fun of administration officials for producing a letter that they claimed proved he would have made the same decision.
"The letter !" Mr. Giuliani moaned with mock horror about a 1987 letter in which he argued that the Lockheed Information Management Services should be allowed to complete a standing contract. "The letter ! The Mayor must be carrying it around with him!" Then he smoothly segued into a detailed account of why the letter did not condone new contracts with the company.
That aplomb may not always be so easy, especially after Labor Day, when both sides expect the race to get nastier and as deadline pressures act like a tourniquet upon both candidates' souls and psyches. How well Mr. Giuliani performs under those pressures could well decide the race as New Yorkers watch to see if he is, in fact, the man they want as mayor.
In the meantime, though, he has his fun. Interrupted during an endless round of handshaking in the Bronx by a woman who wanted to sell him a raffle ticket, Mr. Giuliani patiently listened to her pitch, then looked alarmed. "What if I win?" he asked. "If I win there will be an investigation!"
Once, he wore blue jeans and a hand-painted shirt and greeted supporters with a broad if awkward "Howdy!" at a hoedown. The next morning he was his same old self in a suit and tie. Looking out at a room full of people waiting to hear him talk about the city's economic troubles he stared sheepishly at his audience and then tugged at his lapel.
"I have to admit it," he said. "I feel more comfortable this way." It was a rare moment of total candor and, in its way, a charming admission that even total overhauls can go only so far.

HEADLINE: Big Funds Giving China A First Look

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The rainmakers are coming to China, and Philip A. Schaefer is one of them. "That's what I do," he said. "I make rain."
So he has no apologies for his breathlessness in announcing to a reporter over the phone: "We're coming to town with $500 billion in municipal and corporate pension funds, and I am just so excited. This is the first public pension fund conference ever in China." 
 Two days before the opening here of the pension fund conference organized by his San Francisco-based Pensions 2000 firm, Mr. Schaefer, 52, is sitting in the lobby of the Palace Hotel, a few blocks from the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, suffering a little from jet lag, wearing a casual blue shirt from the Rancho Mirage Ritz Carlton in California, a Mickey Mouse watch and baggy green slacks.
He is dropping names like a tree drops leaves: "Yeah I've got to get back because I'm doing a fund-raiser for Ted Kennedy," and "I was a Clinton delegate" at the 1992 Democratic National Convention; "Gary Hart will be here with the head of U S West" and "I wouldn't have come here without first checking with Nancy Pelosi about the political aspect," referring to the Democratic Representative from San Francisco.
 
'Here for the Long Haul'
 It is just a few days since the news conference when Mr. Schaefer stood beside a top official of the People's Construction Bank, one of China's four largest, and said, "We are looking at ways to increase our investment in China" and "We are here for the long haul."
The "we" are the 100 American pension fund and investment managers and about 100 Chinese banking and Finance Ministry officials whom Mr. Schaefer is bringing together, for a fee, at an investment conference entitled, "The Chinese Century -- From Wall Street to the Great Wall."
Participants listed on the conference agenda include: Donna Anderson, principal investment officer of the New York City Comptroller's Office; William Crist, board president of the California Public Employees Retirement System; Robert Scott, executive director of the Public Employees Retirement System of Colorado, and Randy Stalnaker, chairman of the board of the Dallas Employees Retirement Fund.
"Believe me, I know an A list when I see one," Mr. Schaefer said. The Chinese will give a banquet at the Great Hall of the People, with a final dinner on Saturday at Diaoyutai State Guest House, where former President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger stay when they are here.
Mr. Schaefer acknowledges that as a rainmaker, someone who specializes in drumming up new business and putting together deals, his salesmanship is prone to slip the bonds of earth, especially when he croons about China's booming market and "the pioneers" he has gathered here "on the last frontier of capital."
Jet lag has not kept his promotional efforts out of the stratosphere.
"When the history of the next century is written, much of it, I believe, will be about the relationship between China and the United States," he said. "It will be about two countries with different traditions, each influencing the world, each bound up in each other's future."
 
A History of Knocks
 Over coffee he seems a little less confident about the roadshow he has brought to town and what its seminars might actually accomplish.
"No one should come here with euphoria," Mr. Schaefer said, acknowledging that recent Chinese history has had a few knocks. He also said he was not concerned that Chinese officials seem to think that American pension funds are interested in helping China build railroads, highways and other infrastructure projects that might take decades to show a return, if they ever would.
"They are thinking one way, and the reality is the other," he said, adding that marginal increases in pension fund investments in Asia could help further China's development and support the economic changes that have been under way since 1978.
"I believe that economic reform produces political reform," Mr. Schaefer said, adding that he was a little uncertain whether China's poor human rights record might draw criticism to the conference and its participants.
"We are not here as diplomats; we are here as business people representing pension funds," he added.
 
Marginal Investments
 American pension funds invest 10 percent or less of their capital overseas, Mr. Schaefer added, and only a small portion of those overseas investment funds go into emerging markets like China.
So, this conference is not about bringing $500 billion in capital to China. The most likely result, he said, would be that the American pension funds would increase their marginal investments in Asian mutual funds, whose money managers are beginning to invest directly and indirectly in Chinese companies.
"But that is worth the price of the ticket to come" for money managers hoping to pull down management fees from pension fund trustees looking to shift more investments to Asia, he said.
The conference and Mr. Schaefer's fee are paid for by those money managers like First Boston; J & W Seligman, and NCM Capital Management, which have the opportunity to sit in close quarters for a few days with pension fund trustees who will be making investment decisions and who might be hiring money managers in Asia.
For the Chinese, Mr. Schaefer said, their banking and finance technocrats, will get a Business Administration 101 course in what pension funds are and how they work.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Asbestos and Schools: In Crisis, Opportunity

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Amid crisis, there is opportunity. And the school system's crash program of asbestos inspection and removal, which has delayed the start of school, is no different.
Never mind the boost to the economy of the $40 million or so the city will pay laboratories, asbestos inspectors and work crews to clean up the mess. 
 The asbestos crisis has provided a wealth of political and public-relations opportunities for city officials, from the Mayor to his deputies, commissioners and opponents, and even sometime warring factions of parents.
It gave Mayor David N. Dinkins a chance to be outraged at one of his favorite targets, the Board of Education. He took command, reassured the public and tried to portray himself as the opposite of the aloof and unfocused chief executive he was depicted as being in the report on the 1991 racial disturbance in Crown Heights.
 
Stepping Into Spotlight
 It gave the School Construction Authority, an obscure state agency set up to build new schools, a chance to step into the spotlight and indirectly make its case for greater authority and resources to take over repair and maintenance responsibilities from the Board of Education.
It gave environmentalists, particularly Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, a chance to show their mettle and ride herd over a crisis of public confidence over the safety in the schools. And it gave parents, some of whom have spent years criticizing the Board of Education as being unresponsive, an audience at last and a chance to press for more money for school maintenance.
About the only place that has not seen an up side to the crisis is the Board of Education itself, which is struggling to set up recreation programs, find emergency classroom space and explain why for four years in the 1980's its staff produced unreliable and possibly fraudulent reports.
For the Mayor, the asbestos crisis gave him another chance to become the education Mayor, something that has eluded him through his four years in office.
During the heydays of Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, mayoral aides quietly seethed over Mr. Fernandez's unwillingness to share the glory with Mayor Dinkins. Before the battles over condoms and gay and lesbian acceptance, Mr. Fernandez was treated like a conquering hero -- and got all the credit for anything positive that happened in the public schools.
Mr. Fernandez sparred with City Hall over budget cuts, and there was even talk about a Fernandez campaign for Mayor. But when Mr. Fernandez was ousted as Chancellor, Mr. Dinkins's standing eroded further -- he was shown to have no control over an independent and sometimes hostile Board of Education that ousted the Fernandez team.
 
Chance to Take Charge
 To make things worse, his longtime allies in the United Federation of Teachers spent around $1 million on a television campaign assailing the city administration.
When word of the asbestos scandal percolated through city government, it provided a chance for the Mayor to take charge.
"I am outraged," Mr. Dinkins declared at City Hall, surrounded by a phalanx of educators and investigators. He announced a monumental inspection and repair campaign to restore confidence and show the muscle of his administration and its managers.
But later, when the inspection program bogged down, through miscalcuations and ever more aggresive double- and triple-checks, delaying the start of school, Mr. Dinkins left the announcing to others, and gave his opponents an opening.
The Republican candidate for mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, soon was questioning the handling of the asbestos effort. "Missteps and blunders," he said, "have further undermined public confidence." He called for a "tangible plan of action that won't change every 48 hours."
 
Parallel Agendas
 The crisis brought to life other parallel political agendas as well. Michael J. Petrides, a Board of Education member from Staten Island and a Giuliani supporter, blamed not Mayor Dinkins but his First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, for "jumping in with both feet" and holding more news confereces than there are schools that have been declared safe.
Mr. Steisel responded by suggesting that Mr. Petrides was disengaged and insensitive to the fears of parents, especially by observing recently that he was more concerned about the quality of the food in the cafeterias than the health risks of asbestos.
"He has to answer to parents for his totally insensitive comments about asbestos and food -- he thinks the whole thing is a hoax," Mr. Steisel said. "He has never come to a single one of these meetings we have had and said anything pro or con."
Mr. Petrides said he stands by his remarks about cafeteria food. "Mr. Steisel did not invite me to be a member of the operation," he said.
 
Marriage of Convenience
 The crisis brought environmentalists and construction officials into a marriage of convenience.
When the asbestos problem surfaced, Mr. Appleton, the Environmental Commissioner, jumped in.
"The Mayor has often said publicly that he appointed me because I was an environmentalist and he wanted me to be aggressive about it," Mr. Appleton said. For days he has all but camped out at the School Construction Authority's offices, attesting to the quality of the work but slowing the reopening of schools, school officials said.
At every step, school construction officials said, the Environmental Protection Department insisted on ever more rigorous standards, requiring hundreds of hours of work to be redone. "Protocols were changed four or five times," one official said. "
"He's an environmental cowboy," one longtime city official said. "He allows no potential crisis or disaster to go by without the participation of his department. He is always willing to jump four-square into any situation and dramatize it. He is a public-relations person's dream."
But environmental officials say Mr. Appleton was forced to act when field audits found more than a third of all asbestos inspections to be flawed. And he responded with a laugh to the suggestion that he was using the asbestos problems to build his credentials with environmentalists and to help his job hunting in case Mr. Dinkins is not re-elected.
He said that if that were so, everything he has done, including programs to protect harbor herons, create greenbelts and restore waterways, was a job-hunting tool.
 
Two Distinct Factions
 Parent groups basked in the spotlight too, testifying before the City Council and at board meetings and participating in the task force running the cleanup.
But there were two distinct factions with distinct agendas. One group, which emerged from a series of environmental skirmishes, has made the environment their only issue. The others came from the ranks of the longstanding parent-group leaders, who see the asbestos crisis as an opportunity to get rid of "Kids Week," an extra weeklong vacation in the winter added at the request of teachers and over the objections of parents.
The parents have proposed a "Children's Charter of Environmental Rights" intended to "define the standards and efforts required to protect our children from environmental hazards." Mr. Appleton supported it, and with him the Dinkins administration has taken up the cause.
School officials worry that such a charter could shift too much spending from basic education to various environmental concerns and would give parents new rights to take public officials to court, but in this moment of crisis they are unwilling to speak up publicly.
The asbestos crisis may fit into other agendas as well. Many educators say it will press the city and the state to provide more money for basic school maintenance. Others say it shows the failure of large bureaucracies, and the need to totally decentralize the school system.

Risk in Riding Bonds' Bandwagon

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Millions of Americans are betting more and more of their money on longer-term interest rates. For many investors, that is becoming the only option as they search for higher returns at a time when rates are at their lowest in recent history.
But to portfolio managers who have been making the same bets recently, the strategy is getting riskier. 
 The problem for investors who are rushing into longer-term securities is that they are doing it after a strong rally in the bond market. Not only has the long bond yield dropped to 25-year lows, but yields have fallen sharply on the 2- , 5- and 10-year notes, which are among the other securities bought by bond mutual funds. Investors have been pouring their savings into these funds at a record rate.
Corporate bonds are also at the high end of prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields. And some analysts are worried that the junk bond, or high yield, market may be nearing a peak.
 
 
'A Lot Less Room' for Returns
 "It is pretty scary," said Thomas A. Shively, a senior vice president at State Street Research, a money management firm in Boston. "There is a lot less room to generate returns going forward."
As the yield on the 30-year bond breached the 6 percent level on Friday, falling to 5.94 percent, some portfolio managers who had been betting on the long bond for a long time were talking of altering their strategies.
"If we go through 6 percent, I am going to get more defensive," said Stephen S. Smith, executive vice president of Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del. "If the bond now goes back up to 6.50 percent, you get zero return."
And although many managers believe that long-term interest rates will move even lower, the chance to obtain the kinds of returns of this year are disappearing simply because interest rates across the maturity spectrum are already so low.
A 30-year bond that was bought in February, for example, will produce a total return of 23 percent if prices and yields can hold until early next year. But even a move to 5.5 percent on the long bond's yield in the near future will mean a return of around 12 percent to investors who are buying them now.
 
 
Money Still Pours In
 Such possibilities make some money managers concerned as investors seem to be stepping up the pace of their move to bond funds. With a total of $673.7 billion in June, bond funds were larger for the first time than the popular money market funds, which pay much lower interest rates because they invest in short-term securities. In July, billions more flowed into bond funds as the total reached $690.4 billion, up 30 percent in a year, according to the Investment Company Institute.
"I don't think a lot of people buying bond funds realize that they can lose money," Mr. Smith said. If the investment is concentrated in long-term bonds, "the risks are pretty significant that they don't get any return on their investment in the next year," he said.
David H. Glen, a portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, said: "We know people are pouring money into our funds because they want more yield. But we don't like it when they come in thinking it is a sure-fire risk."
Some managers say investors are moving out of short-term securities at a time when it may be a little safer to stay in, even though the yields are lower, because there is less risk of a collapse in prices.
 
A Difference a Year Makes
 "Bond fund yields look a lot less compelling to money market funds than they did a year ago," Mr. Shively said. The yield on the 30-year bond, at 5.94 percent on Friday, was twice the rate on the three-month Treasury bill. A year earlier, however, the bond was yielding more than two and a half times the yield on the Treasury bill.
But there is the counterargument that yields will move lower, particularly on long-term maturities, given the weakness of the economy and low inflation.
"The economic scenario that is unfolding is very favorable," Mr. Glen said, adding that it would take some "exogenous factor that we cannot anticipate" to change the outlook.
In addition, some of the negative talk has been from professionals in the market, many of whom were doubtful about the rally all along only to find that they missed much of it.
"Professionals think it is going to come to a bad end but don't want to bet against the rally," Mr. Shively said.
 
 
Risk in Moving Too Quickly
 Mr. Glen added this caveat for small investors: "If they are moving from certificates of deposit to long bonds, that is too much risk. They should not be moving that quickly."
The major factors that are going to determine where rates go and what risks investors face are inflation, the pace of economic growth, and technical factors like purchases of securities by local governments regardless of the price or yield
For investors who have sought higher yields by buying longer-term debt up to 30 years, the risk is the greatest. This is because the price move on longer-term debt is much greater when interest rates rise than it is for shorter maturities like five-year notes.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, expects long-term rates to move lower in the near term. He said the move down in rates, with a corresponding jump in prices, would be smaller but longer lasting if it was based on expectations of continued low inflation and economic growth in the range of 3 percent, which is about a percentage point and a half faster than in the first half of the year.
Long-term rates will fall even lower, he said, if traders and investors decide that economic growth will be much slower.

HEADLINE: Bergen Wary Of Shopping On Sundays

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., Sept. 6

 BODY:
If voters decide to repeal Bergen County's 34-year-old ban on Sunday shopping, there's no trick to predicting the most obvious result: highways will be awash in cars for seven days instead of six as shopping centers and strip malls fill with customers.
But the future of Sundays on Main Street in dozens of the county's 70 towns is much harder to foresee. Will these downtown merchants -- many began business in a mall-less America, when Sunday was for Sabbath observance only -- remain steadfast and stay closed on Sundays? Or will they bow to pressure from the shopping centers and from merchants in neighboring towns by opening up a seventh day? 
 In about a week, the County Clerk is expected to determine whether the petition campaign to put the matter on the November ballot was successful. But the issue is already on the minds of local retailers, though merchants and chamber of commerce officials say no consensus has emerged on what will happen if shoppers are let loose on both weekend days.
"To me it doesn't make sense," said David Linden, who owns Lowits, a men's clothing store in Hackensack, the county seat. "I'm strongly opposed to being open on Sundays. It's a 'quality of life' issue. I live in Bergen County and I would like to see Sunday kept the way it is."
Some retailers, like Mr. Linden, say they are unlikely to spend extra on overhead for a seventh day, especially after working a six-day week. Others say the rivalry between malls and downtown shopping districts has been so well defined for so long that one more shopping day will not make much difference.
And still others wonder if shoppers, accustomed to weekend mall-going, could ever be enticed to break behavior patterns and return to the downtown stores that have been closed on Sundays for so many years. Unless all its stores are open, no town will easily gain a reputation for being "open" on Sundays, some retailers say.
Mr. Linden, who is also president of the Hackensack Chamber of Commerce, said he thought that a Sunday opening would merely spread six days of shopping over seven, and would be incompatible with a small business built on personal service.
"It's easy for the big stores to open, but it's different for most of the independents," he said, adding that he and most of his staff of 10 work six days a week. "We are truly a service store, which consists of all full-time people. If you open seven days, you might have to hire part-timers. Our customers want to find a familiar face. They don't want to hear that the person they expect to see is off today."
Ed Baczewski, who owns Herbert's Camera House in Englewood, said: "We just can't afford it. It's difficult for small businessmen like us. If staying open increased your business by one-seventh, it might be worth it. But we have tremendous competition from the malls already."
He characterized the campaign to lift the so-called Sunday blue laws as mall versus mall. The malls in Bergen, he said, would recapture more business from competing malls in neighboring Rockland County, N.Y., and Passaic County, N.J., than they would take from local merchants.
Although Bergen permits the sale of food, drugs, liquor, and newspapers on Sundays, businesses that sell cars, clothing, jewelry, furniture and home-improvement products are closed. With only slight changes, this has been the law since 1959, when the State Legislature allowed each of the 21 counties to decide on Sunday closing. Initially, 10 voted to limit shopping. But over the years, in a bow to competition and the shopping habits of busy two-income families, all but Bergen abandoned the restrictions.
A major factor in the debate has been the government and citizenry of Paramus, which is, in effect, ground zero for mall shopping in northern New Jersey. Although this borough of 25,000 has no central shopping district of its own, five major shopping centers and dozens of strip malls line Routes 4 and 17, which are to traffic here what the swollen Mississippi and Missouri were to St. Louis.
Paramus, along with Ridgewood and Wyckoff nearby, are the only communities in the county that maintain their own stringent closing laws. As a result, a repeal at the county level would be meaningless in these towns, unless the local governing body or its citizens take separate action to amend or repeal their ordinances. This puts enormous pressure on Paramus -- which has vowed to block repeal at the county and local level -- but it has added a new wrinkle to discussions in Ridgewood.
The chamber president there, Samuel P. Pimm 3d, who owns the Seavers & Parker gift shop, says that he and some other merchants have begun tentative discussions with the village about possibly opening on Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the most lucrative shopping season of the year.
He said the smaller, long-established merchants tend to oppose Sunday openings, while others would open around Christmas or for special promotions, and still others -- especially chain stores -- would prefer weeklong operation.
"I wish I knew what it meant," Mr. Pimm said of the prospect of repeal. "It puts us under tremendous pressure because having the availability of stores open so close, Ridgewood people who normally shop in Ridgewood would be able to go one town over on a Sunday and do so."
Since Bergen is New Jersey's blue-law holdout, merchants have few examples to guide them.
In Summit, N.J., in Union County, merchants can't remember when they weren't allowed to open on Sundays. But not all of them do open, even though they are just minutes from two of the state's busiest shopping centers, the Mall at Short Hills and the Livingston Mall.
John McElgunn, whose family has operated a men's clothing store since 1923, said he and most other merchants in Summit are open on the four Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In addition, he says, he opens up for special promotions two or three other full weekends each year.
"When I do direct mail to regular customers, it's a busy day for me on that Sunday," Mr. McElgunn said. "Those days we're open, we do business. But would seven days bring you more business? That's hard to say."
 
Main Street Not United
 If most or all of Summit's stores were open all the time, he said, shoppers might be more inclined to stop by. But most of them equate Sunday shopping with mall shopping, he said.
And getting all the merchants in one town to open all the time is not easy. The Englewood Chamber of Commerce, in a survey of its members a month ago, found no consensus on Sunday openings, said Linda Taub, the chamber's executive director.
One hundred seventy of 250 members responded. Of these, Ms. Taub said, 24 percent said they were legally open on Sunday and 76 percent were not; 55 percent would support repeal of the blue laws, the rest would not. But if the laws were repealed, she said, 56 percent would not open on Sundays.
Mr. Baczewski, of the camera shop, said it was his understanding that merchants who favored abolishing the blue laws did so for their personal shopping convenience, not because they wanted the chance to work a seventh day.
 
Economy May Be Crucial
 Ms. Taub said she wondered whether merchants, particularly at the malls, would really see more business or if shoppers would just browse and not buy in a depressed economy.
"Obviously it's a responsibility for business people to create a more conducive environment for purchasing, and if that means a seventh day is a part of that, that's one theory," she said. "But the reason people aren't shopping is not because they can't get out and shop. It's because of the economy."
Big retailers dispute that, saying that Sunday is one of their two or three most profitable days along with Friday and Saturday.
Duncan Muir, a spokesman for J. C. Penney in Dallas, which has a store in the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, said that while Sunday is a shorter day, with most Penney stores nationwide open only from noon to 5 or 6 P.M., customer volume is high, largely because of pre-printed inserts in Sunday newspapers.
"For retailers who use a circular that runs with the Sunday newspaper, it becomes one of the biggest days of the week," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
To a company that sells mutual funds, a return on its image is the goal of a new campaign.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A COMPANY that sells billions of dollars of mutual funds is about to begin advertising something it values even more highly: its name.
T. Rowe Price Associates, the fourth-largest direct marketer of mutual funds in the country, is introducing its first corporate campaign intended to burnish its image rather than sell financial products. The broadcast and print campaign, by McCaffrey & McCall in New York, carries the company's long-running theme, "Invest with confidence." 
 "We're looking to cast a broader net to raise awareness," said Ed Bernard, the vice president of retail marketing at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "And, perhaps, to influence perceptions of us when there's unprecedented numbers of people paying attention to mutual funds."
The reason for that interest is, of course, interest, as in interest rates. Their decline has sent investors fleeing into mutual funds from fixed-rate investments like certificates of deposit.
For instance, Fidelity Investments reported that August was its best month ever. Fidelity, with $157 billion in retail assets, leads the Vanguard Group ($114 billion), the Dreyfus Corporation ($42 billion) and T. Rowe Price ($30 billion).
"Ours is a business of windows of opportunity," Mr. Bernard said last week in a telephone interview. "Typically, you've got to make hay while the sun shines." (Those windows must be in a barn.)
The campaign supplements harder-selling, product-focused ads created by McCaffrey & McCall for T. Rowe Price, which has been a client of the agency's direct marketing subsidiary since 1982. It is intended to complement the tenor of the company's product-oriented pitches, which have been praised by independent raters of mutual-fund performance like Morningstar Inc. for their rational, lucid tone.
"The more honest the ads are, the more direct they are, the more likely customers are to stay with T. Rowe Price," said Dany Khosrovani, the executive vice president of client services at McCaffrey & McCall.
"As more new mutual fund investors come into the market, who may not be familiar with specific company names," she added, "we had the hypothesis we should do something that associates all the core values of the company with the T. Rowe Price name."
For instance, the 30- and 45-second television commercials in the campaign, which begin running today, eschew the braggart's voice many companies assume as they hyperbolically flog the purportedly outstanding performance of their funds (while they pray earnestly for investors to ignore the type at the bottom of the ads with its microscopic disclaimers.)
Instead, as prosaic methods of measurement like scales, thermometers and beakers appear on screen, a plain-speaking announcer says: "While man has invented an instrument to measure virtually anything with great precision, the same can't be said for the performance of mutual funds. To that end, T. Rowe Price suggests a different way of thinking. It's an approach to investing that says you can achieve attractive returns without unacceptable risk."
That approach, which T. Rowe Price calls "risk-adjusted performance," is described in a brochure, part of a kit offered in the commercials as well as in the campaign's print ads, which will appear in publications like Business Week, Forbes and Money.
T. Rowe Price plans to spend $1 million on the first phase of the campaign, which is scheduled to last five weeks. In keeping with its assiduously careful practice of periodically measuring the response to the toll-free telephone numbers and coupons in its direct-response ads, on which it spends about $15 million a year, Mr. Bernard will gauge the reaction to the image campaign before proceeding further.
"My bottom line is always that until you do it, you don't know if it will work or not," Mr. Bernard said.

HEADLINE: Napoleon Invades Big Southern City

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Aug. 29

 BODY:
When Napoleon wanted to do something, he wanted to do it big.
In his swift rise to power at the end of the 18th century, the soldier turned emperor dazzled Europe with his taste for the ornate and monumental. Short of stature but long on confidence, he dressed up traditional themes to suit himself, then declared them part of his legend. 
 The city of Memphis has been trying a little legend-building of its own with "Napoleon," its latest in a series of large-scale exhibitions.
Last spring, this city of just under a million people on the bluffs of the Mississippi River mounted what it called "the largest exhibition on the life and times of Napoleon Bonaparte ever presented in North America." Filled with paintings and drawings, clothing and jewelry, documents and furniture -- all from the life of Napoleon -- the exhibition offers history buffs and curious visitors a peek inside the world of the Little Corporal.
The exhibition has provoked nostril-flaring from a handful of other museum curators and art critics, who find it overly commercial. But those responsible for "Napoleon" -- part of a continuing city-run arts program called Wonders: The Memphis International Cultural Series -- have said it has accomplished its main objective: to provide regular folks a chance to see art and artifacts from faraway lands while helping the city's economy.
Jack Kyle, the marketing director for Wonders, said "Napoleon" has drawn more than 350,000 visitors since it opened in April.
 
From Jewels to Tapestries
 In scope at least, the exhibition is impressive. Housed in the city's downtown Cook Convention Center, it includes artifacts ranging from ornate porcelain artifacts and large pictoral tapestries, to Napoleon's uniforms, including the coat he wore at the battle of Marengo, to the luxurious jewels he bestowed on Josephine and his second Empress, Marie Louise. There are marble busts of Napoleon and his family by his court sculptor, Antonio Canova, and portraits of the emperor, including Antoine-Jean Gros's "Gen. Napoleon-Bonaparte at the Bridge of Arcole."
For museum watchers, however, the real wonder is how this Southern city has in the last few years been able to land not only "Napoleon," but several other large, and sometimes exclusive, exhibitions, including "Catherine the Great: Treasures of Imperial Russia," "The Etruscans: Legacy of a Lost Civilization" and "Splendors of the Ottoman Sultans."
The first show, "Rameses the Great," in 1987, was conceived under former Mayor Richard Hackett as a way of attracting tourist dollars and cultural exchange to Memphis. Two smaller exhibitions on Egyptian art had drawn a total of 100,000 visitors, largely because of local interest in the ancient land from which this city gets its name. The site of ancient Memphis is near Cairo, so city officials asked if "Rameses," an exhibition organized for two Canadian exhibitions, could come to Tennessee as well.
It drew 675,000 visitors and $80 million, and city officials decided to create a department to organize more shows like it. They created a cultural affairs department, and encouraged to develop an arts series. The result was Wonders, which is operated with only a handful of full-time city employees as managers. Volunteers serve as ticket-takers, gallery guides and docents.
 
'An Economic Coup'
 Not all of the shows have been profitable. The "Etruscans" exhibition lost money. "Napoleon," with a budget of $9.1 million, may not break even, organizers said. But Jon K. Thompson, the city's director of cultural affairs, says that by the time "Napoleon" closes on Sept. 22, the series will have brought two million visitors and $350 million into the city.
"It has been an economic coup for Memphis," said City Council Chairman Jack Sammons, who said the city and its Mayor, W. W. Herenton, plan to continue supporting future shows, including exhibitions featuring Peruvian gold in 1994 and Chinese imperial tombs in 1995.
"There was a fair amount of reluctance early on from the art community, which frowned on the mass marketing of the arts," Mr. Sammons said. But as the series has proved successful and profitable, he said, "they've come around."
Indeed, the secret of Wonders' success, according to series officials and museum curators, has been its ability to win financial support from the city, woo curators and appeal to foreign governments.
To pay for the exhibitions, Wonders pulls money from a city-financed interest-free loan and from local corporate donors. More than half of the money for the shows comes from ticket and gift shop sales.
 
Trading on Good Will
 Unable to trade on prestige as a big-city art museum or the promise of reciprocal loans, Wonders has had to forge a reputation as a friendly collaborator. To do that, in addition to promising tight security, Wonders has offered to restore pieces used in the show, a tempting offer for cash-strapped museums. In the case of "Catherine," Wonders spent $125,000 restoring her royal carriage. In "Napoleon," the series paid $200,000 to restore some furniture in the council chamber of the Chateau de Malmaison, Napoleon's country estate in France. The chamber now appears in replica in the exhibition.
Wonders has also been free to recruit special curators for each show. In "Napoleon," for example, the series officers enlisted Bernard Chevallier, the director of Malmaison, to be curator of the show and to write the catalogue. Mr. Chevallier pulled together more than 175 pieces of art from Malmaison and nearly 50 other museums, including the Vatican and the Louvre, many of which had never been shown in the United States.
Despite tepid critical response, a number of museum officials and art-world professionals have praised the Wonders' shows.
"In Memphis, they are not stuck up in an ivory tower like most of the museum people," said Thomas Hoving, the former director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose book, "Making the Mummies Dance," (Simon & Schuster) chronicled his stormy 10-year reign at the Met. "As a result, they've had extraordinary success. Their exhibits are reaching a whole section of the country that doesn't have much and they are getting big shows, year after year."
Eileen Harakal, a spokeswoman for the Art Institute of Chicago, was similarly upbeat. "Good for them for having the imagination and economic resources to be able to do this," she said. "Most of us in the field can't afford to do it anymore."
Not that others aren't trying. Ned Rifkin, the director of the High Museum in Atlanta, said he had been asked by patrons to emulate Wonders' effort.
"It's been good for Memphis, I know," said Mr. Rifkin, a former chief curator of the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian Institution. "And I'm constantly being bombarded with, "Why can't High Museum do this?' But physically, we can't. We don't have the large halls."
But Mr. Rifkin, like others from the museum world, also voices his concern about such shows, saying it can feed into a kind of herd instinct.
"It's a mixed blessing," he said. "People come to expect and demand these big shows, when they may be missing profound experiences they can get from smaller exhibitions from permanent collections or modest loan exhibitions of very special material. It feeds that part of people's need not to miss the big movie of the summer when there may be this wonderful little foreign film down at an old movie house."

HEADLINE: Pollsters Enlist Psychologists In Quest for Unbiased Results

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
SHOULD laws be passed to eliminate all possibilities of special interests giving huge sums of money to candidates? Or do groups have a right to contribute to the candidate they support?
The first question comes from a survey by Ross Perot last March; the second is part of a more neutral rephrasing of that question as asked by an independent polling concern. When Mr. Perot put the question his way, 99 percent of those responding answered "yes." But in the alternative form, 40 percent favored limits on contributions. 
 The Perot poll has become a textbook case of how readily results of a survey can be manipulated by the pollster, a point too easily forgotten in a day when polls have become a fixture of the information landscape as a quick pulse reading of the body politic.
But survey researchers, seeking to minimize such biases in their results, are continuing to raise questions about the way they ask questions. In pursuit of greater methodological sophistication and accuracy in polling, one of the main tools of social science, they have formed a research alliance with cognitive psychologists.
Those at the forefront of the science of polling confront longstanding challenges in asking questions that are free of bias:
*Words can mean different things to the people who devise a survey and to those who answer it. For instance, in a 1981 poll about television, respondents said the meaning of the questions was clear to them. Yet when 51 respondents were queried further about one phrase, "over the last few years," 7 said "few" meant "no more than 2 years," 19 said it meant "7 years or more," and 19 took it to mean "10 years or more."
*Respondents can offer opinions on issues they know nothing about. In a 1981 study in which respondents were asked their views of a fictitious law, 30 percent said they opposed or favored it. And in a classic study done in the 1940's, college students willingly gave their opinions when surveyed about three nationalities that do not exist: Danireans, Pireneans and Wallonians.
*The options presented as answers can strongly affect the response. In one survey, for example, people were asked if they felt "the courts deal too harshly or not harshly enough with criminals." When offered just the two options, 6 percent said "too harshly" and 78 percent answered "not harshly enough." But when a third alternative was added -- "don't have enough information about the courts to say" -- 29 percent took that option, and 60 percent answered "not harshly enough."
*One question can influence the next. In a classic example, during the height of the Red scare in the 1950's, only 36 percent of respondents answered "yes" to the question, "Do you think the United States should let Communist reporters from other countries come in here and send back to their papers the news as they see it?" But "yes" answers jumped to 73 percent when the same question was preceded by one asking if Russia should let American reporters in.
Much of the current interest by survey researchers in cognitive science stemmed from the wish among government agencies for greater accuracy in several Federal surveys that are used to guide policy, like the Current Population Survey, done monthly to estimate the national unemployment rate.
"I'm hopeful that the cognitive sciences can help with many of the perennial problems of survey research," said Dr. Judith Tanur, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and editor of the book "Questions About Questions: Inquiries Into the Cognitive Bases of Surveys" (Russell Sage Foundation).
In 1980, the first of a series of meetings intended to address these problems brought together two professions that had rarely talked: survey researchers and cognitive scientists, whose expertise is in perception, memory and the nuances of comprehension.
In recent years that collaboration has begun to bear fruit in suggesting new ways to design surveys to get more accurate answers. One innovative method, for example, is a "think-aloud" protocol in which pollsters have people tell them what they are thinking as they answer questions.
"The think-aloud method allows you to see if a question is too difficult to understand or answer, and if you are getting at the concepts you want to," Dr. Tanur said.
A similar method, in which a group of people talk over the questions in a survey, has recently led to a change in a standard question in the Current Population Survey. The question, asked of those who say they are currently not working, has been, "Is there a job from which you are on lay off?"
 
Inaccurate Answers
 To those at the Department of Labor who composed the survey, "lay off" has a specific meaning: being temporarily suspended from a job to which a person expects to be called back. Such people are tallied differently than those out of work but not laid off from a specific job.
But the research showed that many people took "lay off" to be a euphemism for having been fired. A new version of the question adding the phrase "and expect to be called back" is now being used.
"During the past 12 months, about how many times did you see or talk to a medical doctor?" is one of the questions posed to the 50,000 people queried in the National Health Survey, the results of which are used to formulate government health programs.
But research by Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist at the University of Washington, found that when people's health records were checked, their answer to this question was highly inaccurate; people failed to remember 60 percent of their doctor visits in the preceding 12 months.
Drawing on other studies of memory, Dr. Loftus found that asking a question in ways that offered more cues for recall improved the accuracy. One method asks people to recall specific visits, starting with the most recent ones. This improved the accuracy of the responses by about 15 percent, Dr. Loftus said.
One problem that has defied cognitive psychologists is that people give incorrect answers to pollsters. For example, experts on surveys say that when people are asked if they voted in the last election, about 20 to 30 percent will say they did when they did not. The experts say the percentages for misleading answers is about the same when people are asked if they plan to vote in a forthcoming election.
Both types of inaccurate answers introduce error in pre-election surveys, which use varying formulas to identify, as best they can, who will truly vote.
 
Accounting for False Answers
 A research team led by Dr. Robert Abelson, a psychologist at Yale University, has tried several approaches to reduce the rate of false voting responses. One assumed that because many people view voting as socially desirable, some people gave false answers because they wanted to appear virtuous in the eyes of the pollster
But when researchers reworded the question to offer people ready-made excuses for not voting -- suggesting, for instance, that circumstance had prevented them from voting -- there was no drop in the numbers who made false claims.
Testing whether faulty memory could be an explanation for the misleading answers, the researchers tried another technique that asked specific questions about past elections. But they still found no drop in the numbers who gave inaccurate answers on whether they voted in the most recent election.
The cognitive psychologists did discover, however, that part of the problem was a tendency to overgeneralize from past events to current ones. For example, people who usually vote were more likely to say they had voted in the most recent election, even when voting records showed they had not. And those who usually did not vote were more likely to make the opposite error, saying they had not voted in a recent election, even when records showed that they had.
As members of the survey profession struggle to solve such problems, they also face a battle against shoddy polling methods by special-interest groups trying to advance their causes. There are about 1,500 members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, about half academics and half independent polling companies.
"Our members agree to abide by an ethical code that requires that you disclose details of how you did a survey," said Dr. Stanley Presser, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who is president of the association. "But there's less agreement on how you should ask questions, so the code is largely silent on particulars of how to conduct a survey."
Still, said Dr. Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago and a past chairman of the ethics committee, "there is an elaborate procedure for bringing charges of violating ethics like biasing your survey to support a vested interest."
 
Critiques of Surveys
 The profession polices itself through peer review and open critiques of surveys, Dr. Smith said. The main journal in the field, Public Opinion Quarterly, features a column called "Poll Reviews" pointing out defects in methodology, especially those that have received wide publicity.
One critique was of a poll conducted on the night of Jan. 9, 1991, which seemed to show that 39 percent of Americans favored going to war against Iraq immediately. Because that poll was conducted overnight, no effort was made to reach people who did not answer their phones the first time. Such a poll, survey experts say, may include disproportionate numbers of retired people and fewer young men, who are less often home than other groups.
Another poll on the same topic, which was conducted over a four-day period and thus had more time to reach more people, found that 30 percent of the respondents favored going to war immediately.
The Perot poll was the topic of a similar critique in the June issue of The Public Perspective. Professional pollsters said the Perot poll had two major flaws: a skewed sample and biased questions. The questionnaire was published in TV Guide and asked the magazine's readers to reply. Thus the poll was not a random sample of Americans. Critics also said the Perot poll consisted of questions that were apparently composed by Mr. Perot's own political organization, rather than by an independent survey researcher.
"A lot of us in the survey profession were bothered by the Perot poll," Dr. Presser said. "But the practice is getting more and more common, with special-interest groups wording questions their way and letting anyone respond who wants, rather than gathering a random sample."

Ross Perot's mail-in survey in the 1992 Presidential campaign are compared with those for the same question given to a national sample by Yankelovich & Partners, a more neutrally worded version of the question submitted to a national sample and still another version given to another national sample by the Gordon Black Corporation.

HEADLINE: Churches Increasingly Join the Concert World

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Last year, the conductor Jens Nygaard disbanded his Jupiter Symphony concerts because the cost of presenting them far exceeded the money he could raise for them. But a few months ago, Mr. Nygaard's series was revived with help from Christ and St. Stephen's Church, near Lincoln Center, which let him use its sanctuary as his concert hall for a fraction of the cost of Alice Tully Hall, the orchestra's former home. When the first concerts sold out, the church let Mr. Nygaard add a second series.
Across town, at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on the Upper East Side, and in Greenwich Village at the Church of the Ascension, new series of choral concerts have sprung up because the churches' music directors wanted to show off their choirs to the public. And at Corpus Christi Church in Morningside Heights, at St. Paul's Chapel near Wall Street and at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin near Times Square, ensembles of international stature are regularly presented. 
 Just when the directors of New York City's concert halls are looking for ways to attract new listeners and worrying about raising money to pay for their presentations, an alternative concert world is flourishing in the city's churches. In the last 10 years, as the expense of renting conventional concert halls has increased, the number of religious institutions opening their doors to performers or even sponsoring their concerts has increased significantly.
 
'All Music Is Sacred'
 Moreover, audiences are paying attention to their growing schedules. In buildings that seat from 250 to more than 1,500 people, concerts are regularly attracting nearly full houses. Tickets go for as little as $2 to as much as $50. And the music directors of several of these institutions say that their parishioners account for only 10 percent of their concert audiences.
The concerts are presented as secular events, and many feature repertory that is entirely secular. Sometimes the lines are blurred. At the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the stated policy is that "all music is sacred," and a visitor is likely to hear anything from a medieval passion play or a Baroque Mass to the ritual chanting of the Tibetan Gyoto monks or a festival of American Indian music and from Romantic chamber works to jazz.
One might expect there to be some strain between churches and their music directors over repertory, but that seems not to be the case. Recently the Vatican recommended that secular music not be performed in churches, but although some Roman Catholic churches have chosen to make that a matter of policy, others say that such decisions are made at the diocese level. Thus, at Corpus Christi, a Catholic church, the Music Before 1800 series frequently presents ensembles like the Classical Quartet, Fretwork, the Baltimore Consort and the Ensemble Rebel, which play secular instrumental works, as well as choirs that sing sacred repertory.
 
Drawing the Line at the Bawdy
 "We are careful about what we present," said Louise Basbas, the director of Music Before 1800. "I don't think the racier body of music, like certain English Renaissance lute songs, is appropriate to hear while you're sitting in a church."
The Episcopal Church, by contrast, seems to embrace the notion of presenting music of all kinds, hence the eclectic programming at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. "What I feel is part of my and the cathedral's agenda," said Bruce Fifer, the cathedral's music director, "is the idea that in the Middle Ages the cathedral was at the center of the community. We believe that artistically this manifests itself in the relationship of our services and music to the community's needs."
Indeed, many music directors see their programming in terms of form meeting function. "We do sacred music because that's what's written for our kind of outfit," said Gerre Hancock, the music director at St. Thomas Church in midtown. "But we see our concerts as having no liturgical function at all, and not as an extension of our religious responsibilities. We have no problem with other people presenting secular programs here, although the acoustics do not lend themselves to, for example, a violin and piano recital."
Kent Tritle, the music director at St. Ignatius Loyola, which has just installed an imposing new organ, adds a philosophical current. "The bottom line," he said, "is that people can go to a concert hall if they want to hear secular music. And to a degree they can hear sacred works in concert halls, too. But the experience of hearing sacred music in the kind of space it was written for is very different, and that's what we want to offer, in a nonproselytizing way."
 
Handling the Finances
 Most directors of these series say that although they have either free or inexpensive access to church facilities, they cannot depend on church largesse to keep their programs running. Like commercial concert presenters, they raise money for their programs, depending on a combination of ticket sales and donations from "friends of music" organizations. Several are taking a more modern route: they are incorporating as independent, nonprofit organizations and are therefore eligible for endowment and foundation grants that are not available to religious institutions.
"When we started our series," said Ms. Basbas at Corpus Christi, where her critically acclaimed Music Before 1800 program is in its 19th season, "we drew on the activities of the early-music co-op at Columbia University. It was very much of its time, and we were able to be casual about our financial structure and organization. But as the series developed, we needed to rethink that. State money was accessible, but in order to get it, we had to incorporate as an organization separate from the church, with a board and bylaws."
Incorporation is also a way to insulate a concert series from the financial life of the church. Indeed, some churches that do underwrite their music programs, including several with long histories of concert presenting, have been forced by the recession to curtail their activities. Trinity Church and St. Paul's Chapel, for example, have presented daily noontime recitals and chamber music programs for a quarter of a century. But three years ago, Trinity cut its programs back to three a week and has moved them and the rest of its programs to St. Paul's. Owen Burdick, Trinity's choral director and organist, explained that Trinity's economy was based on its real estate holdings in lower Manhattan. When the market softened, the church cut back on both programming and staff.
"For the first time in our history," Mr. Burdick said, "we are soliciting funds from corporations." Still, with a budget of $250,000 and a schedule of 170 concerts and recitals this year, Trinity leads the pack. Most churches present four to a dozen concerts a year and have budgets of $50,000 to $150,000. (The apparent differences in the cost per concert have to do with the kinds of music presented: recitals and chamber music are less expensive than choral concerts with orchestral accompaniment.)
 
A Bargain Rental
 Many churches and a few synagogues fill yet another kind of musical need. Small opera companies, young recitalists and shoestring chamber music and orchestral operations have found homes in churches all over New York where they can present concerts without breaking their budgets. One church that does a thriving rental business, in addition to presenting its own concerts, is Christ and St. Stephen's Church, near Lincoln Center.
Its sanctuary seats 300, and it can be rented for $350 to $500, compared with the $1,300 to $1,500 it can cost to rent Merkin Concert Hall or Weill Recital Hall. Several contemporary music and early-music groups call the church home, and in recent years Jerry Grossman, the principal cellist of the Metropolitan Opera, has presented regular recitals at the church. David Labovitz's Choral Symphony Society has presented its concerts there for years, and this year Mr. Nygaard's Jupiter Symphony joined the fold. All told, the church has about 100 concerts a year.
"One of the main reasons we make the church available," said Carol Wilson, the director of programming at the church, "is that we want to offer an artistic and spiritual home to musicians at all levels. We are available to groups that have been established for many years, like the Jupiter Symphony, and also to newly formed groups like Ex Umbris, an early-music ensemble that made its debut here in April. And musicians like to play here because the sanctuary is a lovely, intimate, warm setting, both visually and acoustically. We're very committed to this as a form of outreach to the community."
 
 
 
SOME MUSICAL OFFERINGS, MANY EARLY
 Once home mainly to organ recitals and amateur choral concerts, churches have expanded their musical offerings to include secular music and performances by internationally famous ensembles, most of them early music groups. Here are some of the most inviting programs scheduled for the fall:
Galatea, a chamber orchestra, will play works by Mozart, Bizet and Strauss at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, Manhattan, on Thursday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $7. Information: (212) 787-2755.

HEADLINE: Supercomputers Update Leonardo, Redesigning the Parachute

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
FIVE HUNDRED years after Leonardo da Vinci sketched out a parachute and elucidated its principles, scientists are harnessing the most powerful computers on earth to probe the secrets of these air brakes so advanced versions can be made for tough new jobs in the 21st century.
The lowly parachute, it turns out, is a surprisingly complex object from the standpoint of aerodynamics. 
 Packed to the density of oak, a parachute emerges from its container and rapidly changes shape from a cylindrical log, to a streamer, to a hemispherical cup -- all in a matter of seconds. The flow of air in and around a parachute changes swiftly and repeatedly through the various phases of its flight, unlike the airflow over a speeding missile or an airplane wing, which in comparison is rather steady.
Because of this complexity, the design of parachutes for decades has been more of an art than a science. The work has been characterized by a trial-and-error approach, with spectacular successes and failures, excitement and death, rather than the orderly application of engineering rules derived from first principles.
Recently, however, supercomputers have acquired enough processing power to tackle the problem of exactly how air and fabric interact to make parachutes work. Quirky aerodynamics have been modeled with growing accuracy, yielding complex sets of equations that are beginning to disclose the inner dynamics of fluid-like airflows. These equations are also suggesting new kinds of parachute designs.
The goal, scientists say, is to make commonplace parachutes lighter and safer and to lay the foundation for more advanced ones. Roles envisioned for parachutes of the future include lowering the products of space factories back to Earth and slowing planetary probes as they speed through the atmospheres of alien planets.
"We want to increase our confidence that what we design is going to work," said Dr. Carl W. Peterson, head of defense and space programs at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., where a dozen or so experts are trying to unravel parachute mysteries.
William J. Everett, head of engineering at the Pioneer Aerospace Corporation in South Windsor, Conn., a parachute maker, said of the Sandia work, "They're doing things that people 10 years ago thought were impossible."
But Dr. Peterson said that the advances made at Sandia to date were too limited to affect parachute design a great deal and that making such improvements would require years of work.
"The nature of the physics, the aerodynamics, is quite different from anything else that flies through the air," Dr. Peterson said. "We're struggling with it. Many people have said the problem is too hard to solve. We still have a ways to go."
"Leonardo had the right shape for a high-drag chute," he added, "and we're finding out how difficult the fluid physics of that inflating shape is, even once it's fully opened."
Sandia's supercomputers often run for days as they struggle to model real-world action that occurs in seconds. Even so, the answers can often be plainly wrong.
"I'm afraid to jump out of a perfectly good airplane, knowing what we don't know about parachutes," Dr. Peterson said. (He admitted that he had never parachuted himself, and that neither had -- to the best of his knowledge -- any member of Sandia's parachute research team.)
Parachutes were first used by Chinese acrobats to slow their falls, according to 12th-century Chinese archives. Da Vinci, in his famous notebooks on the possibilities of human flight, sketched out a parachute design in 1495, saying that "a tent of linen" can allow a man to "jump from any great height without danger to himself." The chute he illustrated, however, was too small to make for a truly safe landing, and it is unknown whether da Vinci himself ever built or tested one.
It was nearly 300 years later, in 1772, that a man named Canon Desforges took the first known leap of modern times, jumping off a tower with a parachute-like gadget and hurting himself only slightly. Decades later, a Frenchman named Andre-Jacques Garnerin became the first person to make repeated jumps, some from substantial heights..
 
Swinging Violently to Earth
 In 1802, he ascended in a balloon to an altitude of more than a mile and jumped with nothing more than a silk canopy. He landed safely. But his canopy had a tendency to swing so violently from side to side that he often had a bad case of motion sickness by the time he reached the ground. The historian Charles J. Cleary says that Garnerin once became violently ill in front of a crowd that included members of the royal family.
It was the conventional wars of the 20th century that provided the stimulus for the rapid evolution of the parachute from curiosity to reliable tool, mainly for delivering men and materiel behind enemy lines. During the cold war, further advances let parachutes perform feats like slowing manned capsules and mock warheads speeding back into the Earth's atmosphere from outer space.
At Sandia, one of three Federal centers for the design of nuclear arms, recent research on parachutes began to encounter major snags as designs became more advanced. For instance, engineers began to make prototype parachutes out of tough, light materials like Kevlar, a synthetic fiber with a tensile strength 10 times greater than stainless steel. Its lightness meant more parachute could be packed into a given space, providing greater stopping power than all-nylon parachutes.
But fast braking produced sudden waves of aerodynamic instability, with chutes often collapsing as air rushed around the edge and hit the outside of the canopy like a sledgehammer. The complexity of such problems, plus the fact that trial-and-error methods were costly and time-consuming, prompted Sandia aerodynamicists in the 1980's to begin to develop computer models of parachute opening, inflation and performance. The hope was that expensive test flights one day might be replaced by computer models.
The main challenge in such simulations is that even very small changes in a parachute can have a surprisingly large effect on its workings, making its behavior very hard to predict. Still, the Sandia team is making some headway, with its computer programs able to disclose complex vortexes swirling about an opening chute. Such computer predictions, continuously checked against real-world data, are slowly getting better.
 
Parachute in Jupiter Mission
 "If we work together internationally, perhaps in three years we might have the basic computational tools," Dr. Peterson said in an interview. "Right now, no designer would hang his hat on this stuff."
The current state of the Sandia work is outlined in an article by Dr. Peterson in the current issue of Physics Today, published in Woodbury, L.I., by the American Institute of Physics.
Though lacking a complete set of equations to describe the workings of a parachute, the Sandia team has produced enough new knowledge to become a magnet for commercial designers. Mr. Everett of Pioneer Aerospace said that his company had sent a team to Sandia last year to study the work there.
It was Pioneer that made the high-tech parachute now hurtling toward the planet Jupiter aboard the $1.4 billion Galileo spacecraft. In 1995, Galileo is to fire toward the giant planet a 760-pound mini-probe that will deploy a 12.5-foot parachute as the apparatus sails into Jupiter's poisonous atmosphere, making measurements as it descends until crushed by intense atmospheric pressure.
Although Galileo's main antenna is stuck and the craft will produce fewer pictures than originally planned, other parts of the planetary mission, including the mini-probe and its parachute, are in excellent shape and should give scientists a wealth of new information about the icy mysteries of the solar system's largest planet.
In the future, Sandia expects to help the National Aeronautics and Space Administration make parachutes for a variety of other planetary probes, including ones to whiz through the thin atmosphere of Mars.
"Leonardo," Dr. Peterson wrote in his article, "would be pleased."

Finding Out Why a Parachute Collapses
In the early phase of inflation, the canopy captures air, creating a pressure differential that causes "drag" and slows the descent. By the time the chute is fully inflated, it has transferred substantial energy to the air, creating a wake behind it. As the chute slows, air from the wake can overtake the canopy, pushing it from behind and making it collapse and accelerate. (Source: Scientific American)(pg. C10)

HEADLINE: Renault-Volvo Marriage Is On

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
After two years of partnership and several months of complex negotiations that were concluded only on Friday, Renault of France and Volvo of Sweden announced today that they will merge on Jan. 1 to form the world's sixth-largest automotive group.
The merger, which had long been rumored and became widely anticipated over the weekend, is aimed at allowing the two companies to weather the severe recession buffeting the European automobile industry. It will also strengthen them as they prepare for the tougher competition that will come when all restrictions on Japanese auto sales in the European Community are lifted in January 1999. 
 Sixty-five percent of the new group, to be known as Renault-Volvo RVA, will be owned by Renault and 35 percent by Volvo until Renault -- currently owned by the French Government -- is partly privatized, perhaps as early as next year. In 1992, the two companies produced a total of 2.45 million vehicles, had combined sales of about $37.5 billion and employed 200,000 people.
 
$5.2 Billion in Savings
 The group will continue to market cars and other vehicles under the Renault and Volvo brands, but they will merge their research, planning, production and distribution operations as well as their corporate structure. They predict that this will result in $5.2 billion of savings by 2000.
"The engagement was long and well thought out," Industry Minister Gerard Longuet of France said today, referring to the Renault-Volvo "alliance" that began in 1991, "and I think it will lead to a successful marriage, a genuine marriage of complete cooperation."
For Sweden, the "marriage" is perhaps more painful, since Volvo has long been a symbol of the country's industrial prowess. But the merger marks another step in Sweden's gradual economic integration with the European Community, which it hopes to join as a full member in 1995.
Measured by its 1992 sales, the new group will rank sixth globally after General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen. Within Europe, in the production of cars and trucks in Europe it will rank second after Volkswagen and ahead of Fiat and Peugeot Citroen, with a share of about 12 percent of the Western European market. Further, it is likely to be the largest industrial group in France and the 20th largest worldwide.
The merger will have little impact in the United States, since Renault withdrew from the American car market in 1987 and has no plans to return, although it will continue to sell trucks through its Mack truck unit. Volvo still sells cars and large trucks in the United States. But with American sales of some 65,000 cars last year, it controls less than 1 percent of the American auto market.
Volvo controls 83 percent of a truck-manufacturing venture with the Gneral Motors Corporation, the Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation.
The new group's main focus will be on the highly competitive -- and currently depressed -- European auto market. New car registrations across the European Community last month ended up only 5.6 percent lower than in August 1992, because of a surge in British sales, but they were down 16.7 percent from January to August, compared with the period a year earlier.
Over the weekend, under pressure from European manufacturers, Japan agreed again to lower its exports of cars and light trucks to the community in 1993, this time to 980,000 units, down 18.5 percent from 1992. But the community is already committed to removing all controls on Japanese car sales in Europe in 1999.
Renault is, in fact, one of the few healthy European auto manufacturers, having recoverd from a crisis that prompted a Government bailout in 1986 to earn profits of about $1 billion on sales of $26.7 billion in 1992. Volvo, in contrast, showed losses of $435 million on sales of $10.87 billion last year, though it earned $5.6 million in the first half of 1993.
Mr. Longuet presided over the news conference announcing the merger today because the French state currently owns Renault. But he also used the occasion to confirm that Renault was one of 21 big state-owned companies marked for privatization by France's new conservative Government.
Asked when this privatization could take place, Mr. Longuet said it would depend on market conditions. "It's difficult to imagine it can happen before the second half of 1994," he said. "But I would like to see it happen before the first semester of 1995."
Much of the negotiation between Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, and Volvo's chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, revolved around creating a corporate structure for the new group that both anticipates Renault's privatization and insures continued control of management by the French state and Volvo.
This has been done through creation of a holding company, RVC, of which Renault will own 51 percent and Volvo will hold 49 percent. RVC, in turn, will own 35 percent of the shares of Renault-Volvo RVA, the company that will control the two manufacturers' car and truck building operations. This share is likely to be a larger stake than any other single shareholder, even after the privatization of Renault.
Thus, with 17.85 percent of Renault's 65 percent total share in the new group held through RVC, only the balance that it will own directly -- 47.15 percent -- will be subject to privatization. Volvo, on the other hand, will own 17.15 percent through RVC and 17.85 percent directly. The two companies pledge not to sell their shares in RVC without mutual agreement.
Although Mr. Longuet stressed that Renault would be the "driving force" in the new group, the delicate problem of how to find places for both Mr. Schweitzer and Mr. Gyllenhammar was resolved by creating a supervisory board and a management board.
Mr. Gyllenhammar is expected to head the 14-member supervisory board, which will have a voice over important financial matters. It will also appoint the management board, comprising three Renault and two Volvo representatives, which will run the group; Mr. Schweitzer seems likely to be chairman of the management board.
"You wanted this merger as much as we did," Mr. Gyllenhammar told his French partner at today's news conference, noting that the alliance between their companies the past two years proved "better than hoped and much better than expected."
France's communist-led CGT trade union, the largest at Renault, called the deal an unacceptable threat to jobs and national independence and said workers would "do everything to render this merger inoperative."
 In January 1991, through an exchange of shares, Renault acquired 8.2 percent in Volvo A.B., the Swedish conglomerate's holding company, as well as 25 percent of the Volvo Car Corporation and 45 percent of the Volvo Truck Corporation. Volvo, in turn, obtained 20 percent of Renault S.A. and 45 percent of the Renault V.I. truck company.
The merger will involve only Volvo's automotive operations, leaving Volvo A.B. as a large shareholder in the Procordia pharmaceuticals giant as well as in companies in the food, beverages, tobacco and aircraft, marine and industrial engine sectors. Renault, though, will retain its share of Volvo A.B.
The proposed merger must still requires the approval of the Renault and Volvo boards as well as by the French Government and the European Community's Executive Commission. Formal approval by the Swedish Government is not required, but the move has already been endorsed by the conservative Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt.
With completion of the deal, large stakes in both of Sweden's auto companies will have passed to foreigners; General Motors owns half of Saab Automobile A.B. in a joint venture with Saab-Scania of Sweden.

FORD CUTS IN BRITAIN
 LONDON, Sept. 6 (Reuters) -- The Ford Motor Company said today that it planned to cut 1,400 more jobs in Britain this year to help it compete in Europe's weakening auto market. A company spokesman said Ford of Britain, which employs 31,350 people, will try to complete the reduction by year-end through voluntary means. In 1980, the British unit had 72,000 employees; its vehicle output is virtually unchanged from that time.

The Big Sizing Down

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
If your ambition is to be fired, this is a great time to be an American.
Most of the big companies -- Eastman Kodak, I.B.M., Procter & Gamble and lots more -- are firing as though unemployment is going to be the biggest thing since Madman Muntz brought television to the American parlor. 
 The boss of any large corporation that hasn't fired at least enough people to make up an army division has a lot of explaining to do to his buddies down at the C.E.O. Club.
"What's the matter, fella? Don't you believe in the end of the American future?"
In modern mushmouth, which now passes for English throughout America, the firing trend is called "downsizing." Downsizing makes a business "lean and mean."
"Lean and mean" is not mushmouth lingo. It's sports jabber, a teen-ager dialect spoken by grown-ups who want to sound dynamic.
"Lean-and-mean types gonna leave cleat marks all over your face, man." And so forth. If they run once big, now downsized companies, those companies gonna leave cleat marks all over the famous "worldwide competition."
"Worldwide competition" is a euphemism. Means foreign companies are beating American companies by using such devices as good national educational systems, government-approved cartel arrangements, superior management skills and/or sweated labor.
To review: Downsizing makes America lean and mean against worldwide competition.
And yes, puts army-size human masses out of work, raising the question that's hardly ever asked. Why not? Maybe because it's naive.
"Never be naive, no matter how naive you are." The law is as old as the story of the child who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes on. In fact it was enacted by that very same emperor as soon as he put some clothes on, made retroactive and cited as justification for giving the naive kid a good caning.
Nowadays of course we are too civilized to cane, so the punishment for asking naively pertinent questions is to be dismissed as a fool whose question doesn't deserve an answer.
Enough digressing. What is the shamefully naive question? This: "Doesn't all the firing mean there'll be even fewer people with money to buy stuff from lean, mean companies, thus making hard times worse?"
I trust nobody here will think I, personally, would ask a question as stupidly naive about economics as this. However, the ruin that was California needs mention.
The ruin seems to result from the downsizing of the national war machine, which results from the end of the cold war. Downsizing in this case was morally delightful, but not otherwise uplifting for California, which turned out to rest on a vast plate of Pentagon contracts.
It's a little awkward to mention California's need for munitions money. That's because it brings up the highly awkward question of whether Hitler didn't also do us a lot of good by forcing America to arm for World War II.
Until then the Great Depression of the 1930's seemed determined to last forever. Hitler, war and munitions contracts put us back on the track to boom times, especially California, which seemed destined to boom eternally until the eternal cold war suddenly turned as un-eternal as everything else.
Downsizing California's defense-contract work force has obviously made California lean and mean, though not yet in the cleats-in-the-face style. Lean, yes: the out-of-work usually get lean before prolonged bad diet fattens them up. Mean, too: the new immigrants, welcome when they were cheap labor, are a bone in California's throat now that all labor is cheap.
Now comes more ominous news for the as-yet unfired. Vice President Gore, who is reinventing government, is reportedly going to call for cutting the Federal payroll by some 250,000 jobs.
Putting the ax to the payrollers sounds dandy. After the joy of the axing subsides, what will the 250,000 latest unemployed contribute to the economy? Not to worry. The North American Free Trade Agreement, though a threat in the immediate future to the still-employed, will create a new boom in the long run, and, as John Maynard Keynes noted, in the long run we are all dead.

HEADLINE: Why Going Back to School Is Like Jet Lag;
Faulty Comparison

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on the lagging of American teacher salaries behind those elsewhere (Education page, Aug. 18) is deceptive. All of the salaries have been blindly converted to a dollar standard, using current foreign exchange rates, without even mentioning how far these salaries might go in costs of living and tax burdens. 
 Your accompanying chart shows American midcareer teacher salaries lagging behind those of the Netherlands, Germany, Hong Kong, Ottawa and Zurich, all places that have much higher costs of living and the tax burdens associated with welfare states. American teacher salaries lead those of Britain, Japan, Sweden and France, where the costs of living and tax burdens are also much higher. Teacher salaries in India are bound to be last on the chart, as the cost of living and tax burden are lowest among the places surveyed.
It has taken the International Monetary Fund and World Bank half a century to figure out the meaninglessness of using a dollar standard at market exchange rates to compare economies.

HEADLINE: Low-Income New Yorkers to Have Day Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Capital for Human Services" Op-Ed, Aug. 23) by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun provides recognition of the role public-private partnerships play in providing nonprofit child care to low-income families, primarily in the Midwest. New Yorkers should know that similar alliances among community leaders, government and the private sector are flourishing to the benefit of this city's children. 
 The same community development corporations that have transformed hundreds of vacant city-owned buildings into thousands of affordable apartments in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan are involved in a plan to develop child care facilities for 900 children in 10 city neighborhoods. New York's community groups are the best resource to maximize Federal and local funds and harness private support to provide day care for low income families.
Working with these grass-roots community development corporations is the city's Human Resources Administration, which will contract for and support day care providers and help leverage Federal funds; my organization, which is a national nonprofit, providing funds and technical help to community groups and arranging bank financing, and Child Care, a nonprofit advocacy and referral organization, which is furnishing expertise in early childhood education programs.
In many cities, including New York, self-help and citizen-led initiatives -- when linked to innovative programs and even modest amounts of capital -- can make a difference in people's lives.

HEADLINE: Finding Gold, of a Sort, in Landfills

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa., Sept. 1

 BODY:
While most cities are still struggling to recycle today's trash, officials here have taken a novel approach to the waste problem -- they are mining yesterday's garbage.
At a municipal landfill nestled in rolling farmland along the Susquehanna River about 10 miles west of here, the detritus that is dug up helps feed a nearby incinerator that supplies electricity for more than 15,000 homes. 
 And landfill space once crammed with garbage is now available for trash that cannot be recycled or burned.
"Some people mine coal for energy, but when we mine, we mine garbage," said Herbert W. Flosdorf, executive director of the Lancaster County Solid Waste Authority, which operates the landfill.
 
Expense of Closing Dumps
 The number of communities and businesses that are turning the trash-disposal process on its head is small but growing. They not only recover usable resources and extend the life of dumps, but may also reclaim some that pose environmental threats.
Interest in such activities is heightened by Federal regulations taking effect in October that will require communities, which have been able to essentially ignore dumps they had filled and closed, to monitor shut landfills for 30 years.
Mining can delay the expenditure of millions of dollars in closing costs. Officials in some states like California, where there are already tough landfill closing laws, have begun to investigate the practice.
"This is all about economics," said Randall Forbes, manager of refuse disposal for the Department of Public Works in Mendocino County, Calif., which has begun studying whether to mine its landfill. "The real benefit may be that we can recover landfill space and use it again."
Proponents of garbage mining, however, caution that in many places the cost of digging up garbage can easily exceed that of simply buying new land. And some environmentalists note that it is far easier to recycle materials before they are buried.
"This is not a waste management strategy of the highest order," said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has its headquarters in New York City. "It underscores the absurdity of entombing everything we throw out."
Federal environmental officials said that it was far too soon to draw any conclusions about mining's benefits or speculate about the impact of new regulations. "This is really cutting-edge stuff that we have not had a chance to evaluate," said Bruce Weddle, director of the municipal waste division of the Environmental Protection Agency.
But it appears that in some cases, mining garbage may save a community money. For example, Collier County, Fla., which includes the city of Naples, has been excavating a landfill to recover an unlikely commodity: the dirt that is spread each day over newly dumped garbage to hold down odors and discourage rodents. This dirt, or cover soil, is extremely expensive in Florida, and officials estimate that they save about $500,000 a year by using the dirt extracted from old garbage mounds to cover newer, smellier, garbage.
As the dirt is excavated, metals, tires and other recyclable materials are also recovered and the rest of the exhumed trash is reburied in a newer part of the landfill that has better environmental protections, said William Lorenz, the country's environmental services administrator.
Some businesses are also looking to landfill mining. Mr. Forbes, the Mendocino County official, told of a lumber company that was hoping to sell dirt and decomposed bark from its landfill to the county for cover soil, and in the process clean up the site and turn it into a marketable piece of property.
Elsewhere, state officials like those in New York are investigating mining as a way of reclaiming problem landfills. In a bid to rejuvenate six dumps that have been ordered closed by state officials, the New York State Energy Research and Power Authority is financing mining projects at the landfills.
The move follows a 1990 experiment at a landfill outside Edinburg, N.Y., near Saratoga Springs, that indicated that some older dumps could be mined safely without releasing toxic materials like asbestos, said Eugene Salerni, an environmental engineer in Albany who directed the project.
But other experts cautioned that such mining could release buried hazards. "This is not much different than what is being done at Superfund sites," said William Rathje, a professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona in Tucson who has studied the history and environmental aspects of landfills. "It does not strike me as something that most local communities would want to mess around with."
The project here in Lancaster County appears to reflect both the potential and limitations of mining garbage. The project's roots stretch back to 1986, when the county decided to close five smaller landfills that no longer meet state standards and opened a 100-acre dump outside the village of Creswell.
Until January 1991, the landfill took in garbage from the county's 425,000 residents and businesses and buried it, producing mounds that were soon 60 feet high. But that month, a garbage incinerator was completed, and there was not enough new trash to run the incinerator at capacity. So officials started excavating 18 acres of the landfill to recover waste that could be burned at the incinerator, said Mr. Flosdorf.
Bulldozers and backhoes dig up old trash at the landfill and dump it into a cylinder-shaped sifter that separates dirt from household waste. Nearly 60 percent of the trash excavated, a hodgepodge of crushed milk cartons, shredded plastic garbage bags and soggy newspapers still showing the headlines of many yesterdays, can be burned in the incinerator.
About 10 percent -- trash like like rubber-backed rugs and bedsprings -- cannot be burned and must be reburied. And the remainder is the dirt, which is used to bury incinerator ash and other waste.
Mr. Flosdorf said the county makes a weekly profit of $4,000 from the electricity produced by the excavated waste, money that offsets the cost of mining. But more important, he estimated that the excavation had decreased the volume of garbage at the 18-acre site by 78 percent, a gain that would extend the dump's life by about four years.
"We don't want to build any more landfills in this county, so we want this one to last as long as possible," he said.
Still, Mr. Flosdorf's enthusiasm about mining is offset by the skepticism of other experts. "Even if this is a viable option, it could be commercially costly," said Mr. Hershkowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "You still have a lot of residue to discard and a lot of buried material that has been contaminated and degraded."
Mr. Rathje, the University of Arizona professor, said he was also cautious about the technique, adding that he believed society's emphasis should remain on recycling new garbage and reducing waste.
But he said that for communities that have decided to use incinerators, mining might make sense. And it could have an even broader appeal if the market for recyclable materials improves enough to make garbage mining cost-effective even without incineration.
"I do believe that somewhere down the line -- perhaps 5 years or perhaps 50 -- mining landfills for resources like aluminum, steel, plastic or the energy in paper is definitely going to be economically viable," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Health Proposal Includes New Program for Long-Term Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton's health plan will call for a new Government program to help finance long-term care for people with severe disabilities, regardless of their age or income, Administration officials said today.
The program would help pay for medical and social services that disabled people receive in their own homes, in adult day-care programs and at other sites outside nursing homes. The program would not cover services in a nursing home or an institution for the mentally retarded. 
 The plan is intended, in part, to meet the needs of elderly people, who already have coverage for hospital care and doctors' services under Medicare. By proposing the new benefit, Mr. Clinton increases the chances that he will win support from the elderly for his overall health care plan.
In the final days before it releases its health plan, the Clinton Administration is working to shore up support among such political constituencies by disclosing aspects of the plan that will appeal to important groups.
At other times, the Administration has appeared to be testing the waters for particularly controversial ideas. The Administration seemed today to back away from one such idea, to limit tax deductions that employers may take for the cost of their workers' health benefits. [Page B11.]
 
Paying 20 Percent of Cost
 White House documents on the proposal for long-term care say that disabled people would, on the average, have to pay 20 percent of the cost of services they get under the new program. But there would generally be no charge for people whose incomes fall below the official poverty level ($11,187 for a family of three in 1992).
Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 32 million elderly and 4 million disabled people, now covers very limited amounts of long-term care. Medicare beneficiaries could also qualify for the new benefit, providing "home and community-based services" outside a nursing home, if they paid a premium of $20 a month, beyond the standard Medicare premium, now $36.60 a month, the documents say.
The Clinton proposal would also establish Federal standards for private insurance covering the costs of long-term care, in or out of a nursing home. Sales of such insurance have been increasing rapidly, but Congressional investigators and consumer advocates have reported abuses in its marketing.
While Administration officials could not specify the cost of the new program, they said that it would be financed partly through premiums and cigarette taxes. The Government would make grants to each state, with the Federal share varying from 70 percent to 95 percent of the cost, the documents say. Each state's contribution would be "roughly equal to current state Medicaid spending on the severely disabled," the documents say.
 
'A Real Breakthrough'
 John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said the Clinton proposal would be "a real breakthrough in covering home and community-based services for people of all ages with mental and physical disabilities -- not just older people, but also victims of accidents and children with birth defects."
The proposal on long-term care will be formally presented, with the rest of Mr. Clinton's health plan, in a speech that he intends to deliver to a joint session of Congress later this month, probably the week of Sept. 20. Congress is expected to make many changes in Mr. Clinton's plan before approving legislation.
White House documents describing the President's plan say the program for long-term care has these components:
*Expanded home and community-based services.
*Improvements in Medicaid coverage for institutional care.
*Standards to improve the quality of private insurance for long-term care and tax incentives to encourage its purchase.
*Tax incentives that support the efforts of individuals with disabilities to obtain employment.
*A demonstration study intended to pave the way toward greater integration of acute and long-term care.
Administration officials see community care as a way to tend to people in their own homes, where they want to be, at lower cost than in nursing homes. But Linda Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care Association, a trade group for nursing homes, said: "The Administration is perpetuating a myth in trying to sell this as a cost-saving measure. Studies over the last decade show that expanding home and community-based care adds to health costs. It costs more money because it doesn't substitute for nursing home care but serves a different population."
Still, Stephen R. McConnell, senior vice president of the Alzheimer's Association, praised the presence of long-term care in the package, saying 1.2 million of the 4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease might be helped by the new program.
 
Providing Care to All
 The White House documents say that the proposal, to be known as the American Health Security Act, "increases Federal authority to provide home and community-based services to individuals with severe disabilities without regard to income or age."
States would decide which services should be available. They could include assistance to help people with daily living, adult day care, rehabilitation services, physical modifications of the home and technology to aid the disabled.
Administration officials say it is neither desirable nor possible for the Government to finance all long-term care. Accordingly, White House documents say Mr. Clinton will propose a wide range of tax breaks to encourage people to buy private insurance.
Americans have bought more than 2.9 million insurance policies covering the cost of nursing home care. Such costs on average are more than $31,000 a year per person and are much higher in big cities like New York. Many elderly people without such insurance have been forced to exhaust their savings to become poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, there would be a Federal tax credit for people with disabilities who work. They could use the credit to help pay for equipment or "personal-care services" that help them perform their work or daily activities.
To combat abuses in the sale of insurance for long-term care, Mr. Clinton will propose that the Government set "minimum standards" for such insurance within two years, the documents say.
The rules, to be enforced by state insurance commissioners, would require insurers to offer "inflation protection," so the value of a policy would not be eroded by the rising cost of long-term care.
Under the Clinton plan, the Government would also prohibit "improper sales practices." Insurers could not deny coverage because of an applicant's medical problems existing before a certain date. And consumers who have paid premiums for years would be entitled to some benefits even if they later let their policies lapse.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL CUTBACKS PROPOSED BY GORE IN 5-YEAR PROGRAM

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore today unveiled a set of more than 800 recommendations that he said would streamline "old-fashioned, outdated government," save $108 billion over five years and cut 252,000 Federal jobs by 1998.
The report recommends eliminating thousands of field offices for the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development and combining the enforcement and regulatory functions of various agencies. For example, the Drug Enforcement Administration would be absorbed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 The document says that eliminating some 252,000 jobs -- about 12 percent of the Federal payroll -- could save more than $40 billion over five years. It recommends drawing up the Federal budget every other year instead of annually. And it says $22.5 billion could be saved in five years by giving Government managers greater procurement authority on a broad range of purchases.
 
Looking to Business
 White House officials used the broadest possible brush in making the recommendations, drawing unabashedly from the experiences of corporations like General Motors and emphasizing how government can emulate private business and industry. Companies have come up with mixed results in their efforts to cut payrolls and other costs by making drastic changes in the way work is done. [Page B10.]
President Clinton immediately embraced the findings of the report, the National Performance Review, and pledged to act immediately to carry it out. But White House aides also cautioned against raising expectations about the ability to make sweeping change when some of the most significant suggestions would require Congressional consent and many of the savings would not be realized for years.
 
Suggestions From Past
 Mr. Gore's report, prepared over six months with the advice of thousands of Federal employees, incorporates suggestions made by past government-reform commissions with an upbeat assessment by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore that the system can actually be changed this time.
Mr. Gore said the report represented "a new customer-service contract with the American people, one that demonstrates to the taxpayers that their tax dollars will be treated with respect for the hard work that earned them."
And Mr. Clinton anticipated criticism that the report would be another in a series of government reviews that have had little practical effect. Later this week, he is expected to announce the first in a series of executive orders to force agencies to set up customer-service centers.
 
'Make No Mistake'
 "Make no mistake about this," Mr. Clinton said as he stood on the South Lawn of the White House with two forklifts piled with Government documents parked behind him. "This is one report that will not gather dust in a warehouse."
"To meet the challenges of the global economy and to better use new technology, our most successful companies have been through this process, many of them starting more than a decade ago -- eliminating unnecessary layers of management, empowering front-line workers, becoming more responsive to their customers and seeking constantly to improve the products they make, the services they provide and the people they employ," Mr. Clinton said. "Meanwhile, I have seen too little of this happen nationally."
 
Weight for Other Demands
 Mr. Clinton is planning to use the report as an underpinning for the other demands he plans to make on Americans this fall, including support for his health plan.
Mr. Clinton's political advisers have been assessing the mood of voters who have declared themselves disgusted with government. The advisers that a realistic effort to change will win support from disaffected citizens attracted to the anti-government message of Ross Perot and the movement to limit the terms of elected officials.
The key to winning, these advisers have said, is to provide convincing evidence that dramatic action is possible and at the same time to convince Federal employees and their unions that all job reductions -- or "simplification," as one official termed it today -- will be achieved through attrition.
"We do not think it will be extraordinarily painful, but we cannot say there will be no pain at all," the official said of the job reductions, adding that no political appointees would lose jobs. Middle managers would feel much of the effect of the recommendations, and their union has already objected.
 
Winnings Initial Praise
 The official spoke at a briefing on condition that she would not be quoted by name. Asked why some officials were being permitted to describe the plan for quotation and others were not, Mr. Gore's press secretary, Marla Romash, explained, "We set the rules."
Administration officials have told members of Congress that roughly two-thirds of the recommendations can be initiated by executive order. And the effort won plaudits from Republicans, Democrats and the representatives of the three major Federal labor unions today.
Almost everyone called it a first step in a difficult process.
"This is going to be a long, tough slog, even if Congress cooperates," said David Osborne, a consultant to Mr. Gore and co-author of the book "Reinventing Government" on which much of the review was based.
 
'Stronger Momentum' Seen
 Still, the endorsements were swift and bipartisan.
"There is a stronger momentum to change government today than there ever had been before," said Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Senate committee on Governmental Affairs.
Representative Bob Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, joined Mr. Glenn in calling for swift action and noted that many of the suggestions have been made by past Republican administrations.
As most parties were striving to present a united front, Mr. Clinton prepared to embark on a week of travel to Virginia, Ohio, California and Texas and Mr. Gore planned to appear on network talk shows, including David Letterman's new late-night television program on CBS.
As they worked to sell the recommendations, some muted objections surfaced. The report, for example, still included a recommendation to fold the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms into the F.B.I. Both Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen have expressed reservations about the plan.
But today, it seemed evident that Mr. Gore's planners had taken the initiative away from the Attorney General, going forward with the idea before Ms. Reno completed her review.
At the same time, Administration officials went out of their way to shift the blame for any inaction on the report to Congress. And Clinton advisers stressed that the changes being recommended were complicated and could take several years to accomplish.
 
'Marbeling in Meat'
 "You have a lot of political demagogues that run around and say that this fat in government is something that's stuck out over in the end, and you just take a hacksaw and chop it off," said John Sharp, the former Texas comptroller who oversaw a similar state streamlining effort there. "It's not. It's like marbling in meat, and you have to have very good people to get inside those agencies and work."
The recommendations Mr. Clinton is making could have a greater effect on Federal offices around the country than in Washington; both the Agriculture and Housing departments and the Army Corps of Engineers would dramatically scale back regional offices.
Individuals would also see the effect of the proposed changes at tax time, when the Internal Revenue Service would be forced to speed up its tax return system and accept credit cards for tax payments.
"The Government is broken, and we intend to fix it," Mr. Clinton said. "We can't do it unless we all understand that this isn't a Democratic goal or a Republican goal. This is an American imperative, and we all need to be a part of it."

HEADLINE: With a Gala, Barneys Opens Madison Ave. Store

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER

 BODY:
Here's a tale the Pressman family, owners of Barneys New York, will be telling for a while.
In September 1993, in the midst of an economic recession, Barneys opened a new store in New York, amid the toughest competition in town. And they had to fight to keep people away. 
 Well, from the opening at least. Last night, the crush of invitation-wielding guests was more Shubert Alley than Madison Avenue. There was the sort of shoulder-rubbing that retailers these days can only fantasize about. And this Barneys, which takes up almost a block, is the largest new specialty store to go up in Manhattan since the Depression. Its creators, the Pressmans, are among America's last retailing dynasties, having opened the first Barneys in 1923 at 17th Street and Seventh Avenue.
Inside the new French limestone store last night were the guests that Barneys hopes will be customers today when it opens to the public on 61st Street and Madison: Bianca Jagger, Joan Rivers, Barbara Walters, Lorraine Bracco, Bobby Short, Peter Gabriel and Barry Diller. And there was Mayor David N. Dinkins, who said, "It's a vote of confidence for our city by very smart business people."
The opening culminated a three-month publicity blitz. Those who made it past the velvet ropes found inside the customary sea of cosmetic and accessory counters. But as martini-wielding waiters threaded by, exotic fish floated in tanks amid the merchandise and camera flashes bounced off familiar faces, the glossy pages of this month's magazines touting Barneys came to life on cue.
"It's like a movie set of what retailing is, like what Mel Gibson would want if he went shopping," said a somewhat dazed Christian Francis Roth, a young New York designer.
They shopped as they socialized. Barneys didn't turn away a sale, even on opening night. Isabel Toledo, a New York designer, sold a sweater at 7:30. "My heart was pounding," said her husband, Ruben, an illustrator, who witnessed what may have been the evening's first transaction.
Designers gathered here from every fashion capital to admire their merchandise on display, with the hope that they were seeing the future of retailing.
Calvin Klein, who had not yet seen his selling space, said: "We have to keep moving ahead. When business is tough, it helps to separate the men from the boys. The competition is good for everyone."
That has been the drama surrounding the opening of the uptown Barneys. Chanel, for instance, decided earlier in the year not to compete with its own 59th Street boutique by supplying Barneys uptown. After more than an hour of browsing, the guests were squired through a passage to the Pierre hotel ballroom, where martinis gave way to all the other trappings of a 1940's supper club, including cigarette girls and a tuxedoed band. There was an old-fashioned bandstand, on which Barry White and Taylor Dayne sang a duet of Mr. White's hit, "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Baby," which Ms. Dayne recently re-recorded. .
The downtown contingent seemed happy to have made the trek. "Fortunately cabs go uptown," said Holly Soloman, the doyenne of the Soho art dealers.
Gene Pressman, store co-president, was happily escorting visitors, a job he plans to continue well into the year. "I can't wait to get on the selling floor," he said. "That's where the fun begins."

HEADLINE: Stocks Hit By a Surge In Selling

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Retreating from its record-setting summer rally, the stock market fell farther and faster than it had in more than a month yesterday, pulled down by concerns about the economy and a feeling by some analysts that the market is overheated and overpriced.
The Dow Jones industrial average sank 26.83 points to close at 3,607.10, after bouncing off the 3,600 level in late afternoon trading. The Dow's retreat was its largest since July 30, when it fell 27.95 points. Broader market indicators also fell yesterday. 
 Among the biggest losers were gold mining stocks, which were pulled down by a steep selloff in gold.
 
Analysts Discount the Slide
 Still, analysts were not extremely concerned about the drop, suggesting that its effects were likely to be temporary.
"Basically, you had a market that's had a pretty good run recently, that had moved pretty high above its short-term moving average," Philip H. Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, said. "We would call that somewhat extended, and say it was due to settle back a little bit."
Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody, attributed some of yesterday's selling to concerns about the strength of the economy. On Friday, the Government's weak employment report raised fresh doubts. Still, he predicted that these concerns would evaporate within the next several weeks, leaving the market strong.
"There are just too many favorable things occurring -- interest rates, precious metals heading down, and so on," Mr. Jarrett said. "The economy may be perceived to be a trifle weak, but it's no worse than it's been over the last six months."
Besides, Mr. Jarrett noted, in the last 21 years, the market fell on the first session following Labor Day two-thirds of the time.
 
Other Indicators Decline
 Among market indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 2.82 points, to 458.52. There were steeper losses among secondary stocks, with the American Stock Exchange composite index falling 5.29 points, to 456.28, and the Nasdaq composite index sliding 10.36 points, to 739.35. Trading volume rose to 229.5 million shares, from 197.2 million on Friday.
Mr. Smyth said that Birinyi had tracked one major program trade, defined as 15 or more issues and a million dollars or more of stock. The program began at 3:18 P.M. and ended at 3:37 P.M., he said, knocking the Dow down 8.94 points, to the day's low, before it rebounded a few points to its close.
"Other than that, it's mostly consistent selling going on -- nothing in the way of standout programs," he said.
The top five percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange were all gold stocks. Among them, preferred shares of Sunshine Mining lost 1 1/8, to 6 1/8 a share; Hecla Mining, fell 1 3/4, to 10 5/8, and Glamis Gold, was down 3/4, to 5 1/2.
Gold losers on the Amex included Granges Inc., off 3/8 to close at 21/16 a share; Republic Goldfields, down 1/2, to 2 5/8; Pegasus Gold, falling 2 7/8, to 18 1/4, and Echo Bay Mines, off 1 3/8, to 9 3/8.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery fell $14.50 an ounce, settling at $350.80, its lowest price since spring. Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation. But with few signs of inflation, demand has evaporated.
Interest-rate developments did not give the stock market the support they have supplied in the past. Long-term interest rates fell sharply in the bond market. After breaking through 6 percent on Friday, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.90 percent yesterday, from 5.94 percent Friday. But short-term rates rose slightly.
Among other decliners were some technology stocks, including Cisco Systems, a manufacturer of computer networking equipment, which closed down 4 at 43 3/8 a share in Nasdaq trading. Cisco was recently downgraded by analysts over concerns about its market share.
Microsoft fell 1, to 74 3/4. Microsoft announced a publishing venture today, a day after reports were first published saying that an inquiry into Microsoft's business practices had been extended into Europe.
Oil prices dropped today after the International Energy Agency made new, lower predictions of worldwide demand, even as OPEC announced that production of oil rose in August. Among the oil stocks, Pennzoil lost 2, to 66 3/4 a share.
The lower oil prices bolstered some airline issues. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, gained 1 1/4, to 144 1/4.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's View on Rates

BYLINE: Reuter

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in written remarks released today that short-term interest rates, adjusted for inflation, were "lower than necessary" to help the economy over the long run and would eventually have to rise.
But Mr. Greenspan was quick to caution, in answers to written questions from the Senate Banking Committee, that changes in such so-called real interest rates do not necessarily mean that nominal interest rates must rise. 
 "Current real short-term interest rates of about zero are below the levels toward which they ultimately will need to move to be consistent with achievement of the nation's economic objectives over time," he said.
The nominal interest rate on 90-day Treasury bills was below 3 percent today. The real interest rate is the nominal rate less the rate of inflation. If inflation is about 3 percent a year, the real rate is zero.
"A change in real interest rates does not necessarily imply a commensurate movement in nominal interest rates," he said. "Real interest rates can rise either because nominal rates increase or inflation expectations decrease."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks on short-term interest rates were similar to those he made when he appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on July 22.
In response to other questions from the committee, Mr. Greenspan wrote that economic activity in Europe and Japan was likely to recover only moderately, if at all.
He stated that continuing problems might include depressed consumer confidence, lackluster business spending because of weak profits or slow credit growth and, in some countries, falling property values.
In addition, Mr. Greenspan wrote that he opposed making it tougher for foreign financial institutions to do business in the United States, even though such sanctions might pressure other countries to open their markets more to American financial institutions.

HEADLINE: Gold's Downhill Ride Shifts to Higher Gear

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Gold prices, which have been sliding steadily for about a month, took a tumble yesterday, helping push down long-term interest rates and lower the dollar against other major currencies.
The drop of nearly 15 percent in gold prices from as high as $411 an ounce on Aug. 2 to as low as $350 an ounce yesterday has analysts wondering if the run-up of the spring and summer was an aberration. 
 Yesterday, gold for October delivery ended trading in New York down $14.50 an ounce, to $350.80, from Friday's price on the Commodity Exchange. (There was no New York trading on Monday because of Labor Day.) The trading was fueled by unconfirmed reports that European central banks, including the Bank of France, were selling gold bullion.
The more actively traded December contract dropped $14.60, to $352.50 an ounce. In London, gold was selling at $354.80 an ounce at the afternoon fixing, down $9.45 from Monday.
After falling to nearly $325 an ounce in early March, a level not seen since the mid-1980's, gold prices staged an impressive and almost relentless advance to the $411 price, a 26 percent climb and a level not seen since September 1990, soon after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
In some respects, the rally helped restore gold's image as a financial instrument and as a harbinger of inflation, a reputation badly tarnished the last three years as prices had registered steady declines.
But memories of the rally are dwindling fast, and analysts say they expect to see prices soften further.
"It took us five months to get from $325 an ounce to $411 an ounce, and markets tend to go down faster than they go up," said James R. Steel, a senior commodities analyst at Refco Inc., a Chicago commodities trading firm.
"I don't suspect we will get back to the lows of the year, but there is a good chance gold could fall to $335 an ounce."
A number of factors have contributed to gold's recent decline, Mr. Steel and other analysts said.
Currency traders, who were buying gold as the crisis over the European Exchange Rate Mechanism mounted in July, began selling in early August after a solution was found.
As gold prices rose the last few months, demand from important Asian markets like China began to dry up.
Perhaps most important, gold commodity funds, which were heavy buyers, began taking profits.
"Quite plainly, the commodity funds were the reason gold went up in the first place," said Warren G. Myers, a vice president and precious metals analyst at Merrill Lynch.
"They pushed it up, and now they are getting out and taking their profits." As prices slipped, commodities traders who chart prices in great detail, automatically sold out their gold stakes either to preserve their profits or halt losses.
 
Inflation Concerns Dwindle
 In addition, economists noted, much of the worry about inflation that accompanied and perhaps stimulated the rise in gold prices in recent months all but evaporated.
"Gold is making a real strong statement on disinflation," said Edward S. Hyman, president of International Strategy and Investment, a New York money management firm.
"Around the world, the policy picture remains conservative, with the German Bundesbank talking about gradualism, the Bank of Japan saying they won't cut the discount rate and the American Congress raising taxes."
In light of those conditions, Mr. Hyman said he expected the inflation rate to be about 2 percent this year. That sort of forecast, if borne out, is hardly conducive to a resurgence in gold prices.
Still, gold analysts and traders remained hopeful.
"From early 1988 until March of this year, we had a bear market in gold," Mr. Myers said. "I tend to view the recent correction as a healthy consolidation in what may be a healthy bull market. But that is more of a gut feel than anything else."
 
Still Above Costs
 Despite the recent decline, gold remains above the level of $290 to $325 an ounce that analysts say represents marginal production costs for many producers.
But Mr. Myers said that for some producers, gold should be left in the ground if prices stayed near $350 an ounce.
One gold trader, who asked not to be identified, said: "Market sentiment is that we are still in a downturn, and that there should still be further liquidation. I wouldn't be surprised to see it trade down to $345 an ounce."

HEADLINE: Japan Offers to Back Loans To Help Trim Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Worried by anger over Japan's huge trade surpluses and eager to use its capital to earn some good will overseas, the Government has decided to offer a new kind of loan guarantee to persuade reluctant Japanese financial institutions to make large new loans and investments overseas.
Officials said the Government-owned Export-Import Bank of Japan planned to announce on Wednesday that it would guarantee a 12-year loan of 8 billion yen, the current equivalent of about $77 million, by Japanese life insurance companies to Greece's state-owned railway. 
 The guarantee means that should the railway be unable to repay the loan or meet interest payments, the Export-Import Bank will. The guarantee thus lowers the interest rate the lenders charge and encourages them to make the loan for a longer term than they would otherwise permit.
The amount of the loan, the first to have such a guarantee, is modest but it is significant for several reasons. It is part of a quiet campaign the Japanese Government is waging to convince other countries that by "recycling" its surpluses in the form of aid, investments and loans to needy parts of the world the surpluses are actually beneficial.
"The policy implications are important," said Yuichi Ezawa, a senior executive director at the Export-Import Bank. "We have been making great efforts to use our excess savings. This new project will enhance the international flow of private funds."
Japan's relations with Europe and the United States have been increasingly strained by the country's soaring trade surpluses. From $63.5 billion in 1990, the surplus hit $132.3 billion last year and it is expected to come to more than $150 billion this year. About a third of that is with the United States and another third with the European Community, of which Greece is a member.
The loan guarantee is aimed directly at easing some of those tensions. "This loan to a member of the E.C. will help improve the Japan-E.C. economic relations, which are clouded by the trade imbalance," the bank said in a statement.
This is also in line with the theory held by some economists here that Japan's surpluses give the country the wherewithal to supply funds to needy areas of the world, which they say is a net plus for the world economy.
"I don't think Japan's trade surplus is hurting other countries," Ryutaro Komiya, a respected economist and head of a research institute at the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, said recently. "It enables us to export capital."
Many other economists argue, however, that a sustained reduction in Japan's surpluses would do more to help bring some balance to the world economy and improve two-way flows of goods and capital in the global trading system.
In 1987 Japan announced with much fanfare a five-year, $65 billion program to "recycle" its surpluses through aid grants, loans and investments. The Export-Import Bank played a major role, providing more than $20 billion in loans to developing countries that were not tied to the purchase of Japanese goods or services.
But foreign governments and economists have argued that Japan did not need its huge surpluses to provide this financing. Perhaps more important, the Government's efforts have been undermined by the fact that Japanese banks and corporations have cut back sharply on their overseas investments.
Thus, a Government plan to make another high-profile announcement of a second five-year "recycling" program in July was quietly scrapped. Fearing a backlash abroad, the Government made little effort to win publicity for its announcement that it plans to provide $120 billion over the next five years, and it dropped the term recycling from the title, which is now "funds for development."
Whether the new loan guarantee program can encourage Japanese institutions to invest more abroad is an open question. A recession at home and the crash of the stock market here has forced the private sector -- which holds most of the surpluses -- to pull back from the international realm.
After sending more than $130 billion a year abroad in the form of long-term private investments in the late 1980's, the private sector made just $28.5 billion in such long-term investments last year.
The new loan guarantee is aimed directly at trying to enhance this outflow of capital, since the actual loan is being supplied by private institutions.
Export-Import Bank officials said that though few other loans of this type are being considered now, they hope more will be made and that their size will grow. They also said they would look to poorer areas of Europe as well as the United States for providing such financing, not just the developing world.

Western Germany's economy is growing for the first time in 15 months, the Government said today, raising hopes that the country's deepest postwar recession had bottomed out.
Germany has the world's third-largest industrial economy after the United States and Japan. Its return to economic health would mean a better market for American and other foreign goods and could help end the worldwide recession. 
 But Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt said Germany's second-quarter growth of half a percent was not enough to signal the end of the recession.
 
'Slight Movement'
 "The first signs of light for overcoming the recession are unmistakable," Mr. Rexrodt said. "But it is premature to see a signal for an economic turnaround from this slight movement upward."
Germany's proposed 1994 budget contains $13 billion in spending cuts, which would allow the Government to contain the heavy borrowing it undertook to pay for rebuilding the former East Germany.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the spending cuts would allow Germany to hold its borrowing to about $41 billion. That would give the German central bank greater room to lower the country's interest rates, which are seen as a drag on the economies of other nations.
Germany has kept its interest rates up to protect the mark from inflationary pressures.
 
Quarter-to-Quarter Rise
 Second-quarter figures released by the Federal Statistics Office for western Germany showed gross domestic product fell 1.9 percent compared with the level for the comparable period last year.
But G.D.P. grew by half a percent compared with 1993's first quarter. It was a small rise but the first since the first quarter of 1992, when G.D.P. rose 1.5 percent compared with the last three months of 1991.
G.D.P. measures the total value of goods and services but excludes income that western Germany generates abroad. The data do not include G.D.P. for eastern Germany, which merged with western Germany nearly three years ago. Unemployment in the east is running at 15.4 percent, while in the west, 7.5 percent of the work force collects unemployment pay.

 BODY:
Despite sluggish sales growth and volume declines in several brands, including Starkist tuna, H. J. Heinz Company's fiscal first-quarter operating earnings improved 5.8 percent.
Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said he was pleased with the first-quarter results, "given the current economic environment in the United States and overseas." 
 Ted Smyth, vice president for corporate affairs at Heinz, said that a company policy not to use price promotions to reduce retailers' inventory discouraged the retailers from ordering new stock. Mr. Smyth said the decision was made to give Heinz more pricing freedom.
The food maker had operating earnings of $152.18 million, or 59 cents a share, in the quarter ending July 28, compared with operating earnings of $143.79 million, or 55 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues increased 1.2 percent, to $1.58 billion from $1.56 billion. Earnings for both periods exclude accounting charges.
Heinz ended fiscal year 1993 on a regimen of cost-cutting, layoffs and internal changes intended to increase profits from its line of condiments, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes, Starkist tuna, Weight Watchers entrees and other brand-name products.

HEADLINE: Coup Weary, Venezuelans Await a Vote

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Plaster and white paint have touched up bullet holes in the Presidential Palace, and democracy seems to be back on track in Venezuela, for now.
Carlos Andres Perez, facing trial on a corruption charge, packed his bags and boxes and moved out of the presidential residence on Wednesday, ending his rocky four-and-a-half-year stay. On May 21 Congress had suspended his presidential powers, a move that it made permanent on Aug. 31. 
 An independent caretaker President, Ramon J. Velasquez, is minding the store until a new President is elected in December and inaugurated in February.
Although a month never passes here without a coup scare, a tight electoral calendar and a 50 percent military pay raise promised for January seem to have defused major threats from Venezuela's restive armed forces. After two violent coup attempts last year, 80 percent of Venezuelans polled say they oppose a third uprising.
 
A Major Source of Oil
 "There have not been any military conspiracies," President Velasquez, a 76-year-old former historian and journalist, said in an interview. "This city lives off rumors."
But just the way art restorers failed to camouflage a bullet hole in an oil painting in the President's waiting room, the rips and tears in Venezuela's social and economic fabric are easy to see.
Increasingly, Americans follow developments here with keen interest. After Saudi Arabia, Venezuela is the second largest source of imported oil for the United States. After Mexico, Venezuela is Latin America's second largest importer of goods from the United States.
Over the last six weeks, eight small bombs have exploded around this capital. Coupled with bomb scares provoked by anonymous telephone callers, the incidents seemed intended to keep the city on edge and to intimidate judges who are investigating high-level corruption.
In the nation's biggest clean-government drive in memory, Mr. Perez and his predecessor, Jaime Lusinchi, face trials on separate corruption charges. An anticorruption court is investigating Cecilia Matos, a longtime companion of Mr. Perez who now lives in New York.
In the armed forces, 12 general-level officers are either awaiting trial on criminal charges that range from drug trafficking to rebellion to stealing public money or are under investigation.
 
Economic Growth Slows
 Helping drive the anticorruption campaign is deep resentment over the humbled economic status of Latin America's largest oil exporter.
Inflation is running at 37 percent a year. Economic growth, after averaging 9 percent over the last two years, is slumping this year to 3 percent.
The inflation stems from a $3 billion budget deficit pried open by falling oil prices. Holding the world's largest oil reserves outside the Persian Gulf, Venezuela relies on state oil company exports for two-thirds of federal Government income.
In 1981, a golden age remembered as "Saudi Venezuela," oil sales added up to $19 billion. This year, they are expected to hit $11 billion.
To close the deficit, Congress delegated decree powers to President Velasquez last month to institute a sales tax and a company assets tax. But no politician here dares to plug one gaping fiscal hole: the pricing of gasoline at 22 cents a gallon.
Retreating from 20 years of stubborn nationalism in the energy field, Congress also approved $10.4 billion worth of joint ventures last month between foreign companies and the state oil company, Petoleos de Venezuela. One joint venture, a $5.6 billion liquefied natural gas project, ranks as the largest single energy project ever undertaken here.
 
State Sector Cut Further
 Faced with few choices, President Velasquez is continuing his predecessor's policies of cutting Venezuela's state sector. Over the next six months, the Government plans to privatize a dozen state companies, including Aeropostal, a major airline.
The delicate job of guiding this volatile nation through 1999 will fall to the winner of the Dec. 5 elections. With the field crowded by 17 candidates, Venezuela's next President will probably take office endorsed by no more than one-third of voters.
All polls currently forecast that the winner will be Rafael Caldera, a former President who is running as an independent candidate with the support of 16 small and largely left-wing parties.

HEADLINE: In the Inner City, a Hungry Scramble for a Few Choice Classroom Seats

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 7

 BODY:
There is a powerful hunger among parents in America's big cities for a quality public school. Last spring, Wayne State University announced it would be starting a new middle school, open to any Detroit child in sixth to eighth grade. More than 6,000 applications were submitted in two months -- for 330 spots.
At the selection lottery, Gov. John Engler noted that one child, Calvin Walker Jr., had applied 100 times. 
 "I didn't realize we did 100," said Calvin's mother, Diane, a nurse's aide. "I thought maybe 60 or 80. I lost track."
Karen Terry, a single parent, anointed her application with blessed oil from her church, Ever Increasing Faith Ministries. "I prayed every day," Ms. Terry said. "When I heard Gerard got in, I screamed, I yelled, I jumped, I praised God and thanked Jesus."
Frank Gillespie, chief of staff for a state legislator, tried speaking with a Wayne State dean about his daughter, Nicole. "I'm no fan of the Detroit schools, so I wanted this bad," he said. "I've always been able to get something done in this town by knowing somebody. This dean said, 'I wish you all the luck in the world but it's not going to work that way.' I was impressed. I couldn't grease them."
 
What Attracts Parents
 As social pressures on cities mount and the Federal financing share of urban education drops (from 12 percent in 1980 to 9 percent today), many parents say their search for a trustworthy city school is growing more frantic. These special public schools may be called magnet, choice or alternative schools, and while some require entrance exams or auditions, most do not. They are someplace special for a child who is not necessarily a star. A cherished spot comes from the luck of the draw or being first in line.
Because a seat at the Wayne State University Public School was so coveted, university officials hired Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, to run a computerized lottery so there would be no question of favoritism.
The lottery means that parents come from all social classes, including Judy Kelley, who is on welfare; Marvin Davis, an assembly-line worker at Ford, and Mr. Gillespie, a lawyer (even without "grease," his Nicole made it). The two things most parents share is race -- the school, like Detroit's population, is mostly black -- and an uncommonly strong motivation to have their children succeed.
All this excitement over the new school is remarkable, when one considers that the school that does not provide bus transportation, is surrounded by homeless shelters and crack dealers downtown, and will receive the same state financing per pupil as a regular Detroit public school. Furthermore, the school had not taught a single student until today, when classes started at 8 this morning.
The parents who mailed in all those applications believe that the new Wayne school will have a more motivated staff than most city schools (300 teachers applied for 14 jobs), that it will benefit from its association with the university, that it will be a magnet for philanthropy (before opening it had attracted $575,000 in corporate donations), that it will be smaller (city middle schools have 600 to 1,000 students) and have smaller classes (25 students versus 35 for city middle schools), and that it will demand more from their children.
 
Longer School Year
 In Los Angeles, 107 of 700 schools are now magnets. This year, 38,000 students in Los Angeles applied for 8,000 vacancies at those magnets. The most popular, Sherman Oaks Center, had 2,000 applicants for 340 slots. In the Miami-Dade County schools in Florida, 11,000 students applied for 4,500 magnet vacancies. In New York City last spring, after the high school selection was completed, officials announced 32 new specialty schools. In two weeks, 8,000 students applied for 4,000 slots -- at schools that were still essentially ideas on a piece of paper.
And while the Wayne school can be seen as a commentary on the sad shape of the city school system here, 53 of Detroit's 256 schools are now choice schools with their own long waiting lists. Last year, when it opened here, the Mae C. Jemison Academy, an "Afro-centric" public school, had 800 applications for 120 slots.
The Wayne school's day is longer than most public middle schools, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., and so is the school year, 200 days rather than 180. As Kathy Neumann registered her son Peter, she said, "It's good that they'll go to school in the summer."
"What?" said Peter, looking like Cobo Hall had just been dropped on his head.
Ms. Neumann said, "Peter hasn't heard all the details yet."
"What?" said Peter.
 
Interested Parents
 Ms. Terry, a program scheduler at radio station WQBH, says because she knows what a bureaucracy can do in an urban system of 170,000 students, she always takes a week off when school starts and another when it ends "to make sure there are no slip ups for Gerard."
At registration, Kathleen Walker, a cook for a vending company, signed up for the school's parent dress code committee. "I'm letting them know I'm one of those interested parents," she said." She was the 96th parent to join the dress code committee in a school of 330 students.
Ms. Walker's son, Demitirius Porter, an eighth grader, had attended Columbus Middle School where, she said, gangs hassled him. "Tell the reporter you're an honors student," his mother said, "and stop fidgeting."
"Oh yeah," Demitirius said, "I'm an honors student."
"Tell him what you did this summer."
"I worked at a car wash."
"Tell him your other little jobs."
"A little paper route."
"And your other little job."
"I cleaned up at a metal shop."
To get to school, Demitirius left his house at 6:30 this morning, taking two city buses. "I'm very proud of my son," Ms. Walker said. "Now don't get me wrong -- he's a typical boy."
 
More Hours for Less Pay
 Teachers clamor for a school like Wayne, where they can start fresh and work with children like Demitirius. New York City's new specialty schools typically had more than 200 teachers apply for eight positions at a school.
Most Wayne teachers are working more hours and earning the same or less than they would in a city school. Carolyn Glover, a speech teacher who just graduated from college, says she will make $5,000 less, John Harris, the principal, is making $52,000, $20,000 below his city salary.
If Claude Tiller Jr. had kept his job at a Detroit middle school, he would have had the summer off, reporting for work on Aug. 30. He said he started planning sessions at the new school in June. "It's worth it," he said. "This is a big thing to put on your resume."
The teachers' backgrounds at this new school are less conventional. Maura Lobos spent a decade in children's education at a science museum. This morning her room was decked out with a boa constrictor, three mice, an African clawed toad and dozens of stuffed animals. "We'll be getting South American cockroaches," she said, and all the students went "Oooo!"
 
$1.2 Million Startup Grant
 Wayne State had hoped to run several Detroit schools. Beginning in 1989, university officials spent two years negotiating with public school leaders. But Detroit officials and leaders of the teachers union were not receptive to the idea. They felt Wayne State would draw off the city's most motivated teachers and students, and siphon off grant money.
There would be no Wayne public school today if Governor Engler had not signed a bill last year permitting universities to bypass local districts and create their own public schools with state financing.
Wayne was awarded a $1.2 million startup grant from the state. The Detroit Superintendent of Schools, Deborah M. McGriff, complained that she does not get that kind of money to renovate her "choice" schools.
Ms. McGriff's concerns are legitimate, says Dr. Judith Stein, president of Magnet Schools of America, which represents 5,400 magnets. In Miami, where Dr. Stein works, magnets get $900 more per child than regular public schools. "Good education costs money," she said. "We've downgraded public education so far. It's not like magnets are that special; they should be standard.
"Magnets get tons of private contributions, too. We are a niche within this vast sea of public education. A lot of businesses do not want to give to the traditional big-city school. They see it as throwing money down a well."
The Wayne staff is aware of the resentment among city school officials, and everyone interviewed at the school recited the same mantra: nothing they said was meant to reflect badly on the city schools.
 
'Violence and Trouble'
 But that is not how parents see it. Diane Walker, who sent in the 100 applications, said, "There's so much violence and trouble in the schools, especially if you have a boy." She had also applied to one of the city "choice" middle schools, but Calvin was not selected.
Mrs. Walker started her large mailing with an application for the Wayne school printed in the Detroit newspapers. She called the school and requested more. "My friends at work kept bringing them in," she said. "They said this is perfect for you, Diane."
In June, she received a notice of an information meeting at North Rosedale Community Center near her home. "I was excited," Mrs. Walker said. "I thought it meant he'd get in. When I got there my heart sank. It was standing room only with lines out front. The principal made a speech inside and someone else spoke to the people outside. They talked about the arts, music, language. They didn't talk about sports, which was fine."
After the meeting, she said, she and her husband, a butcher, each grabbed another stack of applications.
When the lottery was held in July, she learned that officials had decided to allow one application per student; duplicates were eliminated.
Calvin was not picked. Today he was at Murphy Middle School. "Maybe it will be all right," Mrs. Walker said. "You know, all this time I've been afraid that because we filled out so many duplicates it actually hurt Calvin's chances somehow. I've been a little afraid it was my fault he didn't get in."

Chart: "A New School Year: More Students, More Spending"
 Students around the nation are returning to school in circumstances vastly different from those of a decade ago.
 PUBLIC SCHOOL ENROLLMENT is rising, especially in the lower grades and even more so in kindergarten. "There's a mini baby boom," said Chris Pipho of the Education Commission of the States, a private research organization in Denver. A leading reason, he added, is the influx of children of immigrants.
 At the same time, PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT, which fell in the mid-80's in part because many Catholic schools closed, has been gaining rapidly in the 90's. And so has COLLEGE ENROLLMENT, especially in two-year colleges. "Because of the downturn in the economy," Mr. Pipho said, "many unemployed or underemployed people went back to school."
 SPENDING jumped in the 1980's, far outstripping the rise in the number of students and teachers. That was a time of growing state and Federal demands on schools and colleges alike - required curriculums and laws requiring that buildings be accessible to the handicapped and free of asbestos.
 But with the recession, schools have come under great pressure to curb their costs, and the spending increase has slowed.

HEADLINE: Washington Takes Leaf From Business Manuals

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In its drive to streamline the Federal Government, the Clinton Administration is following the path that Corporate America has been on for years. It is called "downsizing" or "re-engineering," in business jargon, while the code phrase among policy makers is "reinventing government." Whatever the terminology, it means drastically changing the way work is done -- and it also means significant job cuts.
In the private sector, the results have been decidedly mixed. Companies like General Electric and Xerox have become leaner, more competitive forces in the global economy, while the jury is still out on struggling giants like I.B.M. and General Motors. 
 The companies that have succeeded, management experts say, have strong leaders who are willing to keep pushing for change for years and who can convince the rank and file that a new order is both necessary and possible.
 
A Best-Selling Topic
 "Coming up with ideas is the easy part, but getting things done is the tough part," said Michael Hammer, a management consultant who is the co-author with James Champy of a current best seller, "Re-engineering the Corporation."
"The place where these reforms are going to die is not at the Cabinet level, but down in the trenches," said Mr. Hammer, who sat on one of Vice President Al Gore's panels on overhauling the Government.
The Federal bureaucracy, to be sure, has been the object of management theories and reform commissions since 1905, with little apparent effect. But this time, some analysts are encouraged by the high-level commitment from President Clinton and Vice President Gore, and a genuine sense within the Government that real change is both necessary and possible if Washington is to continue providing services when budgets are crimped.
In the past, they say, attempts to make the Government more efficient have foundered because most politicians regarded such efforts as the boring side of politics, while marketing new policy ideas is where the headlines and the votes are. In truth, the management side of government still is less exciting than policy making, but the opportunity for saving money and raising revenues to protect pet programs is simply too large to ignore any longer.
Most Government agencies can trim 15 to 30 percent of their budgets, David Osborne and Ted Gaebler estimated in "Reinventing Government," a best seller last year and a book that President Clinton has called a blueprint for overhauling the Government.
 
Less Emphasis on Policy
 "That's a very lucrative target to go after," said Mr. Gaebler, who runs a government consulting firm in San Rafael, Calif. "And that is why we're seeing real interest from leaders at every level of government in how governments do things rather than what the policies are."
Yet the proposals produced by the Vice President could mean a wrenching adjustment for the Federal bureaucracy and possibly for the economy as well. The Government is the country's largest employer, with about 4.4 million workers, and the 250,000 Federal jobs that Mr. Gore intends to eliminate equals the payroll of 10 average Fortune 500 companies.
Management experts question whether Government leaders, so much more susceptible to interest group pressures than corporate executives are, will continue to push for difficult changes in the months ahead. Examples from the private sector show how lengthy and difficult even the successful transitions can be, taking years and often proving quite unpopular early on.
 
A Corporate Example
 The General Electric Company, under John F. Welch Jr., its chairman, is often cited as a success story. Since 1981, G.E.'s work force has dropped to 230,000 from 418,000, while revenues have more than doubled, to $60 billion, and profits have increased more than fourfold, to $4.6 billion.
"You can be successful at transforming large enterprises, but at the same time you've got a lot of painful dislocations of people," said Noel Tichy, a professor of business at the University of Michigan, who headed G.E.'s management development program in the mid-1980's. "And you don't win any popularity contests in the early going."
A crucial factor in the Clinton Administration's effort, Professor Tichy added, will be whether senior civil servant managers can be removed for poor performance. "You've got to make sure the right incentives for government to save and earn, not just spend, are injected into the bureaucracy," he said. "And to accomplish that, you've got to have the freedom to move senior people around or out."
The basics of the current management theories, like re-engineering, tend to sound like little more than common sense. One popular edict is to "focus on the customer," which is presumably what all businesses are set up to do. Also high on the list of current management virtues is to "empower" workers, which means giving employees responsibility and rewarding them for taking the initiative in improving products or practices. Again, it seems like a firm grasp of the obvious rather than a startling insight.
 
Making Do With Less
 Re-engineering an organization amounts to abandoning old ways and doing things smarter. Although it tends to be referred to as "core process redesign," it typically means removing layers of middle management, eliminating reporting requirements and holding fewer meetings. When successful, the result is using fewer people to process insurance claims or cutting in half the time required to bring out a new generation of personal computer.
"Even re-engineering, let's face it, is not rocket science," said Michael Watkins, an assistant professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "This stuff isn't deep; it's hard to implement."
Still Professor Watkins, a specialist in organizational change within business and government, points to examples of Federal agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in the Treasury Department, where managers are increasing efficiency through re-engineering programs.
"It is quite possible to make significant improvements," he said. "And the best public-sector managers have learned to succeed despite the more restrictive framework of government."

New Curbs Urged for Municipals

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The chief regulators of the municipal bond industry recommended yesterday that sharp restrictions be placed on political contributions from underwriters and others to help clear the clouds now over the industry.
They also urged more mandatory disclosure of financial information on bonds trading in the secondary market. 
 The recommendations came in reports from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the National Association of Securities Dealers to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance.
 
 
A Basis for Action
 The recommendations, which will be discussed at a committee hearing tomorrow, may become the basis for legislative or regulatory action in response to recent scandals that have raised questions about the influence of money in the municipal market.
Investigations are under way in New Jersey, where the Governor's chief of staff resigned after questions were raised about dealings involving a New Jersey Turnpike bond issue. The dealers of Massachusetts Water Resources Authority have also come under fire over secret agreements between financial advisers and underwriters that allowed for fee splitting.
The S.E.C.'s report concludes that "although the municipal market generally functions in an effective manner, there are significant areas where improvements can be made."
In a statement, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the subcommittee, said: "In recent months, considerable attention has been focused on questionable practices relating to the underwriting and sale of municipal securities. With these reports, the regulators have now weighed in with a comprehensive package of suggested regulatory and legislative solutions."
 
 
Reporting Contributions
 The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board has proposed a rule that will require bond dealers to report their political contributions made two years before and two years after they are involved in a municipal bond sale. The proposal is endorsed by the S.E.C. and the N.A.S.D.
The S.E.C. is also continuing its review of political contributions by underwriters "to determine the nature and extent of improper campaign contributions and influence-peddling practices in connection with municipal offerings."
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's proposal includes a ban on contributions to state and local officials from underwriters and others involved in the municipal bond market. But such a ban will be difficult to enforce, analysts say.
 
 
Mandating Disclosure
 The S.E.C has proposed new legislative authority to allow it to mandate disclosure of new financial information about issuers after bonds have been sold and are trading in the secondary market. This would require repeal of the so-called Tower amendment, which protects the authority of local governments on what they choose to disclose to investors.
If new legislation is not possible, the S.E.C. proposes using existing regulations that can prohibit dealers from recommending municipal bonds unless the issuer continues to provide important financial data.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the N.A.S.D. endorsed a voluntary approach to financial disclosure. The S.E.C. report, however, says this approach has not worked. The commission must approve regulations proposed by the rule-making board.
The S.E.C. report also proposes changes to make the data on the trades of actively traded municipal bonds available to the public.
 
Treasury Market
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell yesterday as prices continued to rally on the belief that inflation would remain low and economic growth would stay slow. A sharp decline in gold prices and other commodities helped the low inflation environment.
But the price of the bond, which was up more than a point, tailed off late in the day, apparently after comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His comments also turned earlier gains at the short end of the market into losses on the day.
In a written response to questions from the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan indicated that short-term interest rates would have to begin rising some time. While this remark was similar to what he said in July, when he testified before Congress, it seemed to be enough to worry investors after a blistering rally that carried the price of the long bond up three points in just three days.
"I don't know why they are paying attention to that now but for the dizzying heights the bond is at," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities.
The price of the 30-year 6.25 percent bond ended up 17/32 at 104 28/32 as the yield fell to 5.90 percent, down from 5.94 percent on Friday and 6.04 percent on Thursday. Before the remarks by Mr. Greenspan were made public by the Senate Banking Committee, the yield had dropped as low 5.86 percent.
The price of the two-year note, which was up 1/32 with the yield down to 3.68 percent, ended down 2/32 with the yield at 3.73 percent, up from 3.69 percent Friday.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
At the age of 1, New York 1 News keeps trying new sales ideas.

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SOMETIMES in advertising, success can be measured in cockroaches.
Seeking to overcome the Clorox Company's reluctance to buy commercial time for its Combat line of insecticides, the advertising sales executives at New York 1 News, the 24-hour local news cable television channel, produced a sales package tailored to the giant marketer's particular needs. 
 Not only do Combat's spots run before and after New York 1's environmental news reports, but coupons and brochures for the brand are included in a free "welcome kit" delivered to homes that order service installations from the parent Time Warner Cable.
"We did an analysis on cost per roach instead of cost per thousand," said Allen N. Blum, a sales director at New York 1 News, using the term for the benchmark measurement for media buys.
"We just don't sell spots and dots," he added. "The people we're successful with understand we think out of the box."
And so it goes for New York 1 News, which turns 1 today. Though the fledgling channel has been making progress on the advertising front, its growth efforts have been retarded by the sour local economy and the intensely combative New York television market, where broadcasters and cable operators joust in a battle far fiercer than any household's war on pesky insects.
For instance, New York 1 News's rates for 30-second spot commercials have ranged from $100 to $200. A year ago, the channel had planned to charge $200 to $750.
And there is the occasional setback like the decision last week by Howard Koeppel to withdraw about $50,000 worth of commercials for his Infiniti, Mitsubishi and Nissan auto dealerships in Queens. Mr. Koeppel, a supporter of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for New York City mayor, complained that the channel's coverage was biased in favor of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"In light of our economic situation and the competitiveness, we're proud of what we've accomplished," Rodney B. Lowenstein, a sales director, said last week during an interview at New York 1's office in midtown Manhattan.
In the channel's first 12 months, said Larry J. Fischer, president of Time Warner City Cable Advertising, which handled sales for New York 1 News, advertising revenues exceeded $4.5 million, adding that they should reach $6 million for calendar year 1993.
"We're bullish," he said, adding, "We think we can outdo that" in 1994.
Those figures pale against the costs of starting New York 1 News, estimated at $10 million, and its annual operating costs, also estimated at $10 million. But such shortfalls are typical of ambitious media start-ups.
Still, Mr. Fischer said, "we need to generate more spot advertising," to complement the channel's results with selling sponsorships of specific programs.
"The proof of the pudding is right about now, at renewal time," he added. "We're getting tremendous response and are confident just about every sponsor will renew." They include Anheuser-Busch Inc., which signed a 65-week contract to sponsor the channel's nightly sports report, called "Budweiser Sports on 1," and New York Telephone, which signed a 52-week contract to sponsor segments like community calendar listings.
Such programming-driven advertising opportunities are emblematic of New York 1 News's marketing strategy. For example, Paul Sagan, vice president of news and programming, disclosed that the channel had agreed to televise the New York City Marathon on Nov. 14 beyond 2:30 P.M., Eastern time, when ABC Sports and WABC-TV are scheduled to end their coverage.
"That's the real New York marathon -- the other 20,000 people who finish anonymously," he asserted.
Mr. Fischer noted that his sales force is "hoping that New York Marathon sponsors will ante up additionally for our coverage." He is also planning to create short segments using archival footage of past races, call them "New York Marathon Moments" and seek sponsors for them, too.
And Mr. Lowenstein said the American Express Company, "which does not buy local cable in this marketplace," had agreed to a "six-figure deal" to sponsor entertainment segments for the next 52 weeks. The agreement came through its agency, Ogilvy & Mather New York.
When New York 1 News signed on last Sept. 8, it was available in about 850,000 homes with cable, all served by Time Warner systems. Now it is available in close to 1.2 million homes as a result of its first conquest -- an agreement to be carried by a cable system not owned by Time Warner. That came last week, when Cablevision signed to add its systems covering the Bronx and part of Brooklyn.
Landing the Bronx finally put the "New York" in New York 1 News, giving it coverage of all five boroughs, which Mr. Sagan called "important from an editorial and a marketing position."
"We're not sure what critical mass is," he added, "but a million is a nice number."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slides Against Mark And Also Drops Versus Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar slumped to a 13-week low against the German mark yesterday amid growing speculation that Germany's interest rates will remain high while poor economic growth keeps American rates depressed.
The dollar also fell against other currencies, including the Japanese yen, as trading resumed in the United States after the Labor Day holiday. 
 In New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.6047 marks, its lowest level since June 4, before recovering to close at 1.6135 marks, down from 1.6222 marks on Friday. It also dropped to 104.23 Japanese yen, from 104.55 yen on Friday.
"Marks are still in demand," said Paul Farrell, chief dealer at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "The dollar will test 1.60 marks this week, easily."
The dollar has fallen more than 8 percent against the mark since July 30, and its slide has accelerated since the Labor Department reported on Friday that the economy lost 39,000 nonfarm jobs in August. The report convinced many investors that the American economic recovery has lost momentum.
 
Forces Against Dollar
 Without stronger growth, interest rates in the United States are likely to remain low, making investments denominated in dollars less attractive.
"The U.S. economy looks weak and German central bankers are being stingy with the rate cuts," said David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange analyst at MCM Currency Watch. Those forces are conspiring to drive the dollar lower, he said.
With the slumping German economy showing signs of life, fewer analysts and traders expect Germany's central bank to lower interest rates when its leaders hold their regular policy meeting tomorrow, Mr. Gilmore said.
The Bundesbank left a key money-market rate unchanged yesterday, an indication that it will leave the discount rate steady at 6.75 percent, traders said.
A bigger-than-expected increase in western German gross domestic product reinforced the notion that the German economy is on the rebound, making the case for rate cuts less pressing, traders said. Western German gross domestic product rose five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.
The dollar did stage a rally late in the day after the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said short-term interest rates must rise eventually.

HEADLINE: Abbey Offers Total Care $197 Million

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Abbey Healthcare Group said yesterday that it would buy Total Pharmaceutical Care for $197 million in cash and stock.
Analysts said the deal was a logical match for two companies that have carved out complementary niches in a business that provides nursing care, equipment, drugs, therapy and intravenous nutrition to patients at home, where such services are usually less costly than in a hospital. 
 The announcement of the agreement sent Total's stock soaring to $21.25, up $8, in Nasdaq trading of about 1.6 million shares. Abbey's stock dropped 75 cents, to $22.125, on Nasdaq trading of about 203,000 shares.
 
Outstanding Stock Is Sought
 Abbey Healthcare, which earned $7 million on revenue of $147.4 million in the first half of the year, said it would buy Total's outstanding stock for $19 a share in cash and $4 a share in Abbey common stock.
Total, based in Torrance, Calif., is to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbey, based in Costa Mesa, Calif. Total had first-half earnings of $4.2 million on revenue of $43.6 million.
The two companies both have offices in the Northeast and the West, but their services overlap only slightly. Abbey specializes in medical equipment for rehabilitation and respiratory therapy, while Total focuses on patients who need drugs and nutrients delivered intravenously.
William Hicks, a vice president at Cowen & Company in Boston, said he considered the purchase price "high relative to the other players in the industry."
"What they appear to be banking on are the synergistic benefits from the merger: economies of scale and leveraging existing customer or referral relationships," he said.
Joel M. Ray, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York, said more and more home health care companies were considering joining forces to benefit from what they predict will be sweeping changes in the nation's health care system.
Under a plan expected to be proposed in the coming months by President Clinton, buyers of health care would form alliances so they could demand lower prices. In such an environment, Mr. Ray said, larger home health care providers would flourish.
"The purchasers are going to want to deal with larger entities versus smaller entities," he said. "So you are going to see more amalgamations of provider networks."
Abbey has been in the acquisition market for some time. Last spring, it tried to buy the Lifetime Corporation, a Boston-based provider of home health care personnel, but Lifetime rejected the offer and was later purchased by Olsten, an office temporary and nursing services company.
 
Public Offering Planned
 Abbey said it would pay for Total by selling senior subordinated debt through a public offering.
The company said Timothy M. Aitken, president, chairman and chief executive officer of Abbey, would become executive chairman of Abbey's board of directors and continue as president of the Abbey Home Healthcare subsidiary.
Victor M. G. Chaltiel, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Total, is to become a director, president and chief executive officer of Abbey and continue as president of the Total subsidiary.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Head Start on Data Superhighway

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
As the boundaries blur among the telephone business, cable television and wireless communications, no company may be better prepared to navigate the new landscape than the Comcast Corporation, the nation's third-largest cable provider and fifth-largest independent cellular phone company.
For years, the smart money bet that only the conventional local telephone companies would have the money and expertise to build the information superhighway that would bring phone calls, data communications and video-on-demand to American households. But now cable television companies plan to deliver the same services at lower cost. And soon, the cable companies may outrun the phone companies by linking wireless communications services to their lower-cost cable networks. 
 "The future of cable television is brighter than ever, and so is ours," said Ralph J. Roberts, Comcast's dapper 73-year-old chairman, who runs the company with his son, Brian, 34, Comcast's president.
Alone among the major cable operators, Comcast has its hands in almost every sector of telecommunications. The exceptions are paging and long-distance, and even long-distance may eventually change if something comes out of Comcast's continuing talks with A.T.& T. and the MCI Communications Corporation over multimedia technology.
These are exciting days indeed for Comcast, the Philadelphia-based company that the Robertses have built from an $83 million concern a decade ago into one with revenue of $900.3 million last year.
Two weeks ago, the CBS television network capitulated to Comcast and other cable operators. Under a new Federal law, CBS had wanted cable companies to pay it fat cash fees for the right to carry network programs like the top-rated "60 Minutes."
But in an example of the cable industry's newfound power, CBS agreed to be compensated not in cash, but with a new CBS cable channel. Such a channel, devoted to public policy, could win new subscribers for Comcast but mire CBS in development costs.
Earlier in the summer, A.T.& T. had agreed to buy McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. for $12.6 billion, one of the largest deals ever and one that enhanced the value of most cellular operations, including those of Comcast. Comcast's stock has been trading in the low 30's recently, well above its 52-week low of $13.50. Yesterday in Nasdaq trading, the shares were down 12.5 cents, closing at $30.375.
 
Big Day Approaching

 
 Comcast, like dozens of other big communications companies, is eagerly awaiting Sept. 23. That is the day the Federal Communications Commission is to announce ground rules for personal communications services, or P.C.S., a nascent industry that aims to provide cheaper and smaller wireless devices for the mass market. These devices could include pagers with built-in answering machines, wireless fax machines and even tinier pocket telephones than the shirtpocket versions available today.
The F.C.C. permitting, cable operators like Tele-Communications Inc., Time Warner and Comcast plan to bid next year for the newly available radio frequencies that will make these devices possible.
In P.C.S., as with other emerging technologies, cable operators believe they have an edge over the local phone companies. The reason: traditional copper telephone lines do not have the capacity to carry much more than voice conversations. And even though phone companies like GTE and Pacific Telesis have laid thousands of miles of ultrahigh-capacity fiber optic lines connecting cities, they have laid next to none that lead directly to neighborhoods and individual homes.
To extend fiber optic lines to neighborhoods would require a huge rewiring effort by the phone companies involving up to 200 million miles of local lines nationwide, or the equivalent of four times the distance between Earth and Mars. And the price would be an astronomical $276 billion, according to a variety of analysts.
 
Widely Available

 
 By contrast, the cable industry already has a high-capacity network available to nearly as many homes as the phone network is. (About 64 percent of the nation's households subscribe to cable television, but the actual cables "pass" 96 percent of households -- nearly as many as have a telephone.)
Moreover, this cable network totals only a million miles, and only 15 percent of the cable system -- the long-haul part between neighborhoods and between towns -- might need to be replaced with high-capacity fiber optic lines. The cost: $26 billion, according to cable industry estimates.
Why so little rewiring? Because unlike copper phone lines, most of the television cable already has adequate carrying capacity and would not need to be replaced. The coaxial cables serving most homes have 250,000 times the information capacity of copper telephone lines. Faced with only a fraction of the rewiring costs of the phone companies, cable operators like Comcast would have the edge in pricing services cheaply. With that advantage, cable operators might offer wireless service cheaply.
Using radio transmitters inside a house or office building, where cellular calls are difficult to make today, and transmitters outside buildings attached to the telephone poles that hold up cable lines, they might be able to provide seamless service between the living room, the backyard, the street and the office. Comcast and others have experimental P.C.S. licenses from Federal regulators to test the idea.
 
'Why Reinvent the Wheel?'

 
 "The cable industry can take advantage in both the wired and wireless worlds of the billions of dollars already invested," said the younger Mr. Roberts, Comcast's president. "Why reinvent the wheel?"
The cost advantage that cable companies may have in building the information superhighway is getting increasing attention from analysts. Indeed, some view U S West's agreement in May to invest $2.5 billion in a Time Warner venture as a tacit admission of the argument for cable.
By agreeing to develop Time Warner's advanced technology for consumer video services, U S West, a phone company, was conceding that it was more economical to revamp cable television than the phone system, these analysts say.
But others contend that the cable industry does not have the borrowing capacity to finance its goals, which they concede are technically feasible. Still others simply think the industry argument is wrong.
"Coaxial cable is a 30- or 40-year-old technology and has a high mean time between failure; in other words, it breaks down a lot," said Kenneth G. McGee, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. "And who knows how to lay down fiber optic cable better than the phone companies?"
 
Possible Alliances

 
 But in Comcast's view, telephone comanies need not necessarily be its antagonists. Comcast has been talking with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and, separately, with A.T.& T.'s long-distance rival MCI about forming a venture in multimedia, the hazily defined convergence of telephones, computers and television into applications like video-conferencing.
Comcast has nothing to announce about its talks with the two companies, Mr. Roberts said in an interview, but he added that a link with a long-distance carrier could benefit all parties.
One problem with A.T.& T.'s new videophone system, for example, is that even though it costs $2,000 for a pair of phones, its quality leaves something to be desired: the picture is blurry and one-third slower than regular television because the signals must be squeezed through low-capacity telephone lines. The cable television network, by contrast, would have no problem carrying a television-quality video phone call.
"Would people pay 25 cents a minute to, once in a while, have a video-conference call with a friend in another city?" Mr. Roberts asked. "The picture would be full motion and absolutely as good as a regular TV set because it is a regular set. I think people would pay for that."
Comcast has a good track record lately in guessing what people will pay for. Analysts expect the company to exceed $1.3 billion in revenue this year, up from the $900 million of last year. Cash flow, the crucial indicator of health for cable companies, is expected to rise nearly 60 percent, to $625 million from the level a year earlier. (Much like other highly indebted cable companies, Comcast has been reporting losses since 1987.)
 
Entry to Mobile Radio

 
 Comcast has a large stake in Nextel, formerly Fleet Call, a specialized
mobile-radio company that later this year will provide cellular-like competition to cellular carriers in some major cities. In many ways, Nextel is a rehearsal for P.C.S. Using new wireless phones from Motorola, Nextel can offer static-free digital service that also provides a paging service that delivers short text messages.
In Britain, where regulation is less strict than in the United States, Comcast offers both cable television and phone service to consumers. Comcast is learning valuable marketing lessons for the day it can do the same in the United States.
And back home, Comcast has large investments in Teleport Communications Group, which provides an alternate local phone service to that of the Baby Bells, catering mainly to business customers. The other investors are also cable companies like Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver.
"Long term, the cable companies want to look like the phone companies with ubiquitous coverage," the younger Mr. Roberts said. "We've wired up nearly all the homes, but not the businesses. So that's why we're investing in Teleport."

Chrysler Has a Small Car for the Young Market

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Zippy, inexpensive, environmentally friendly -- oh, and "huggable."
Such are the qualities, according to the Chrysler Corporation, of the Neon, a bubble-shaped, bug-eyed car it introduced today that will test two propositions: that a small car can make money and that Americans in the 20-something age group can be persuaded to buy a car built by the Big Three. 
 Chrysler has researched those youthful consumers, whom the Big Three fear they have lost -- as they did the baby boomers before them -- to the Japanese auto makers.
 
The 'Stereotyped' Generation
 "This generation is often stereotyped as the grunge-dressed teen-agers wearing hightops and ball caps, often backwards," said E. Thomas Pappert, Chrysler's vice president for sales. In fact, he said, the group, which he puts at ages 24-30, is diverse and accounts for about half the two- million-unit small-car market.
Hence the Neon, which will be available as a four-door in January and a two-door coupe next September. The photographs that accompanied Neon's early marketing blitz, a barometer of the forthcoming advertising campaign, display the car with young people who are being hip -- playing trumpets, scrawling graffiti, recycling.
"These are people who are faced with the knowledge that it's tough to achieve the same life style their parents did," said Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, answering questions by satellite from the annual auto show in Frankfurt. "They're not willing to sacrifice anything, however."
While the base price of the Neon has been rumored to be anywhere from $9,000 to $11,500, Mr. Lutz refused to put a price on the car, saying only that it would be competitive with other American subcompacts like the Ford Escort.
The car, he said, delivers many qualities of larger, more expensive vehicles. For example, Mr. Lutz said, the Neon has 98 percent of the interior room of the Ford Mondeo, a midsize car that Ford recently put on sale in Europe and will introduce in America next year.
The Neon comes with driver- and passenger-side air bags as standard equipment. Its fuel economy -- 28 miles a gallon for city driving and 37 on highways with manual transmission -- is lower than might be expected from a subcompact because Chrysler, trying to cozy up to 20-somethings who want something fun to drive, decided to equip the car with a relatively powerful 2.0-liter engine. The car accelerates from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than nine seconds.
Mr. Lutz said the car would be 85 to 95 percent recyclable.
 
A Washout for Detroit
 Generally, the Big Three have lost money on small cars. "The small car has been essentially a failure in the United States car market," said Arvid F. Jouppi, an auto analyst with Keane Securities. While Japanese auto makers were successful selling high-quality subcompacts here, small cars made by the Big Three have never been perceived to be of the same caliber, he said.
"It's going to be interesting to see if Chrysler can carry this one off," Mr. Jouppi added. "I think they will."
The low development costs for the Neon give it a head start on becoming profitable. Under Chrylser's new platform-team approach, the Neon was developed at the relatively small sum of $1.3 billion (compared with $6 billion for the Mondeo), and in a relatively brief period of 31 months.
While Mr. Lutz promised profits on the car, he was not extravagant in his predictions. "The car is designed to be a little better than break even," he said.
Mr. Lutz said Chrysler planned to sell the Neon worldwide. In America, the car will be carried by both Dodge and Plymouth dealers. Traditionally, auto makers market the same car, with different names and some modifications, through different dealers.
Chrysler has the capacity to build 375,000 of the cars this year, said Robert J. Eaton, the company's chairman and chief executive. Most of them will be built in Belvidere, Ill., but 75,000 four-door Neons will be built in a Chrylser plant in Toluca, Mexico.

Cadbury seeks a U.S. company, perhaps Dr Pepper or A & W.

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN recent years, Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. has often been rumored to be a takeover target. Now, the British soft drink and candy company has turned the tables.
Last month, it raised its stake in the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies of Dallas to 25.9 percent from 5.7 percent and said it would not rule out an eventual bid for the entire company. That prompted Dr Pepper to raise its anti-takeover defenses. 
 In the last week, speculation has mounted that Cadbury is also stalking another of the few remaining independent soft drink companies in the United States, A & W Brands.
Analysts said that over the long term, Cadbury could benefit considerably with either Dr Pepper or A & W. But they said that financing a deal for Dr Pepper -- which would likely cost a minimum of $1 billion for the shares that Cadbury does not already own -- would be a stretch for Cadbury, given its already burdensome debt load.
A & W would be more manageable, at a rumored price of around $300 million, but the implications to Cadbury's balance sheet of financing even that deal might give investors pause.
Cadbury's American depository receipts, which had hit a 52-week high of $30.375 on Aug. 19, closed yesterday at $28.375, down 25 cents in Nasdaq trading.
The speculation about a deal in the United States has to some extent overshadowed a general improvement in Cadbury's existing businesses, largely from increasing market share and lower costs in its British soft drink business. The company will report its earnings for the first six months of the year tomorrow, and analysts are expecting a sharp gain over the period a year earlier.
John Elston of James Capel & Company in London said he was looking for pretax earnings of 165 million, or about $247 million at current exchange rates, compared with 126 million a year earlier. The earnings are expected to include one-time gains of 11 million. "It's a pretty good performance across the group," Mr. Elston said.
Cadbury is the world's third-largest soft drink company after the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico. But its lags far behind its big rivals, and the only major market in which it is a dominant force is Britain, where its strength derives largely from its joint bottling venture with Coke.
In turning its attention to expansion in the United States, Cadbury, which currently holds 3.4 percent of the soft drink market in the United States, will not put fear in the hearts of Coke and Pepsi. But it is seeking increased clout by adding other established brands to its lineup, which includes Canada Dry, Schweppes, Sunkist and Crush.
Combining forces with Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, which has 10.6 percent of the market in the United States, or A & W, which has about 2 percent, would provide Cadbury with economies of scale and improved marketing and distribution opportunities, as well as a chance for greater profits in a market that accounts for a third of worldwide soft drink consumption.
Cadbury has not made any public comment about its rumored interest in A & W. Cadbury has said it has no immediate plans to make a bid for the rest of Dr Pepper, and has said that it would like to discuss with the Dallas company ways in which they could cooperate more closely. Dr Pepper already produces soft drink concentrates for the Cadbury brands in the United States and distributes some of them to restaurants.
Many analysts think Cadbury would be content to turn over its brands in the United States to Dr Pepper in exchange for an increased stake in the company. But what deal gets done, and how fast, depends to a large extent on how Cadbury deals with Dr Pepper's management, which seems distinctly nervous about Cadbury's intentions.

2 Maiden Ladies and Their Century

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON

 BODY:

Having Our Say
The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years
By Sarah and A. Elizabeth Delany with Amy Hill Hearth
Illustrated. 210 pages. Kodansha. $20.
Sometimes they sound like the oldest living Confederate widows, and sometimes they sound like turn-of-the-century Negro blue bloods. They refer to the Civil War as "the Surrender" and those we would call bigots they call "those rebby boys." They are not "old maids," they are "maiden ladies," and at 103 and 101, they avoid all hospitals. "One time, some doctor asked Sadie to do a senility test. Of course, she passed. A year later, he asked her to do it again, and she said, 'Don't waste your time, doctor.' And she answered all the questions from the year before, before he could ask them. And then she said to me, 'Come on, Bess, let's get on out of here.' " 
 They are Sarah and Annie Elizabeth Delany, and their lives hold a century of social, sexual and racial codes, enforced, broken and revised. They were taught to participate in history, not just witness it, and they have had the wit to shape their histories with style. If one likes to trace American literature through the voices of American citizens, one might place the shrewdly decorous Sadie in a Charles Chesnutt story, while Bessie, with her feisty pronouncements and slangy asides, belongs in a Mark Twain monologue. And no, I am not saying that their memoirs, deftly arranged in alternating chapters by the journalist Amy Hill Hearth, are literature; I am saying that they are literature's living kin.
Anyway, the Delanys are quite involved with their own kin and their own achievements. Every group has its cherished list of firsts: the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, the first Greek Presidential nominee, the first woman to graduate from medical school, the first open homosexual to win public office. The Delanys' father was America's first Negro Episcopal bishop. Bessie was one of the first female Negro dentists in New York, and Sadie was the first Negro to teach home economics (she calls it domestic science) in a white New York City high school. Firsts are a strange business. They advertise their importance -- the breaking down of a barrier -- even as they expose their absurdity: why should an honorable achievement be deemed unattainable or exceptional?
You have probably noticed that I do not call the Delanys blacks or African-Americans. That's because, as Bessie makes clear, she and her sister each prefer to be called "a colored woman or a Negro woman." They belong to a generation that used "black" literally and often dismissively; they also belong to a generation that considered it a proud, even daring gesture to call themselves Americans with no descriptive attached. Since I respect them, I will follow their lead. It would be rude not to, and besides, history and identity are too complicated to be summed up by any one term. Why not use them all, according to one's need and world view?
The Delanys' father, Henry, was a 9-year-old house slave in Georgia when Emancipation came. In a war-torn state short on food or supplies, where many former slaves "wandered about the country like shell-shocked soldiers," his family was lucky: "They could read and write, and they hadn't been abused, and their family was still together." Their mother's ancestry takes the sisters into the murky terrain of miscegenation. Among their great-grandparents were a Virginia slave and his white mistress, who took up with him when her husband went off to the War of 1812. Their maternal grandparents were a free black woman and a white farmer and dentist whom the law forbade to marry, but whom affection and, yes, respect kept together. The authors grew up in North Carolina on the campus of St. Augustine's, an Episcopal college for Negroes where their parents worked.
They moved to New York City in 1916 and became cosmopolites. "In North Carolina, there were white people, Negroes, and Indians," Sadie recalls. "In New York, there were Irish people, German people, Jewish people, Italian people, and so on." They became charter members of the Harlem Renaissance, too, mingling with artists, journalists, lawyers, socialites and intellectuals. Sadie became a world traveler, and Bessie became a veteran of picket lines and boycotts for civil rights.
They make each memory vivid and particular. To girls of 5 and 7, the coming of Jim Crow laws meant being told, "Sorry, I can't serve you," in the drugstore where they had always bought limeade, a store owned by a future mayor of Raleigh, N.C., who had "a colored family on the side." "His colored daughter was a friend of ours," the authors say. "She used to go over to the drugstore and he was real nice to her." By and large, they got the lives they wanted. "Fortunately," notes Sadie, "our earliest experiences with whites predated Jim Crow." When Jim Crow began to block the view, she would play the muddled minstrel-show Negro or the empty-headed, fair-skinned belle. When directed to the back of a shoe store, she cooed, "'Back where?" until the owner sighed, "Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany," and she did. Bessie, moodier and angrier, would talk and fight back in public (she once barely avoided being lynched), then "weep and weep and weep" in private.
They observed their parents' Olympian injunctions. (Father Delany to Sadie: "You are college material. You owe it to your nation, your race, and yourself to go. And if you don't, then shame on you!" Mother Delany on her daughters' achievements: "It's no more than they should have done." And they managed -- no small thing when your heart and soul are pledged to a family, a race and a nation -- to cultivate private, eccentric selves: the stuff that makes you a personality, not just a worthy symbol.
Sadie observes that as she grew old she began growing bold. Bess shakes her fist at bigotry: "all those rebby boys -- they have turned to dust". And that done, she thumbs her nose at propriety. Her sister may be a Christian woman, "but I'm afraid I am a naughty little darkey!" Bessie says. "Ha ha! I know it's not fashionable to use some of the words from my heyday, but that's who I am! And who is going to stop me? Nobody, that's who!" Who would want to, once the oldest living Negro maiden authors choose to tell all?

HEADLINE: Suburban Renewal

BYLINE: By David Rusk; David Rusk, the former Mayor of Albuquerque, N.M., is author of "Cities Without Suburbs."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
State legislators and voters are starting to grapple with the results of four decades of misguided policies that have favored suburban development over inner cities, fragmenting urban areas by race and class. Several communities are trying innovative styles of government to bridge the economic gap between cities and suburbs and address their shared problems. These efforts are long overdue.
For example, last November in Oregon, Portland-area voters approved a home-rule charter to give new powers to the region's "metro" government, a sort of umbrella governing body. The metro government's priority, the new charter states, will be less to provide regional services than to manage the region's growth, which has been exploding. Goals include an affordable housing plan, in which each of the 24 cities and towns in the three-county jurisdiction must accept a proportionate share of low- and moderate-income housing. 
 Some 170 miles north, Seattle-area voters also endorsed a new regional strategy, giving the county enhanced control over growth. Strengthened by its new mandate, the King County Council stunned real estate developers by rejecting a new town -- 4,500 homes some 20 miles from Seattle -- to preserve surrounding forests. The council's action also strengthens the plan of Mayor Norman Rice to rebuild Seattle's declining neighborhoods, since it will keep demand for housing within the city higher.
In Minnesota, legislators representing inner-city constituents in Minneapolis-St. Paul forged a coalition this spring with lawmakers from older, blue-collar suburbs to pass the "Metropolitan Stabilization Act." Among the key provisions were low-income housing quotas for wealthy suburbs and tax changes to discourage converting farmland to subdivisions. Although Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed most of the package, a jointly appointed Advisory Council on Metropolitan Governance is now hammering out a compromise plan, and the prospects for success look good.
The Northeast is facing up to these issues as well. Parents in Hartford are suing the State of Connecticut; they assert that because the public schools depend heavily on local property taxes, the economic gap between Hartford and its suburbs is so great that inner-city children are denied their state-guaranteed right to a decent education.
To address this problem, Gov. Lowell Weicker has recommended reorganizing the state's 169 independent school districts into six regional systems, equalizing school spending and spreading low-income students more evenly throughout the schools. Now the Legislature has begun a planning process to encourage cooperation between urban and suburban school districts to improve their racial balance.
This summer Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia appointed a Commission on the Revitalization of Virginia's Urban Areas. The commission is studying compelling evidence that every major Virginia city has been hurt economically by a state law passed in 1979 forbidding annexation of surrounding suburbs. Without the ability to annex surrounding growth areas, most cities have lost population and jobs.
The best barometer to a city's social and economic health is whether it has been able to annex substantial new territory. Since World War II, urban population growth in the United States has occurred through low-density, sprawling suburban development. Successful cities were "elastic": they expanded their boundaries, capturing new development, holding on to middle-class families and maintaining a broad tax base.
Less fortunate were cities that were trapped within existing limits by bad laws or hostile neighboring communities. As middle-class families have left, these "inelastic" cities have become poorhouses for their suburbs. They are squeezed between rising social needs of poor residents and declining tax bases. Such cities are programmed to fail.
Forty major cities -- including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore and Cleveland -- were virtually frozen within their 1950 city limits. All have lost population, an average of 26 percent. Proportionally, these cities have four to five times as many poor residents as suburban communities have, and urban incomes average 71 percent of those in the suburbs. Many of these cities' budgets stand on the brink of collapse.
At the other extreme, two dozen cities expanded their limits fivefold or more. These include Austin, Charlotte and Oklahoma City and consolidated governments like Jacksonville-Duval County, Nashville-Davidson County and Indianapolis-Marion County.
This group more than tripled their populations. They have only about 20 percent more poor residents than their suburbs, rather than the four or five times for the inelastic cities. The average incomes for city residents are even slightly higher than those who live in surrounding suburbs. And the credit rating for the elastic city governments is on average two grades higher than that of cities unable to expand.
It is too late for most inelastic cities to resume annexation, and successful city-county consolidation is by no means easy: it requires both uncommon civic leadership and a farsighted electorate. That is what makes the regional initiatives in Portland, Seattle and Minneapolis-St. Paul so significant. These communities are beginning to recognize that suburbs should share responsibility for inner city social and economic problems; a dying city holds back the whole region.
This summer Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros told a delegation of mayors that there would be no major new Federal aid forthcoming. Instead, he is focusing on ending HUD practices that have made Federal public housing a primary factor in segregating poor blacks and Hispanics in inner-city ghettos. Inner-city problems, he argues, can be solved only by joint efforts between cities and suburbs.
As President Clinton embarks on an ambitious legislative program this fall, his Administration's wisest policy for America's ailing cities might be simply to adopt the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm. Salvation for America's cities is to be found not in Washington but in the cities' own suburbs. Governors and legislators must be the marriage brokers -- shotgun or otherwise.
