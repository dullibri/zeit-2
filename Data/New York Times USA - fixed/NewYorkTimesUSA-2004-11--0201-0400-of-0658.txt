HEADLINE: New Study Puts Sept. 11 Payout At $38 Billion

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The families or loved ones of civilians killed on Sept. 11 received, on average, $3.1 million in government and charitable awards. The families of those who died in uniform that day -- including police officers and firefighters -- received more, their average compensation exceeding $4.2 million. Insurance payments to businesses victimized by the terror attacks, for property damage alone, totaled $7.5 billion. 
 These figures, some exceeding earlier estimates, others never before captured, emerged yesterday from a formal study that was two years in the making. It aimed to be the most comprehensive accounting of how much victims and businesses affected by the Sept. 11 attacks have been compensated by private and public means -- an effort by charities and government agencies unmatched in the country's history. 
 In all, the study, done by the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research organization based in Santa Monica, Calif., found that victims and businesses have so far received $38.1 billion. 
 Insurance companies accounted for the single greatest share of payments, about $19.6 billion. Government entities, including payments to individual families as well as loans to small businesses near ground zero, gave out nearly $16 billion.
 On page after page, the study gives more weight to the sense that the economic response to Sept. 11 has played out in ways both remarkable and uneven -- ''of a scope and scale never before seen,'' it says.
 And it does not mince words: For one thing, it noted that the government was, at times, ill-equipped to handle the crisis, citing in particular the often criticized performance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
 The study also questioned whether the payouts were fair to all victims, and it asked who should foot the bill in future terror attacks, especially given the fact that terrorism insurance for businesses is now harder to obtain than it was before Sept. 11.
 ''The system has raised many questions about equity and fairness that have no obvious answers,'' said Lloyd Dixon, a senior economist with the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, who conducted the study, along with Rachel Kaganoff Stern, an associate political scientist.
 Mr. Dixon added, ''Addressing these issues now will help the nation be better prepared for future terrorist attacks.''
 Called ''Compensation for Losses from the 9/11 Attacks,'' the 173-page study is different from earlier efforts in that it looked at the financial aftermath of Sept. 11 from the perspective of the recipients, and not the agency or body handing out the money. The study stated, as part of its tabulations, that $210 million in government and private money was spent to help people who were traumatized.
 The study included some of the $20 billion pledge that President Bush made shortly after Sept. 11 to help rebuild New York. And it also took into account the federal Victim Compensation Fund, which paid out $7 billion in awards to families as part of an effort to limit lawsuits against the airlines and other parties.
 But the study did not include about $11 billion in federal assistance to New York for cleanup, overtime costs and transportation repairs, Mr. Dixon said. Nor did it include payments yet to come, chiefly from pending court cases and litigation costs, as well as continuing insurance disputes.
 Still, elected officials and analysts who have reviewed the report said they were generally impressed with its ambitions and execution.
 ''It is a significant contribution to our understanding of the scope and complexities of victim compensation programs,'' said Tom Seessel, a social policy consultant in Hopewell, N.J., who has conducted three studies on Sept. 11 relief, financed by the Ford Foundation. Mr. Seessel, though, did say he thought the study could have done a better job in calculating compensation to some businesses and workers.
 Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who has been aggressive in tracking the response in Congress to Sept. 11, applauded the report, and claimed it had done what the government itself had failed to do -- provide a thorough accounting of the economic costs of Sept. 11.
 The likelihood that the families of uniformed personnel who were killed on Sept. 11 would receive greater payouts has been assumed for some time. But the Rand study demonstrates just how great the disparity has been -- a difference determined chiefly by the array of charities set up for police officers and firefighters in the aftermath of the attacks.
 The Rand study determined that the families of the more than 400 uniformed men and women who died, out of a total of 2,976 victims, received a total of $1.9 billion. On average, the families received, in addition to a $250,000 death award for public safety officers, an average of $880,000 more in charitable awards than civilians with similar economic losses. 
 The total amount of money paid out to the civilian dead from Sept. 11, the people on the airliners and in the offices in Manhattan and the Pentagon, wound up at $8.7 billion, with the greatest part of the compensation coming from the federal fund that calculated lost income.
 The study also found that about $660 million was distributed to people who sought help because of exposure to dust and other potential health hazards near ground zero. Again, the federal fund, known as the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, provided the bulk of the compensation -- roughly $380 million tax-free. But as a caveat, the study warned that ''a major unknown is whether resources will be available to pay for health care for respiratory injuries that might appear in the future.''
 The study also sought, in certain instances, to break down compensation by geography. For instance, it determined that residents of Lower Manhattan received about $920 million -- more than half of it from property insurance. Almost 10 percent of that figure came from private charitable donations.
 The researchers also sought to document how much money was paid to people who worked in New York City and filed claims that they had lost jobs or income as a result of the attacks. It found that those workers received a total of $1.7 billion, with money coming from government grants, unemployment insurance -- $600 million -- and charity, which accounted for $540 million.
 But by far the biggest recipients of assistance were businesses -- $23.3 billion, to be exact. Of that amount, $7.5 billion came from insurance for property damage, and $9.5 billion for insurance for business interruption. An additional $4.9 billion came from government incentives, such as tax breaks and programs to attract small and large companies.
 And yet, should there be a future attack, the study concluded, the circumstances could no doubt be different. Congress may decide not to establish a victims' fund. And despite passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in 2002, which would require the federal government to pay for most of the insurance losses in a catastrophic attack, ''purchase of terrorism insurance after 9/11 has been spotty,'' the study said.
 All the more reason, Mr. Dixon said, to plan ahead, because ''the more we work this issue, the more we realize that compensation is an important part of the strategy to combat terrorism.''

HEADLINE: China's Informal Lenders Pose Risks to Its Banks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WENZHOU, China, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The Wenzhou ''stir-fry'' is not a dish you eat. But it is giving indigestion to Chinese regulators and could prove troublesome to many investors worldwide -- from New York money managers, Pennsylvania steel workers and Midwestern farmers to miners in Australia. 
 Here in this freewheeling city at the forefront of capitalism in China, the dish is prepared when a group of wealthy friends pool millions of dollars worth of Chinese yuan and put it into a hot investment like Shanghai real estate, where it is stirred and flipped for a hefty profit. 
 The friends often lend each other large amounts on the strength of a handshake and a handwritten i.o.u. Both sides then go to an automated teller machine or bank branch to transfer the money, which is then withdrawn from the bank. Or sometimes they do it the old-fashioned way: exchanging burlap sacks stuffed with cash. 
 The worry for Chinese regulators is that everyone in China will start cooking the Wenzhou stir-fry and do it outside the banking system. In the last few months, borrowing and lending across the rest of China is looking more and more like Wenzhou's. The growth of this shadow banking system poses a stiff challenge to China's state-owned banks, already burdened with bad debt, and makes it harder for the nation's leaders to steer a fast-growing economy. 
 The problem starts with China's low interest rates. More and more families with savings have been snubbing 2 percent interest on bank deposits for the double-digit returns from lending large amounts on their own. They lend to real estate speculators or to small businesses without the political connections to obtain loans from the banks. Not only is the informal lending rate higher, but the income from that lending, because it is semilegal at best, is not taxed. For fear of shame, ostracism and the occasional threat from thugs, borrowers are more likely to pay back these loans than those from the big banks. 
 Tao Dong, chief China economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, calculates that Chinese citizens withdrew $12 billion to $17 billion from their bank deposits in August and September. The outflow turned into a flood last month, reaching an estimated $120 billion, or more than 3 percent of all deposits at the country's financial institutions. 
 If the bank withdrawals are not stemmed in the months ahead, Mr. Tao warned, ''this potentially could be a huge risk for financial stability and even social stability.'' 
 With China now accounting for more than a quarter of the world's steel production and nearly a fifth of soybean production, as well as some of the largest initial public offerings of stock, any shaking of financial confidence here could ripple quickly through markets in the United States and elsewhere. For instance, if the steel girders now being lifted into place by hundreds of tall cranes in big cities across China are no longer needed, that would produce a worldwide glut of steel and push down prices.
 On Oct. 28, when China's central bank raised interest rates for one-year loans and deposits by a little more than a quarter of a percentage point, it cited a need to keep money in the banking system. Higher official rates should ''reduce external cycling of credit funds,'' the bank said in a statement. 
 The main Chinese banks have fairly substantial reserves, but they need those reserves to cover huge write-offs of bad debts someday. The International Monetary Fund's China division chief, Eswar Prasad, expressed concern about bank withdrawals in a speech in Hong Kong three days before the central bank acted. 
 The hub of informal lending in China is here in Wenzhou, 230 miles south of Shanghai. Some of China's first experiments with the free market began here in the late 1970's, and a result has been a flourishing economy together with sometimes questionable business dealings.
 Depending on how raw they like their capitalism, people elsewhere in China describe Wenzhou as either a center of financial innovation or a den of loan sharks. But increasingly, Wenzhou is also a microcosm of the kind of large-scale yet informal financial dealings now going on across the country. 
 The withdrawals by depositors and the informal money lending have spread so swiftly here that it is only in Wenzhou that the Chinese central bank releases monthly statistics on average rates for direct loans between individuals or companies. The rate hovered at 1 percent a month for years until April, when the authorities began limiting the volume of bank loans. 
 Borrowers default on nearly half the loans issued by the state-owned banks, but seldom do so here on money that is usually borrowed from relatives, neighbors or people in the same industry. Residents insist that the risk of ostracism for failing to repay a loan is penalty enough to ensure repayment of most loans. 
 Although judges have ruled that handwritten i.o.u.'s are legally binding, creditors seldom go to court to collect. ''If it is a really good friend, I would lose face if I sued them in court,'' said Tu Shangyun, the owner of a local copper smelter and part-time ''silver bearer'' -- a broker who puts lenders and borrowers in touch with each other, ''and if it weren't a good friend, I wouldn't lend the money in the first place.''
 Violence is extremely rare, but the threat of it does exist as the ultimate guarantor that people make every effort to repay debts. ''Someone can hire a killer who will chase you down, beat you up and maybe even kill you,'' said Ma Jinlong, who oversaw market-driven financial changes in the 1990's in Wenzhou as director of the municipal economic reform committee and is now an economics professor at Wenzhou University. 
 An austerity policy was invoked, its goal to slow rapid economic growth in the hope of stopping an upward spiral in the inflation rate. With consumer prices rising at 5.2 percent a year despite price controls on many goods and services, and with less-regulated prices for goods traded between companies climbing nearly twice as fast, people lose buying power while their money is on deposit at a bank. 
 The interest rate for informal loans jumped last spring to 1.2 percent a month, or 15.4 percent compounded over a year, and has stayed there since. According to the nation's central bank, total bank deposits in Wenzhou have been dropping by $250 million a month since April as companies and individuals withdraw money either because they can no longer obtain bank loans for their investments or because they want to lend the money at higher rates to each other. 
 For lenders, these interest rates are much more attractive than earning a meager 2.25 percent a year, even after the recent rate increase, on a deposit at a government-owned bank. And while Beijing assesses a 20 percent tax on all interest from bank deposits, nobody pays tax on the income they receive from lending money on their own, Mr. Ma said. 
 Most informal loans have traditionally gone to relatives or neighbors to finance the starting of small local businesses. Wenzhou is now one of the world's largest producers of nonbrand sunglasses; Dong Ganming, the owner of a 350-employee sunglass factory here, said that his plant was just one of almost 1,000 here involved in making glasses. 
 Fierce competition has prompted local residents to borrow money to exploit every possible niche in the industry, with some factories making nothing but bridges for sunglasses so that they will not slide down customers' noses, other factories making only the lenses and so forth. Any government crackdown on informal loans would carry the risk of stifling highly efficient small and medium-size businesses that have little hope of obtaining loans from the state-owned banks, which still allocate credit based partly on political connections.
 Mr. Dong said that loans from friends and family allowed him to start his sunglass company with 10 employees a decade ago; he quickly paid off the loans and has been reinvesting most of the profit ever since, putting very little into bank deposits. ''The interest in the bank is very low,'' he said. ''If you invest the money, you can get much more money.'' 
 But more recently, local residents say, a lot of money has been flowing into real estate here and in other big cities, especially Shanghai, helping to fuel double-digit increases in interest rates. Deals increasingly involve people who have no family or neighborhood connection, raising the risk of disputes. 
 Kellee Tsai, a specialist in Chinese informal banking at Johns Hopkins University, said that many overseas emigrants from Wenzhou had also been sending their savings back to be lent at much higher rates here than are available in the countries they have moved to. 
 Some local investors have been able to pay for their investments with profits from businesses here, like Chen Shen, the owner of four shops that sell shoe-manufacturing equipment to the hundreds of shoe factories that have popped up in this area. She said she paid cash for an apartment near Shanghai's Bund, its riverfront district, that had appreciated as much as 60 percent in less than two years. 
 Still, Chinese regulators do not like the practice, and officials have been trying to stamp out such operations with limited success. They have outlawed the practice of pooling savings into various kinds of informal banks that make loans for real estate and other investments: organizers are subject to the death penalty but are rarely caught unless the informal banks collapse. 
 Oriental Outlook, a Chinese current affairs magazine, reported late last month on the trial of a man accused of operating an illegal bank northeast of here that collapsed a year ago, leading to the filing of more than 200 civil suits. Another man who lost money in the scheme, and went bankrupt as a result, assaulted the defendant outside the courtroom, the magazine said. 
 The extent of such pooling is unclear. But it poses the greatest risks of damage to financial confidence if bank runs occur at these informal institutions, economists agree. Bank runs, with depositors lined up clamoring for their money back, have been an occasional problem around China for years, but always quickly contained as the authorities rushed to distribute as much cash as necessary. 
 ''The policy with bank runs, even with illegal banks in some cases, has been to flood the bank with liquidity and pay everyone off,'' said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Beijing University, who criticized as ill advised the Chinese policy of bailing out even illegal banks. ''One of the most salutary ways to let people know not to put money in these is to let two or three go bankrupt.''


CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 9 about blackmarket lending in China included erroneous figures supplied by an economist for the outflow of deposits from Chinese banks in October. The economist, Tao Dong of Credit Suisse First Boston, later corrected his estimate to say that $9.7 billion, or more than three-tenths of 1 percent of all deposits at Chinese financial institutions, went into informal lending and other activities -- not $120 billion, or more than 3 percent.

 Re ''Textile Quotas to End Soon, Punishing Carolina Mill Towns'' (''Made Elsewhere'' series, Business Day, Nov. 2):
 Your look at the end of textile quotas and the effect it will have on global trade was interesting. I am dismayed, however, at your characterization of Kannapolis, N.C., and the areas along the I-85 corridor north of Charlotte as looking at 2005 as a ''death sentence.'' Kannapolis, with 39,000 citizens, is moving forward with new industries and new opportunities, and we are far from the ''economic ghost town'' you described. 
 In the last year, the city added 1,030 new jobs in several sectors. In the last month, several companies have expanded their facilities -- one plans to add 60 jobs. We're experiencing residential growth, with individual home values of more than $3 million. Our expanding neighbor Charlotte, 30 minutes to the south, is helping to drive this growth.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 David Brooks (''The Values-Vote Myth,'' column, Nov. 6) and Gary Langer (''A Question of Values,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 6) can talk all they want about the significance of vote percentages and the wording of exit poll questions. A clearer impression, however, comes from the statements of voters themselves, who told your reporters that they were concerned about the Bush administration's ever-shifting motives for waging war in Iraq, the enormous budget deficit, persistent unemployment, the environment and the appointment of extreme right-wing justices to the Supreme Court, yet they still voted for the president merely because of his moral posturing.
 It is that sort of logic that really scares the other 48 percent of us.

HEADLINE: As the Battle for Falluja Begins

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As Gen. William Westmoreland did during the Vietnam War, ''More Troops For Iraq'' (editorial, Nov. 8) argues that 40,000 more American troops can give President Bush's policies in Iraq some chance of success. The opposite is true.
 The more troops, the more the Americans will be seen as what they are: occupiers. The United States will fail as long at it continues to impose its agenda and goals on Iraq, which include permanent military bases, control over oil and privatization of the economy. 
 The United States must get out of Iraq. It can do so by giving up its agenda and by having neutral countries and parties try to work with Iraqis to stabilize the country. Unfortunately, this administration, like those involved in Vietnam, wrongly believes there is light at the end of the tunnel. Sadly for Americans and Iraqis, there will be death and destruction for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Americas: Cuba: The Buck Stops

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Cuba ended circulation of the American dollar to reduce its vulnerability to United States sanctions, and shops, restaurants, hotels and other businesses began accepting only Cuban convertible pesos. Cubans still have another six days to swap their dollars for the locally printed currency -- pegged at par to the dollar but worthless outside Cuba -- before facing a 10 percent exchange fee. The government, which legalized the dollar in 1993 during a post-Soviet economic meltdown, said the conversion was prompted by Bush administration steps to squeeze Cuba financially. Experts said it increased Cuba's control over money supply and gave depleted dollar reserves a boost, providing badly needed liquidity to import food and oil. Economists estimate that the Central Bank has taken in about $500 million over two weeks as Cubans rushed to exchange their dollars to avoid the fee. At the Hotel Nacional in Havana, tourists unable to buy even a rum cocktail lined up to change their dollars.

The city has reached an agreement to develop an automobile distribution center at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park, the Economic Development Corporation said yesterday. The $40 million project, to be developed by the Axis Group, part of Allied Holdings, a large transporter of new vehicles in the United States, is expected to create 600 jobs. Axis plans to use ships and rail barges to move vehicles to and from the site. Andrew M. Alper, president of the development agency, said the agreement ''will help revitalize the Brooklyn waterfront by creating jobs, attracting new industries and increasing waterborne transport to relieve truck traffic.''

HEADLINE: Seeking an Enron Trial Far From Houston

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
It is no secret that the fortunes of Houston were long married to the success of Enron, the once highflying energy company that was the city's premier corporate citizen. But now, amid the wreckage of Enron's high-profile collapse, has Houston been transformed into the role of bitter ex-spouse, eager to exact revenge?
 The answer, at least according to lawyers for three of Enron's most senior former managers, is yes. 
 In briefs filed in Federal District Court in Houston yesterday, defense lawyers argue that the scar dug into the city by the Enron debacle is so deep that none of the former executives can receive a fair trial there. Instead, they ask for the criminal trial to be moved to a similar city, like Atlanta, Denver or Phoenix. 
 Such motions for a change of venue are hardly unique. In fact, it would have been astonishing if one had not been brought in this case. But the scope and detail of the documents filed yesterday -- amounting to part sociological analysis, part economic investigation and part media critique -- were highly unusual, involving an array of experts hired by the defendants to prove that Houston residents, well, hate them deeply.
 ''You can't understand the feelings of betrayal and desire for retribution in Houston until you see the enormous dependency that existed between the community and the company,'' said Daniel Petrocelli, who represents Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive. ''As much as he would have preferred a trial in Houston, the sad reality is that Jeff Skilling cannot get a fair trial there. The Houston community has a vested interest in the outcome of the case.''
 Mr. Petrocelli wrote the main motion that was filed yesterday. He was joined in his effort with supporting motions by lawyers representing Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman, and Richard L. Causey, its former chief accounting officer.
 Andrew Weissmann, who leads the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, declined to comment. The prosecution team will have to respond in writing to Mr. Petrocelli's motion. 
 Enron collapsed in 2001 amid an accounting scandal. Since then, a number of executives have pleaded guilty to engaging in schemes to help the company report nonexistent earnings and hide debt. The case against Mr. Skilling, Mr. Lay and Mr. Causey -- who will be tried together -- involves the highest-ranking former officers, who are charged with participating in a variety of accounting frauds and deceptions. 
 Much of the filing focuses on the usual paths taken by lawyers trying to change the venue for a trial. The papers discuss the local news coverage and cite statements -- either written or broadcast -- that seem to suggest a predisposition toward the guilt of the defendants.
 But almost 30 pages into the motion, the argument heads in a new direction, laying out in vivid detail the history between Enron and Houston: their once-blossoming relationship, the bitterness as it fell apart, and the victims left behind. Much of the information comes from a group of experts hired by Mr. Skilling, including Stephen Klineberg, a Houston sociologist; Edward Bronson, a social scientist who analyzes jurors; Philip Anthony, a polling and jury research consultant; and Russell Scott Armstrong, an expert on media.
 ''When Enron's remarkable rise and fall is viewed in its social and historical context, one of the causes of the emotionally charged atmosphere in Houston becomes clear,'' the primary motion reads. ''People in Houston feel betrayed.''
 Throughout the 1990's, the document says, Enron epitomized the very best of Houston's self-image. It quotes a historian portraying Enron as the place where Houstonians ''placed our hopes for the future; where we wanted to work; where we wanted to invest; where we thought the Houston economy would go.''
 A result was that Mr. Skilling, Mr. Lay and others at Enron were celebrated as ruling members of Houston society. In the words of Dr. Klineberg, ''opposing Enron was a little like being against the city itself.''
 But the collapse turned that perception on its head, says the filing, which quotes Dr. Klineberg as arguing that supporting Enron or its executives is seen as being against Houston. The sparkling Enron office tower that loomed over downtown Houston became deserted, local charities ended up short some $10 million in pledged contributions, and the Houston Astros had to pay more than $2 million to repurchase the naming rights for their baseball stadium, then known as Enron Field.
 None of that includes the thousands of people who were dismissed from Enron, or the untold number of companies affected by the collapse, the filing says. ''The ripple effect extended throughout Houston, touching virtually every sector of the local economy,'' it says. ''The collective economic impact is deeper and deeply felt to this day.''
 Planned office buildings were canceled. Lunchtime sales at downtown restaurants fell. Even a local locksmith and vending machine operator experienced huge declines in their businesses. The filing cites a poll conducted by Mr. Skilling's expert saying that 32.9 percent of Houstonians personally know someone affected by the Enron collapse.
 While that number is huge compared with other cities, it also appears to point out one weakness in the economic impact argument: that 67.1 percent of the people in Houston do not personally know anyone affected by the collapse.
 The response to the collapse, the filing says, was an outpouring of support for the victims and a simultaneous vilification of the company's former senior executives. This, the papers argue, has led to conflicted incentives: the government repeatedly cites an Enron Victims Fund, where fines and settlements taken from companies and executives associated with it are collected. The result, the filing argues, is that Houston jurors could believe the money seized from convicted defendants would return to their own community.
 The emotions spurred by the collapse, the filing argues, have led to an immense contempt for the defendants. In interviews with Mr. Skilling's pollsters, Houstonians likened them to pigs, snakes, and terrorists, describing them as evil, lying and lecherous. They have been referred to as liars in local sports articles; a former Enron employee even released a rap album, featured in The Houston Chronicle, which advocated ''street justice'' for Mr. Skilling in a song complete with the sound of gunshots, according to the filing.
 All told, the filing says, 31.8 percent used negative comments to describe Mr. Skilling. Again, of course, this means that 68 percent did not.
 The defense lawyers argue, however, that the bias is so strong that there is no way for them to screen out jurors predisposed to believing in their clients' guilt. Some potential jurors, they argue, will lie about their biases so that they could be in a position to convict the defendants.
 ''In light of the deep, widespread feelings of betrayal, anger and victimization throughout Houston,'' the filing says, jurors ''will be under immense pressure from their peers and their community to convict.''

HEADLINE: Card Will Stay On as Chief of Staff

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Eric Lichtblau and Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The White House said Monday that President Bush had asked his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., to stay on in Mr. Bush's second term and that Mr. Card had said yes. It was the first major personnel decision made by the president since his re-election, and it suggested that Mr. Bush did not intend any major shakeup of his most senior White House aides.
 Mr. Bush dropped by the 7:30 a.m. senior staff meeting in the Roosevelt Room, across the hall from the Oval Office, to give the news to his top aides and to thank them for their hard work, said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman. 
 But the White House had nothing to say about how many cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials might be leaving, either voluntarily or not. Mr. Bush met with Mr. Card at Camp David over the weekend to begin considering the makeup of the second-term cabinet, and to secure Mr. Card's agreement to continue on in his job.
 One prominent Republican with ties to the White House said the administration had already put out feelers to people who might replace some of the current cabinet secretaries. But it is not clear how far into his decision-making process Mr. Bush is; Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference on Monday that he had yet to have a post-election discussion about his job with the president.
 Mr. Rumsfeld seemed to give a hint about his own desires, saying that he had made ''considerable progress'' toward his goal of modernizing the military, ''but there's much to be done.''
 ''He's thinking about his administration for the future,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said, referring to Mr. Bush. ''I've met with him two or three times on totally different subjects since the election, but that's not a subject that's come up.''
 Mr. Card is an embodiment of the stability and discretion of Mr. Bush's top aides. A former lobbyist for the automotive industry, he was named chief of staff during the transition four years ago and has survived the first term with relatively few bruises. He operates largely behind the scenes; his best-known public moment came when he walked into a Florida classroom more than three years ago and whispered in Mr. Bush's ear that the World Trade Center was under attack.
 Mr. Bush now seems certain to start his second term surrounded at the White House by many of the same aides who have been with him since he was governor of Texas, including Karl Rove, his senior adviser; Dan Bartlett, the communications director, and Mr. McClellan.
 Other long-time aides, like Margaret Spellings, the domestic policy adviser in the White House, who is often mentioned as a possible education secretary, could move to other top-level jobs within the administration. The fate of newer faces in the White House, like Stephen Friedman, the former Wall Street executive who has been director of the National Economic Council the last two years, is less clear to insiders but seems to hinge as much as anything on their own decisions about staying on.
 The biggest unanswered question regarding Mr. Bush's inner circle is whether Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser and one of the president's closest confidantes, will stay in her job, move to a cabinet post or leave the government. Neither she nor Mr. Bush has given any public hint of their intentions.
 There is already some turnover in sub-cabinet positions. On Monday, Brian C. Roseboro, deputy undersecretary of Treasury for finance, informed the White House that would be leaving in December. Mr. Roseboro has been in charge of the increasingly big job of refinancing the federal debt.
 ''Announcements will be made in due course when it comes to the cabinet,'' Mr. McClellan said. ''We continue to move forward on the process. He had discussions with his chief of staff over the weekend at Camp David.''
 Officials inside and out of the Justice Department say they remain doubtful that Attorney General John Ashcroft will return for a second term, although some still hold out that possibility.
 Republican officials cite both Mr. Ashcroft's health -- aides said a severe case of gallstone pancreatitis took a heavier toll on him than many people realized -- and his sometimes fractured relations with the White House as driving forces in the decision. 
 But other officials suggest that the strong election statement made by evangelical groups, who helped put Mr. Ashcroft at the Justice Department in 2000 after he lost his Senate seat, may have prompted him to rethink his departure. 
 ''Watching the resurgence of the Republican Party has helped him think this through,'' an adviser who is close to Mr. Ashcroft said Monday. ''But he fundamentally has not decided what his decision would be if the president asked him to continue to serve.''
 As far as the White House's thoughts on Mr. Ashcroft's future, the adviser said: ''no one really knows for sure.''
 Should Mr. Ashcroft leave the Justice Department, the most likely successors are thought to be Larry Thompson, who served as the deputy attorney general until last year and would be in line to become the first black attorney general in history, and Marc Racicot, who played a key role in Mr. Bush's victory as chairman of his re-election campaign and was considered for the attorney general's job in 2000. 
 Also mentioned as candidates are James B. Comey Jr., who succeeded Mr. Thompson as deputy attorney general; Frank Keating, the former Oklahoma governor who was also considered for the job in 2000; John Danforth, the former Missouri senator; Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and federal prosecutor; and Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel and longtime adviser to Mr. Bush. 
 Mr. Bush is expected to make changes to his economic team, though he may not act immediately. There are conflicting reports about Treasury Secretary John W. Snow. Several informal advisers to the administration said he might be asked to step aside in favor of someone with greater ability to sell Congress on an ambitious overhaul of the tax code. Other said he was seen as having worked hard to advance Mr. Bush's agenda, although he has generally kept a low public profile since succeeding Paul H. O'Neill nearly two years ago.

HEADLINE: CUNY Seeking To Raise $1.2 Billion

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The City University of New York is starting a $1.2 billion fund-raising campaign, reflecting both the new economics of public universities, which have faced shrinking public support, and the belief that CUNY has emerged from the troubled days in the late 1990's, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other critics charged that it was a third-rate university filled with students who could not read or write.
 ''We couldn't have done this campaign five or six or seven years ago,'' said Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor. ''People would have laughed at us.''
 The fund drive, which is to be completed over eight years, is CUNY's first universitywide campaign. The university has already accumulated $450 million in the ''quiet phase'' preceding the campaign announcement. 
 In an era in which top universities -- both public and private -- routinely raise hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions annually, CUNY's 20 campuses, which have more than 200,000 students, have been slow to seek donations. 
 The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that 22 public and private universities are engaged in campaigns seeking $1 billion or more. These include the University of Virginia, which plans to raise $3 billion by 2011; the University of Michigan, whose goal is $2.5 billion by 2008; and the University of California at Los Angeles, which had sought to raise $2.4 billion by 2005 but has already raised $2.6 billion.
 CUNY's individual colleges have more modest goals. City College and Baruch are both aiming for $150 million. Brooklyn College has a goal of $75 million. And the Graduate Center has a $28 million target. Other campuses are expected to announce specific targets in the coming months. Each college will decide how to use the money, but it is likely to be used for scholarships, research, recruiting faculty members and improving facilities.
 The State University of New York, which has 64 campuses and 400,000 students, has a $3 billion universitywide campaign, which began early this year and is scheduled to end in 2012. 
 When it comes to fund-raising, it helps to have wealthy graduates. Campuses like City College and Baruch have many, dating to the days when City College was the gold standard for public education, students were less prone to go away to college and many elite colleges limited their intake of Jewish students and minorities. 
 But it typically takes years -- if not decades -- to involve them in the life of the school to the point where they want to make contributions, and CUNY's schools have largely ignored their alumni until recently. 
 Also, many alumni were unhappy with the university for various reasons: the influx of poorly prepared students under open admissions; the anti-Semitic utterances of Leonard Jeffries, a City College professor; and the university's chaotic management in the late 1990's.
 Under Dr. Goldstein, the university has upgraded the standing of its more selective colleges by removing the weakest students and creating an honors college. It is building its full-time faculty and has imposed a proficiency test that all students must pass to graduate.
 But even in the dark days of the 1990's, Dr. Goldstein, as president of Baruch, showed that it was possible to conduct significant fund-raising at CUNY, bringing in more than $70 million in gifts. And many alumni he drew in have continued to give. This year, Baruch announced $54 million in gifts as a welcoming present for its new president, Kathleen M. Waldron.
 Gregory H. Williams, president of City College since 2001, has begun to do the same kind of alumni cultivation and has raised $84 million in three years.
 ''When I came, I talked to fund-raising consultants, and they said I'd be lucky to raise $25 million over five years because City College's reputation had been so damaged,'' he said. ''But last year alone, we raised $29 million. Folks have come back and resonated with the changes here in a way that is heartwarming. People who were reluctant to give are now stepping up.''
 Dr. Williams said the givers included Andrew S. Grove, the chairman and a co-founder of Intel; Jack Rudin, the New York real estate executive; and Joseph Flom, the New York lawyer. 
 But even the officials at some of CUNY's younger colleges with less wealthy alumni see potential. Jeremy Travis, the new president at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which was founded 40 years ago, said that while many of his alumni worked in police and fire departments, some have entered private industry and done well financially. The bigger challenge, he said, is to reach beyond the alumni and ''energize a larger community of people who have an interest in seeing John Jay succeed.'' 
 ''We shouldn't cede fund-raising opportunities to our colleagues in private education,'' Mr. Travis said. ''We have a competitive story to tell.''
 Dr. Goldstein said that it was imperative that CUNY raise private funds to supplement the public money it received.
 ''We have to generate revenues from private sources to move ourselves forward,'' he said. ''We can't rely only on the public fountain; that has been drying up for a while.'' 
 Although state financing is a bit higher than it was in the late 1990's, it has met a smaller and smaller share of CUNY's needs. Fifteen years ago, the state provided $746 million in operating money, which accounted for two-thirds of CUNY's budget; this year, the university expects to receive $790 million, or less than half of its operating budget. 
 In the same period, New York City aid has dropped from 13 percent of CUNY's budget to 10 percent, while tuition and fees have climbed from 20 percent of the budget to 44 percent.
 A campaign involving all CUNY's campuses, Dr. Goldstein said, would create a buzz -- and competition.
 Competitive juices are clearly beginning to flow. When Mr. Travis, John Jay's president, learned about Baruch's $54 million in gifts, he told the trustees of the John Jay Foundation that it was John Jay's turn. 
 ''The tempo has picked up,'' he told them. ''Let the race begin.''

The American offensive in Falluja will provide a crucial gauge of the Iraqi insurgency, testing the view that the resistance can be subdued in time for Iraqi elections in January. The operation will also be a key test of the Iraqi forces, since it is crucial that Falluja not be seen solely as an American operation. A11

The Persian Puzzle
The Conflict Between Iran and America
By Kenneth M. Pollack
539 pages. Random House. $26.95.
 Kenneth M. Pollack's last book, ''The Threatening Storm'' (2002), made the case for invading Iraq a lot more eloquently than the Bush administration ever did and helped persuade some moderates who might not otherwise have supported the war to get behind it. In that book, Mr. Pollack argued not only that the United States should depose Saddam Hussein but also that it should go to war ''the right way'' -- by dealing with Al Qaeda and the war on terrorism first, by restarting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and by building a large multinational coalition employing at least 250,000 troops. 
 In the wake of postwar revelations that Mr. Hussein did not possess stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and was not on the verge of acquiring nukes, Mr. Pollack has become an increasingly vociferous critic of the Bush administration's rush to war. He has accused the administration of distorting intelligence estimates and criticized its execution of the war and postwar reconstruction as ''reckless'' and ''often foolish.'' Now, in his latest book, ''The Persian Puzzle,'' Mr. Pollack addresses the United States' relationship with one of Iraq's more troubling neighbors: Iran, another part (along with North Korea) of the ''axis of evil'' invoked by President Bush in his 2002 State of the Union address -- a country that has supported terrorism, allegedly pursued nuclear weapons and tried to undermine regional stability and the Middle East peace process. 
 Mr. Pollack's recommendations for dealing with Iran turn out to be a lot less hawkish than the sort he proposed for Iraq in ''The Threatening Storm.'' In these pages, he argues against invading Iran (''unless Iran commits some truly egregious act of aggression against the United States on the order of a 9/11-type attack''), calls for a flexible approach that would take into account fluctuations in Iranian foreign policy (caused by internal tensions in the country between hard-liners and pragmatists) and discusses the uses of containment and carrot-and-stick incentives.
 The most noticeable omission in ''The Persian Puzzle'' has to do with Mr. Pollack's reluctance to analyze the consequences that the Iraq war has had on Iran and its regional ambitions -- even though he notes in passing that one of the chief reasons the first Bush administration did not push to depose Mr. Hussein in 1991 was its concern that such a move would leave ''a power vacuum in the region and no state to balance Iran.'' 
 The other high-profile omission in this volume concerns Mr. Pollack's failure to explain persuasively why he initially believed it was necessary to go to war against Iraq but feels containment can work with Iran (even when he writes that ''with the demise of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Iran,'' not Iraq, ''is probably the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism'').
 What ''The Persian Puzzle'' does most effectively is put America's relationship with Iran into historical perspective. Mr. Pollack, who has spent the last 16 years studying Iran (as a C.I.A. analyst, as director for gulf affairs at the National Security Council and in his current capacity as director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution), argues that ''understanding the history of U.S.-Iranian relations is absolutely essential to appreciate the nature of the problems we currently confront.'' This is not exactly a new notion; the scholar James A. Bill took on much the same subject in his 1988 book ''The Eagle and the Lion: The Tragedy of American-Iranian Relations.'' But Mr. Pollack brings a nuanced and carefully reasoned, if sometimes debatable, approach to his exploration of the emotional baggage that both sides bring to the table today.
 He provides the reader with a brief history of Iran, underscoring the ferocious xenophobia of Iranian leaders like Mohammed Mossadegh and Ayatollah Khomeini, while emphasizing how the country's experience as a pawn in the Great Game played by Russia and Great Britain during the 19th century nurtured Iranians' suspicion of foreign interference in their country's affairs. He discusses the tendency of the Iranian people -- fed by centuries of weak and corrupt regimes -- to resent and resist their rulers. And he reviews the many traumatic encounters between the United States and Iran over the last 50 years.
 Like most observers, Mr. Pollack sees the 1953 coup against Mohammad Mossadegh as a defining moment for Iranian attitudes toward America. ''What is most knotty for the United States,'' he writes, ''is that the popular Iranian version of history portrays Mossadegh as a wildly popular prime minister forging a new, democratic Iran fully in command of its own destiny, who was overthrown by American agents to prevent Iran from achieving political and economic freedom.''
 Though he argues that this myth ''embellished and exaggerated'' American mistakes ''to grandiose proportions,'' he adds that ''there is a kernel of truth in it, and therein lies the rub; the United States did help to overthrow Mossadegh, and it was culpable in the establishment of the despotism of Mohammed Reza Shah that succeeded him.''
 Many Iranians, furious at the shah for a multitude of sins, from his creation of a repressive police state to his squandering of money on military equipment, blamed the United States, which they saw as ''his ally or colonial 'master.''' Mr. Pollack, on his part, contends that ''to the extent anyone was manipulating anyone, it was the shah who was manipulating the United States through his ability to influence oil prices,'' his monopoly over ''strategic freedom of action in the gulf region'' and ''his control over virtually all of the information the United States received from his country.'' 
 Despite the fact that the failure to anticipate Ayatollah Khomeini's ascendancy was a historic blunder by the United States, Mr. Pollack curiously does not blame American policy makers this blind spot. ''The shah brought the Iranian revolution on himself,'' he concludes: America's ''greatest mistake was not in failing to prevent his fall but in following policies that made his fall so injurious to our interests.''
 For Americans, Mr. Pollack goes on, the defining moment in relations with Iran was the 1979-1981 hostage crisis, which ''left a terrible scar on the American psyche'' and which has remained the ''elephant in the living room'' of American policy toward Iran ever since.
 ''The hostage crisis made the United States look weak in the eyes of the world,'' he writes, ''and weakness invites challenge. It seems fairly certain that this impression of weakness contributed to Iran's decision to challenge the United States in Lebanon in the 1980's and throughout the Persian Gulf in the 1980's and early 1990's; Iraq's decision to invade Kuwait in 1990 and then to remain there even after the United States committed 500,000 troops in 1991; Syria's willingness to challenge us in Lebanon in the 1980's; and possibly to other international confrontations that followed.'' 
 Can the United States and Iran overcome their bitter past? Or will their psychological scars heighten their already very real difficulties with each other? As Mr. Pollack sees it, Iran may currently be at a kind of hinge moment in history, where either the country could make ''a transition to real democracy'' or Islamist autocracy could solidify; where the nation could acquire nuclear weapons or embrace the concept of collective security; where it could demonstrate a greater openness toward the outside world or make a more concerted effort to shut it out.
 Just how the United States deals with Iran at this crucial moment in time, he writes at the end of this informative and often useful volume, ''may be the ultimate test of America's leadership in the new era that is dawning.''

HEADLINE: Imitators and Parodies, Testing the Job Market

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
In an era of flextime, telecommuting and employee harassment lawsuits, bosses have never been more malleable. Except, of course, in that last bastion of ancien regime tyranny: network television. 
 And never has there been a more piercing cry for help from programming executives than the latest crop of workplace reality shows, from NBC's ''Apprentice'' to the various knockoffs starting this week. These reality shows do not signal a national malaise about outsourcing and unemployment. Mostly, they reflect the anxiety of the network producers who serve at the mercy of mercurial corporate bosses: one small slip in the ratings and boom, a pink slip. 
 ''The Apprentice'' is now histrionic and humdrum. And there are no real business tips to be learned from the latest Fox imitations, ''The Rebel Billionaire'' and ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss,'' or, for that matter, Spike TV's ''I Hate My Job,'' with the Rev. Al Sharpton as host. Yet when seen as a playbook for the behind-the-scenes fear and scheming in Rockefeller Center and Fox studios in Los Angeles, they have a certain edifying piquancy.
 Network programming executives are like workplace reality show contestants: their goal is to push all the other rivals off the schedule and be the last one standing. Those responsible for these shows, after all, are ambitious, hard-working young people who live in fear of sitting across the conference table from taskmasters like Rupert Murdoch of Fox, Michael D. Eisner of Disney and Bob Wright of NBC Universal and hearing the words, ''You're fired.'' And unlike government or academia, television is a world where people actually do lose their jobs. In April, Disney bosses fired ABC's two top entertainment executives; the shows they had developed, ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' became this season's huge hits. 
 Spike TV, ever in pursuit of the young, male slacker audience, scheduled ''I Hate My Job,'' a reality show that takes eight men who are unhappy in their work -- a lawyer, a construction worker, a preschool teacher -- and forces them to compete to achieve their dream jobs. Not surprisingly, those dreams include male model and stand-up comic. They are divided into teams and given assignments by Mr. Sharpton, who serves as their career counselor and motivational coach.
 Mr. Sharpton's protean career as an advocate, minister and presidential candidate can serve as a model to all dissatisfied workers. Regrettably, he seems to have used up most of his charm and rhetorical gifts on the campaign trail; on the show, he is disappointingly sober and mild. His most colorful phrase in the premiere episode is: ''Dinner at eight. Don't be late.'' 
 And Fox 's first elbow jab at ''The Apprentice,'' Sunday night's ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss,'' is a cautionary business lesson. In this send-up hoax, a formula already well-trod by ''Joe Schmo'' and ''Joe Millionaire,'' an actor pretends to be an autocratic venture capitalist who torments his would-be apprentices with verbal abuse and daffy advice. (''As I like to say, there is no future in the past.'') The show has some amusing insights into corporate America. To instill the lesson that a boss never takes the fall for company misdeeds (he is ''the first to know and the last to go''), the leader of the losing team in each event cannot be booted. Instead he gets a bye for the next round. 
 The women named the men's team ''Concad Inc.'' The men named their rivals after Kenneth Lay's collapse, ''Femron.'' Yet audiences stayed away from the deadpan mockery, perhaps because the real ''Apprentice'' and the latest Fox imitation, ''The Rebel Billionaire,'' are already so close to self-parody.
 ''My Big'' failed to put much of a dent in the NBC show, but it did seem to undermine Fox's own version, ''The Rebel Billionaire,'' which features Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic Airways entrepreneur, presiding over an extreme-sports version of ''The Apprentice.'' (Nerves are tested in a hot-air balloon rather than the boardroom). Unlike Donald Trump, Sir Richard speaks in an Englishman's mild, apologetic tone. (''I'm afraid one group will not be able to come,'' he tells a team that is left behind on the first challenge, walking a plank between two hot-air balloons 10,000 feet up.) The exotic daredevil adventure aspect is closer to ''Fear Factor.'' 
 Otherwise, the show follows the same formula of teams living in luxury suites, husky young men and attractive blondes, silly assignments and weekly firings. Like Mr. Trump, Sir Richard is cast as a mogul in search of the perfect protege. And the motives of the man currently promoting a United States version of his airline, Virgin Domestic, are as transparently self-serving as the New York real estate developer's. ''If 'Rebel Billionaire' is a success,'' Sir Richard told The New York Times Magazine, ''Virgin will be almost as well known in America as it is in England.''
 Sir Richard may succeed, but that does not mean that Fox found a winner. The network would like ''Rebel Billionaire'' to be to ''The Apprentice'' what Microsoft was to Netscape: an imitator that used greater resources -- and some questionable practices -- to overwhelm and crush the original.
 More likely, the reality show's producers will be summoned to a Fox boardroom to face the consequences.

HEADLINE: Can Bush Break the Second-Term Jinx?

BYLINE: By Lou Cannon. 
Lou Cannon is the author of '', Ronald Reagan: A Life in Politics.''

DATELINE: SUMMERLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
President George W. Bush justifiably casts himself as the apostle of the Reagan Revolution begun by his father's predecessor. But Mr. Bush may find in his second term, as Ronald Reagan did before him, that he must overcome resistance as much from his friends as from his adversaries. 
 Perhaps because of Mr. Reagan's iconic status, conservatives today exhibit selective amnesia about their attitudes toward him during his second term. They remember cheering his determination to end communism as we knew it, but they have forgotten that they deplored the fruits of his negotiations with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. 
 Late in 1987, William F. Buckley started a campaign in the National Review against ratification of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the signal achievement of the Reagan-Gorbachev negotiations and the first accord to reduce American and Soviet nuclear arsenals. Senate conservatives, led by Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Steven Symms of Idaho, proposed amendments to the treaty that were unacceptable to the Soviets and would have torpedoed the accord. Bernard Rogers, a former NATO commander, led an advertising and letter-writing campaign against the treaty that compared President Reagan to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who appeased Hitler. George Will, the conservative columnist, described the 1988 Moscow summit between Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev as ''moral disarmament.'' President Bush, now basking in his re-election honeymoon, is likely to face even greater skepticism over Iraq if the prospects for success there do not improve after the current offensive in Falluja and the Iraqi elections in January. Both Mr. Buckley andMr. Will, for example, have questioned the wisdom of the Iraq war. Further to the right, Patrick Buchanan has denounced the war and insisted (accurately, I believe) that Ronald Reagan would never have waged it.
 Nor is Mr. Bush assured of smooth domestic sailing. Senator John Kerry may have used fuzzy math in assessing the costs of his own policy proposals during the recent campaign, but he had it right in saying that President Bush has never vetoed a spending bill. The president's big-government conservatism has not escaped the critical attention of conservatives like Joe Scarborough, the television host and former member of the House of Representatives, who has denounced the administration's bland acceptance of pork-barrel politics. 
 While President Reagan was more willing than Mr. Bush to wield a veto pen, he, too, underestimated Congressional appetites. One of his central miscalculations was his belief that Republicans in Congress would be more willing than their Democratic counterparts to cut spending. In fact, with few exceptions, Republicans resisted spending cuts in programs that benefited their districts as much as Democrats did. This, coupled with tax reductions and a huge increase in military spending, led to a deficit of more than $200 billion at the end of the first Reagan term.
 President Bush's predicament is worse. A combination of tax cuts, spending increases, an economic slowdown and the costs of war have produced a growing deficit of $413 billion that mocks the administration's rosy budget forecasts and has pushed some conservatives into the ranks of the deficit hawks. 
 In addition, political expectations are higher for Mr. Bush in his second term than they were for Mr. Reagan. That's because Ronald Reagan, despite a 49-state landslide victory in 1984, never enjoyed the presumed benefit of a Republican-controlled House. In 1986, midway through that second term, Democrats also regained control of the Senate.
 Without openly abandoning supply-side doctrine, Mr. Reagan dealt practically with ascendant Democrats, particularly on economic issues. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was an ambitious mix of tax cuts, tax increases and loophole closings that on balance was less of a drain on Treasury coffers than is Mr. Bush's plan to make permanent the tax cuts of 2001. 
 In foreign policy he combined fiery anti-Soviet rhetoric -- ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!''-- with an attempt to find common ground with Soviet leaders. While Mr. Reagan was famously stubborn in his refusal to abandon his pet project of the Strategic Defense Initiative, he was accommodating on the margins and shared with Mr. Gorbachev a genuine desire to reduce nuclear arsenals.
 Our current president, despite a popularity with rank-and-file Republicans that may equal Ronald Reagan's, has less running room. Abroad, he has no Gorbachev with whom to negotiate, and no known exit strategy from Iraq. His relationships with many traditional allies are strained. 
 At home, Mr. Bush has also failed to build alliances across the political aisle. President Reagan and House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill rarely agreed on anything, but they liked each other. In several crises, most notably the deployment of Marines in Lebanon, their relationship produced tangible support for the administration. Mr. Bush has no similar relationship with any leading Democrat.
 But as he embarks on his second term, President Bush may hold an advantage over President Reagan in one respect. It is the advantage of clarity. Mr. Reagan came to office in 1981 after a crystal-clear campaign in which he promised to cut taxes and increase defense spending, and he did. In contrast, he ran for re-election on the gauzy slogan of ''Morning Again in America,'' a feel-good theme that avoided commitments and left him adrift in his second term. Even before the Iran-Contra affair diverted his focus, Mr. Reagan never made a serious attempt to cut the budget or control runaway entitlement programs.
 Mr. Bush, by contrast, was re-elected after making specific promises to keep his tax cuts, limit civil lawsuits and partially privatize Social Security. Promises embolden, and even though Mr. Bush's margin of victory was far smaller than Ronald Reagan's, he arguably has more of a mandate for change.
 If he is to accomplish these changes, he will need to court Congress far more assiduously than he did in his first term. He will need a thriving economy and good fortune in the Iraq war. And he will also require the steady backing of conservatives who are now freed of the anti-Kerry unity required by the election campaign. As Ronald Reagan learned in his second term, that support can't be taken for granted.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Voters Declared Their Independence

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The Spanish-language television advertisements for President Bush went negative this fall, attacking Senator John Kerry's voting record and his stance on abortion. Mr. Kerry's Spanish television advertisements, in keeping with the traditional appeals that Democrats have made to Hispanic voters for generations, mostly stayed positive, rarely even mentioning Mr. Bush's name.
 But in the end, Mr. Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, more than any Republican presidential candidate in at least three decades. That tally, more than 10 percentage points higher than he received in 2000, shattered the Democrats' hopes that a growing Hispanic population would help Mr. Kerry in Colorado or New Mexico, or perhaps even Florida. 
 Few experts say they believe Mr. Bush has achieved a seismic shift of the sort that Ronald Reagan brought about in the early 1980's in winning over blue-collar white voters. A clear majority of Hispanics, after all, still voted for Mr. Kerry. 
 What is unquestionably clear, those experts say, is that like the great Latino wave in pop culture, which has more and more influence in areas like music, food and fashion, this election has taken Hispanic voters a giant leap away from being thought of as separate and different. A reliable Democrat no longer, taken for granted no longer -- and more electable than ever in their own right, with the first two Hispanic United States senators in 30 years poised to take office, from Colorado and Florida -- a new swing voter may have emerged. 
 ''The bottom line to me is that with this result, it's no longer sensible to think of Hispanic voters on a national basis as a core constituency of the Democratic Party,'' said Roberto Suro, the director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization based in Washington. 
 ''We are up for grabs,'' said F. Chris Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico. ''That is a good thing for Hispanics; we're going to be more influential in the future and a bigger target for both campaigns.''
 No one thing explains how Mr. Bush was able to achieve this coup. The loyalty of Cuban-Americans already gave the Republican Party a foothold among Hispanic voters, and Mr. Bush was already strong among Hispanic voters in Texas, who are mainly Mexican-Americans. 
 But the two parties' different strategies, reflected in the Spanish television advertisements, Hispanic scholars and political analysts say, were revealing if not decisive. The Bush campaign approached Hispanic voters exactly the way it did everybody else: by reaching out for cultural conservatives, who in this case just happened to be Hispanic. The Kerry campaign sought votes as if Hispanics, as in the past, were reliably Democrat. The advertisements emphasized issues like immigration and economic opportunity and used few attack advertisement techniques, omnipresent on English-language television, to close the deal. 
 ''The Democrats made a broad appeal to a Democratic base and not a specific appeal at all to religious Hispanic voters, or even specific segments of the Hispanic electorate,'' said Adam Segal, director of the Hispanic Voter Project at the Johns Hopkins University. ''The Bush campaign used moral values, and specifically the national discussion over gay marriage and abortion rights, as wedge issues within the Hispanic community to try to break off a conservative religious segment.''
 Les Dorrance, a security guard in Denver whose family has lived in Colorado for generations, is the kind of Hispanic voter the Bush campaign went after and won. 
 Mr. Dorrance said conservative values about abortion and the sanctity of marriage were important issues for him, and he went straight down the Republican line after Mr. Bush's name, even going so far as to vote against Ken Salazar, the lone Hispanic on Colorado's statewide ballot, in the process. Mr. Salazar beat the Republican candidate, Pete Coors, for the open Senate seat being vacated by Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican who chose not to seek a third term.
 ''I voted for Bush based on his moral stance,'' Mr. Dorrance said on a recent sunny morning in Denver as he patrolled outside a downtown office building. ''Bush is pro-life, I'm pro-life. He believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, and so do I.''
 But conservative social values were just part of the appeal, experts say.
 Hispanics are heavily represented in the Marines, for example, and according to some national polls are about as patriotic as Americans get; both factors could have increased support for a sitting president in wartime. And the the candidates's focus on security and global terrorism may have blunted the domestic and economic issues that Democrats have used in the past to score well with the heavily blue-collar Hispanic population. 
 ''The campaigns, either purposefully or not, didn't bring to the forefront things like jobs, education and health care,'' said Janet Murguia, the executive director and chief operating officer of the National Council of La Raza, a nonpartisan civil rights group. ''At the same time there was a very concerted effort by the Republicans to target the Hispanic community in some new ways.''
 Ms. Murguia said the Roman Catholic Church had a role in that outreach, with sermons and other messages in Spanish-speaking parishes on abortion and embryonic stem cell research, which many conservatives oppose because it can result in destroying human embryos. 
 Negative advertisements by the Bush campaign on Spanish television were also an innovation this year, according to the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins. In the 2000 campaign, neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, used negative Spanish-language television advertisements, school officials said.
 Even the tagline that was used in many print advertisements under the president's name reinforced the campaign's message that Mr. Bush was the candidate, despite all the history and tradition with the Democrats, who really spoke the inner language of Hispanic culture. 
 ''Nos conocemos,'' the advertisements said. ''We know each other.'' 
 Some political scholars caution that, like Americans in every category, more Hispanic voters cast ballots this year, so it is possible that on-the-ground organization was as responsible as a conservative Republican message. Mr. Bush may have done well, they say, because more of the people who already agreed with him went to the polls. 
 Mr. Bush has personally done well among Hispanic voters before. In his first election for president in 2000, he got 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, second until this year only to Mr. Reagan, who got at least 37 percent in 1984, according to voter surveys going back to 1972.
 It is too early, some experts say, to suggest that Bush Hispanics will join the ranks of Reagan Democrats. Professor Garcia of the University of New Mexico, for example, does not think that this election portends a permanent new pattern in the Hispanic vote.
 ''One swallow does not make a spring,'' he said.
 But other experts say that crossing the 40 percent threshold is a turning point, especially given that the rapidly growing Hispanic population has become the largest ethnic minority in the nation.
 Mr. Suro, and others, say that perhaps the real message of the election is that Hispanic voters cannot be pigeonholed. In a year when the national Democratic Party floundered in reaching Hispanics, the first two in 30 years were elected to the United States Senate: Mr. Salazar, a Democrat, here in Colorado, and Mel Martinez, a Republican, who was elected to the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Graham in Florida.
 But where Mr. Salazar is a moderate with deep rural roots as a farmer and rancher, Mr. Martinez is a conservative Cuban-American who is Mr. Bush's former secretary of housing and urban development. And both had to appeal far outside any traditionally defined ethnic voting bloc to be elected.

HEADLINE: Kerry Advisers Point Fingers At Iraq and Social Issues

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
In a glum post-mortem to the presidential campaign, senior advisers to Senator John Kerry said Monday that Mr. Kerry lost because he had failed to turn the election into a referendum on the economy, a problem they attributed to a barrage of foreign policy news and the success of the White House in wielding cultural issues.
 A pollster for Mr. Kerry, Stanley Greenberg, said that the campaign saw evidence that its position was slightly deteriorating among white rural voters 10 days before Election Day and that the erosion began ''cascading from group to group.'' 
 At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. Greenberg said voters had been open to backing Mr. Kerry but pulled back after he failed to convince them to make their decision based on economic issues.
 ''Voters were very concerned about the economy,'' Mr. Greenberg said, ''but in the end, they did not respond to John Kerry on the economy. And after that, they voted their values. And that produced a cultural polarization of the electorate.
 ''These voters were waiting to hear an economic choice before the election, and they didn't get it.'' 
 Mr. Kerry's aides said his efforts to turn the election to the economy were drowned out by news from Iraq as well as Mr. Bush's focus on cultural issues. The slide worsened as the final days of the campaign were dominated by two overseas topics, Osama bin Laden's videotaped message that was released on the weekend before the election and the missing explosives in Iraq.
 ''News events were driving this, including the Osama bin Laden tape, at the end,'' said Robert Shrum, a senior adviser to Mr. Kerry. ''The economy was not driving the news coverage.''
 James Carville, a Democrat who was an informal adviser to Mr. Kerry's campaign, told reporters that President Bush achieved a ''monumental political achievement'' in winning despite polls that showed deep concern about the direction of the country and unhappiness with his job performance.
 ''If this is an election that we couldn't win ...'' Mr. Carville said, his voice trailing off, as he sat next to Mr. Shrum and Mr. Greenberg. ''The purpose of a political party is to win elections, and we're not doing that.
 ''I think we have to come to grips with the fact that we are an opposition party right now and not a particularly effective one. I'm out of denial. Reality has hit.''
 Even as they sought to put much of the blame of Mr. Kerry's loss on external events, Mr. Carville and Mr. Shrum acknowledged at least implicitly what had been a continuing criticism of Mr. Kerry, that he never presented an overarching view of what his presidency might be like. The two men suggested that the Democratic Party could become competitive only if it came up with what Mr. Greenberg described as a ''narrative'' that offered a clear choice to voters.
 ''A narrative is the key to everything,'' Mr. Greenberg said, acknowledging that the Republicans had done better at presenting such a campaign essential. ''I think they had a much more coherent attack and narrative that motivated their voters.''
 Mr. Carville said: ''I think we could elect somebody from the Hollywood Hills if they had a narrative to tell people about what the country is and where they see it.''
 Mr. Shrum grimaced in what appeared to be a soft dissent.
 ''We had a narrative,'' he said. ''But in the end, I don't think it came through. Everybody said we lost in 2002 because we didn't say anything. You can't say that this year.''
 Mr. Shrum and Mr. Greenberg suggested that there was little that they could have done differently to change the result, and seemed somewhat less despondent over the defeat than Mr. Carville.
 ''John Kerry barely lost,'' Mr. Greenberg said.
 At that, Carl Leubsdorf, the longtime political correspondent for The Dallas Morning News, cocked an eyebrow at Mr. Greenberg.
 ''He lost by 3.5 million votes,'' Mr. Leubsdorf said.
 Mr. Shrum responded by turning the focus back on Ohio, pointing to the relatively small number of votes that would have had to shift there to turn around Mr. Bush's winning margin. 
 ''That's not true,'' Mr. Shrum said. ''He lost by 60,000.''
 Mr. Shrum also noted that there had been few post-election recriminations aimed at the campaign among Democrats. Still, the advisers appeared amid evidence of waves of angst among party leaders.
 ''I think we have come to an ending point in a long transition that began in 1968,'' said Donald L. Fowler, a former national chairman of the party. ''During that time, the old Roosevelt Democratic majority coalition has creaked and cracked away under various kinds of racial, religious, social and international forces, and this election was the end point in that transition. I think we live in a country that is majority Republican now.''

 MONTPELIER, Vt., Nov. 8 (AP) -- Former Gov. Howard Dean is considering a bid to be chairman of the Democratic Party when it elects a new leader next year. 
 Steve Grossman, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Mr. Dean had told him that he was thinking about it.
 Dr. Dean's spokeswoman, Laura Gross, said it was ''far too early to be speculating on that.''

HEADLINE: Retailers trying harder to push the buttons that turn goods into gifts.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
LEADING national retailers -- worried about the size of their coming holiday haul -- are intensifying efforts to find the right advertising to entice jaded shoppers into opening their wallets and purses before Dec. 25.
 The goal of the campaigns, from retailers like Best Buy, Cartier and Target, is to stand out from the usual seasonal spiels by forging more emotional bonds with consumers. That is a response to the trend of shoppers showing increasing resistance to rational price-and-item pitches.
 The need for retailers to use nontraditional approaches to differentiate themselves from the competition is becoming more urgent as analysts offer forecasts for revenue growth that are more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho. 
 ''People want to spend,'' said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, the market research company, ''but there is still enough uncertainty around that they're being a little watchful.''
 ''That will require retailers to think about engaging consumers in a more substantial way,'' he added, ''not so they get turned off by all the marketing that goes on but so they will feel connected to the season.''
 For instance, Best Buy, the nation's leading electronics retailer, is doubling down on its chances at piquing consumer interest by running two campaigns at the same time rather than just one as it did last year. Both campaigns were created by its agency, Best Buy Advertising.
 One campaign, focusing on Elton John DVD's sold only at Best Buy, is a follow-up to a successful promotion last year centered on exclusive Rolling Stones merchandise. The other campaign, new for 2004, features an offbeat character named Kevin Kringle, Santa Claus's everyman brother, who without access to his sibling's elf-operated workshop turns to Best Buy for his gift-giving needs.
 ''The environment is always very competitive at this time of year,'' said Ruby Anik, vice president for advertising at Best Buy in Minneapolis, ''so we're looking at how we can build the momentum with advertising that creates that extra punch in the market.''
 ''Some years our holiday advertising is more 'jingle bell-y,' and some years it's more general,'' she added. ''Last year, it was more about the right gift; this year, we wanted to create a personality we can own and use on a recurring basis.''
 Kevin Kringle will be almost as omnipresent in Best Buy's advertising as his brother is in traditional holiday campaigns. The character will appear in television commercials, catalogs, print advertisements and online ''teaser'' ads at Web sites including aol.com, msnbc.com, ticketmaster.com and yahoo.com. Kevin even has his own Web site (kevinkringle.com), created by a Minneapolis agency, Space 150.
 Characters, fanciful and real, also play a major role in a holiday campaign for the Target discount department store chain. To generate interest in its sales on the Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving, which start as early as 6 a.m., Target will soon offer shoppers free prerecorded wake-up calls through its Web site (target.com/wakeup).
 ''Find the flavor that'll get you out of bed,'' a newspaper ad proclaims, ''and wake up and shop.'' The choice of callers includes a rooster, the supermodel Heidi Klum, a crying baby, the ''Star Wars'' villain Darth Vader, a singing child prodigy and the rapper Ice-T.
 ''Every year we're trying to reinvent the wheel to grab our guests and gain their attention,'' said John Remington, vice president for marketing at Target in Minneapolis, using the company's term for customers. ''We're trying to make this new promotion as fun as possible and as different as possible.''
 The wake-up call campaign begins tomorrow with so-called viral marketing like e-mail messages; short films on Web sites like ifilm.com and atomfilms.com; and ''profiles'' of the callers on Friendster, the social-networking Web site (friendster.com). Newspaper ads, along with television and radio commercials, are to follow on Nov. 22.
 The campaign is being produced for Target on a project basis by the New York office of Mother, a London agency known for its unconventional creativity. It is the agency's first work for Target, which also uses agencies like Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York and Peterson Milla Hooks in Minneapolis.
 ''The environment seems to get ever more cacophonous each year,'' Andrew Deitchman, a partner at Mother New York, said of the holiday season, requiring ''fresh thinking and new creative resources'' for retailers seeking to break through the clutter.
 Another potential clutter-buster emanates from a retailer on another end of the economic spectrum, Cartier, the luxury jeweler owned by the Richemont Group. For the first time, Cartier is sponsoring a branded-entertainment campaign, featuring celebrity families from movies, music and television like the Carradines, the Marshalls and the Sutherlands.
 The Cartier campaign will appear as advertorial sections, produced in collaboration with the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, to run in the December issues of three magazines published by the Hearst Communications division of the Hearst Corporation: Esquire, Harper's Bazaar and Town & Country. The Cartier media agency is Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 ''We want to put the message out that Cartier has been, and intends to remain, one of the glamorous brands on the market,'' said Olivier Stip, senior vice president for marketing and communications at Cartier North America in New York.
 ''It's hard to predict what Christmas will look like,'' he added, ''but we are preparing for a strong season.''
 One thing unchanged from recent years is the starting dates of the campaigns, which are concentrated in the first and second weeks of November. Start before Election Day, and many consumers, focused on politics, may ignore the ads, however unusual and elaborate. Start before Halloween, and people will complain about rushing the season.
 ''We refer to it as 'season treason,''' said Mr. Smith of Yankelovich. ''Getting too aggressive about trying to engage people in the holiday season before they take in the pumpkins may dilute some of the anticipation and some of the excitement.''

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic Advice On What Is to Be Done

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:

Free World
America, Europe and the Surprising Future of the West
By Timothy Garton Ash
Illustrated. 286 pages. Random House. $24.95.
 ''Free World'' is a sort of citizens' manifesto aimed at persuading governments and the people who elect them that the battered trans-Atlantic alliance needs to stop its petty bickering and work together, or the world might burn while we fiddle.
 The West, Timothy Garton Ash says, repeating here what is commonly known, is afflicted by a strange crisis, sparked by the Iraq War but marinated in the sense that Europe and America have become distinct and incompatible zones of culture, values and behavior. Robert Kagan, writing along these lines, coined the phrase, ''Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus.'' Charles A. Kupchan foresees Europe and America becoming separate, rival zones of interest.
 Mr. Garton Ash, the Oxford historian who has gained a solid reputation as a wise and erudite commentator on European affairs over the years, takes a different approach from these other analysts. His view is that things are more complicated than the commonplace notion that the West has become ''divided between Europe and America.'' The West, he says, ''did not split neatly into a European and an American half, like a well-cracked walnut.'' We are not, he writes, two separate civilizations but two variants of the same set of values, most of whose ''long-term interests are common, coincident or, at the very least, compatible.'' And most important, only by working together can the two zones of the old cold war West capitalize on what Mr. Garton Ash describes as a ''historic chance,'' namely working in concert ''to go beyond the 'free world' of the old West and lay the foundations of a free world.'' 
 We owe it to Mr. Garton Ash for speaking what ought to be commonly accepted wisdom but has often gotten lost in the maelstrom. ''Free World'' is a model of common-sense reasoning based on strong empirical evidence. American readers might in places find this book to be a touch Britain-centric -- it was published in the Britain a few months ago and certainly takes the British condition as its starting point. There is a certain amount of thematic wandering and some repetitiveness in a book that has an occasional pep-talk, stump-speech quality to it (''What can we do? The answer is: a lot.''). More important perhaps, Mr. Garton Ash is not always clear when a difference is deep and abiding -- the American belief in force; the European in the efficacy of diplomacy and international organizations, for example -- and when these represent only what he calls, quoting Freud, a narcissism of minor differences. Still, Mr. Garton Ash has given us a readable and worthy argument, rooted in a sense of what is important and what is not and based on as informed and accessible a tour of the global situation as we're likely to have. 
 In this regard, what is important to Mr. Garton Ash is the commonality of the interests, values and even ways of life of both sides of the Atlantic. He devotes some fascinating passages to demonstrating the error of the view that American and European social systems are opposites of each other. ''America was the first European Union,'' Mr. Garton Ash reminds us. The divide is not mainly between Europe and America -- though there are clearly some divisions -- but within both Europe and the United States. And this is as true of the supposed difference about the use of armed force as it is of the social variant: European statism versus supposed American savage capitalism. ''America's Medicaid program alone spends more on caring for 40 million poor Americans than Britain's cherished National Health Service does on looking after all the country's 60 million people,'' he writes in his effort to nibble away the stereotypes that each side of the Atlantic has about the other. 
 Mr. Garton Ash goes on to explicate the background of post-cold-war Euro-American alienation and lays out the alternatives for the future. He makes an eloquent case in rejecting both American go-it-alone-ism and Europe's dream, pushed most ardently by France, of becoming a counterbalancing superpower, arguing that every European country should have as special a relationship with the United States as Britain has. 
 Gaullism, he writes, speaking of the desire, named after France's great man but a common temptation in the European Union, is a fantasy. ''We hope to become a superpower, fellow Europeans, in vain,'' Mr. Garton Ash writes. And here's what the United States should be announcing, Mr. Garton Ash says: ''We unequivocally, wholeheartedly support a uniting Europe (sotto voce: even if some Gaullist French are up there making trouble on the bridge).''
 The heart of his analysis is in his elucidation of what he calls ''the new red armies,'' the post-cold-war enemies that face us, most urgently terrorism but more generally the conflict in the Middle East and the terrible, crushing poverty of what used to be called the third world. His point is that in all of these areas, American and European strategic interests are more or less the same. The dispute then, where there is a dispute, is over how to achieve them. Along the way, Mr. Garton Ash has some specific guidelines to the key questions for the future: How far should the European Union expand? When is international intervention justified? What should the European and American roles be in the future? 
 Underlying all of this is the theme of freedom, interpreted by Mr. Garton Ash -- a former student of the philosopher Isaiah Berlin -- in the narrow, negative sense, as an absence of arbitrary constraints and a voice in the selection of rulers. 
 He provides a sophisticated analysis, helped by his reading of the economist Amartya Sen, regarding the inextricable link between freedom and economic development. The West, he writes, will probably enjoy a global paramountcy over the next two decades or so, during which it can use both its military and economic strength and its cultural resources to spread freedom and end poverty, the ultimate source of extremism and terrorism. 
 ''If Europeans, Americans and free people everywhere don't work together toward this goal, instead of remaining sunk in a narcissism of minor differences,'' he writes, striking his consistently practical, common-sensical theme, ''it will be impossible to achieve.''

HEADLINE: Chicago's Mayor Seeks Rise in Sales Tax to Close Budget Gap

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN RUETHLING

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Facing a $220 million budget deficit, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said on Tuesday that he wanted to raise the city's sales tax to 9 percent and cut hundreds of city jobs. 
 Mr. Daley's proposed $5 billion budget for next year would eliminate 320 vacant city jobs and reduce spending by nearly $50 million. But Mr. Daley, who still needs approval from the City Council, stressed that his plan called for no increase in property taxes. 
 In his annual budget speech before the City Council on Tuesday morning, Mr. Daley also praised a proposal to bring casino gambling into Chicago as a way to raise money. And, in the wake of charges of corruption regarding the city's use of private trucking companies, he pledged accountability and transparency in city contracts.
 Under Mr. Daley's budget plan, the sales tax would increase, to 9 percent from 8.75 percent, making it one of the highest in the nation. He also proposed increases in city fees, fines and taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, hotel rooms, amusements, parking lots and rental cars.
 He cited a sluggish local economy, rising costs and lagging state and federal help for what he described as the most challenging period the city has faced in his 15 years as mayor.
 But Mr. Daley pointed to a recent deal to lease the city's toll road, the Chicago Skyway, to a private developer for $1.82 billion as a way to begin paying off debt; build a reserve fund; invest in neighborhood public works; and finance programs for the homeless, the elderly, children, former prisoners and families with disabled children.
 The toll road proceeds, however, will not answer all the city's problems, Mr. Daley said.
 He said he supported the idea of opening a taxpayer-owned casino in the city -- an idea that state lawmakers are considering in Springfield.
 Mr. Daley said that a casino could generate at least 11,000 jobs, $250 million to $300 million a year for Chicago and more than $600 million a year for Illinois.
 ''The rest of Illinois already benefits from gaming,'' Mr. Daley said. ''Why shouldn't Chicago?'' 
 During his address, Mr. Daley repeatedly spoke of the need for accountability and transparency in city government. He called for more oversight of city projects, uniform hiring guidelines across all city departments, standard contracts and an online bidding system.

HEADLINE: Foreign Enrollment Declines At Universities, Surveys Say

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Many of America's top research universities suffered steep declines in foreign student enrollment this fall, according to two new surveys, and alarmed educators blamed delays in processing American visas as well as increased competition from universities overseas.
 Educating international students is a $13 billion industry for the nation's 4,000 colleges and universities, and in many science and engineering departments a majority of graduate students are foreign.
 The number of Chinese students who applied to attend American graduate schools this fall dropped 45 percent compared with fall 2003, according to a survey of its 450 member institutions by the Council of Graduate Schools. Applications from India fell 28 percent, the survey found. The decline in actual enrollments of students from those countries was less severe, however: 8 percent for Chinese and 4 percent for Indian students, the survey found. 
 The declines represent a troubling turnaround after three decades in which American colleges and universities experienced a boom in the enrollment of foreign students. The uninterrupted growth ended in the fall of 2003, when the country registered its first decline in foreign enrollment since 1971, 2.4 percent, according to the Institute of International Education.
 ''This is a serious problem for our country,'' said Peter D. Spear, the provost at the University of Wisconsin, where foreign enrollment declined by 3.8 percent, to 3,435 this year from 3,571 last year. ''We depend on international students to provide a good portion of our science and engineering work force,'' Dr. Spear said.
 At Arizona State University, which has about 60,000 students, the number from foreign countries fell 7 percent this fall over last. ''It's a major issue for us, and it's going to get worse,'' said Michael M. Crow, the university's president. ''We need workers in our scientific and engineering laboratories, and Americans tend to go into business, economics and law, while international students go into science and engineering. So our pool of talent is going down.''
 The countries contributing the most students to Arizona State's total enrollment are China, Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Dr. Crow said, and for students from all those countries, obtaining an American visa has become frustrating.
 ''For students from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, it's extremely difficult,'' he said.
 Other causes of the decline in foreign enrollment include increasing competition from universities in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, as well as a large expansion of university capacities in the countries that send the most students to the United States, India and China.
 ''Both countries are dramatically increasing their capacity to train their own graduate students at home,'' by expanding existing universities and building new ones, said Peggy Blumenthal, a vice president at the Institute for International Education.
 The institute released its annual report on student mobility, financed by the State Department, which surveyed enrollment data for the 2003-4 term. It found that total foreign student enrollment at 2,700 accredited institutions fell by 2.4 percent in the fall 2003 term, the first such drop since 1971.
 At the same time, Nafsa: Association of International Educators released a survey, conducted with four other groups, of foreign enrollment this fall at more than 400 institutions. It found that some universities experienced impressive growth, like the University of Southern California, which has the most foreign students in the United States, 6,647, an enrollment that represents a 6 percent jump over fall 2003. But about two-thirds of the 25 universities with the most international students reported declines. 
 Similarly, in a survey released last week, the Council of Graduate Schools said 7 out of 10 graduate schools reported declines in first-time international graduate student enrollment.
 Many universities that responded to all three surveys attributed the declines, at least in part, to visa denials and delays. Since Sept. 11, foreign students applying for visas have faced stringent review at American embassies. But science and technical students must also now be cleared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. Educators have been warning that the process keeps thousands of students away, and officials in the Bush administration are trying to fine-tune it, said Vic Johnson, a spokesman for the Association of International Educators.
 ''But there's a perception in the world now that students can't get a visa to study in the U.S. anymore, and that may take a long time to fix,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 Visa problems are keeping away not only students, but eminent visitors, too, said Larry Faulkner, president of the University of Texas. J.M. Coetzee, a South African author and the 2003 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, who was once a doctoral student at Austin, cited the headaches of applying for a visa in declining to attend a ceremony to honor him there this fall, Dr. Faulkner said. And also citing potential immigration problems, the International Astronomical Union decided to hold its 2009 general assembly in Brazil, rather than Hawaii, said Ken Marvel, a spokesman for the union.

HEADLINE: Sunni Party Leaves Iraqi Government Over Falluja Attack

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Karbala for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
In the first major political backlash over the assault on Falluja, the country's most prominent Sunni political party said Tuesday that it was withdrawing from the interim Iraqi government, while the leading group of Sunni clerics called for Iraqis to boycott the nationwide elections scheduled for early next year.
 The moves seemed to promise that popular protest against the American-led attack on the city, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim, is likely to grow in coming days.
 A widespread Sunni boycott of the January elections, if one comes to pass, would threaten the legitimacy of the outcome. It would also undermine the main rationale for the attack on Falluja: to drive insurgents out of the city so residents could freely take part in the elections. 
 The Sunni Arabs, who make up about 20 percent of the population, were ousted from power with the toppling of Saddam Hussein. They have expressed ambivalence about taking part in the elections, though American and Iraqi officials say their participation is crucial to the entire democratic enterprise, and to defeating the insurgency.
 The developments on Tuesday will almost certainly dampen voter turnout, but to what degree is unclear. 
 ''The clerics call on honorable Iraqis to boycott the upcoming election that is to be held over the bodies of the dead and the blood of the wounded in cities like Falluja,'' said Harith al-Dhari, director of the Muslim Scholars Association, a group of Sunni clerics that says it represents 3,000 mosques.
 Hours earlier, the group issued a religious edict ordering Iraqi security forces not to take part in the siege. Of course, there is always a chance that clerics could rescind their call for a boycott, but the group has until now been fairly uncompromising in its dealings with the Americans and the interim Iraqi government. 
 Just as ominous was the withdrawal of the Iraqi Islamic Party from the interim government. The party was a member of the Iraqi Governing Council set up by the Americans during the occupation and has been held up by American and Iraqi officials as a model of Sunni participation in the political future of the country. In recent weeks, its leader, Mohsen Abdul Hameed, had been saying he intended to take part in the elections.
 ''After the attack on Falluja, we decided to withdraw from the government because our presence in the government will be judged by history,'' Mr. Abdul Hameed, an interim National Assembly member, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
 The move so alarmed Prime Minister Ayad Allawi that he met privately with Mr. Abdul Hameed hours later. But the party stuck to its position, and an aide said in the afternoon that it was not clear that the group would take part in the elections.
 ''We haven't decided to withdraw from the elections; we're still going forward with the process,'' the aide, Ayad al-Samarrai, said. ''But it will all depend on the general situation in Iraq.''
 Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan, wrote on his Web log that Mr. Abdul Hameed's move ''raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government.''
 Adding to the growing tension, Moktada al-Sadr, the popular Shiite Muslim cleric who has led two uprisings against the Americans, said through a spokesman that the attack on Falluja ''is an attack on all the Iraqi people,'' and that Iraqis must not help the American forces. 
 Last April, as the Marines made their first ill-fated assault on Falluja, Mr. Sadr ignited a bloody uprising in the south against the Americans and proclaimed his support for the people of Falluja. The leaders of Falluja reciprocated by backing Mr. Sadr's insurgency. That rare moment of cooperation between Sunni and Shiite guerrillas led to one of the greatest crises of the occupation.
 American and Iraqi officials approved the latest offensive in Falluja with an understanding of the political problems it could provoke. 
 In April, disputed reports of civilian casualties in Falluja ignited protests across the Middle East and transformed the siege into a symbol of the evils of the occupation. 
 Within days, three prominent Sunni politicians -- Hajim al-Hassani, a deputy in the Iraqi Islamic Party; Sheik Ghazi al-Yawar, now the Iraqi president; and Adnan Pachachi, a former exile -- threatened to resign from the Governing Council, a move that helped push the Bush administration to halt the invasion after four days.
 Mr. Hassani, an economist who is now the minister of industry, said in an interview on Tuesday that he had resigned from the Iraqi Islamic Party rather than take part in the group's decision to withdraw from the government.
 ''Nobody is in favor of using force, but the problem is you need sovereignty over all the parts of Iraq,'' he said. ''I haven't heard any party come up with a single suggestion that we can solve the problems in these places without using force.''
 But Mr. Hassani acknowledged that the siege of Falluja, if it inspires public outrage and more political protests like the ones on Tuesday, could jeopardize Sunni turnout and derail the elections.
 ''We have to wait and find out how things are going to go,'' he said. ''If we can solve the Falluja problem very fast and without trouble in other areas, it might work. But I don't know what will happen.''
 Mr. Pachachi, a secular Sunni, said in an interview on Al Arabiya, an Arab satellite network, that he believed that the invasion of Falluja would have ''serious consequences,'' but also said the interim government had tried and failed to reach a peaceful solution.
 ''I had hopes that negotiations would continue, and I don't know whether all peaceful methods were exhausted or not,'' he said.
 At the same time, Mr. Pachachi said, bringing Falluja under government control would help the residents of the area take part in the elections. He said his relatively small party, the Movement of Independent Iraqi Democrats, would still take part, and said political groups ''should know that anyone who boycotts the elections will be the loser.''
 Tensions over the elections flared as well in the southern Shiite heartland. 
 Police officers in the holy city of Karbala said they had arrested seven aides of Mahmoud al-Hassani, a radical anti-American Shiite cleric who is close to Mr. Sadr and has issued an edict calling for an election boycott. The police said they had raided Mr. Hassani's office in hopes of catching him but he had disappeared.

Battle for Falluja Continues As Insurgents Fall Back
The American-led assault on Falluja wrested at least a third of the city, capturing the mayor's office, two mosques, a commercial center and other major objectives and advancing past the main highway through the city. Battles continued as the insurgents appeared to be retreating along a central corridor toward the southern fringes of the city. A1

Insurgent leaders in Falluja probably fled before the American-led offensive and may be coordinating attacks in Iraq that have left scores dead during the past few days, according to American military officials, insurgents and Western security contractors there. A1

President Bush spent two hours with wounded service members at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and afterward wished ''Godspeed'' to the troops in Iraq. A13

HEADLINE: Immigrants Reverse Their Trek as American Dreams Fade

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
They arrived as the New Irish in the 1980's and 90's, thousands drawn to a New York that still glittered in family lore as a place where hard work could bring prosperity.
 But the glitter began to dim along with the economy and the government's attitude toward illegal immigrants. Now they are streaming back to Ireland at such a clip that in the neighborhoods they regreened in Queens, Yonkers and the Bronx, once-packed pubs stand half-empty and apartment vacancies go begging. 
 Some immigrants, longtime illegal residents losing hope for legal status, say they are being driven out by new security crackdowns that make it harder for those without a valid Social Security number to drive, work or plan a future in the United States. 
 Others, already naturalized citizens, say the price in toil for health care and education was too high, and hope for a less-exhausting life in a prosperous Ireland. 
 ''It's the complete reversal of the American dream,'' said Adrian Flannelly, chairman of the Irish Radio Network in New York, who has served on an Irish government task force on returnees. The exodus from the city, he said, signals a historic shift in a relationship that is part of the city's backbone, inscribed in the subways and bridges built by Irish immigrant labor in past centuries. 
 Michael and Catroina Condon, both naturalized American citizens who spent 19 and 11 years in New York, respectively, say Ireland's style of prosperity promises a better life for their children. After the birth of their first baby, they said, they rebelled against the toll of seven-day workweeks to pay rising costs in a sluggish American economy. 
 ''It's longer hours, less money, and a lot of the time you see people working for their wage just to pay their rent, to pay their health insurance,'' said Ms. Condon, 31, who was a corporate secretary in Manhattan before returning in September to Mullingar, in County Westmeath. Her husband, a carpenter, is starting his own business, and she envisions a wedding-planning enterprise.
 The exodus is hard to quantify, but unmistakable, according to observers in the travel agencies, real estate offices, moving companies and pubs that cater to Irish New Yorkers in the Bronx and Queens. Christina McElwaine, a spokeswoman for the Irish Consulate in New York, said the reversal seemed unprecedented in scale.
 Some Irish immigrants have always gone back home, of course, and in 2002, after several years of strong economic growth and declining emigration, Ireland's census recorded 26,000 more Irish who returned than left. 
 It was one of the largest inflows ever in a country that had hemorrhaged its population for most of three centuries, and lost 23,000 as recently as 1990. 
 But the Irish departures reached critical mass in New York last summer, and were echoed in the last two years in Boston and Philadelphia. ''If this trend continues, it will be a very rare commodity to hear an Irish accent in this country,'' said Tom Conaghan, director of Philadelphia's Irish Immigration and Pastoral Center.
 The surge surprised even Danny Moloney, director of Liffey Van Lines, which had to keep its container loading dock in upper Manhattan open 24 hours a day to meet the demand from families shipping their household goods back to Ireland before school began.
 ''Our business has tripled in the past year,'' he said. ''It's all people that are going home to Ireland.'' Aine Cullen, a waitress at Eileen's Country Kitchen on McLean Avenue in Yonkers, followed six of her brothers when she migrated to New York seven years ago at 21. Now, most of her family has moved back. 
 ''Everybody's leaving and nobody's coming over anymore,'' Ms. Cullen said, ticking off colleagues, friends and relatives who packed up and moved back to Ireland over the summer or have bought one-way tickets home before Christmas. ''This will be the fourth brother to go.'' 
 Some leave reluctantly. ''I don't really have much of a choice,'' said Johnny C., 44, a construction worker who made a good living in New York for 14 years, only to see his jobs dwindle since a Department of Motor Vehicles crackdown this year left him unable to renew his driver's license. He sent his wife and 13-year-old United States-born daughter back to Waterford, Ireland, in June, he said, speaking on condition that his last name not be published, and he will join them this week.
 Counselors in immigrant advice bureaus on both sides of the Atlantic say that many returnees will have a rude awakening in Ireland -- especially those who were stuck in the underground economy in the United States, unable to travel abroad for fear of not getting back in. The Irish government now puts out brochures warning that they will find not the Ireland of memory, but rather a fast-paced multiracial society where their dollars are weak against the euro and affordable housing scarce. 
 ''The old tradition that you come to America and you work like hell and you save, and you go back and the almighty dollar will give you a kick start -- that's all over,'' Mr. Flannelly said.
 But for those who linger illegally in New York, there is another twist in the Irish-American relationship. Now it is they who marvel at visiting Irish friends and relatives who are able to fly to New York for the weekend, just to shop for cheap designer-label goods, or to consider investing in a $300,000 apartment.
 ''For generations, we Irish have fled oppression and poverty to New York in the hope of a better way of life; now it seems we just want to buy the place,'' Tim O'Brien wrote in The Irish Times in a Sept. 23 article about ''the latest big thing'' -- ''how affordable property is for the Irish investor.'' 
 Johnny C., the construction worker, remembers that kind of attitude in the Irish-American visitors of his childhood. ''The shoe is really on the other foot now,'' he said. 
 In the Woodlawn section of the Bronx, where homes typically change hands through word of mouth, the ripple effects are inescapable. An Irish-American landlord said that half a dozen of his apartments had been vacant since August and that his wife had to close down her home day care business as families moved away. 
 Siobhan Dennehy, director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, in Queens, said others had only been holding out for a fresh approach to immigration after the election. One example was a 40-year-old mother in Woodside, Queens, who began packing last Wednesday after seven years. ''The election definitely tipped things for me,'' she said as she prepared to take her New York-born daughter back to Sligo. ''I may as well go home and be part of a society that I can belong to and contribute to. Under Bush, it's never going to happen.''
 But Anthony Finn, a counselor with the Emigrant Advice Centre in Dublin, said the returnees might find disillusionment, too, in today's Ireland. The most successful, he said, are those who got legal status in the United States; the illegal are caught short in both economies.
 On one side is Barry Fox, a carpenter who went from illegal day laborer to American citizen earning a union wage over a dozen years in New York. ''I think I'm actually better off,'' Mr. Fox, a father of three, said in a telephone call from County Tyrone, where he built a home on his father's farmland after returning three years ago. 
 Weighing the higher cost of parochial school education, health insurance and his mortgage in Yonkers, he said even his $70-an-hour union carpenter's wage in New York fell short of what he earned now. 
 At the other end is a couple that left Boston for County Cork two years ago, and told Kieran O'Sullivan, a counselor at Boston's Irish Immigration Center, that they now regretted it. 
 While they were in the United States, prices soared in Ireland, spurred by the high-tech boom known as the Celtic Tiger. But they do not qualify for high-paying work, they said, and service jobs in hotels and restaurants go to the recent wave of immigrants from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe willing to work harder for lower wages.
 ''We were only gone for four and a half years, but everything had changed,'' the wife said in a call from Ireland, asking to remain anonymous in hopes of avoiding a 10-year ban on re-entering the United States, imposed on anyone found to have overstayed a tourist visa by more than 180 days. 
 Mr. Finn, the emigrant advice officer in Dublin, agreed. ''They are not returning,'' he said of the Irish from America. ''They're remigrating to a different country.''

HEADLINE: Deals Are Hot and Heavy But the Talk Is of a Bubble

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
With its curved green glass facade, which follows a bend in the neighboring Chicago River, the 36-story building at 333 West Wacker Drive is one of Chicago's most admired postmodern skyscrapers. Last summer, however, some real estate professionals were surprised when a German investment group paid $208 million, or about $240 a square foot, for the 21-year-old building; the price was a whopping $67.5 million more than it traded for in 2000.
 Some real estate investors and analysts say that rich deals like this one are a sign that the commercial real estate market is dangerously overpriced. ''This feels very much like the last couple of months of the Internet bubble,'' said Larry Jay Wyman, the co-chairman of HRO Asset Management, a company that represents a German fund that invests in American real estate. Many investors seem to be making unrealistic assumptions about future market conditions, he said. 
 ''People keep saying this is a new paradigm,'' said Mr. Wyman, who estimates that he has evaluated about 100 deals in recent months. ''As soon as you hear those words, you grab your wallet and get out of the room as fast as possible. A building can only produce as much net rent as its market will allow.'' 
 The 333 Wacker Drive deal, for example, comes as Chicago's downtown office vacancy rate is 16.2 percent, according to Fitch Ratings, with another 3 million square feet about to be added to the market. The CoStar Group reported that 333 Wacker Drive was 93 percent leased and was expected to produce an initial rate of return of only 6.4 percent, some two percentage points less than the initial yield when the building changed hands four years ago. 
 Investors who buy properties with such low initial yields generally expect to increase revenues. But it will not necessarily be easy for the new owners, KanAm U.S. Grundinvest Funds, to generate more income from their trophy building. Rents in the city have declined in recent years and landlords are being forced to offer increasingly generous inducements, said Brian P. Nagle, an investment sales broker in the Chicago office of Cushman & Wakefield. 
 Two of the building's larger tenants, with leases expiring in 2008 and 2009, could be tempted to move into one of the four new downtown office towers that are under construction. The oversupply of new space in Chicago's central business district, Fitch Ratings reported last week, ''will depress both occupancy levels and rent rates for some time to come.'' But Steve McCarthy, the managing director of WestWind Partners, a private company that manages KanAm's investments, said that 333 West Wacker was acquired at a reasonable price and with average rents below market level. 
 Despite high vacancy rates, cheaper rents and the pressure on landlords in most markets to make ever-sweeter concessions, the trading frenzy in commercial real estate has continued unabated. Sales of industrial, retail and apartment properties valued at $5 million or more approached $44 billion in the third quarter of this year, reaching a level that was 10 percent higher than any other quarter on record, according to Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company. 
 At a time when interest rates remain low and the stock market is performing tepidly, many investors are willing to accept relatively low returns on real estate because they believe they have nowhere else to put their money, investors and analysts say. Expected initial yields, known as capitalization rates, have dropped two percentage points in the last three years, to 7.7 percent, said Robert O. Bach, the national director of market analysis for Grubb & Ellis. ''People are willing to pay more per dollar of income,'' he said. ''No doubt about it, real estate is expensive, compared to five years ago. Some investors may be overbidding.'' But he said there were also signs in many places that the office buildings were slowly beginning to rent empty space. 
 Fueling the feverish trading is the availability of enormous amounts of capital from both domestic and international sources. Mr. Wyman said his HausInvest Global fund alone had $1.5 billion to invest. ''It used to be that if you had a billion dollars to spend, you were a pretty popular guy,'' he said. ''Now you're just one of the herd with a billion dollars.''
 But even Mr. Wyman has not stayed out of the game. In May, his company paid $390 million for the 1.1-million-square-foot Manhattan Mall, now a mixed-use building, on 34th Street and Broadway. The initial yield, according to CoStar, was only 7 percent, but Mr. Wyman said the price was well below what it would cost to replace the building. ''We got what we think is a fair return that we know will grow,'' he said. More recently, the company bought a major stake in a 55-story office tower at 1100 Louisiana Street in Houston.
 Also driving the trading is the fierce competition among banks to make loans. Kevin C. Donahue, who manages a portfolio of 169 defaulted or distressed loans around the country for Midland Loan Services in Overland Park, Kan., said retail and investment banks were so flush with cash that ''underwriting standards have become a little more relaxed.'' Larry Duggins, the president and chief operating officer of ARCap Real Estate Investment Trust, a company that also services distressed loans, said he was worried about this competition, even though the loan default rate remained low. ''I believe the lending environment has become very aggressive,'' he said. 
 To measure whether buildings are overvalued, Reis Inc., a New York research firm, has examined transactions of more than $2 million in 50 metropolitan areas for the last two years and has compared the price of each building with what it considers its actual value, based on market conditions and the property's cash flow. Lloyd Lynford, Reis's president, said that in the second quarter of this year buyers were paying an average premium of 24.2 percent for office space, up from 16.6 percent in the second quarter of 2002. For apartments, the premium declined slightly during the same period, from 14.6 percent to 13.7 percent, he said. ''It's not as pronounced, but it's still meaningful,'' Mr. Lynford said. 
 These trends are making some investors start to pull back, Mr. Lynford said. ''Some investors are beginning to wonder if they want to be last in the game of musical chairs,'' he said.
 One such company is Jamestown of Atlanta, which also raises money from German investors, who have been active buyers of United States real estate in recent years. Jamestown has sold $1 billion worth of prime office and retail property in the last 14 months, including the Waikele shopping center in Honolulu, but has not bought any buildings since it acquired a 75 percent interest in a 2.8-million-square-foot building, 111 Eighth Avenue, in Manhattan early this year for $775 million, said Stephen J. Zoukis, a partner. High prices are expected in New York, where it is difficult to build new office buildings, but Mr. Zoukis said he was astounded by the deals he saw in Atlanta, where there were few barriers to new construction. ''We are seeing record-setting prices paid for buildings,'' he said. ''We don't get it.''
 While some investors are troubled by today's high prices, some of the people who advise them are more optimistic. 
 In the last year, the biggest buyers of office real estate have been public and private real estate investment trusts and foreign investors, according to Real Capital Analytics. Private local investors have actually sold more property than they have bought -- something that pension funds and other large institutional investors have been doing since 2001. Susan Hudson-Wilson, the chief executive of Property and Portfolio Research, a Boston company that advises pension funds and other large investors, believes that this strategy is a mistake. ''They are moving in the wrong direction,'' she said. ''They are waiting for an event that is never going to happen -- for the real estate market to crater.'' 
 Dale Anne Reiss, the global director for Ernst & Young's real estate, hospitality and construction practice, said that for foreign investors taking advantage of favorable currency exchange rates, today's prices might not look so bad. ''People who say the market is overheated and priced too high are saying that it's priced too high for them, for the criteria they are using,'' she said. And indeed, Jamestown is contemplating changing its investment criteria by creating a new fund that would invest in riskier older properties with the potential for being upgraded, Mr. Zoukis said. Such investments would carry more risk, he said.
 Raymond W. Torto, the manager director of Torto Wheaton Research, said investors who could hold onto their property for five years or more would earn adequate returns. But he said he expected prices to fall in the coming year. And in cities like Boston, where market-rate rents are less than what many tenants with expiring leases are currently paying, some buyers may have problems achieving their goals if their expectations are unrealistic, he said. ''You're foolish in general if you go in and buy property with expectations of big rent spikes,'' he said. ''Then, you're buying on a bubble.''

 CORRECTION:
A Commercial Real Estate article in Business Day on Wednesday about rising prices for commercial real estate misidentified a Houston building in which the Haus Invest Global fund recently bought a major stake. It was the 36-story tower at 1000 Main Street, not the 55-story building at 1100 Louisiana Street.

HEADLINE: In Washington, a Delay on the Road to Baseball's Return

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
For the 33 years since the Washington Senators played their last game here at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, this city has been starved for baseball. But starved enough to pay for a glistening new stadium for its new team, the former Montreal Expos?
 On Tuesday, the City Council answered with an ambiguous maybe. Facing evidence that Washingtonians are deeply concerned about publicly financing a new stadium, the council delayed a final vote on a plan that would have relied heavily on tax money to finance a $435 million ballpark along the Anacostia River. 
 The moved stunned and infuriated supporters, led by Mayor Anthony A. Williams. But it thrilled opponents, including an array of economists, religious groups and community activists who have argued that the stadium would drain money from vital city services like schools and libraries, while doing little to strengthen the economy. 
 ''I'm excited that this could kill public financing,'' said John Capozzi, an organizer with a coalition of community and education groups called No DC Taxes for Baseball. ''This at least moves away from total capitulation to Major League Baseball.''
 But the delay was far from a death knell for the district's baseball dreams. Major League Baseball has given the city until the end of the year to enact a financing plan, and the council is expected to take up the issue again in two weeks. Mr. Williams said he remained confident that he had 7 solid votes on the 13-member council to enact the plan. 
 ''Yes, we've had a setback today,'' he said at a hastily called news conference. ''But I think we're still making progress.''
 Mr. Williams, who made an unusual appeal for his plan on television on Monday night, has argued that the new stadium would anchor a development boom that could generate 3,500 construction jobs and create a tourist attraction barely a mile from the Capitol.
 ''From a quiet, dirty, forgotten waterway, the Anacostia can flow into a vibrant, bustling center of residential and commercial life,'' Mr. Williams said in his televised address. 
 Under the plan Mr. Williams hammered out with Major League Baseball, a 41,000-seat stadium would be built in time for the 2008 season using bonds financed by higher taxes on larger businesses, taxes on stadium concession sales and the annual rent paid by the team. The rent would begin at $3 million, rise to $5.5 million in six years and increase 2 percent a year after that.
 While the new stadium was under construction, the team -- which is expected to be renamed the Nationals, after a team that played in Washington in the 1870's and 1880's -- would play at R.F.K. stadium starting next spring. 
 While polls show residents were thrilled about baseball's return, they also indicated that many people opposed relying on public money to pay for it. 
 Discontent may have been a factor in City Council elections earlier this year, when three candidates who had opposed the stadium plan -- including former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. -- defeated incumbents who had supported it. Those new members will join the council in January, putting additional pressure on Mr. Williams to enact his plan by Dec. 31.
 The council president, Linda W. Cropp, pulled the stadium measure from the agenda Tuesday morning, saying said she had received an 11th-hour proposal from a development group to build the stadium on the Anacostia River site using mostly private money. The city would have to finance improvements to roads and utilities and land acquisition, a total of about $150 million, she said.
 But other council members and city officials said the new proposal seemed unrealistic because it called for the developers to receive part of the broadcasting revenue, which usually goes to the team, and would rely on a tax provision that Congress may change. 
 ''I don't think there is anything we can do with this proposal in two weeks,'' said Councilman Adrian Fenty, who opposes public financing for the stadium. But Mr. Fenty argued that the city should delay a vote until next year to explore sources of private financing. 
 Richard Gross, a lawyer for the development group, BW Realty Advisors, could not be reached for comment. City officials said the group includes Michael Sununu, son of John H. Sununu, the former Republican governor of New Hampshire, and brother of the state's junior senator, John E. Sununu. 
 Marc Ganis, a consultant to professional sports teams, said the only way the city won the intense competition for the Expos was to offer public financing for a stadium. But Mr. Ganis said the trend was away from cities' fully financing stadiums. In San Francisco, the Giants' new stadium, which opened in 2000, was financed almost entirely with private money. New stadiums in Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Detroit all depended on some private financing. 
 Last month, a group of 80 economists sent a letter to Mr. Williams arguing that new stadiums not only failed to increase employment and per capita income for cities, but could also hurt existing businesses by shifting spending from them. 
 Mr. Williams has rejected such predictions, appearing repeatedly with business leaders to promote his plan. ''This is our moment, our time to write history,'' he said Monday. ''Revive the Anacostia. Or let it languish for years to come.''

HEADLINE: Shares Sluggish as Investors Await Fed Action on Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average ended slightly lower while the Nasdaq composite index inched higher yesterday as investors waited for hints from the Federal Reserve about the pace of interest-rate increases.
 A sharp drop in oil prices also helped limit losses.
 Investors were guarded ahead of earnings from the technology bellwether, Cisco Systems. After the closing bell, Cisco fell 2 percent when it reported first-quarter earnings that matched rather than exceeded Wall Street estimates as it usually does. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 4.94 points, or 0.05 percent, to close at 10,386.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell just 0.81 of a point, or 0.07 percent, to 1,164.08. The Nasdaq composite gained 4.08 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,043.33.
 Yesterday's performance marked the second session when markets have paused after last week's post-election rally. However, dealers said it was encouraging that there had been no sell-off.
 ''Everyone's waiting for the Fed even though it's a foregone conclusion what they're going to do,'' said Tom Schrader, managing director of United States equity trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to increase the benchmark Fed funds rate by a quarter point to 2 percent today. More important, however, is what the Fed will indicate about further rises. A stronger-than-expected jobs report last Friday increased the expectation of an increase in December as well as in November.
 ''The Fed needs to raise rates,'' said Subodh Kumar, chief United States investment strategist at CIBC World Markets Inc.
 ''If the Fed says they are raising rates moderately -- even if they do it at two meetings -- the stock market would see that as a sign that the earnings cycle is continuing to expand. Stocks would take it well,'' Mr. Kumar said.
 Crude oil lent some support to indexes during the session. The December contract fell $1.72, to settle at $47.37 a barrel, further easing concerns about the impact that high energy costs have on consumer spending and corporate profits.
 The fall in oil prices helped economically sensitive stocks like industrials, but hurt energy-related stocks. Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker, rose $1.30, or 1.5 percent, to $88.31, but Exxon Mobil slipped 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.31.
 Microsoft rose 1.7 percent, or 49 cents, to $29.77.
 Microsoft's shareholders approved the company's planned $3-a-share special dividend. 
 Merck & Company fell more than 2 percent, or 57 cents, to $26, dragging on the Dow and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after it was subpoenaed by the Justice Department for documents relating to the recalled arthritis drug Vioxx.
 In economic news, inventories at wholesalers rose 0.5 percent in September, the smallest increase since April.
 Treasury bond prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note declined 2/32, to a price of 100 6/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.23 percent from 4.22 percent.

HEADLINE: Leaders in Nassau and Suffolk Vow to Try a Little Diplomacy

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: MELVILLE, N.Y., Nov. 9 

 BODY:
The top officials of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, meeting in a building overlooking their geographical border, agreed Tuesday that they had far more in common than their boundary and pledged to find ways to work together on mutual problems. 
 ''There is no county border when it comes to homeland security or transportation or lobbying Albany to get our fair share,'' said Suffolk's county executive, Steve Levy. His counterpart from Nassau, Thomas R. Suozzi, nodded in agreement. 
 The two men, both Democrats, made a show of shaking hands for the assembled cameras in a office building here. Then they sat down and jointly signed a ''declaration of cooperation'' in which they promised to ''find ways to assist each other.''
 All that might sound like common sense. But Long Island is notorious for its hundreds of units of local government, including not just the two counties but also 13 towns, dozens of villages, two cities and many school, fire, library, water, sewer, police, park and other special districts.
 Historically, those jurisdictions have jealously guarded their autonomy, making few attempts at cooperation. But Mr. Suozzi began discussing bicounty efforts with the previous Suffolk executive, Robert Gaffney, and now, Mr. Suozzi and Mr. Levy are making that initiative more formal. 
 Acknowledging that the event appeared made for the television cameras, Mr. Levy said, ''This is not a one-time-only photo shoot.'' After the two executives took questions from reporters, they met privately with deputies and agency chiefs arrayed along two long rows of tables -- one side from Nassau and the other from Suffolk.
 Among the items on their agenda was the possibility of operating a joint juvenile detention center, which might be more economical as a combined operation. Suffolk has had trouble getting state approval for its proposed center.
 They also discussed revitalizing the Long Island Regional Planning Board, the only agency that bridges the two counties. Hearings on that proposal are scheduled for Wednesday. To combat growing gang violence, officials from both counties agreed that their police forces should share intelligence and strategies.
 To guard against terrorism, the officials considered the possibility of creating a regional homeland security program. To save money, they talked about combining their purchasing power to buy supplies and even discussed sharing equipment.
 The two counties also plan to lobby more to reduce state mandates and seek greater reimbursement for expenses like police patrols of the Long Island Expressway. Westchester gets reimbursed for policing state roads, Mr. Levy said, and Long Islanders deserve the same. 
 ''We're not proclaiming that all these will necessarily happen,'' said Mr. Levy, conceding that some ideas may not pan out. But the new approach should foster even more ideas, he said.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Moody's Upgrades State Bond Rating

BYLINE: By Al Baker (NYT); Compiled by George James

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service upgraded New York State's weak bond rating yesterday for the first time in 14 years, reflecting recovery in the state's economy and rebounding tax collections. Moody's raised the rating on the state's general obligation bonds one notch, to A1. Although the A1 rating is still among the lowest in the nation, Moody's cited improving economic conditions in New York City and a move by lawmakers in Albany to raise income and sales taxes last year, over Gov. George E. Pataki's objections. Al Baker (NYT)

HEADLINE: Buy a G.M. Car at 0% Now, Get the Same Deal in 5 Years

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Can fear of the Fed sell cars? 
 General Motors has a new pitch for car shoppers to coincide with an expected rate hike Wednesday from the Federal Reserve. G.M.'s program, called ''Lock 'n' Roll,'' will give shoppers who buy a car and qualify for zero percent or low financing rates the same deal on any new G.M. purchase before the present financing runs out. 
 For example, buy a Chevrolet Malibu from Wednesday through the end of November at zero percent for 36 months, and get the same rate on any other future G.M. vehicle, including a Cadillac or a Saab, provided you buy the new car within three years. The buyer of a model financed over five years would qualify for the same interest rate on a new vehicle bought within those five years. 
 The deal is good for a total of 10 years, meaning that the longest term for financing on the car bought now would be five years.
 ''We think we're in an environment over the next two-year window where interest rates will go up,'' said Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s marketing chief. ''We think the Fed will move Wednesday to some extent. We've been in a period of historically low interest rates. What we're saying is we have incredibly aggressive rates right now on our new products and we're going to assume the risk of any interest rate increases out into the future.''
 The deals are the latest escalation in a price fight among the Big Three domestic automakers. Rebates as high as $6,000 and loan financing at zero percent are good for shoppers, but financial analysts fret about their impact on Detroit's profits. The special financing deals are made by G.M.'s financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, and erode the company's profit margins. G.M. has the highest incentive spending levels in the industry, according to Edmunds.com. 
 G.M.'s promotional campaign is the latest in an onslaught started just after the Sept. 11 attacks to boost flagging car sales. The initial G.M. campaign, called ''Keep America Rolling,'' introduced the first wave of zero-percent financing offers. 
 Lately, G.M. has tried to make different offers, like a recent promotion in which the company gave cars to a few lucky people who visited G.M. dealerships.
 The company also recently gave away a new Pontiac G6 sedan to each person in the studio audience of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' More than 200 cars were given away then.

HEADLINE: ASHCROFT QUITS TOP JUSTICE POST; EVANS GOING, TOO

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington for this article, and Adam Liptak from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Attorney General John Ashcroft, one of the most prominent and polarizing members of the Bush cabinet, said Tuesday that he would resign, after a tumultuous tenure in which he was praised for his aggressive fight against terrorists but assailed by critics who said he sacrificed civil liberties in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, a close friend of President Bush who spent years promoting the administration's tax cuts across the country, also submitted a letter of resignation on Tuesday.
 The two were the first in a series of departures from the administration that are expected before Mr. Bush is inaugurated in January for a second term.
 Leading candidates to succeed Mr. Ashcroft include Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, and Marc Racicot, the chairman of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. Larry D. Thompson, who served as deputy attorney general until last year and is now the general counsel of Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y., is a personal favorite of the president but is said not to be interested in the job, a Republican close to the White House said. 
 In his letter of resignation, Mr. Ashcroft indicated that he would stay in the job to ensure a smooth transition until his successor was nominated and confirmed.
 Mercer Reynolds, a Cincinnati businessman who was Mr. Bush's campaign finance chairman, is a top candidate to replace Mr. Evans, the Republican said.
 In a handwritten resignation letter to Mr. Bush, dated Nov. 2, that was released by the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Ashcroft said, ''The demands of justice are both rewarding and depleting.''
 He added: ''I take great personal satisfaction in the record which has been developed. The objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror has been achieved. The rule of law has been strengthened and upheld in the courts. Yet, I believe that the Department of Justice would be well served by new leadership and fresh inspiration.''
 The resignation of Mr. Ashcroft, 62, had been widely expected, even as some Justice Department officials in recent days had suggested that he might want to stay on.
 But Mr. Ashcroft had been sidelined for nearly a month last March when he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder after a severe case of pancreatitis. In addition, he never developed a close relationship with Mr. Bush and annoyed some members of the White House staff who thought he was at times a grandstander who was overtly politicizing the Justice Department. One Republican close to the White House said on Tuesday night that Mr. Ashcroft had gotten a ''strong signal'' from the administration that his resignation would be accepted.
 Mr. Bush, in a three-paragraph statement released by the White House, praised Mr. Ashcroft for his work over the past four years.
 ''I applaud his efforts to prevent crime, vigorously enforce our civil rights laws, crack down on corporate wrongdoing, protect the rights of victims and those with disabilities, reduce crimes committed with guns and stop human trafficking,'' the statement said. ''I appreciate his work to fight Internet pornography. I am grateful for his advice on judicial nominations and his efforts to ensure that my judicial nominees receive fair hearings and timely votes.''
 But Mr. Ashcroft's critics were caustic. ''We had an attorney general who treated criticism and dissent as treason, ethnic identity as grounds for suspicion and Congressional and judicial oversight as inconvenient obstacles,'' said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. ''He was a disaster from a civil liberties perspective but also from a national security perspective.''
 Republicans close to the administration said that the candidates to replace Mr. Ashcroft were still undergoing scrutiny by the White House.
 Mr. Gonzales, who grew up in a poor Mexican-American family and attended Harvard Law School, was appointed by then-Governor Bush to the Texas Supreme Court. He has been central in the administration's debate over what interrogation techniques are permissible for prisoners held since the Sept. 11 attacks, and is the author of a White House memorandum in which he wrote that the Geneva Conventions were ''quaint'' and not suitable for the war against terrorism.
 Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City was mentioned by some as a possible successor, but his spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said Tuesday night that he was not interested in the job.
 The resignation of Mr. Evans had also been widely expected. Mr. Evans, who has known Mr. Bush for more than three decades, had made it clear to associates before the election that he wanted to step down even if the president won a second term. Mr. Evans's family had recently moved back to Texas, where Mr. Evans has been a Republican favorite to run for governor.
 In his letter of resignation to the president, dated Nov. 9, Mr. Evans said, ''While the promise of your second term shines bright, I have concluded with deep regret that it is time for me to return home.'' He added, ''It is a blessing to have served America with such an extraordinary leader and a true friend.''
 Mr. Bush, in a statement released by the White House, called Mr. Evans ''one of my most trusted friends and advisers'' and ''a valuable member of my economic team.'' Mr. Bush added: ''To encourage job creation here at home, Don has worked closely with me to reduce taxes, open markets for American goods and services and promote a level playing field abroad.''
 Mr. Evans's departure is part of a broader reshuffling expected in the administration's economic team, which includes John W. Snow, the treasury secretary. A prominent Republican with close ties to the White House said on Tuesday that while Mr. Snow would remain for now at Treasury, he would probably step down after six months or a year.
 Extending Mr. Snow's tenure would reward the treasury secretary, a 65-year-old former railroad executive who aggravated Bush campaign officials when he traveled to Ohio in October and called job losses under the president nothing more than ''myths.'' But Mr. Snow has also been a tireless salesman for Mr. Bush's tax cuts and a cheerleader for his economic policies.
 Administration officials are also contemplating a shift for Stephen Friedman, who is currently director of the White House National Economic Council. Mr. Friedman, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, is under consideration as the United States trade representative and would be in charge of negotiating international trade agreements.
 It remains unclear what will happen to Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's top trade negotiator for the past four years. Mr. Zoellick, who made progress on global trade talks and negotiated free-trade agreements with Chile, Australia and nations in Central America, had been looking for a new post in a second Bush term.
 Administration officials said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of Mr. Bush's White House Council of Economic Advisers, was expected to return to Harvard University, where he is a tenured professor of economics. Mr. Mankiw, although well respected as an economist, badly rattled the White House and many Congressional Republicans last year when he said ''outsourcing'' American jobs to foreign countries was simply a new form of trade that would ultimately benefit the United States.
 Republicans also said on Tuesday that Roland W. Betts, a close friend of the president and a Democrat, is a leading candidate to become chairman of the inauguration festivities in Washington in January. Mr. Betts, an owner of the Chelsea Piers sports and entertainment complex in Manhattan, has known Mr. Bush since their days together at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale, and spent election night at the White House with Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: North Korean at U.S. Consulate in Russia Tests New Asylum Rules

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Ten days after President Bush signed into law a bill easing the way for North Koreans to win political asylum in the United States, a North Korean man jumped from a neighboring building onto the roof of the American Consulate in Vladivostok, Russia, entered the building and asked for asylum.
 ''He's still here,'' an American consular official said by telephone on Friday, speaking of the man who entered the premises in late October. Citing federal privacy rules, the official added: ''We are working the case. There is not a resolution.'' 
 Holed up in the consulate, the defector, a construction worker in his 40's, presents the first test of the North Korean Human Rights Act. Passed unanimously by both houses of Congress in September, the highly popular bill was signed by President Bush on Oct. 18, in the heat of the presidential campaign.
 In addition to removing barriers to granting asylum to North Korean refugees, the law calls for doubling American radio broadcasting to North Korea to 12 hours a day and smuggling radios into North Korea. It also grants $2 million a year to groups supporting human rights, democracy and a market economy in the Communist nation and allocates $20 million a year to help settle North Korean refugees. By mid-February, the State Department is to submit to Congress guidelines for accommodating North Korean asylum seekers who present themselves at United States consulates and embassies.
 The North Korean government has angrily attacked the law, to the point of telling The Wall Street Journal last week that it would not take part in regional talks over its nuclear weapons program until the law was repealed. Minju Chosun, an official publication, said last week that the United States ''is trying to send in obscene publications and discrepant rogue recordings using travelers, and worse, miniradios and televisions using balloons.''
 The bulk of North Korean refugees go into China, where thousands live a hunted existence. But the Russian Far East could also become a new magnet for people fleeing North Korea, widely considered one of the world's most repressive nations.
 Russia and North Korea share only a 10-mile land border, but North Korean freighters routinely stop at nearby Russian ports, and a direct rail line takes an estimated 4,000 North Koreans a year to work in construction and logging, all under tightly supervised construction contracts.
 ''My country is like a big prison,'' a 28-year-old North Korean interpreter said by cellphone last Friday from the Vladivostok apartment of Russians who were hiding him until he could win asylum in South Korea or the United States. ''I absolutely hate the political system in my country, and I see no future there.''
 Asking not to be identified, he said he escaped detention in a North Korean workers' apartment in Vladivostok by jumping out a second-story window, breaking bones in his feet. He said he had lost his girlfriend in college when security agents dragged her out of a class and sent her and her family into rural exile. He said her father, a prominent economist, was purged for advocating free market experiments.
 He begged over the phone: ''Please help me. I will go to any country that will offer me political asylum.''
 In China, consulates, embassies and foreign schools increasingly look like armed camps after invasions by North Koreans seeking asylum. Currently, about 130 North Koreans are camped inside the South Korean Embassy in Beijing.

HEADLINE: Wary of Regulators' Scrutiny, Reinsurer Ends Berkshire Deal

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Responding to heightened scrutiny of a once-common insurance industry practice, Platinum Underwriters Holdings, a Bermuda-based provider of property and casualty reinsurance, said yesterday that it was scrapping an insurance contract it had bought from Berkshire Hathaway because the deal might not meet regulatory standards.
 ''We would rather publish pristine financial statements that are beyond this kind of unwelcome scrutiny,'' Michael Price, president and chief underwriting officer at Platinum, said in a conference call with analysts. The company conducted the call to release its third-quarter results. 
 The transaction unwound by Platinum is a type of insurance known broadly as finite or financial reinsurance, which is intended to limit companies' exposure to unknown liabilities. Such contracts became enormously popular in the late 1990's as costs related to litigation surged and companies had an increasingly difficult time assessing their potential liabilities. Adding to the appeal of finite insurance was its effect of smoothing volatile earnings, which many investors find distressing. 
 When used properly, finite insurance allows insurers or corporations to spread their risk of loss on an asset or business over time and spread it to other insurers willing to take on more risk in exchange for premiums. But for a policy to be considered true insurance, it must involve the transfer of some risk to the party receiving the premiums. If the insurer agrees to return the premiums paid at a later date, the policy resembles a loan, not insurance, and runs afoul of accounting rules. 
 Regulators have recently turned up cases of finite insurance that transferred no risk and were used to cover losses that occurred before the contracts were written. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Brightpoint, a cellphone distributor in Indiana and the giant American International Group for misleading investors through the use of finite insurance. 
 The insurance, regulators said, helped Brightpoint hide $11.9 million in losses in 1998. Brightpoint and American International settled with the S.E.C. Federal prosecutors in Indiana are investigating the matter. 
 During the conference call yesterday, Platinum's executives said that increased regulatory interest in finite insurance compelled them to reexamine the deals they had struck, looking for ''red flag'' issues, like insufficient risk transfer, insurance that covers known losses, and undisclosed side agreements. Platinum management said it was careful to avoid such problems with its finite insurance transactions.
 Finite transactions accounted for 28 percent of Platinum's premium volume in the first three quarters of 2004, according to Jean-Francois Tremblay, an insurance analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. Yesterday, the company said that the contract it had terminated with Berkshire Hathaway, headed by Warren E. Buffett, differed from the finite insurance it sells to other clients.
 Gregory Morrison, chief executive of Platinum, said in the call that even though the contract bought from Berkshire Hathaway ''contained ample risk transfer and was reviewed with our auditors at its inception,'' recent events might not have caused an economic loss to Berkshire. Therefore, the deal was scuttled. 
 Platinum had been scheduled to release its earnings last week, but delayed the announcement so it could get out of the reinsurance deal, executives said. Investors seemed relieved that it involved only an unwound contract, and Platinum Underwriters' stock closed at $29.60, up 8.4 percent. The company said termination of the Berkshire Hathaway deal would not affect its results.

HEADLINE: As Labor Leadership Gathers, Head of Largest Union Issues Call for Major Changes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As the nation's union leaders gather today in Washington the labor movement is in turmoil, with the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s largest union hinting that it might pull out of the labor federation and some labor leaders saying that John J. Sweeney may face a challenge for its presidency.
 In a sign of the jockeying and soul-searching, Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s largest union, called yesterday in a letter for far-reaching changes in labor designed to increase its membership, proposing a $25-million-a-year campaign to unionize Wal-Mart and a near doubling in the amount spent annually on organizing.
 The meeting comes as long-simmering differences in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have been intensified by President Bush's re-election, with many union leaders fearing retaliation because organized labor spent more than $150 million to try to defeat him. 
 ''The labor movement was really shaken by the election and they're also badly divided,'' said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. 
 Unions are also feeling a sense of crisis, largely because the percentage of workers in unions has plunged to 13 percent from nearly 35 percent in the 1950's and because corporations are cutting back health benefits and pensions. 
 In recent months, Mr. Stern, whose union, with 1.6 million members, is the nation's fastest growing, has warned that the service employees might break away from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- a federation of 60 unions and 13 million workers -- unless the federation embraces major changes to reverse labor's decline. 
 Mr. Stern said in his letter to the 54 members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Executive Council that President Bush's victory had intensified the need for change. ''When only 13 percent of the American work force is in unions, our ability to win national elections is limited,'' he said. And he said he wanted a vote on proposals for change before the president's inauguration in January, instead of at the labor convention in July. Mr. Stern's call for broad restructuring has fueled fierce divisions, even causing one union, the International Association of Machinists, to warn that it might quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. if Mr. Stern prevails in his push to remake the federation.
 Adding to the tensions, some labor leaders say that a close ally of Mr. Stern, John W. Wilhelm, the longtime president of the hotel workers' union, might challenge Mr. Sweeney, who is up for re-election next year. 
 In an interview, Mr. Wilhelm declined to say whether he would run against Mr. Sweeney, who says he will seek a new four-year term at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s convention in July.
 ''We have to do things much differently in the labor movement because of all the challenges that we face,'' Mr. Wilhelm said. ''Organized labor right now is obviously in trouble because we continue to decline as a percent of the work force.''
 Mr. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, called today's meeting to discuss proposals to reshape the union movement and to assess labor's political efforts this fall.
 He, too, sent a letter to labor leaders yesterday, saying that unions needed to reshape their movement ''to better take on corporate America and win power for working families in today's economy.'' He added, ''We should be big enough to discuss our different positions with respect for each other and without restoring to an 'us against them' stance.''
 Mr. Stern's proposals would amount to a thoroughgoing restructuring of labor.
 In his letter he called for consolidating the federation's 60 unions, perhaps to less than 20, saying that many unions are too small to grapple with giant corporations. 
 ''Since the founding of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. nearly 50 years ago, our employers have changed, our industries have changed, technology has changed, and the global economy has changed,'' Mr. Stern said.
 ''The labor movement has not kept pace with these changes. Today, workers and their families are paying the price,'' he said.
 Complaining that workers are often hurt when 10 or more unions represent workers in a single industry, Mr. Stern called for giving the A.F.L.-C.I.O. power to bar a union from negotiating a contract that undercuts the wages and benefits that unions in the same industry have already negotiated.
 At his union's convention last June, Mr. Stern said the A.F.L.-C.I.O., in order to be more effective in helping workers, needed power to hold unions accountable -- to make sure they organize more workers and do not undercut one another. At that convention, he warned, ''We either transform the A.F.L.-C.I.O. or build something stronger together,'' language his aides said suggested that he might break off from the federation to begin a more aggressive, growth-oriented federation.
 As part of an effort to make $2 billion available for unionizing efforts over the next five years, Mr. Stern called yesterday for giving half the dues that member unions pay the A.F.L.-C.I.O. back to the unions so they would have more money available for organizing.
 He also proposed using the $25 million in royalties that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. gets each year from its Union Plus credit card to organize Wal-Mart, the nation's largest corporation. 
 ''The Wal-Mart business model of providing low wages and few benefits, shifting jobs overseas to exploit workers under poverty conditions and viciously opposing workers' freedom to form unions is setting a pattern that undermines good jobs for all working people at home and abroad,'' Mr. Stern wrote.
 Wal-Mart officials say that their workers receive competitive wages and benefits, that Wal-Mart is not opposed to unions and that conditions are humane in the overseas factories that produce many of the goods it sells.
 Mr. Sweeney, who came to power in 1995 promising to rejuvenate the movement, said he welcomed many of Mr. Stern's proposals, including his call to have unions back national health care reform and have unions back a campaign to pressure employers not to interfere in organizing drives. He said the was already carrying out some of these proposals
 ''I look forward to discussing these and a range of ideas that aim to strengthen the voice of working people,'' Mr. Sweeney wrote. 
 Richard Sloan, a spokesman for the machinists' union, criticized Mr. Stern's proposals, asserting that they were part of a power play in which Mr. Stern and his allies were seeking to take over the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 ''It's not Andy Stern's role in life to say to 60 other international unions that you got to do it my way or the highway,'' Mr. Sloan said. ''That's just dead wrong. There's an arrogance to that. He fails by misunderstanding the nature of the labor movement -- this isn't a set of elites that dictates to us. This is a democratic movement.''
 At their convention in September, the machinists' delegates authorized the union's executive council to withdraw from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. if its political opponents won control of the federation.

HEADLINE: G.M. enlists a TV dispenser of monetary advice to pitch 'Lock 'n' Roll' as the way to finance a car.

BYLINE: By Danny Hakim

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
SUZE ORMAN wants to tell you about a can't-miss car deal. 
 Ms. Orman is a financial planner, CNBC talk show host, motivational speaker and best-selling author of such books as ''The Courage to Be Rich,'' and now, she has been tapped by General Motors to pitch the company's latest marketing promotion, which G.M. is calling ''Lock 'n' Roll.''
 The deal, which is the latest salvo in Detroit's three-year-old price fight, allows consumers who qualify for no-interest financing or other special low rates on 2005 G.M. models to get the same low rate on the purchase of their next G.M. vehicle. So even if you buy a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu or Pontiac Grand Prix today with a three-year no-interest loan, then hit the lottery and can afford a Cadillac or Saab, you can still buy a more expensive G.M. vehicle with a second three-year loan at no interest, as long as you make the deal before the first loan expires. 
 The exception is the Hummer, which will go only as low as 5.9 percent under the Lock 'n' Roll plan.
 Enter Ms. Orman, the Oprah Winfrey of financial planning. 
 She addresses the camera while walking from what looks like the lobby of a big bank to a Chevrolet S.U.V. parked on the street. 
 ''What do they mean when they talk about the smart money? In my opinion, it's how you spend it,'' she says, and goes on to outline the deal. ''Even if interest rates go through the roof, you will be protected.'' 
 A print ad for newspapers and magazines asks, simply, ''What's better than 0% APR on your next new car? 0% APR on your next one too.''
 The offer started yesterday and lasts through the rest of November. It was timed to coincide with Wednesday's announcement by the Federal Reserve Bank that it was raising interest rates by a quarter point. The advertising campaign was developed by the Troy, Mich., office of McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 Such a deal ''has never been done in this industry,'' said Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s marketing chief, adding that customers could lock in a no-interest loan for ''a product four or five years from now that is hot as a firecracker.''
 There are currently no interest-free deals longer than three years on 2005 models, though loans on 2004 models extend longer. But buyers can get rates as low as 3.9 percent for five-year loans on many 2005 models. A Lock 'n' Roll buyer can arrange a package of two loans, with each loan up to five years. 
 Mr. LaNeve declined to say how much the company was spending on the campaign, but said it ''will run everywhere, prime time, during football games, cable.''
 ''We'll do insertions in national papers. It will be prevalent.''
 Mr. LaNeve was until recently the head of G.M.'s Cadillac brand, which used the Led Zeppelin song, ''Rock 'n' Roll,'' in its commercials. He said the approach for ''Lock 'n' Roll'' would be less flashy and more focused on the deal. 
 ''We think we're in an environment over the next two-year window where interest rates will go up,'' Mr. LaNeve said. ''We've been in a period of historically low interest rates. What we're saying is we have incredibly aggressive rates right now on our new products and we're going to assume the risk of any interest rate increases out into the future.''
 The campaign is the latest from G.M. in a wave of deals that have sent incentive spending in Detroit soaring through the sunroof. The deal-making began shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, when G.M. began its ''Keep America Rolling'' campaign to resuscitate dormant auto sales. That brought the first wave of no-interest financing offers, which the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group promptly matched.
 Recently, G.M. briefly offered no-interest financing deals on many loans as long as six years to clear out an excess inventory of 2004 models. The company has also been trying more unusual promotions now that the novelty of the straight no-interest deal has worn off; in one, the company recently gave away 276 of its new Pontiac G6 sedans to each person in the studio audience of Oprah Winfrey's television show. 
 Many financial analysts worry that G.M.'s retail market share has fallen this year, even as its incentive spending has continued to rise. Already, its spending is substantially higher than foreign-based competitors like Toyota. 
 ''It's a business cost that they're going to have to absorb and put reserves aside for,'' said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, referring to Lock 'n' Roll. ''If interest rates go up two points over the next couple of years, that's two percentage points they have to reserve against to cover the shortfall. It's potentially a profit nibbler, not a buster, down the line.''
 Mr. Spinella's firm surveyed more than 2,000 people last Tuesday about the program and found that buyers of luxury vehicles and small-business owners shopping for large pickup trucks were the most likely to be interested.

HEADLINE: Hard Choices but No Overall Plan on 9/11 Rebuilding

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
WHAT does it mean to rebuild Lower Manhattan?
 Does it mean investing above all in the World Trade Center site, on the theory that a big office project with memorial and cultural facets would be a lodestar for downtown?
 Or does it mean investing first and foremost in regional transportation, on the theory that if suburban residents -- Long Islanders, in particular -- cannot get to jobs downtown more easily, few large employers will be interested in staying or moving there?
 Or does it mean investing before anything else in the existing neighborhood, through subsidies for affordable housing and aid to small businesses and the construction of schools and libraries and parks, on the theory that Lower Manhattan's best chance for recovery is as a diverse commercial and residential area? 
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation might like to answer ''all of the above,'' but as a practical matter, choices will have to be made among these approaches as the pot of federal money grows smaller. With the board's decision yesterday to authorize $44.5 million to acquire an additional parcel for the trade center site, there is now roughly $825 million to allocate, from the original $2.783 billion.
 Because competing demands far exceed the available grants, there is a growing sense that each decision to finance one project effectively starves another. But the corporation has not articulated an overall spending plan beyond saying that it seeks the most effect for the dollars it invests. Allocations are made as needed.
 Now on the horizon is the prospect that the corporation will be asked by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, to pick up part of what might be a $1 billion price tag for underground infrastructure: the vehicle screening area, ramps, roadways and loading docks for the office towers, the memorial, the PATH station and the cultural buildings.
 Yesterday, in an unusual address to the board by an outsider, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver laid out his own priorities for the remaining money, while bemoaning what he called the competition between commercial development downtown and development on the far West Side.
 Mr. Silver, a Democrat whose Assembly district includes much of Lower Manhattan, said his first priority is a seamless rail link between downtown and Long Island to help attract and keep the jobs needed to fill the towers that are planned in and around the trade center site. ''Before we create millions and millions of square feet of additional office space, we ought to think about filling this space up,'' Mr. Silver said after the meeting.
 HE asked the board to consider the need for schools, a community center and libraries; economic development incentives for Chinatown; and $70 million to finish the Hudson River Park in TriBeCa. And he called for more local representatives on the 12-member corporation board than the two who currently play that role.
 Mr. Silver also said he opposed giving any money to the Port Authority until it accounted for what it had already received from the federal government, from its insurers and from Silverstein Properties, the commercial leaseholder.
 In response, the Port Authority said that federal money and insurance proceeds related to the World Trade Center complex were either reinvested in the site or used to pay the agency's relocation costs. The $109 million annual rent from Silverstein supports general operations and capital spending.
 Because the underground security areas and roadways will be shared by all users (the authority estimated that 75 percent of the traffic in the first phase of redevelopment would come from tour buses), Roland W. Betts, a board member, said the development corporation was obliged to help finance it. He also said the corporation should make a significant contribution -- on the order of several hundred million dollars -- to jump-start private fund-raising for the memorial and cultural projects.
 But Mr. Betts also said the spending ought to be done within more of a framework. ''We have a finite amount of money left,'' he said, ''and it would be irresponsible of the L.M.D.C. not to have a master plan for the money. And I'm confident that we can do this.''
 ''You need to know what's in your checkbook,'' Mr. Betts said.

HEADLINE: Incredible Hulks, Enticing the Young

BYLINE: By LOCKHART STEELE

 BODY:
THE hallways are as dingy as can be, with yellow paint flaking onto beat-up tile floors. In the bare lobbies, elderly residents shuffle between elevators and front doors. Outside, cracked concrete paths wind among patches of lawn, the massive forms of the buildings hulking above.
 By all appearances this place -- the Cooperative Village, a collection of undistinguished red-brick towers strung along the eastern reaches of Grand Street on the Lower East Side -- is one that only a grandmother could love, the last place anyone would expect fresh design activity. Unlikely as it may seem, however, the towers are quietly evolving into something of a design laboratory as a wave of younger residents move in and remake these overlooked relics of midcentury Manhattan real estate one apartment at a time.
 Set just south of the Williamsburg Bridge, where lower Manhattan bulges into the East River, apartments in Co-op Village were unavailable on the open market until 2000. Now that they are in play, the towers' ungainly appearance only seems to increase their offbeat appeal. ''Granted, it looks so institutional,'' said Carol Markel, an artist who bought a one-bedroom apartment with her husband last year. ''But I like that. In a way it proves your creativity.'' 
 Pioneers include Richard Fortus, a guitarist for Guns N' Roses, who moved in last year, officially stamping Co-op Village with the sheen of hipness. He was followed by SuChin Pak, an MTV news correspondent, who is renovating a one-bedroom she bought in July, and Gary Shteyngart, a novelist, who just closed on a one-bedroom.
 ''You get such a mix: all these young hipsters and the Hasids and the modern Orthodox,'' said Mr. Shteyngart, author of ''The Russian Debutante's Handbook'' (Riverhead Books, 2002). ''The buildings could be a crossbreeding experiment.''
 Built between 1930 and 1960 by trade unions, Co-op Village offered the union members a chance to buy apartments below market rates. Later the same opportunity was extended to nonmembers, but eventually the waiting list ran to 10 years or more. There was of course a catch: owners who wanted out were required to sell their shares back to the co-op at little or no profit, negating any chance of a real-estate killing.
 That changed in the late 1990's when, like manna from heaven, residents were granted full ownership of their apartments. As the apartments underwent deregulation from 1997 to 2000, price caps kept owners from flooding the market in a rush to cash out. Prices have more than doubled in the last two years, said Jacob Goldman, the owner of LoHo Realty, which specializes in sales in Co-op Village, but they are still a relative bargain for the mix of artists and hipsters (and a smattering of Wall Street types) who would otherwise have to go to Williamsburg or Clinton Hill in Brooklyn, or even beyond, to find comparable square footage at the same prices.
 ''On the outside they are ugly,'' said Dana Menusi, 31, a fashion and design photographer who bought an apartment in 2001. ''They look like cheap projects.'' No matter. The appeal lies in the interior, where behind decades of paint, wallpaper and dated moldings the original clean lines are ripe for revival.
 Of the four tower complexes, Amalgamated Dwellings, built before World War II, and Hillman Houses, built soon after, had prewar detailing. The new class of design-minded buyers tend to gravitate to the newer complexes, Seward Park Houses and East River Housing, designed in the 1950's by Herman J. Jessor, an architect known for middle-income housing. Jessor eschewed prewar detailing in favor of a more austere look.
 ''There's an astringent, economic efficiency to these apartments -- not a lot of bells and whistles -- and very straight lines,'' said Stacey Jacovini, the principal in Ascape, a TriBeCa design firm, who oversaw the renovation of a one-bedroom last year for Ms. Markel and her husband, Richard Cramer. ''When you take off the shag carpet, the pink paint and the moldings, which we did,'' Ms. Jacovini said, ''and raise the door heights and open up part of the walls, the rooms become more of a modern space.''
 Margot Perman, 42, a graphic designer who bought a one-bedroom place in a Seward Park tower last year with her husband, Jurgen Riehle, also 42, said they were impressed by the views of the East River and the Midtown skyline, which were enhanced by the clever angling of the buildings just off the surrounding street grid.
 Working with Ronnette Riley, a Manhattan architect, Ms. Perman and Mr. Riehle remade their boxy interior as a single space. ''It seemed like there were walls everywhere,'' Ms. Perman said.
 Ms. Riley's plans called for a larger master bedroom with space borrowed from a set of closets the couple decided they could live without. A wall between the eat-in kitchen and the living room was removed, creating an open living area with views to the north and east.
 The day the couple closed on the apartment, Ms. Perman learned that she was pregnant. So Ms. Riley altered the plans to include a pint-size baby's bedroom in the very middle of the apartment, now home to their 1-year-old son, Anton.
 To echo the contemporary feel of the remade space, Mr. Riehle, who was raised in Karlsruhe, Germany, scoured eBay's German Web site (www.ebay.de) in search of midcentury furnishings that had not yet surfaced on eBay's main site. His finds included four original Egon Eiermann chairs from the 1960's ($600 for the group).
 One advantage of the towers, residents have discovered, is their proximity to inexpensive furnishings outlets on the Lower East Side. Ms. Menusi, the photographer, bought a sofa at Las Venus on Ludlow Street and had it re-covered with a fabric she found on Orchard Street. Master Kitchen Supplies, a store on Chrystie Street that specializes in custom work, designed sinks, countertops and a kitchen cart for her, all in stainless steel and all for less than $10,000.
 Like many newcomers, Karen Skurka, a real estate broker, stumbled upon Co-op Village almost by accident and snapped up a two-bedroom for $290,000 in 2002. She hired a design firm called the Apartment, which also runs a home furnishings store on Crosby Street, to turn her run-down rooms into an otherworldy white environment with modular furnishings and floors covered in white epoxy. Stefan Boublil, a partner in the Apartment, called it ''a livable iPod.''
 Mr. Shteyngart, 32, was living in Italy last spring, watching online as prices for Co-op Village apartments went up roughly $20,000 a month. ''I should have bought before I left,'' he said. ''I decided I would fly in and just buy something on the spot.'' So he did: a one-bedroom on the sixth floor of a 20-story building. ''Of course I could have bought a two-bedroom penthouse for the same money eight months earlier,'' he added.
 Newcomers like Mr. Shteyngart find themselves in a place that is growing oddly divided between young and old. ''I have a large percentage of seniors who come from a socialist background who built these buildings,'' said Heshey Jacob, 60, general manager of Co-op Village. ''But I also make it my business to understand what the young families want.''
 Nodding to younger tastes, Mr. Jacob installed gyms and bike rooms. But the old-timers won the thermostat wars. When energy-efficient windows were installed in East River Housing several years ago, temperature levels in the apartments shot up.
 ''The older people love it because the apartments are warmer, but the younger people are screaming that we give too much heat,'' Mr. Jacob said.
 When Amy Letterman, 33, a media planner, bought an apartment in 1995 -- her father already owned one and had put her name on the waiting list when she was 12 -- she was met with skepticism. ''When I moved in, it was 75 percent senior citizens,'' she said. ''I really stuck out. One old lady didn't believe I could actually be moving in: she thought I was stealing things. I had to have the guard tell her, 'No, she really is moving in.' ''
 Despite the generation gap, residents agree that there is a rare spirit of community.
 ''It's a new kind of extended family,'' said Noah Wildman, 33, a graphic designer who is among the most prolific participants in an online message board for residents. ''The really old ones are unfriendly, always complaining that it's too cold. But some I do enjoy talking to. My next-door neighbor asks for my help reading her medications, and there's one large Orthodox family on my floor who are very cool.''
 Erin Mulvey, 27, a financial analyst who bought a one-bedroom last year for $230,000, said she found the eccentricities a welcome change from her previous building on the Upper East Side. ''We got a gym, and now all the old ladies work out there as well,'' she said. ''You see Orthodox women in long skirts on the treadmills.''
 Like other newcomers, Ms. Mulvey has adjusted to the Saturday practice of rigging one elevator so that it stops on every floor, an accommodation to the sizable Orthodox Jewish population that strictly observes the Sabbath. While pushing an elevator button is prohibited on the Sabbath under religious law, stepping into and out of an elevator is permitted.
 The rise in prices is unlikely to stop the flow of newcomers, though the balance may tip toward a more affluent crowd. Still, younger residents who have discovered Co-op Village have come to see it as more than just a stopping-off place before trading up or leaving New York City.
 On a recent evening, as the sun set and the Chrysler Building twinkled on the Midtown skyline, Ms. Perman and Mr. Riehle prepared to tuck their son in for the night.
 ''The hallway still needs to be redone,'' Ms. Perman said, ''but we're patient. We're not going anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Record Exports Help Bring U.S. Trade Deficit Down a Bit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit shrank to $51.6 billion in September, as exports posted their best month on record.
 In another report, new claims for jobless benefits rose last week by 2,000, to 333,000, the Labor Department said. Even with the increase, the level of claims pointed to a recovery in the jobs market, analysts said. 
 The latest snapshot of trade activity, reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, came after the deficit had grown to $53.5 billion in August -- the second-highest level ever registered. The September trade deficit represented a 3.7 percent reduction from August.
 The deficit in September turned out to be smaller than the roughly $53 billion or $54 billion deficit that some economists were forecasting. 
 ''It's a modest positive in what remains a disturbing story'' of big trade deficits, said Clifford Waldman, economist at Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research group.
 Exports of goods and services grew to a record $97.5 billion in September, a 0.8 percent increase from August. Exports were helped by a weaker dollar, which makes United States goods cheaper to foreign buyers, and improved foreign demand.
 Imports dipped by 0.8 percent in September, to $149 billion. Even with the drop, imports of goods and services were still the second best on record, a testimony to Americans' appetite for foreign items.
 America's politically sensitive trade deficit with China hit a record $15.5 billion as imports from the country also reached a high. United States manufacturers claim China's currency policies give Chinese companies a big competitive advantage. The Bush administration has been pressing Beijing to let the value of its currency, the yuan, be set in open markets.
 The United States trade deficit with Japan, however, narrowed in September, to $6.1 billion, and with Canada to $5.3 billion.
 On the imports side, sales of foreign-made foods, industrial supplies and consumer goods dipped in September from August. But sales of foreign-made autos, parts and engines totaled a record $19.4 billion. Imports of capital goods, like drilling equipment, came to $29.5 billion, the highest since December 2000.

HEADLINE: New York's Working Poor Are Losing Ground, Report Says

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
More than a quarter of the working families in New York State are so poor that they cannot cover necessities like rent and child care, according to a new study of poverty in the region.
 The study, by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit liberal research group that focuses on economic and neighborhood issues, said the number of low-income families in the state increased by 2.7 percent during the boom of the 1990's, at a time when the number was falling in the rest of the nation.
 The reasons for the increase, the report's authors said, include the large numbers of both immigrants in the state and people who have left the welfare rolls. While New York provides generous benefits for the working poor in the form of tax credits and health insurance, the report said, its unfocused economic planning has led to the creation of low-paying jobs and inadequate higher education opportunities for working people and people with limited English skills. 
 ''Working families in New York are rapidly losing ground,'' said Karen Schimke, president of the Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy, an organization based in Albany that was a co-author of the report. ''More and more people in our state are working long and hard but not making enough to pay the bills. While educated New Yorkers are doing better than ever, we're seeing a transformation of the working class into the new working poor.''
 The report defines a working poor family as one in which at least one member of the household works full time, or works part time and has looked for full-time work in the last six months, and earns up to twice the national poverty rate. (The rate is defined as $18,979 for a family of four in 2003.) Although New York has roughly 550,000 such families, it still ranks only 29th out of 50 states when the families are measured as a percentage of total population.
 Still, New York has many more working-poor families than neighboring states -- in New Jersey, for example, only 17.4 percent of working families fall in that category. And 32 percent of New York's citizens are in the lowest-wage jobs, the fourth largest percentage in the nation, according to the report, which is based on 2002 census data and other public documents. 
 The authors say the state offers too little money for part-time students seeking higher educational degrees and too few programs for immigrants and the illiterate wanting to gain proficiency in English.
 John Mogulescu, senior dean for academic affairs at City University of New York, agreed that financing for more of such programs would be ideal, but faulted the report for looking for ''simplistic cures.'' Too many New Yorkers, he said, were so far behind that helping even a small percentage gain higher education degrees was ''a major investment.''
 He said structural changes in the job market are needed to help working families pay their bills.

HEADLINE: Fed Raises Interest Rate A 4th Time, To 2 Percent

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, and suggested that it would continue to raise them gradually through much of next year.
 The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter point, to 2 percent, a move that was widely expected.
 Saying that monetary policy is still ''accommodative,'' the central bank repeated its assertion of the last several months that it would continue to raise short-term rates at a ''measured pace'' from their historic lows earlier this year. The stock market had little reaction, with the three main gauges trading slightly lower. Bond prices fell on the possibility of further rate increases. 
 ''Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices,'' the Fed said in a statement announcing its decision. ''Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.''
 The statement suggested that officials felt no need to retreat from the Fed's strategy of gradually raising interest rates, and provided no hint of a pause in December that many analysts have been expecting.
 At the same time, the emphasis on low inflation pressures indicated that officials thought they could take their time if, as many forecasters predict, economic growth slows sharply next year.
 ''It's ambiguous enough that it can be spun in any direction to support your view,'' said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup.
 By historical standards, interest rates are still far below normal levels. After adjusting for inflation, the ''real'' federal funds rate is barely equal to zero after being solidly negative for the last two years.
 On average, the federal funds rate has been about three percentage points above the rate of inflation. Most analysts think a normal or neutral rate under today's circumstances would be about 4 percent.
 But members of the Federal Open Market Committee have warned against formulaic approaches. 
 ''I believe it to be very important that the F.O.M.C. not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate,'' Roger W. Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech on Oct. 29.
 Job creation, which had been very sluggish this summer and was a lingering worry for the Federal Reserve, appears to have surged by 337,000 jobs in October and to have been stronger than previously thought during August and September.
 But most forecasters believe economic growth will slow from its current rate of about 4 percent this year, and some predict that it will slow to nearly 3 percent next year.
 Among other factors, higher oil prices are expected to be a drag on consumer spending. The jolt from last year's tax cuts has now mostly played out, and homeowners are no longer taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance mortgages and take cash out of their homes.
 The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other top officials have also noted that business executives remain more cautious about investment than is usually the case in an economic recovery, and they had been counting on business investment to be a principal source of growth.
 The Federal Reserve's most recent beige book, a summary of anecdotal reports about the economy from around the country, suggested that oil prices were pinching both consumer and business spending.
 Businesses ''modestly increased'' capital spending and hiring, the Fed said, and ''businesses in most districts continued to express concern over the rising cost of energy and other inputs.''
 The biggest uncertainties, aside from the possibility of a terrorist attack, are about the huge United States trade deficit and the prospects for a significant fall in the value of the dollar.
 The trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday, but the deficit has widened by about 25 percent over the last year and is expected to widen further in the months ahead as a result of high oil prices. 
 Higher trade deficits subtract from domestic economic growth, and they have also led to a staggering increase in the United States' overall indebtedness to the rest of the world, which is now ballooning by more than $600 billion a year.
 Laurence H. Meyer, chief economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, predicted that the economy would expand at a rapid rate of 4 percent next year, but said he had trimmed his forecast slightly to account for a slower growth in net exports. 
 At the same time, he predicted, consumer spending will be restrained as stimulus from President Bush's tax cuts declines and as people cling more tightly to their pocketbooks.
 ''The Fed is in a tough spot,'' said Peter Morici, professor of economics at the University of Maryland. ''It has established expectations that it will increase interest rates further, and there's a lot of experience showing that it's bad to frustrate expectations. On the other hand, there is evidence that the economy is in trouble.''
 Fed officials are more sanguine, with Mr. Greenspan still predicting that the economy simply entered a temporary ''soft patch'' this summer. Fed officials also feel they have room to maneuver, because inflation remains very low. 
 The Fed's unofficial rule is that inflation, excluding volatile sectors like food and energy, should not increase more than about 2 percent a year.
 The Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy, is up about 2 percent this year. But the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the Commerce Department's deflator for personal consumer expenditures, shows the core rate of inflation at 1.5 percent.

There are no uniforms for these battles, nor are the casualties particularly heavy this time around. They are certainly not the focus of attention at a new $16 million, 18,200-square-foot exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. 
 But there are signs of scarring, if not open wounds, and they affect the impact of this permanent exhibition, which opens on Veterans Day. The exhibition is ''The Price of Freedom: Americans at War'' and is billed as this country's first comprehensive exhibition of its military history, and is a major step in the redesign of the Smithsonian. 
 It is astonishing that something like this has not been done before. With David Allison as its curator and Christopher Chadbourne and Associates as the designer, the exhibition is an ambitious, if flawed, chronological account of American wars, beginning with the French and Indian War and ending with the war in Iraq. There are 850 objects on view, ranging from George Washington's sword and scabbard to a restored Huey helicopter used in Vietnam. 
 Uniforms, furniture, documents, weapons, photographs, videos, dioramas, first-person accounts, explanatory panels and allusions to controversies all punctuate a guided narrative, which begins near an ersatz tree in which a Revolutionary-era ''tax collector'' is hanged in effigy. The chronology ends near pieces of twisted, rusted metal from the World Trade Center and a pack of ''Iraqi Most Wanted'' playing cards. 
 But the behind-the-scenes battles in the construction of this exhibition may have given it a split personality. These battles were over the nature of the national museum, over how American history should be portrayed, and over who gets to tell the story. These issues haunted the Smithsonian in the 1990's, in controversies over exhibitions about the atomic bomb, sweatshops, slave life and Freudian theories. 
 In this most recent show, could anything less be expected, given topics that include American Indian wars, the cold war, Vietnam and war in Iraq? All of these continue to spur political confrontation. 
 Only in this latest exhibition, the controversies may have left their mark in advance. In July, for example, Katherine Ott, the chairwoman of the American history branch of the Smithsonian Congress of Scholars, wrote the museum's management arguing that including Iraq in ''The Price of Freedom'' exhibition ''presents a partisan view of the current war and is counter to our neutral public mission.'' 
 The Iraq display, it turns out, is careful to note that after major combat operations ''coalition units remained entangled in a controversial effort to establish an Iraqi democracy.'' Allusion to controversy becomes a substitute for explaining it. 
 This is a minor problem in a contemporary portion of the show, which will, no doubt, be changing. It is more of a problem when trying to make sense of historical events. 
 In museum controversies of the 1990's, critics feared that the exhibitions would lean too far to the left. 
 Before this exhibition, the fear of critics and historians was that it would lean too far right, because of its hortatory title and because the exhibition was financed with an $80 million donation from the real estate developer Kenneth E. Behring. Mr. Behring explained that he wanted to emphasize how many have paid the ''ultimate price'' for American freedom.
 Accusations about Mr. Behring's undue influence on the exhibition were made (and denied), spurred partly because of a controversy over another donor's attempts to influence an exhibition. 
 The secretary of the Smithsonian, Lawrence M. Small, has also inspired controversy with his solicitation of corporate donors. Such debated helped lead to the creation of a Blue Ribbon Commission, which included historians, to analyze the National Museum of American History. Their report, delivered in 2002, included a withering criticism of the museum for its cramped incoherence, challenging it to remake itself as a national history museum that could begin to reflect strands of the past not on display: histories of immigration, struggles for freedom, the development of capitalism, the evolution of diversity, the influence of religion.
 The issues mentioned in the commission report are almost all reflected here. Some historians, the report noted, argue that history should focus on heroic individuals; others prefer social and economic forces. Some suggest that American history should celebrate American achievements; others are more interested in failures and frailties. The commission challenged the museum to ''attend fairly to divergent frameworks.'' 
 In this exhibition neither pole is fully present and a synthesis never fully takes place. The artifacts tend to emphasize the heroism of figures like George Washington, but there is little discussion of his achievement other than his renunciation of leadership after the war and his insistence on the civilian control of the military. 
 Apparently, in compensation for the show's overall de-emphasis of individual heroism, a display at its conclusion is devoted to soldiers who have won the Medal of Honor.
 There is also tension about how the exhibition treats war's suffering. The close-standing formations of Revolutionary-era soldiers, it is explained, ''kept scared soldiers marching forward while those beside them exploded in blood.'' This is a bit overdone, though a display of photographs of the mutilated bodies of Civil War survivors is haunting and historically suggestive, for such wounds influenced the development of American nursing and surgery. 
 Perhaps because the particular lessons are ambiguous, the educational enterprise is also oddly undeveloped; it can easily swerve into pandering or pointlessness. A cake of lye soap, for example, is mounted in a cylinder, challenging young viewers to decide who would have used it in the Revolutionary War; the cylinder must be ''interactively'' turned to reveal the answer: women doing laundry.
 But more important is the exhibition's difficulty in establishing proportion. World War II seems reduced to miscellaneous impressions. The exhibition is dominated by a Willys jeep and a life-size model of G.I. barracks, but also includes battle photographs, war posters, references to the Japanese internment and descriptions of strategy. Wartime leaders shrink in size. The struggle starts to seem less significant than its social results and its aftermath, even though this war, on its own, earned the exhibition's title.
 Contemporary perspectives loom extraordinarily large, like the shadows from a hand held up to a flashlight. The Vietnam War, for example, is treated as one of the United States' four major military conflicts (along with the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and World War II). That may be more because of its continuing impact on American politics than because of its long-term importance. What if it had been integrated into a longer cold war narrative about the failures and successes in that half-century conflict? Even now, a major display about the Vietnam War is just a timeline of photographs chronicling the 60's and early 70's, punctuated with postings of American troop strength in Vietnam. There is more sensation than context. 
 Any historical survey can be open to similar challenges, but there is a curious sense that the results are remnants of long-fought battles and compromises. By the end it is unclear just what price is being paid and what is being fought for until one hears, in a closing video, the final words of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Then, one almost wants to start again, from the beginning.

HEADLINE: A Former Viking Joins the Giants

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Chuck Wiley stood in the Giants' locker room Wednesday in front of a blank nameplate, wearing practice clothes fresh out of a box. He could look one locker to his left to absorb the reason for his arrival, but Wiley might need a little time to sort through the strange series of events that vaulted him here.
 Only two weeks ago, Wiley lined up across the line of scrimmage from many of the Giants he is now meeting as his new teammates. He played defensive end for the Minnesota Vikings on Oct. 31, experiencing the Giants' 34-13 victory as a difficult loss. Two days later, he found out that the Vikings were cutting him to make roster room for running back Onterrio Smith to return from a drug suspension. 
 With defensive ends Michael Strahan and Keith Washington lost for the year, the Giants pulled Wiley out of the unemployment line, pulled safety Omar Stoutmire's name off a locker (he is out for the season, too) and handed Wiley his new clothes.
 ''It's crazy,'' Wiley said. ''Yesterday was a long day. I worked out for Jacksonville, and it turned out they didn't make a move. And then I got a call to come to New York. Now here I am.''
 For the Giants, the repercussions go much deeper than Wiley's quick change of allegiance.
 Now trying to prepare for a bounce-back game at Arizona on Sunday, the team is dealing with the injuries, particularly to Strahan. Defensive tackle Norman Hand, not normally the voluble type, stood up in a meeting and told his teammates they needed to rally in their missing comrades' absence.
 ''Mike is the heart and soul of our team, our defense,'' receiver Ike Hilliard said. ''It's unfortunate, but the show must go on. He will be there in spirit, I'm sure. But it's tough. We will miss him.''
 Strahan's corner locker, normally a hub of activity centered around his booming laugh, was quiet Wednesday as he was undergoing surgery on his torn pectoral muscle. The attention had shifted to the left and right of his spot, with the introduction of Wiley, who moved into Stoutmire's old locker, and defensive end Osi Umenyiora, Strahan's left-hand neighbor.
 That the spotlight will shift to Umenyiora, a second-round draft pick from 2003, is natural. He will start in Washington's spot and move into a far more significant role. Until now, the Giants could groom him more slowly, use him to take advantage of his pass-rushing skills while he developed his play against the run. The defensive line had that luxury because it was the team's deepest position.
 ''Over the last couple of weeks, I've been in there a lot more and I have been playing a lot more snaps, so it's kind of like I've been preparing for this situation anyway, so I'll be good,'' Umenyiora said. ''But yeah, there's definitely a lot more pressure on me because I'm going to be in there from the beginning, not just coming in on nickel and dime situations.''
 The Giants will also get some help from Lorenzo Bromell, a seventh-year veteran signed as a free agent in the off-season before he sustained a knee injury. Bromell was activated from the physically unable to perform list and said he hoped to contribute right away.
 ''I'm still going to be a little rusty, but experience and wisdom should carry me,'' Bromell said. ''I'm just anxious to get out there.''
 Eager would be a better word to describe Wiley's attitude. Like Bromell, Wiley has been around the league, playing the past two and a half seasons with Minnesota after two years in Atlanta and one in Carolina after missing his rookie season there with a torn Achilles' tendon. 
 Now he finds himself in Giants blue and trying to make the most of it, despite being startled by his release from the Vikings.
 ''The only thing I can do is be myself,'' he said. ''I can't replace Michael Strahan. All I can do is come in here, do my job, do what I'm told to do, help the team win.''

EXTRA POINTS
 The Giants should have center Shaun O'Hara back this week after he missed two games with a staph infection in his leg. Tackle Luke Petitgout was also cleared to practice, without contact, after he had a concussion in Sunday's game. Running back Mike Cloud, who has been Tiki Barber's primary backup, may miss the game with a back injury, and a similar injury is limiting tight end Marcellus Rivers.

HEADLINE: In Health Care, Gap Between Rich and Poor Persists, W.H.O. Says

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Despite significant gains in medical science, disparities in public health persist between rich and poor countries, the World Health Organization said in a report released here on Wednesday. 
 The report, released in advance of a W.H.O. meeting here next week of health ministers from 30 countries, called for more research into how health care is delivered. . 
 ''Half of the world's deaths could be prevented with simple and cost-effective interventions,'' said the report. ''But not enough is known about how to make these more widely available to the people who need them,'' it continued. 
 The study said that inadequate health systems in developing countries had been a constraint in global programs to fights AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. ''Countries with few resources struggle with creaking infrastructure, inadequate financing, migrating doctors and nurses and lack of basic information on health indicators,'' the study's authors concluded.
 The study pointed to market reforms in the health sector, promoted by the World Bank in the 1980's, as one reason for steadily weakening public health systems in developing countries. The push toward privatization might have accentuated disparities in the health care available to rich and poor, the report said. 
 It also pointed to ''gross inequities in the research process at both global and national levels'' and said treatments in the developing world must be tailored to local conditions.
 For example, the report cited a study in Haiti that found that babies born to mothers treated with antiretroviral drugs to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. might then die of congenital syphilis. 
 A second report released here on Wednesday, by the Global Forum for Health Research, a Geneva-based nonprofit group, found that spending on health research rose from $84.9 billion in 1998 to $105.9 billion in 2001.
 Despite this, there has been little headway in closing the gap between rich and poor countries in financing for research into the infectious diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries, like malaria and tuberculosis, the report said. 
 The Global Forum, which will hold its own meeting parallel to the W.H.O. conference, said that less than 10 percent of spending on health research goes to study 90 percent of the world's diseases. 
 ''Very few infectious diseases are getting sufficient attention,'' said Stephen Matlin, the group's executive director. ''They remain neglected diseases.''
 Pharmaceutical companies account for 48 percent of the spending for medical research, reflecting in part the increased cost of bringing a drug to market. The public sector, led by rising budgets at the National Institutes of Health in the United States, spends 44 percent of all research funds. Private foundations and universities account for the other 8 percent. 
 Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to release information about their research, Mr. Matlin said, but the evidence is that much of their spending goes to developing therapies for noncommunicable diseases prevalent in wealthier countries. 
 Mr. Matlin pointed to mergers that have left the industry in the hands of a few companies and speculated that ''it may be that larger companies are getting less innovative.'' 
 ''Our direct concern is to see an increase in spending on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries and to change priorities,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Station Offers Gas, Snacks and Hydrogen

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
At an ordinary filling station about a mile east of the Capitol that has the usual selection of regular, premium and diesel at the pumps and chewing gum and soda next to the cash register, Shell Oil and General Motors are offering hydrogen.
 For $1.99 a kilogram, drivers can choose liquid hydrogen, chilled to nearly 300 degrees below zero, or gaseous hydrogen, at 500 pounds per square inch of pressure. That amount of hydrogen, when burned, produces about the same amount of energy as a gallon of regular unleaded gas, which was also selling for $1.99 on Wednesday. 
 In a fuel cell, which converts hydrogen to electric current without combustion, a kilo of hydrogen could take a car twice as far as a gallon of gasoline. But at the moment the car itself would cost more than $100,000. 
 That is one reason there will not be much of a wait at the new pump soon. For now there are only six hydrogen-powered vehicles likely to use the pump -- a small fleet that General Motors is lending to a rotating set of people it hopes will be influential in helping a new technology flourish. While this is not the first hydrogen fuel pump in the country, it is the first integrated into a gas station.
 At a cost of about $2 million to install, the new pump has no prospect of making money in the short term. But the two companies hope it is the first in a chain that will extend from here to New York, and eventually, all over the country. 
 Before that could happen, several major questions would have to be resolved. For one, the cost of the fuel cell would have to be cut by about 90 percent to make it economically competitive with a conventional gasoline engine. 
 The source of the hydrogen is another issue. For this pilot project, the hydrogen is produced at a chemical plant in Canada by exposing the methane in natural gas to high-temperature steam and extracting the hydrogen. Then the hydrogen is chilled into a liquid and brought here by a truck that resembles a thermos. 
 Hydrogen is produced in many places, including oil refineries and chemical plants, but it is normally used where it is produced because it is difficult to ship. It can be made in small batches in remote locations using electricity, but environmentalists say making the electricity may hurt the environment more than the fuel cell helps it. The cell itself produces electricity with no byproducts, except pure water and a bit of waste heat.
 Another problem is the flammability of the gas. About two dozen protesters, who said they were fearful of a fire, carried signs on Wednesday accusing Shell and G.M. of environmental racism for having chosen a site in a black neighborhood. An organizer pointed out that the station was adjacent to an elementary school. 
 But the mayor of Washington, Anthony A. Williams, said at an opening ceremony at the pump: ''This is a good thing, unless I'm missing something.'' And Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, called the opening ''a real step in the transition from the carbon-based economy of the past to the hydrogen economy of the future.''

HEADLINE: Iran in Deadlock With Europe on Halting Production of Uranium

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Iran and European negotiators have become deadlocked in their effort to reach a final agreement for Iran to suspend its production of enriched uranium in exchange for possible economic and political incentives, European officials said Wednesday.
 After marathon negotiations in Paris last Friday and Saturday, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, optimistically announced that his government had reached a ''preliminary agreement'' with senior negotiators of France, Germany, Britain and the European Union, but he emphasized that any suspension of uranium enrichment would be temporary.
 The Europeans were more cautious, saying in public that progress had been made in the talks while acknowledging in private the existence of unresolved issues. 
 Those issues may mean the unraveling of an agreement intended to stave off a confrontation with Iran at a crucial meeting with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog organization, in Vienna on Nov. 25.
 ''They came back to the Europeans for more and the Europeans frankly said, 'No, a deal is a deal and that is that,''' a Vienna-based diplomat said. 
 At the November meeting, the countries that make up the leadership of the agency could decide to let the United States proceed with a still vague but serious proposal to refer Iran to the Security Council for possible sanctions. Iran has consistently denied the Americans' accusations that it has a secret program to build nuclear bombs under the cover of a civilian nuclear energy program.
 One outstanding issue is highly technical but considered important by the Europeans. They have demanded that Iran stop its program to convert raw uranium into uranium tetrafluoride. Uranium tetrafluoride is a precursor to the form of uranium that is fed into centrifuges to enrich it for use as fuel that can be used either for peaceful purposes or to develop nuclear weapons, European officials said.
 That demand goes beyond what the United Nations' watchdog agency requires, and the Iranians are arguing that they are being asked to do too much.
 Another Iranian demand, so far rejected by the Europeans, is the timing of the delivery of some rewards for Iran, including the resumption of talks on a trade agreement between the European Union and Iran, the officials said.
 Iran is also seeking precise assurances about a European offer to supply Iran with a light-water research reactor that would produce less fissionable material than could be used for making nuclear weapons, the Vienna-based diplomat added.
 Iran wants the rewards up front as a ''confidence-building measure,'' arguing that France, Germany and Britain failed to deliver the rewards it promised after Iran agreed in Tehran in October 2003 to suspend its production of enriched uranium.
 A decision for Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium is an extremely delicate political matter in Iran. The October 2003 agreement was excoriated by hard-line politicians and newspapers as proof that Iran was caving in to the Western demands and forfeiting its sovereign right to develop a peaceful nuclear program.
 Iranian presidential elections are scheduled for May, and the nuclear issue is likely to play a large role in what is expected to be a brutal political campaign.

HEADLINE: Rise and Fall of Oil Prices Result in a Mixed Forecast

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
After rising continuously over the summer and hitting a crest in late October, oil prices have fallen recently, leaving traders and analysts wondering if the downward trend is a turning point or merely a lull before demand picks up in the winter months.
 Prices rose 3.2 percent yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but they are still down 12 percent from their high of $55.67 a barrel on Oct. 25. 
 The International Energy Agency, an advisory body to oil-consuming nations, indicated yesterday that crude oil prices might have peaked. Still, the agency said in its monthly oil report, ''it is too early to tell whether these trends will continue.'' 
 ''Moreover, weather, unscheduled maintenance and logistical snags can still cause bumps in the road. But barring any major unforeseen developments, oil markets should continue to ease heading into and out of the winter,'' the agency said.
 Yesterday, crude oil for December delivery rebounded from a seven-week low, rising to $48.86 a barrel. The increase came after government figures showed that heating-oil stocks in the United States had dropped for a sixth week.
 Not everyone believes that prices have peaked. Thomas Bentz, a senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas in New York, said the increase could even signal a new bottoming of the market. ''I'm not convinced that the rally is in,'' Mr. Bentz said. 
 Prices have risen 50 percent this year, spurred by strong demand, tight production and geopolitical uncertainty in many oil-producing regions. The increase in energy costs, which also includes natural gas, gasoline and heating oil prices, could slow economic growth around the world next year.
 The agency's report underscored that point, saying that high energy prices are having an effect on oil demand as well as on economic growth. 
 ''Many countries have begun to feel the economic impact of high energy and commodity prices on their economies'' and are revising gross domestic product estimates downward, the report said. ''Consequently, we may be witnessing early signs of lagged price effects on global economic growth.''
 Demand remains robust, however, especially this year. The world is expected to consume 82.4 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2004, an increase of 2.6 million barrels from the previous year, according to the agency's latest estimates. 
 In absolute terms, the increase is equivalent to the daily production of a country like the United Arab Emirates. 
 This year's demand growth of 3.3 percent is also the biggest jump in a generation and can be attributed largely to growth in domestic consumption in the United States and in China. Next year, the agency is forecasting that global demand will grow 1.4 million barrels a day, to 83.8 million barrels.
 The recent decline in crude prices was precipitated by hedge funds, which some blame for accelerating the price spike and which have now reduced their long positions on oil futures to just 5,236 contracts, their lowest in a year, according to the agency.
 Oil prices began to rise in December 2002, when Venezuelan oil workers went on strike, shutting down the country's exports for weeks. Then disruptions in supplies occurred in Nigeria, and finally, Iraqi exports were interrupted after the March 2003 invasion.
 ''This thing goes back so far ago, I still don't know that we're done,'' said Mr. Bentz, the analyst. ''Cold winter is approaching and we haven't had time to build up inventories.''

HEADLINE: Newcomers Reinvent Denver, With a Train System

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Colo., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Mass transit systems get tougher to build as cities age and grow, planners say. But as the Denver metropolitan area begins work on one of the most ambitious urban transportation projects in the nation's history -- 120 miles on six new rail lines to be built all at once over the next 12 years -- that logic has been turned on its head. 
 Politicians and planners say that for reasons of economics and car culture, Denver could never have embarked on such an adventure in urban thinking at any imaginable time in the past.
 In the late 1990's, 644,000 people moved to Colorado from other states for jobs and a better way of life. The influx, mostly in the Denver area, created big problems. Traffic snarls multiplied, and sprawl extended out in every direction. 
 But to a great extent, politicians say, it also led to a reinvention of what Denver could be, because the newcomers who created the need for better transit also had a solution. They liked trains.
 A survey commissioned by the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation this year found that support for mass transit was in direct correlation to how long people had lived in the state. 
 Among those here 15 years or less, two out of three liked the idea, compared with about half of the people who had been here 30 years or more. The $4.7 billion transit project, called FasTracks and financed by an increase in the local sales tax, was approved by 58 percent of the region's voters on Nov. 2. 
 ''The in-migration has brought many folks who aren't saddled with conventional thinking -- that this is how we do it in the West, we all have our horses or our cars or whatever and we ride them to work,'' said Byron R. Koste, who has lived in the state eight years and is director of the Real Estate Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
 Diron Baker is another newcomer who will leave his mark on Denver transit. He came here in 2001 to attend college from Washington, D.C., where he rode the trains. He was shocked that he could not do it here.
 ''I was kind of expecting to take the light rail,'' he said. Mr. Baker now drives just about everywhere -- from his home in Lakewood, a suburb west of Denver, to school and to his job at a Denver hotel -- and does not much like it. He voted for FasTracks even though he said he would probably move away eventually, to continue his studies in Portland, Ore.
 ''I still voted for it because I think they really need it,'' he said.
 The transit package had other features that made it palatable now to voters and business leaders. The Denver of years past would not have had the derelict industrial sites on the city's fringe where some of the new train stations will be built. And when Denver was still a cow town of bawling freight yards, many of the old rail beds that the transit system will rely on were still in use.
 In other ways, though, the Denver system is a throwback to the early days of urban rail in the late 19th century, when trolley systems snaked out of cities like Denver and Boston, creating what were called streetcar suburbs. Some of Denver's new lines are meant to function precisely in that way. 
 As the rail corridors head toward Longmont, 38 miles north, for example, and to Denver International Airport, 24 miles to the northeast, they will go through land that is still mostly empty. 
 Planners expect the future growth pattern of the region -- for the 900,000 new residents expected over the next 20 years -- to be tied together by those lines in the same way that the Main Line of Philadelphia shaped its suburban enclaves like Bryn Mawr and Ardmore.
 The Denver system will have some lines of commuter rail, in which the trains run on diesel fuel, and some -- on separate tracks -- of light rail, which use electricity for power.
 ''In the early part of the 20th century, when subways and trolley lines were built, often it led to the development of new parts of the city,'' said William W. Millar, president of the American Public Transportation Association, a trade group that represents transit agencies and companies. ''Then we got away from that -- highway building in the 50's dispersed development; now in the last 15 years, communities are struggling to find their way back.''
 What distinguishes Denver, Mr. Millar said, is that it will grow up all at once with a comprehensive vision of how the parts fit together, not one line at a time, as many cities are building light rail systems. And it is pure transit, not the mixture of highway expansion and rail that many other cities are building.
 ''Outside of New York City, which is in a league by itself, this is the largest comprehensive program of expanding public transportation in the country,'' Mr. Millar said.
 In Lakewood, planners are only partly thinking about how people will move around. The equally big benefit and risk, they say, will come from the stations. A rezoning plan will be worked out in the next year to encourage what are essentially islands of high-density apartment living around at least two of the big stations, with lots of open space and pedestrian promenades integrated into the design. The goal is to create stations that are also destinations.
 Focusing development on the stations, said the city's director of community planning and development, Frank Gray, will also protect the more suburban areas along the line where residents have said they do not want things to change. Most of the Western Line that will run through Lakewood and end in Golden is to be built with a deep historic echo, Mr. Gray said. There was a trolley line on that same railbed there in the 1890's, which was later replaced by a freight line before its abandonment in the 1960's.
 Other stations, like those northeast of Denver on the Gold Line, are to be built specifically in areas that never shared the region's boom years, or that declined in the 1990's as older industries like agricultural and livestock were supplanted by financial services and technology.
 Denver's mayor, John W. Hickenlooper, said that the approval of FasTracks was a mark of recognition that Denver's future was to be shared among all the counties and communities of the region. And the very process of building it, he said, will strengthen and hone that realization. 
 But it is also a nod, he said, to the idea that Denver's future, in a way that might make older Coloradan's quail, is undeniably, permanently urban -- more akin to the big cities of the East and West Coasts than the prairie metropolis of old.
 ''It will attract urban people who love trains,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tapping the Work Ethic In Fading Rural Towns

BYLINE: By JOHN GROSSMANN

 BODY:
Across the Great Plains, farm towns are dying, their downtown shops going dark, their young people forsaking failing family farms and sputtering local economies to make a living elsewhere. Enter (or, rather, re-enter) the entrepreneurs Tom Galloway and Carl Kelly, who came back to help breathe some life into the communities of their youth. 
 Both men had witnessed from afar the slow, wrenching declines of their hometowns, and both wanted to lend a helping hand. But it was not just altruism that brought Mr. Galloway back to the sand hills of north central Nebraska or Mr. Kelly to the rolling prairie of southeast Kansas.
 Both also saw a solid business opportunity in the grit of the men and women they had left behind, who struggled to keep their farms and ranches afloat as falling commodity prices and the crush of agribusiness crippled local economies. Here was a farm-raised, self-reliant work force made to order for expanding businesses like theirs, old neighbors who possessed a traditional work ethic, openness and loyalty -- hallmarks of rural life, but traits sometimes hard to find in urban America. 
 Mr. Galloway, 41, grew up in Bassett, Neb., and was one of 40 students in a high school graduating class; now, the classes are half that size as the town has fallen to 681 residents. Like many of his classmates, he sought his future elsewhere. After a year at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, he headed for California, attended two junior colleges and, in 1988, took the first of several jobs in the computer industry between manufacturer and customer.
 He learned the ropes at these hardware and software distributors and resellers, then struck out on his own in February 2002 with Technologent in suburban Los Angeles, selling service contracts and products for Sun Microsystems. 
 As sales surged from $15 million in the first year toward $30 million in 2003, Mr. Galloway decided to open a call center. And he chose a location far from his California headquarters and his other office in Dallas: Ainsworth, Neb., a town of 1,850 people more than 250 miles from Omaha and a half-hour drive west on U.S. 20 from Bassett, his childhood hometown. There, he concluded, he could avoid one of the big frustrations common to urban call centers.
 ''It's a reality of the computer world: we hire people, train them, a year or two they're gone,'' he said. ''It's hard to keep good people. In our culture, the assets are the people, and I know the people back there are hard working and extremely ethical.''
 A credit card call center in Ainsworth had just closed, throwing 50 people out of work, Mr. Galloway said, and ''people were begging for these jobs,'' which start at $8.65 an hour and for many, have risen above $10 or $12. They also offer a benefit that can be hard to find in the heartland, health insurance. Technologent provides health, dental and vision benefits for its 35 employees at the call center and offers family coverage at group rates via payroll deduction.
 Families that lacked health insurance or that were deterred by high deductibles from getting regular checkups have returned to their doctors and dentists, according to Sheryl Hiatt, a business development consultant for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
 Technologent's presence has not only pumped money into the local economy, it has prompted a few expatriates, like Audrey Kramer, to return home. Ms. Kramer, 49, who grew up on a 2,500-acre cattle ranch outside Ainsworth and married a local rancher, had spent the last two decades in Omaha, where her husband, Ken, held jobs at an insurance company and a car dealership.
 They missed their rural roots, though, and saw a job for her at Technologent as a way back. The couple bought a 146-acre farm outside Ainsworth, where Mr. Kramer now trains horses.
 ''The benefits are good and the camaraderie -- I think I missed that most when we were gone,'' Ms. Kramer said.
 Today, Technologent's account representatives average over 30 calls a day, about twice the industry average, according to Mr. Galloway. And Julie Younkin, the center's director, says not a single employee has left for another job. ''I think one family moved and one person left to get married,'' she said. 
 Mr. Galloway's business has also benefited from some $500,000 in federal community development funds, half to help cover employee training and start-up costs, the other half a seven-year, no-interest loan. Moreover, the local owners of the call center's 8,000-square-foot building made a gift of it to Mr. Galloway. With revenue continuing to grow to a projected $50 million this year, he expects to hire 45 more people in Ainsworth by the end of the year, for a total of 80.
 In addition, he is seeking a larger community in Nebraska to help him fill 200 to 250 jobs at a planned second call center.
 Mr. Galloway says he has won over Sun Microsystems' executives, whom he has brought to visit his native state. ''They're now big believers in the heartland of America, that we've got to stop sending jobs overseas and bring back jobs to the United States,'' he said. ''These are the hardest-working people. They'll do anything for you.'' 
 One state to the south, there is no longer a school of any kind in Grenola, Kan., which was a thriving cattle-drive town in the 19th century but is now down to 280 residents. This summer, when milk and bread delivery trucks no longer considered it worthwhile to take the highway exit for Grenola, the town's one small supermarket shut its doors, leaving the True Grit Cafe and a small tire and auto repair shop as the only commercial establishments. 
 But thanks to Mr. Kelly, owner of Kelly Manufacturing, a $5.5-million-a-year maker of aviation instruments in Wichita, the economic outlook has brightened.
 Mr. Kelly, 62, who grew up on a farm near Grenola, got a business degree and then a law degree from the University of Kansas, and went on to become a corporate lawyer at R.C. Allen Inc. in Wichita, a maker of aviation gyroscopes and various engine gauges. In 1993, when its fortunes were falling, he bought the company and threw his energies into turning it around.
 In 1996, the same year he renamed the company, keeping R.C. Allen as the trade name, he opened a satellite plant in a vacant 40,000-square-foot school building in Grenola, 50 miles east of Wichita, where his brother worked the family farm and where he, too, had a farm. In return, local officials offered the building rent- free for 10 years.
 Today, he pays 17 employees $8 to $13 an hour and subsidizes their health insurance.
 ''We feel fortunate to have them here. They're very community oriented,'' said Grenola's mayor, Walter Dean, explaining that the company's prairie-style work hours allow working mothers to pretty much match the school bus schedule of their children. ''If we had three Kellys here, maybe a service station would come in.''
 In effect, there will soon be two Kelly-owned companies. Mr. Kelly has begun renovating a 15,000-square-foot industrial arts building adjacent to the school, which was also offered to him tax-free, and will soon relocate about half of another business, Kansas Diecasting, to Grenola from Le Roy, Kan. 
 Mr. Kelly's brother Lynn, the Grenola plant manager for the last four years, boasts about the local work ethic. ''In emergency situations, people will stay half the night,'' he said.
 He toils just as hard, at all hours. He gets up at 6 a.m.; works at the plant from 7 to 10:15; drives 17 miles to West Elk High School in Howard to teach classes in introductory calculus, calculus, principles of technology and advanced physics for more than two hours; returns to the plant and works until about 5; heads back to his 2,600-acre farm to feed his 120 cows and tend his wheat, soybeans, and milo; and then, often, puts in a final late-evening stint at the plant.

HEADLINE: Warning: Military service can be a drain on later earning power in civilian life.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
THE risk of serious injury or death to members of the armed forces is clear enough, but their economic risks are less apparent. Veterans Day is a fitting occasion to recognize the economic sacrifices of veterans. 
 For a long time, it was believed that veterans of popular wars benefited from their service when they rejoined the civilian labor market, while veterans of unpopular wars lost out. A growing body of research, however, shows that most veterans -- whether inductees during a draft or enlistees in the voluntary forces -- suffer an earnings penalty in the civilian economy. Military experience appears to be worth little to most private-sector employers. 
 Figuring out how military service affects veterans' civilian earnings is not straightforward. On the one hand, the military rejects individuals who are physically unfit, uneducated or have a low aptitude. On the other hand, during the Vietnam War, many men with good connections, occupational deferments or a college education were able to avoid service. As a result, veterans are not a representative sample of the population, and a simple comparison of veterans to nonveterans can be misleading. 
 In a celebrated 1990 study, Joshua Angrist of M.I.T. solved this problem by ingeniously exploiting the Vietnam-era draft lottery. Priority for the draft was determined by random selection on birthdays. Professor Angrist compared the earnings of those whose birthdays made them eligible for the draft with those whose birthdays made them ineligible. Because birthdays were randomly selected, there is no reason to suspect that the two groups would have had different earnings absent the draft. With this setup, he found that veterans who joined the military because of their unlucky draft number earned about 10 percent less than otherwise similar nonveterans in the first decade after leaving the service. 
 The nature of selection into the military was different during World War II, but the impact of service was similar. Three-quarters of men born from 1919 to 1926 served in World War II. Those who did not were often disqualified because of a physical or mental handicap. These handicaps limited job opportunities for nonveterans. While World War II veterans earned about 10 percent more than nonveterans over the course of their civilian careers, that advantage was a result of the low earning power of nonveterans. 
 The draft lottery again offers a way to estimate how much veterans would have earned if they had not served. By comparing birth cohorts with greatly different call-up rates as the draft built up and then wound down, Professor Angrist and I found that World War II veterans earned 5 to 10 percent less than comparable nonveterans, similar to the penalty that Vietnam-era veterans suffered. 
 In recent work, Professor Angrist tackles the effect of serving in the post-Vietnam all-volunteer force. He uses two methods to determine how much veterans would have earned in the absence of their service. First, he matches applicants to the military who served to other applicants who did not serve but had the same education and aptitude score. 
 Second, he takes advantage of a mistake in the way the armed forces qualifying test was graded. 
 From 1976 to 1980, more than 250,000 applicants were accidentally let into the military because of this mistake. The military fixed the mistake in October 1980. Applicants who were rejected after the fix-up but who would have been accepted previously provide a natural comparison group for those mistakenly accepted. 
 Both techniques yield similar results. When they entered the civilian labor market, white veterans earned around 5 percent less than their nonveteran counterparts. It took about 10 years for this earnings disadvantage to dissipate. 
 Nonwhite veterans, by contrast, earned almost 10 percent more than otherwise comparable nonveterans upon leaving the military, and this advantage persisted for at least a decade. 
 A possible explanation for this racial disparity is that a record of military service may be a positive signal that helps minority workers to (at least partially) overcome the discrimination they face in the labor market. For white veterans, however, military service mainly amounts to a loss of civilian work experience. 
 Several studies find that while in the armed forces, military personnel earn higher salaries than their civilian counterparts. The pay of military personnel also increased sharply relative to that of civilians since 2000, according to a new study by John T. Warner and Curtis Simon of Clemson University. 
 But all is not so rosy. Wives of men in the armed forces earn 30 percent less than other married women their age with the same education, according to a study by Col. Casey Wardynski of the United States Military Academy. 
 In part, the spouses fare poorly because military bases are overwhelmingly in low-wage, rural areas. In addition, because military wives are often forced to relocate, they have little opportunity to advance within the same company, and little bargaining power because they cannot easily move to another location in search of better pay. 
 The limited labor market opportunities for wives of military personnel was of little consequence in the 1960's, when fewer than a third of them worked. But now, with two-thirds of wives of soldiers in the labor force, the earnings gap significantly lowers family incomes. 
 To reduce the economic burden on military families, Colonel Wardynski recommends considering giving preferences to spouses of military personnel for civilian jobs on military bases. 
 Despite the economic sacrifices -- and the increased risk to life and limb from the war in Iraq -- enlistments rose noticeably in all branches of the armed forces except the Navy from 1999 to 2003. The weak job market, intensified military recruitment efforts and patriotic zeal have undoubtedly increased recruitment, Mr. Warner said. 
 ''Without regarding the danger,'' Adam Smith once remarked, ''young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the beginning of a new war.'' 
 As the war in Iraq persists and the job market continues to strengthen, the costs of reaching the Pentagon's growing target for enlistments are expected to rise as well -- for the Treasury and for veterans.

 conversely, white veterans earned less than their counterparts.Graph tracks the annual earnings gap between veterans (WHITE VETERANS, NONWHITE VETERANS) and nonveterans with similar backgrounds before service, during service, and post service from 1975-1990.(Source by Joshua Angrist, ''Econometrica,'' 1988)

HEADLINE: Scotland Plans to Ban Smoking in Public Places

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Scotland's semi-autonomous government has agreed to ban smoking in enclosed public places under legislation to be presented before the end of the year, First Minister Jack McConnell said Wednesday.
 ''Too many people smoke, and too many people die or fall ill from cancer, stroke and heart disease,'' Mr. McConnell told Scotland's Parliament after a unanimous vote of the region's governing executive in Edinburgh. 
 ''The single largest cause of preventable premature death in Scotland is smoking,'' Mr. McConnell said, pointing to the estimated 13,000 smoking-related deaths a year.
 He told the Parliament that poor diet, excessive drinking, lack of exercise and drug abuse all made Scotland one of Europe's unhealthiest places.
 ''It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health,'' he said. ''The single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.''
 Pub owners or employers who fail to enforce the law in their premises will face fines of up to $:2,500 -- $4,600 -- and pub owners could lose their licenses altogether.
 Individuals who smoke in enclosed public areas will face a maximum fine of up to $:1,000 for persistent offenders.
 The announcement provoked fury from the tobacco industry, smokers' groups and people in the hospitality trade, who warned that the ban would damage the Scottish economy.
 ''The Scottish Executive's decision to bring in legislation banning smoking is unnecessarily heavy-handed and shows a total disregard for what the public wants,'' said Tim Lord, chief executive of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association. ''Opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of people in Scotland want to see more restrictions on smoking in public places but they do not support a total ban.'' 
 However, public health officials, unions and anticancer charities in Scotland were delighted by the news.
 ''Tobacco has done so much damage to Scottish society, these new laws will help us to improve everyone's quality of life,'' said Maureen Moore, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health Scotland.
 Keith Fox, the chairman of the group and a leading heart specialist, called the move ''a rare opportunity not just to protect our society from danger, but to pass on to future generations a legacy of clean air and better health.'' 
 Scotland's decision to pursue a ban follows similar action in Ireland, Norway and some parts of the United States.
 The British government has taken an increasingly tough line on tobacco, and has been keeping a close eye on the ban on smoking in all public places introduced in Ireland earlier this year. The ban was controversial when it was introduced, but subsequent opinion polls have found the measure to be popular with the public.

HEADLINE: Tech Shares Lose Ground in Otherwise Flat Trading Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lower-than-expected sales at Cisco Systems sent tech stocks lower yesterday, while the overall market changed little after the Federal Reserve announced a widely expected interest rate increase. A jump in oil prices encouraged mild profit-taking.
 The Fed's Open Market Committee raised interest rates a quarter point, bringing the federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to 2 percent. The market had little reaction to the rate increase, though investors closely read the Fed's policy statement for hints about what may lie ahead. Analysts took it as a good sign that the language in the statement was largely unchanged from the Fed's last announcement. 
 ''This gives a very positive tone to their outlook on the U.S. economy, despite higher energy prices,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company. ''There's nothing to fear on the inflation front, from where they sit, and they see flexibility in the labor market, which suggests they will allow faster job growth to show itself without having to move any quicker on rate changes.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.89 point, to 10,385.48. The broader gauges were slightly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,162.91. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 8.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,034.56, reflecting investors' disappointment with Cisco Systems.
 Cisco shed $1.31, or 6.6 percent, to $18.44, after reporting results that met profit expectations but missed sales forecasts. Growth at Cisco, a leading maker of routers and switches that move data over computer networks, remains strong, despite cautious spending by its corporate customers, but management warned that it could face increased competition.
 Despite relatively good economic news, overall trading was tepid, particularly in the face of volatile oil prices. The government's weekly report on petroleum inventories showed another decline in the nation's supply of distillate fuels, which include heating oil. Separately, the International Energy Agency, the energy adviser to 26 industrialized nations, indicated that worries over the global heating-oil supply were easing. Light, sweet crude for December delivery settled up $1.49 at $48.86, putting pressure on stocks.
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit shrank to $51.6 billion in September, a 3.7 percent drop from August, as exports posted their best month on record. The latest snapshot of trade activity showed that exports of goods and services increased to $97.5 billion in September. 
 Exports were helped by a weaker dollar and improving foreign demand.

HEADLINE: SunTrust Fires 3 Executives Over Miscalculations

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
SunTrust Banks said yesterday that it had fired its chief credit officer and two other executives after finding numerous errors in calculating how much to set aside for bad loans. 
 The banking company, based in Atlanta, also said that it planned to release its third-quarter results tomorrow, a month late. 
 The chief credit officer of SunTrust, Sandra Jansky, who joined the bank in 1981, and two other credit administration executives were dismissed. The controller, Jorge Arrieta, will be reassigned to a nonaccounting position, the company said. 
 SunTrust did not identify the other executives fired. 
 It said that because of the errors, it expected to revise its first-half profit figure higher by at least the $31.6 million, or 8 cents a share, it forecast on Oct. 11 when it disclosed the problems. SunTrust had reported first-half profit of $723.3 million, or $2.55 a share.
 SunTrust said it was cooperating with an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the planned restatement. 
 Jeff Davis, an analyst with FTN Midwest Research in Nashville, said: ''Though the error went in SunTrust's favor, there is too much egg on the company's face. That people were forced to step aside is unsurprising and probably appropriate.'' 
 SunTrust said members of its credit administration unit ''provided false draft minutes'' of a committee meeting to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the bank's auditor.
 It also said that a ''material weakness'' remained in its internal controls for establishing loan loss set-asides, as that term is understood under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the past, SunTrust has been known for conservative accounting. 
 Its chief executive, L. Phillip Humann, said in a conference call yesterday, ''There's no way I'm going to downplay the seriousness of what's taking place, nor am I going to even try.'' 
 The material weakness, Mr. Humann said, is ''a very, very big deal to us,'' and the executives' failure to communicate properly with the auditors is ''particularly unsettling.'' The bank, he said, had so far identified no other accounting problems. 
 In New York yesterday, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on the outlook for SunTrust debt to negative from stable. Fitch Ratings also lowered its credit rating.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed's Statement on Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2 percent. 
 The committee believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions have improved. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
 The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. 
 Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 3 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Lower Terrorist Alert Levels for Financial Sites

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Sewell Chan contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Federal officials lowered the terrorist alert level on Wednesday for the financial services industry in Washington, New York and northern New Jersey, saying that financial institutions in those regions had taken significant steps to improve defenses against possible attacks.
 The action was taken nearly three and a half months after the Department of Homeland Security imposed a heightened state of alert based on computer records found in Pakistan. 
 The authorities said the records showed that Qaeda operatives, starting before the 2001 attacks, had meticulously monitored financial buildings in these areas, including the World Bank in Washington, the Citigroup building in Manhattan and the Prudential Financial building in Newark. Federal officials also said the approaching presidential election was a cause for heightened concern. 
 James Loy, deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, said the announcement on Wednesday should not be interpreted as a sign that the nation was any less likely to be a terrorist target.
 ''We are as concerned today as we were a month ago,'' Mr. Loy said. ''The whole notion of taking a deep breath and saying, 'Wow, we got past this, and now we are O.K. for a while,' is, in my mind, a very dangerous train of thought.''
 Instead, Mr. Loy said, the recovered surveillance reports identified the need for security improvements.
 At Prudential, for example, which has 4,000 employees at its Newark headquarters, double rows of concrete barriers were installed around the main offices. Cars parked below the complex are now searched, and visitors must pass their bags through X-ray machines.
 At the Citigroup Center, a tower in Midtown Manhattan considered particularly vulnerable because it is largely supported by four giant stilt-like structures, the company now requires visitors to have escorts.
 Spokesmen at both companies said the tighter security procedures would remain in place, even with the lowered threat level. 
 One immediate change here in Washington was around the Capitol, where the police ended a 24-hour-a-day check of all passing vehicles, a reduction of security welcomed by Mayor Anthony A. Williams.
 ''It is a recognition we are a safe society, but we also have to be an open society, which means we have to work our way to as normal a state as possible,'' he said.
 In New York, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne said the city was scaling back unspecified security measures, but added that the city ''continues to be considered a terrorist target and remains at a higher threat level.''
 The Homeland Security Department's pattern of raising the alert level, discussing the possibility of a major attack on the United States and then, with considerably less fanfare, lowering the alert level has caused a certain fatigue among some residents of the affected cities. Several on Wednesday asked whether the announcement's timing had more to do with politics than terrorism.
 ''This is something that could have probably been said two or three weeks prior to the election,'' Warren MacQueen of Washington said. ''But it was the notion of Bush protecting America that was a central part of his platform.''
 Mr. Loy said although his department t had no evidence that the surveillance of the buildings was ever part of an active bombing plot, such statements were unjustified. 
 ''We don't do politics here at this department,'' he said.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Explains Ruling Against U.S. Internet Gambling Ban

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization explained yesterday why it had ruled that the United States violated its international trade obligations by prohibiting Americans from gambling over the Internet.
 A W.T.O. panel that resolves disputes among members gave specific reasons behind the decision, which was issued last March. At the time, the Department of Justice vowed to appeal the ruling and several members of Congress angrily asserted the decision was equivalent to having the rest of the world dictate United States policy. 
 In its explanation, the W.T.O. said it was not seeking to undermine the ability of the United States, or any of its members, to regulate industry within its borders. Rather, the panel said that the United States policy prohibiting Internet gambling was inconsistent with longstanding trade agreements.
 The ruling stems from a case brought in June 2003 by the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda. It argued that United States trade policy did not prohibit Internet gambling and that to do so would be hypocritical given the huge overseas presence of American gambling enterprises.
 The ruling allowed Antigua and Barbuda to issue trade sanctions against the United States, said Sebastian Sinclair, an Internet gambling industry analyst with Christiansen Capital Advisors. But Mr. Sinclair said it would be unlikely that such sanctions would have any effect.
 He said the larger issue was whether another, larger nation might use the ruling to challenge the United States' policy. And he said that the decision underscored a larger problem: that the United States is markedly out of step with many other nations, which not only allow Internet gambling but license and authorize Internet casinos within their shores.
 Despite prohibitions against Internet gambling in the United States, millions of Americans participate in the activity, using credit cards or online payment services to wager on sports or games like poker, blackjack and roulette. Americans will be responsible for about half of the $7.6 billion lost this year on Internet wagers, Mr. Sinclair said.
 The effort to regulate and prohibit Internet gambling has been particularly tricky for the United States because the operations are based overseas and players are logging on from home. 
 Mr. Sinclair said the challenges were similar to those facing the music industry, which has struggled to fight piracy over the Internet. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about the United States' ban on Internet gambling misidentified the agency that planned to appeal a World Trade Organization ruling against the American prohibition -- a ruling that could eventually lead to trade sanctions. It is the office of the United States trade representative, not the Justice Department.

PERSON: Yasir Arafat

HEADLINE: Yasir Arafat, Father and Leader of Palestinian Nationalism, Is Dead

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat, who died this morning in Paris, was the wily and enigmatic father of Palestinian nationalism who for almost 40 years symbolized his people's longing for a distinct political identity and independent state. He was 75. 
 No other individual so embodied the Palestinians' plight: their dispersal, their statelessness, their hunger for a return to a homeland lost to Israel. Mr. Arafat was once seen as a romantic hero and praised as a statesman, but his luster and reputation faded over time. A brilliant navigator of political currents in opposition, once in power he proved more tactician than strategist, and a leader who rejected crucial opportunities to achieve his declared goal. 
 At the end of his life, Mr. Arafat governed Palestinians from an almost three-year confinement by Israel to his Ramallah headquarters. While many Palestinians continued to revere him, others came to see him as undemocratic and his administration as corrupt, as they faced growing poverty, lawlessness and despair over prospects for statehood. 
 A co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1994 for his agreement to work toward peaceful coexistence with Israel, Mr. Arafat began his long political career with high-profile acts of anti-Israel terrorism.
 In the 1960's, he pioneered what became known as ''television terrorism'' -- air piracy and innovative forms of mayhem staged for maximum propaganda value. Among the more spectacular deeds he ordered was the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. In 1986, a group linked to Mr. Arafat but apparently acting independently seized the Achille Lauro cruise ship and threw overboard an elderly American Jew in a wheelchair.
 In 2000, after rejecting a land-for-peace deal from Israel that he considered insufficient, Mr. Arafat presided over the Palestinians as they waged a mix of guerrilla warfare and terror against Israeli troops and civilians that has lasted more than four years.
 Indeed, shifting between peace talks and acts of violence was the defining feature of his political life. In his emotional appeal for a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, he wore a holster while waving an olive branch. After his pledge of peace with Israel in 1993, Palestinians associated with him carried out suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He officially condemned such violence but called for ''martyrs by the millions'' to rise for the Palestinian cause. 
 Mr. Arafat assumed many poses. But the image that endures -- and the one he clearly relished -- was that of the Arab fighter, the grizzled, scruffy-bearded guerrilla in olive-green military fatigues and his trademark checkered head scarf, carefully folded in the elongated diamond shape of what was once Palestine.
 He seemed to thrive when under siege. Surrounded in the spring of 2002 by Israeli tanks in two rooms of his compound in Ramallah, he cried out, ''Oh God, grant me a martyr's death.''
 Until 1988, he repeatedly rejected recognition of Israel, insisting on armed struggle and terror campaigns. He opted for diplomacy only after his embrace of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 -- and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- left his movement politically disgraced and financially bankrupt, with neither power nor leverage.
 In September 1993, he achieved world acclaim by signing a limited peace treaty with Israel, a declaration of principles that provided for mutual recognition and outlined a transition to Palestinian autonomy in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories that Israel had controlled since its decisive victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The culmination of secret negotiations in Oslo, the agreement was blessed by President Bill Clinton and sealed with a stunning handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Mr. Arafat on the White House lawn.
 But in 2000, he walked away from a proffered settlement based on the Oslo accords proposed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- the biggest compromises Israel had ever offered.
 The Israeli proposal appeared to meet most of his earlier demands, but Mr. Arafat held out for more. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak charged that Mr. Arafat had failed to respond with proposals of his own, effectively torpedoing the American-brokered talks. The Palestinians had a different interpretation, saying that despite being pushed into negotiations before they were ready, they had nonetheless responded with counterproposals but that the Barak offers kept shifting and ultimately fell short of their needs. 
 After the talks collapsed in 2000, Ariel Sharon, then in the opposition in Israel, visited the Jerusalem plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque in late September. Palestinians erupted in violent protest, igniting what came to be called the second intifada. That campaign has killed more than 900 Israelis and almost 3,000 Palestinians, and plunged the fragile Palestinian Authority into armed conflict. 
 Mr. Arafat died without achieving any of the essential goals he had espoused at various stages of his career: the destruction of Israel, the peace with the Jewish state he backed after 1988, or the creation of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Moreover, the political concessions that produced the 1993 Oslo accords -- accords for which he, Mr. Rabin and Shimon Peres of Israel shared the Nobel Peace Prize -- deepened both the admiration and hatred of him. Few Arabs or Israelis were neutral about Mr. Arafat or his Oslo deal with Israel.
 Mr. Arafat leaves an ambiguous legacy. He succeeded in creating not only a coherent national movement, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization, but also the very consciousness that made it possible. A master of public relations, he made the world aware of Palestine as a distinct entity. And he helped persuade Palestinians, who now number five million to six million, to think of themselves as a people with a right to sovereignty. ''He put the Palestinian cause on the map and mobilized behind his leadership the broadest cross section imaginable of Palestinians,'' said Khalil E. Jahshan, an Arab-American political activist who knew him well for more than a decade.
 His detractors, however, grew more numerous over time. Mr. Arafat, those critics contended, betrayed the Palestinian and Arab cause to maintain his own power. They called him a traitor for having accepted what Hisham Sharabi, the Palestinian scholar and former supporter, called an Arab Bantustan, an entity that was neither politically coherent nor economically viable. Critics noted that while ''President Arafat'' toured the globe being welcomed by world leaders, Israel doubled the size of its settlements on what was envisioned as soil for a future Palestinian state.
 Other detractors argued that he had waited too long to accept political reality. His reluctance to recognize Israel's existence and renounce the violence that claimed hundreds of Israeli and other lives prolonged the pain of the Palestinians and left a new generation stateless, ill treated under Israeli occupation and by most Arab governments. Palestinians in many Arab countries, including Syria and Lebanon, were restricted to camps and denied citizenship, while their host governments spoke in heartfelt tones of the Palestinian cause.
 Both admirers and enemies agreed that like King Hussein of Jordan, his late longtime rival and eventual partner in peace with Israel, Mr. Arafat was a survivor. Having experienced perhaps 40 attempts on his life by Israelis and Arabs, he was strengthened as a revolutionary leader by single-mindedness in pursuit of his dream and uncanny energy. Yet after Oslo, his enemies said he continued living mainly because Israel permitted him to do so. 
 Until 1991, when he wed Suha Tawil, his Palestinian secretary, and had a daughter, Zahwa, he was married only to his cause. He slept and ate little, took no vacations and neither drank nor smoked. People viewed his role in various ways -- terrorist, statesman, dreamer, pragmatist, his people's warrior, his people's peacemaker. Even admirers described him as a chameleon. Virtually all the biographies about him express bewilderment about his actions and character, about what an Israeli author, Danny Rubinstein, in his book ''The Mystery of Arafat,'' called ''this strange phenomenon.''
 Many Palestinians compared him to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founder and first leader, seeing Mr. Arafat as an Arab pioneer who struggled to lead his people back to their promised land. Many Israelis, by contrast, regarded him as an archterrorist, an opportunist who endorsed peace merely as a tactic to destroy Israel -- ''a beast on two legs,'' as the late Israeli leader Menachem Begin once called him. 
 After the Oslo accords, Mr. Arafat became as controversial among Arabs, especially Palestinians: revered by many as the father of their country, reviled by others as an autocrat, a divisive and sometimes indecisive buffoon, a traitor. Even many Arab supporters of his 1993 agreements with Israel eventually came to loathe him for what they saw as his political duplicity, his administration's endemic corruption and his dictatorial tendencies. 
 An exasperating and mercurial man, Mr. Arafat, with his ever-present silver-plated .357 Magnum, was one of the most recognizable of world figures. He was known by many names: Abu Ammar, his nom de guerre; the ''chairman,'' after he became leader of the P.L.O. in 1969; and the ''old man,'' the name he once said he preferred because in Arabic it conjures an image of a beloved uncle. At the end of his life, he referred to himself as ''general,'' often speaking of himself in the third person. 
 Over the years, ''old man'' became apt. His once-taut stomach gave way with age to paunch despite his frequent walks and the treadmill behind his office. What remained of his hair, almost always hidden by his trademark head scarf, turned gray. The face, with its three-day stubble, became visibly lined, his eyes weary.

The Young Guerrilla
 The mystery surrounding Mr. Arafat starts early, as accounts of his origins vary. The man who became ''Mr. Palestine'' was probably not born there. He has claimed to have been born on Aug. 4, 1929, in Jerusalem, or alternatively in Gaza. What seems certain is that this son of a lower-middle-class merchant spent much of his childhood being shuttled among relatives in Cairo, Gaza and Jerusalem after his mother, who came from a prominent Jerusalem family, died when he was 4.
 In 1949, he began studying engineering at Cairo University, where he was prominent in Palestinian student affairs. When Israel, Britain and France invaded Egypt in 1956, Mr. Arafat, as an Egyptian military reservist, is said to have taken a course in which he learned how to use mines and explosives, skills that proved useful. That same year, he also began wearing his trademark kaffiyeh, which impressed both Arabs and Westerners when he first traveled to Europe in a Palestinian student delegation.
 After graduating, he worked as an engineer in Egypt and moved first to Saudi Arabia, then to Kuwait in 1957, where he plunged into clandestine Palestinian nationalist activities.
 In October 1959, he and four other Palestinians founded Al Fatah, ''the Conquest,'' which later became the core of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
 From the beginning, Mr. Arafat was intent on building a revolutionary organization with three hallmarks: unity, independence and relevance. He knew that all three were essential to prevent the Arab nations, torn by bitter rivalries, from exploiting the Palestinian cause for their own purposes. He spent brief stints in prison in Egypt, Lebanon and Syria. 
 In May 1964, Egypt created the P.L.O. under Arab League auspices, but only as a front for the Arab nations. Ahmed Shukairy, an Egyptian bureaucrat who headed the P.L.O. and had never held a gun, resented Mr. Arafat and Al Fatah, denouncing them as ''enemies'' of the liberation movement.
 The 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which brought humiliating defeat to the Arabs' conventional armies, gave Mr. Arafat's group a chance to become heroes to Arabs desperately in need of some. But it still took Mr. Arafat two years to wrest control of the P.L.O. from the lower-key Palestinians to whom the Arab states had entrusted it.
 His genius for attracting media attention became evident in the spring of 1968, when he made his first appearance on the cover of Time magazine.
 That March, the Israeli Army attacked Karameh, the Jordanian town east of the Jordan River where Al Fatah had set up headquarters. Mr. Arafat insisted that his commandos not retreat. After the Israelis withdrew, he staged a victory celebration around several destroyed Israeli tanks that was attended by representatives from many Arab countries and, of course, the news media.
 Calling Karameh ''the first victory of the Arabs against the state of Israel,'' Mr. Arafat, with his kaffiyeh and Kalashnikov, became an instant sensation and a leading spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Money and volunteers poured in. Guerrilla training camps sprang up in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and Al Fatah became paramount among Palestinian guerrilla groups.
 At the same time, wrote Abu Iyad, a late top aide to Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian National Council, the P.L.O.'s parliamentary body, adopted Al Fatah's goal: ''Creating a democratic society in Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews would live together in complete equality.''
 Though such a state would have meant the destruction of Israel, Mr. Arafat and other Palestinians kept openly advocating it until the early 1980's. 

The Evicted Guest
 The guerrillas' power grew steadily in Jordan, to which 380,000 Palestinians had fled after Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, joining others who had arrived in 1948 when Israel was founded. By 1970, thousands of guerrillas were there, many of them adherents of Al Fatah.
 Spurred on by Palestinian radicals, Mr. Arafat committed what was to be the first of several blunders: he countenanced an attempt to wrest power from King Hussein, whose grandfather, a religious and tribal leader from Saudi Arabia, had been placed in charge of the country when Britain recognized its independence in 1923.
 Palestinian guerrillas began interfering with highway traffic, controlling Palestinian refugee camps, clashing with the Jordanian Army and systematically defying the Jordanian government. In September 1970 -- later known to Palestinians as Black September -- King Hussein sent troops and armor into Amman, his capital, to suppress the P.L.O. After days of shelling refugee camps where some 60,000 Palestinians lived, the army drove the would-be usurpers out of Jordan into Lebanon.
 Conservative estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. Mr. Arafat, who made his way unharmed to Cairo, later claimed that Jordan's Army had killed 25,000. By the following summer, the Jordanian Army had nullified the P.L.O. as a military power in the country. Sapped and shaken, the guerrilla movement drifted into Lebanon.
 In Lebanon's atmosphere of banking secrecy, duty-free trade and political freedom, Al Fatah expanded its political and military institutions as never before. Working among some 400,000 Palestinians in the country, the P.L.O. built its own police force, clinics and hospitals, a research center and a network of business interests that made it a ''virtual state within a state.''
 Moreover, it set about developing a formidable military arsenal.
 By 1974, the P.L.O. became, in effect, the sole representative of the Palestinian people, and that November, Mr. Arafat became the first Palestinian leader to plead his people's cause before the General Assembly.
 Mr. Arafat and his P.L.O. seemed at their peak, but as he had done in Jordan, he soon overplayed his hand. In 1975, tensions between Palestinians and Lebanese helped set off the Lebanese civil war. Despite some antagonism, he maintained his headquarters in Beirut for several years, and during this period armed Palestinians based in southern Lebanon harassed northern Israel.
 Sensing an opportunity to rid itself of Mr. Arafat and his movement, Israel invaded Lebanon and laid siege to Beirut in 1982. General Sharon, who later complained that he should have killed Mr. Arafat in Lebanon when he had the chance, dealt the Palestinians heavy blows before an agreement sponsored by Washington led to the withdrawal of thousands of P.L.O. guerrillas in August 1982. The guerrillas scattered to eight Arab cities, with their leaders fleeing to Tunis, the new Palestinian headquarters.
 Mr. Arafat ventured back to Lebanon in 1983. But rebel Palestinian guerrillas backed by Syria challenged and besieged him and his commandos in northern Lebanon. After a six-week siege in December, the anti-Arafat Palestinians drove him out.
 Thus Mr. Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization lost a base of military operations near Israel, as well as a sense of unity. And in moving to Tunis, a political backwater, he also jeopardized his organization's relevance in any peace talks.

The Pragmatic Survivor
 Mr. Arafat still managed to stage a limited revival. Traveling incessantly in Arab countries, he refilled his organization's depleted coffers and commanded world attention, especially when he escaped death in 1985 in an Israeli attack on his compound.
 But weakened and increasingly on the margins of Arab politics, he and the P.L.O. leaders gradually became convinced that political survival demanded a shift in both propaganda and tactical courses.
 The man who had vowed in 1969 to ignite ''armed revolution in all parts of our Palestinian territory'' in order ''to make of it a war of liberation'' against Israel, realized that while he had exhorted and overseen many armed actions against Israel, the terrorism had never amounted to a war of liberation. He and his advisers became increasingly convinced that Israel could not be vanquished by force.
 Moreover, the cold war was ending; the Soviet Union, a crucial patron, was broke and uninterested in his cause. The only Arab nation that had succeeded in reclaiming land lost to Israel was Egypt, whose president, Anwar el-Sadat, had been denounced by Mr. Arafat as an American ''stooge.'' Increasingly, however, the United States seemed like the only power that could press Israel to make political concessions.
 The outbreak of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising that erupted without the P.L.O.'s approval or encouragement in the Israeli-occupied territories in late 1987, also pushed Mr. Arafat toward greater pragmatism, if not moderation.
 In November 1988, after considerable American prodding, the P.L.O. accepted the United Nations resolution that called for recognition of Israel and a renunciation of terrorism.
 Yet this achievement was soon eclipsed by yet another miscalculation: Mr. Arafat's support for President Hussein in the Persian Gulf war enraged his remaining wealthy Arab patrons. The Persian Gulf states and other backers cut off at least $100 million in annual support, and the P.L.O. became even more isolated.
 Mr. Arafat, however, did not see it that way, and later claimed that he had not sided with the Iraqi dictator. In an interview in Tunis soon after the gulf war, he insisted that the P.L.O. was at its ''peak'' and that he was ''more popular than ever before'' with the ''Arab masses, the Muslim nation, the third world.''
 But with his coffers bare and Palestinians increasingly calling for his ouster, he had little choice but to grab the lifeline of peace talks that Israel had thrown him. Though Prime Minister Rabin was initially reluctant to engage the P.L.O. in secret peace talks, his fear of the growing power of Hamas, the militant Palestinian Islamic movement that had taken hold under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, was stronger than his disdain for Mr. Arafat and his bedraggled guerrillas.
 Mr. Arafat endorsed the Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in Madrid in October 1991, with Palestinians (but not the P.L.O.) taking part. The Arab participants sought a settlement under which Israel would yield land it occupied. Concurrently, in early 1992, secret contacts between representatives of the P.L.O. and Israel got under way in Tel Aviv. The talks continued, at Oslo and other sites, and by early September 1993, the essence of the proposed pact was generally known: mutual recognition and the creation of self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, with that autonomy envisioned as the beginning of a larger transfer of authority to the Palestinians in the occupied lands.
 The Oslo peace accords of 1993 were the first between Israeli officials and the P.L.O., and many Palestinians and Israelis argue that with the organization and even his own Fatah so divided about the accords, only Mr. Arafat could have secured their approval.
 But many diplomats and scholars say he could have secured a better deal for the Palestinians much earlier had he not placed priority on his organization's survival and unity rather than on establishing autonomy and a state on any sliver of his people's original land that he could secure.
 In 1978, Mr. Arafat joined most Arab nations in rejecting Mr. Sadat's peace with Israel under the Camp David accords. But unlike the others, Jordan and the P.L.O. had something to gain by taking part. The accords provided for an end to Israeli occupation of vast sections of the West Bank and Gaza and for ''autonomy'' for the Palestinians there, the possibility of eventually establishing the kind of national autonomy the P.L.O. had been seeking since 1974.
 William B. Quandt, a scholar and former American official who was intimately involved in Israeli-Arab diplomacy for years, said even the Camp David accords would probably have provided a better deal than the one Mr. Arafat ultimately accepted in 1993. ''In 1975 there were only 10,000 Israelis on the West Bank,'' he said. Today, there are 225,000 in the West Bank and 200,000 more Jews in East Jerusalem. 
 Some of Mr. Arafat's most euphoric and frustrating moments occurred after the 1993 Oslo accords. Among the highlights was his triumphal return to Gaza in July 1994. Welcomed by tens of thousands of cheering Palestinians and a city bedecked with the red, green, black and white colors of the Palestinian flag, he established the first Palestinian government.
 The assassination of Mr. Rabin by a Jewish hard-liner in November 1995 was a personal and political blow to Mr. Arafat, according to several associates, including Edward G. Abington, the American consul general in Jerusalem until mid-1997. Mr. Abington said Mr. Arafat ''broke down and sobbed over the phone'' after learning that Mr. Rabin had been assassinated. 
 But in January 1996, the Palestinian leader presided over one of the freest elections ever held among Arabs. Some 85 percent of the Palestinian electorate chose from a bewildering array of 700 candidates for an 88-member Palestinian Council.
 With 88 percent of the vote for him as president, Mr. Arafat became the undisputed leader of his people -- no longer (or so it seemed) dismissible by Israelis as a terrorist who derived his authority from the gun, or by Islamic nationalists who had assailed him as the hand-picked collaborator of Israel and the United States. ''This is a new era,'' he said after the 1996 elections. ''This is the foundation of our Palestinian state.''

The Criticized Symbol
 Such optimism proved short-lived. The Palestinian Authority was soon locked in increasingly bitter struggles with Hamas, which insisted on the continuing need to stage terrorist attacks not only against Israeli soldiers and settlers in their midst, but also on civilians inside Israel. 
 Opposition to Mr. Arafat and his Oslo accords also increased among secular Palestinians. Some of the most rabid critics accused him of having betrayed the Palestinian cause.
 Palestinians grew ever more critical of his autocratic style and what they called his inept stewardship, the brutal, arrogant methods of his 14 security services, his crackdown on dissenters and the corruption among the ''outsiders'' who had accompanied him from Tunis.
 In Israel, opposition was also building to what Mr. Arafat had once called the ''peace of the brave.'' After Mr. Rabin's assassination, a series of lethal suicide attacks by Hamas helped elect the hawkish government of Benjamin Netanyahu in May 1996.
 Palestinian hopes for economic development were also repeatedly dashed, partly by punitive Israeli actions that denied Palestinians jobs in Israel and work at home. In 1996, the border with Gaza was sealed by Israel for 3 days of every 10. By 1997, three years after Mr. Arafat's triumphal return to Gaza, the Palestinian economy was stagnant and per-capita annual income in Gaza had declined by $100, to $1,050. Refugee camps remained mired in squalor.
 Mr. Arafat's penchant for trying -- once more -- to satisfy all constituencies further undermined confidence in his leadership. Successive Palestinian crackdowns on Hamas and other militants invariably gave way to deals, pledges of forgiveness and rounds of kisses.
 Still, Mr. Arafat presided over an autonomous Palestinian sector that was, relative to most Arab states, tolerant and politically free-wheeling. And his popularity prevailed relative to challengers.
 Ever the careful balancer, he insisted on making decisions alone and in private. Indeed, he found himself increasingly isolated in his final years, with almost all his former close aides having been killed over the years by Israeli or Arab assassins.
 Plagued by a neurological illness that doctors said stemmed from an airplane crash in the Libyan desert that nearly killed him in 1992, Mr. Arafat slowed down. No longer able to work his legendary 18-hour days, he was forced to delegate some power, if not real authority, as he grew ever more frail. His trembling lower lip and shaking hands increased Palestinian concerns about the future. He had not appointed or groomed an obvious successor.
 Some Americans and Israelis involved in the Oslo peace negotiations continued to view him as the only Palestinian leader willing and able to make the compromises needed to end the bitter conflict. They disagreed with the growing number of Israelis who suspected that he secretly sought Israel's destruction while negotiating for peace.
 This upbeat assessment, however, was challenged in Israeli and American eyes by the collapse of the Oslo talks at Camp David in July 2000 and a last ditch round of negotiations that continued despite growing violence until January 2001. The talks with Mr. Barak's Labor government failed despite the intervention of President Clinton, who offered Mr. Arafat an 11th-hour peace package to secure a final settlement before the end of his term in office and before Mr. Barak faced elections in February 2001. 
 The package would have given the Palestinians all of Gaza and more than 94 percent of the West Bank, much closer to Mr. Arafat's goal of securing the return of all the territories lost in 1967 than he had ever come before. The Israelis also agreed to give Palestinians full sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem and air rights over Israel. But Mr. Arafat, who had already blessed the uprising and was facing growing Palestinian criticism of his stewardship, still insisted, among other things, on the right of return of refugees into Israel. Henry Siegman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Arafat's rejection of the American-brokered peace package a ''disastrous mistake.'' But, he added, ''based on my 14 years of dealings with Arafat, I reject the notion that he was bent on Israel's destruction.'' Rather, he said, Mr. Arafat's decision reflected his political weakness, a result partly of Israel's acceleration of settlement expansion and Mr. Barak's lack of interest in peace with the Palestinians until his own government began collapsing.
 But Dennis B. Ross, who spent 12 years trying to negotiate an Arab-Israeli peace settlement in Republican and Democratic administrations, ultimately concluded that while Mr. Arafat might have been prepared to die with Israel in existence, he was not prepared to have history regard him as the man who betrayed the vision of a single Palestinian state. ''In the end, he was not prepared to give up Palestinian claims and declare that the conflict is over,'' Mr. Ross said in an interview. 
 Even worse, Mr. Ross wrote in his book documenting the collapse of the American-brokered peace effort, ''he continued to promote hostility toward Israel.'' To avoid potential opposition, he remained a ''decision-avoider, not a decision-maker,'' Mr. Ross wrote, ''all tactics and no strategy.'' 
 In the February 2001 elections, Mr. Barak lost to Mr. Sharon, the candidate of the conservative Likud Party and a figure hated by Palestinians for his invasion of Lebanon, his settlements policy and his September 2000 visit to the Jerusalem plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque, an act intended to demonstrate Israeli sovereignty over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary.
 After Mr. Sharon's election, the newly elected Bush administration refused to help broker a serious peace effort similar to that of Oslo or the Madrid conference staged by the first President Bush. As a result, Palestinians argue, Mr. Arafat and others who ostensibly favored a diplomatic option lacked the political leverage they required. 
 Mr. Arafat's critics, by contrast, maintain that it was he who set off the violent Palestinian protests in September 2000, using the weapons and terrorist infrastructure he had secretly built alongside Israel while he negotiated for peace. 
 After almost 60 suicide bombings in 17 months, Mr. Sharon surrounded Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah in late March 2001 and later confined him there, leaving the Palestinian leader to rail against Jewish ''extremists'' as his cellphone battery died and his entourage ran short of food. 
 Pressure by Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies prompted the Bush administration to re-engage in an American-sponsored peace effort in the summer of 2001. Although Mr. Bush had been tentatively scheduled to meet Mr. Arafat on the periphery of the United Nations General Assembly in the fall of 2001, the session was canceled after the attacks of Sept. 11. Mr. Bush never met with Mr. Arafat. 
 The White House's hostility to the Palestinian leader hardened over time as American intelligence officials informed the White House that he was lying about his opposition to violence against Israelis. Officials said Mr. Bush came increasingly to equate Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians with militant Islamic attacks on Americans. 
 Mr. Ross, the longtime negotiator, said a low point came in January 2002, when Israelis interdicted in the Red Sea the Karine A, a ship carrying Iranian arms for use against Israelis. In a letter to Mr. Bush, Mr. Arafat disavowed any connection to the ship, though it turned out that the shipment had been arranged by a crucial Arafat aide, and the pilot was a Palestinian navy officer. Mr. Bush angrily dismissed the letter, insisting that Mr. Arafat must have known about the weapons. Though Mr. Arafat finally acknowledged responsibility for the arms, the diplomatic damage was done.
 Increasingly, the United States looked on with indifference as Prime Minister Sharon took unilateral steps to protect Israelis that infuriated the Palestinians, including building walls to cut Israel off from suicide bombers and ordinary Palestinians, dividing up the West Bank into supposedly temporary zones of security and more permanent zones of settlement.
 Efforts by the Bush administration to force Mr. Arafat to share power with other Palestinian leaders also failed. Because he steadfastly refused to designate a successor, a generation of lieutenants has been jockeying for power.
 The International Crisis Group, an independent Brussels-based group that studies global issues, partly blamed the Palestinian leadership. ''Recent power struggles, armed clashes, and demonstrations do not pit Palestinians against Israelis so much as Palestinians against each other,'' the report stated. 
 Under Mr. Arafat, local actors like mayors, kinship networks and armed militias competed for authority in the vacuum. One result, the report said, was growing chaos. 
 Nor did Mr. Arafat deliver prosperity. According to United Nations figures, 50 percent of the 2.2 million Palestinians on the West Bank live below the poverty line, compared with 22 percent in 2001; the figure is now 68 percent in teeming Gaza, with its 1.3 million residents. 
 Despite deteriorating political and economic conditions, many Palestinians blamed Israel and not their leader for their plight. For many, until the end, Mr. Arafat remained the symbol of Palestinian aspiration to a state, the only man who could have sold the painful compromises for peace to his people had he chosen to do so.

 CORRECTION:
The obituary of Yasir Arafat in some late editions on Thursday referred incorrectly to the state of knowledge about his organizational role in the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. A group under his authority has long been blamed for the killings; it is not known whether Mr. Arafat personally ordered them. The article also misstated the year in which the cruise ship Achille Lauro was seized by terrorists loosely linked to Mr. Arafat's organization. It was 1985, not 1986.

HEADLINE: ARAFAT DIES AT 75; NO SUCCESSOR SET; WEST BANK BURIAL

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET and STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Thursday, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, died early Thursday morning in a Paris hospital, a French military spokesman announced.
 Mr. Arafat, who was the symbol of the Palestinian revolution and aspiration for an independent state for some 40 years, died at about 3:30 a.m. Paris time of complications from an unknown disease after lingering in a coma for days, as his wife and closest aides struggled over his political and financial legacy.
 Mr. Arafat will be buried in Ramallah, on the West Bank, in the Muqata, an old British fortress he used as his headquarters and where he spent the last three years confined to his compound by the Israelis. 
 His body will first be flown to Cairo for a memorial service on Friday, a ceremony most Arab and world leaders are expected to attend so that they do not have to pass through Israeli border controls. Then, Palestinian officials said, Mr. Arafat will be buried here on Saturday, near his headquarters, from which he was airlifted to a French hospital on Oct. 29.
 Palestinian officials quickly confirmed the death of their leader as small groups gathered outside the Muqata in a reddish dawn to mourn his passing. Early Thursday, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the presidency, confirmed the death and said that Mr. Arafat ''planted the seeds of hope for his people.''
 ''The Palestinian leadership mourns Yasir Arafat,'' he said.
 ''We mourn with our people, with the Arab nation, with the whole of humanity,'' he said, the loss of ''the tutor, the leader, the son of Palestine, its symbol, the builder of its modern nationalism and the hero of its battle for freedom and independence.''
 As he finished, saying: ''Glory to you, our leader,'' Mr. Rahim broke into tears.
 Mr. Arafat died with the Palestinians still in a limbo of semistatehood, a final peace with the Israelis unachieved and a lingering intifada against Israel that has seen the deaths of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians over the last four years.
 The Israelis regarded him as a terrorist and an obstacle to peace, but Mr. Arafat held all the power of the Palestinians in his hands -- the presidency, the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization and of its largest movement, Fatah. But he groomed no successor, and he kept many secrets to himself, including the full range of the billions of dollars in Palestinian assets held in many joint accounts under his name. 
 Jibril Rajoub, the national security adviser, said: ''The Arafat era is over. But the loyalty and commitment to his march, connected to building the state and ending the occupation, are the responsibility of every Palestinian.''
 Mr. Rajoub, speaking on Al Jazeera television, then sent a further message to Palestinians, asking for stability. ''The coming phase should be one of institutions and laws, working through existing institutions, whether strong or not,'' he said.
 Under the rules of the Palestinian Authority, the speaker of the parliament, Rawhi Fattouh, will serve as acting president until new elections are held for the post within the next 60 days.
 Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian minister, urged the United States to work with the Palestinians and with Israel to ensure that ''free and fair elections'' could take place.
 Mr. Arafat's lingering death allowed his putative successors, most prominently Mahmoud Abbas, the secretary general of the P.L.O., and Ahmed Qurei, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, to organize themselves. They are working in tandem, and are trying to reach out to other, younger Palestinians with more power and street credibility.
 Mr. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, is expected to take over the P.L.O. and Fatah, while Mr. Qurei, known as Abu Ala, will continue as prime minister but with more authority over the day-to-day running of government.
 But there is bound to be a struggle for the Palestinian leadership over time, with a younger generation of militants and reformers pressing for a larger voice in Palestinian affairs, and hard choices coming about whether to try to absorb militants like Hamas or to confront them and try to make peace with Israel.
 Israel's president, Moshe Katsav, expressed hope that Mr. Arafat's death would allow his successors a fresh start with Israel, Agence France-Presse reported. ''I hope that the new Palestinian leadership will take a new path with a view to putting an end to terrorism and violence, which would allow a resumption of negotiations,'' he said.
 But Hamas said Mr. Arafat's death would only strengthen its resolve to keep up attacks against Israel, Reuters reported. ''The loss of the great leader will increase our determination and steadfastness to continue jihad and resistance against the Zionist enemy until victory and liberation are achieved,'' it said.
 Mr. Abbas and Mr. Qurei will have to move quickly to try to restore credibility in the Palestinians' tattered institutions and provide security on the streets.
 Outside the Muqata, Khalik Rimawi, 21, said he had waited all night for news. ''I wanted to be in solidarity with my president,'' he said, trembling. ''With the loss of our president we lost all confidence and trust we might have for anyone who might come after him. He personally was the symbol of the Palestinians and the Palestinian cause, and when he spoke, it was as if the whole nation were speaking.''
 His friend, Muhammad al-Hamoud, also 21, works in a dairy. ''I feel there is a big gap, an emptiness,'' he said. ''We'll stay until they bury the president.''
 In Gaza City, hundreds of people took to the streets after the announcement of Mr. Arafat's death. Some shot volleys of gunfire into the air; others burned tires, and smoke filled the air. Hamas, which considers the Palestinian Authority illegitimate, offered its condolences.
 Mr. Arafat's death came after Palestinian leaders spent much of Wednesday planning the succession in meetings in Ramallah.
 There was a debate about whether to hold elections to replace Mr. Arafat as president of the authority within 60 days of his death, as the authority's basic law demands. 
 Some argued that an election would be too difficult and risky and might not be carried out in time, especially with Israeli troops intermittently occupying parts of the West Bank and Gaza. It would be better, they said, for the legislature, the Palestinian Legislative Council, to select a president instead.
 But the leadership decided to follow the basic law and hold an election, said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator. American officials favor an election as the best way to establish legitimacy quickly, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in Washington. He said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke on Tuesday with Nabil Shaath, one of Mr. Arafat's aides, ''about the situation as it was and what plans were being made.'' 
 President Bush said that with a new Palestinian leadership that asks for help in building a democratic, free society, ''there will be an opening for peace.''
 When that happens, Mr. Bush said, ''the United States of America will be more than willing to help build the institutions necessary for a free society to emerge so that the Palestinians can have their own state.''
 ''The vision is of two states, a Palestinian state and Israel living side by side,'' he said, ''and I think we've got a chance to do that, and I look forward to being involved in that process.'' 
 Mr. Abbas is expected to run for the presidency as the candidate of Fatah, the largest faction in the P.L.O., said Edward Abington, a former American diplomat and now a consultant to the Palestinian Authority. But Mr. Abbas may face strong challenges from more popular, militant candidates who may have the tacit support of groups like Hamas. 
 ''Even if he wins with 60 percent of the vote,'' a senior Israeli official said, ''and a Hamas-supported candidate gets 40 percent, do you think Hamas will then accept what he says?''
 The Israeli government wanted Mr. Arafat to be buried in the Gaza Strip, far from Israel proper and the place where his father and sister are buried. But in the cabinet debate on Wednesday, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon asked if anyone, including the army and the intelligence agencies, objected to the Ramallah burial site. No one did, Israeli officials said. 
 Instead, there was agreement that the first request of Mr. Abbas as putative heir should be acceded to. An Israeli official said the Americans had urged the Israelis to accept Ramallah for Mr. Abbas's sake.
 The Israeli Army will coordinate the burial plans, the cabinet decided, but will stay out of Ramallah. In a statement, the cabinet said: ''The responsibility for maintaining security and public order in Ramallah during the funeral and after it falls on the Palestinians.''''

Under Palestinian law, parliament speaker Rawhi Fattouh, is to become caretaker president of the Palestinian Authority until elections are held.Mahmoud Abbas, former prime minister, late 60's. Mr. Abbas, who is known as Abu Mazen, became the first Palestinian prime minister in 2003, but lasted only four months on the job. When he quit in September 2003, he cited frustrations with the Israelis, who showed little interest in negotiating with him, as well as with Mr. Arafat, who resisted handing over authority to the prime minister. Regarded as a moderate and pragmatic voice, he said that it was a mistake for the Palestinians to wage an armed uprising against the Israelis. He has played a leading role in encouraging contacts between Palestinians and left-wing Israelis as far back as the 1970's.Muhammad Dahlan, former security chief, 43. Muhammad Dahlan was the head of the Palestinian Preventive Security Forces in the Gaza Strip in the 1990's, and carried out crackdowns against the Islamic faction Hamas. Some Israeli and American officials touted him as a potential future leader. However, after the current Palestinian uprising erupted in 2000, the Israelis began criticizing him for not doing enough to prevent attacks. Mr. Dahlan speaks English and since leaving his security post, he has often traveled abroad. He pressed Mr. Arafat to create a larger political role for a younger generation of Fatah leaders. However, Mr. Arafat and the aides who have been close to him for decades have resisted, and this has been a source of friction with the old guard. He was deported in 1987.Ahmed Qurei, prime minister, late 60's. Widely known as Abu Ala, he became the Palestinian prime minister in October 2003. But Israel has effectively boycotted the Palestinian leadership, and he has accomplished little during his time in office. Mr. Qurei has been a close aide to Mr. Arafat for decades, but has never escaped the large shadow cast by the Palestinian leader. He was born to a wealthy family in 1937 in Abu Dis, on the Mount of Olives, then an Arab village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He is regarded by some Palestinians as an aristocrat rather than a revolutionary. Much of his activity was in the economic sphere.Marwan Barghouti, Fatah leader, 44. Marwan Barghouti is the second-most-popular Palestinian leader after Mr. Arafat, according to Palestinian opinion polls in recent years. However, Mr. Barghouti was convicted in May by an Israeli court of orchestrating five killings and is now serving five consecutive life sentences. Until the current conflict began four years ago, Mr. Barghouti, who is fluent in Hebrew and English, had close ties to Israelis and had a reputation as an advocate of reconciliation. A wry man given to blue jeans and leather jackets, he positioned himself as the common man's alternative to corrupt, aging ministers around Mr. Arafat. Mr. Barghouti was raised in a West Bank village outside Ramallah and is a member of a large, well-known clan. (pg. A12)

HEADLINE: As Curses Go, Boras Is Familiar With Them All

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

 BODY:
THERE will be a delicious moment of recompense in April, when the guiltless glee of schadenfreude will alight on Fenway Park as Boston unfurls its World Series banner in front of the Yankees in the Red Sox' home opener.
 What core Red Sox player worth his Tasmanian Devil coiffure would miss this?
 What soulful Red Sox player among the secret order of flakes would skip this daily double of Boston ecstasy and Yankee humiliation?
 More than anyone, catcher Jason Varitek should be in the Boston lineup for this first day in the rest of the Red Sox' curseless lives. But as a free agent this off-season, Varitek has aligned himself with an agent who has a reputation for relegating homespun sentimentality to a contract line item beneath player perks like hotel suites and use of a private plane. 
 The one and only Scott Boras cases every team before he holds them up. A voracious student of stats, team financial statements, market economics and psychoanalysis, Boras famously leveraged Tom Hicks's naivete and ego into a $252 million deal for Alex Rodriguez. 
 In Varitek's case, Boras wants years, as in a five-year deal, even though such a contract breaks the Red Sox' unspoken policy of four-year limits to retain roster flexibility.
 ''There are only two or three catchers who are doing what Jason Varitek is doing, and he wants a salary commensurate with them, and why wouldn't he?'' Boras said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''The issue may be years, but what's the market offer? That's what usually drags players away.''
 Even so, Boras promises, with crossed heart, that only 30 percent of his clients go to the top bidders. He promises, with an earnest voice, that he advises players to be loyal and true to their teams.
 Promises are malleable in Boras's world, though. He has been known to create phantom offers for players when there are none. A year ago, Boras established the market for Varitek when catcher Ivan Rodriguez left the World Series champion Florida Marlins -- and their $7 million-a-year offer -- to peruse other offers.
 Were there others or just one? Rodriguez signed a four-year, $10 million-a-year deal to play in the baseball abyss of Detroit even though his family roots were in Florida.
 Varitek could end up in a similar situation. If so, some will no doubt blame Boras if the Red Sox lose Varitek, their heart and soul. Often, Boras is seen as the choreographer of betrayal. He was the one who turned the draft pick J.D. Drew into an example of Gordon Gekko greed when the uber-agent demanded a $10 million contract from the Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies recoiled, Drew re-entered the draft in 1998, and the St. Louis Cardinals signed him for a contract worth no more than $8.5 million. 
 In 2000, Boras was labeled as the emperor of gluttony when A-Rod left a good-faith offer in Seattle for a record-breaking deal in Texas, only to be made miserable by the Rangers' losing lone-star outfit.
 ''Whenever you go to a play, there are villains and heroes,'' Boras said. ''The problem in this play is fans only know what the player makes, not the owner. My job is to know that and extract the right percentage for the player.''
 Boras is who he is, without apology. He will bluff, bully and bargain teams into submission, preying on the instant ego-gratification needs of owners and players in a cycle of deals that leaves him more powerful by the year.
 Boras may be at the height of his powers as baseball's free-agent swap meet begins, with an elite list of clients that includes Varitek, Drew, Carlos Beltran, Adrian Beltre, Magglio Ordonez, Derek Lowe and Kevin Millwood.
 His clients come willingly. By now, they must know Boras's hardball tactics often leave a player's image smudged. By now, they must know how Boras can make a player rich, but in an outpost of futility. 
 This client-agent association reveals as much about the players as it does about Boras. It is interesting that a shy, quiet type like Beltran, labeled as the It Player of free agency, has chosen Boras to be his bouncer.
 Does Beltran really want Boras to put him in pinstripes or does he need Boras to create that illusion? This winter, the Yankees may come to find out that they are not the ultimate destination for players anymore, not when a World Series is no longer a guarantee, not when free agents like Jason Giambi fizzle in New York, not when Steinbrenner is the resident curmudgeon. This year, the Yankees may be artfully used as decoys by Boras -- particularly in Beltran's case. 
 In June, Beltran was craving anonymity, not the New York market.
 ''I pray to God I can be a great player, but I want to keep my life,'' Beltran told Sports Illustrated. ''I don't want to be hiding from people. It would be difficult to be recognized everywhere, so that I couldn't do things ordinary people can do. I love to go to the grocery store or the movies or go to the mall and be just an ordinary person. In Kansas City they don't know who I am. Same thing when I'm home in Puerto Rico. I like that.''
 By the playoffs, Boras seemed to be a ventriloquist for a bolder Beltran.
 ''When I see an owner who cares about winning, I like it,'' Beltran said in an obvious reference to George Steinbrenner.
 Is Beltran bluffing? Is Boras? Everyone will know in April how sentiment and comfort are rated by Boras's clients when the Yankees and the Red Sox line up for opening day at Fenway. Will Varitek be there? Will Beltran?

 I would like to ask Americans who voted for George W. Bush because of ''moral values'' which moral-value issue tipped the balance for you.
 Is it the tens of thousands (possibly more) of Iraqi civilians dead caused by the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq? 
 Or is it the deceit that President Bush and others used as reasons to start that war? 
 Or is it the billions of dollars of debt your children and grandchildren will be saddled with because of Mr. Bush's borrow-and-spend economic policy?

HEADLINE: France to Sell a Third of Its Nuclear Power Group

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The French government forged ahead on Wednesday with a plan to sell a one-third stake in the nuclear power group Areva on the Paris stock exchange early next year -- a transaction that could raise more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.51 billion).
 The sale, expected in the first half of 2005, would increase the portion of Areva's shares that are publicly traded to 35 to 40 percent, France's finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said in a statement.
 The partial privatization of Areva, the world's largest maker of nuclear reactors, comes as the government-owned company is trying to raise its international profile. 
 The company is competing for an $8 billion contract from China to build four nuclear reactors. Last month it began a $250 million project for the United States government to convert weapons-grade plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel rods for civilian use.
 Areva has a market value of more than 10 billion euros ($12.9 billion), based on a closing price Wednesday of 288.80 euros for nonvoting investment certificates. 
 The company had a net profit of 243 million euros ($313 million) in the first half of this year. 
 Last week the company said, without giving its earnings, that its group revenue for the fiscal year to Sept. 30 rose by 31.6 percent, to 7.7 billion euros.
 ''We are ready,'' Areva's chief executive, Anne Lauvergeon, said of the share sale. ''This increase in our float capital will provide us with the resources we need to continue expanding.''
 The government said the proceeds of the share offering would be used to help cover the costs of dismantling 15 nuclear sites run by the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, the nuclear power agency that holds the bulk of the government's stake in the company.
 Denis Guelen, an analyst at the French brokerage Fideuram Wargny, said that growth prospects for the nuclear power sector remained moderate, especially in Europe, where political opposition to nuclear power is still strong. But soaring economic growth in Asia and increasing awareness of the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, along with the desire to renovate and upgrade existing nuclear sites in North America and Russia, will combine to guarantee ''solid fundamentals'' for the industry in the decades to come, he said.
 Mr. Sarkozy announced the Areva share sale just weeks before his planned resignation at the end of this month. France's most popular politician, Mr. Sarkozy is running for head of the governing Conservative Party before an expected bid for the French presidency in 2007.
 In his final months in office, Mr. Sarkozy has sought to accelerate the privatization of a number of government-run companies, seeking cash to reduce a government deficit that is expected to reach 50 billion euros this year, about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.
 On Tuesday, the government-owned Societe d'Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone, Europe's third-biggest toll-road operator, began selling up to 1.35 billion euros in shares; in September, the state sold 5.1 billion euros worth of shares in France Telecom, bringing its stake in the phone company below 50 percent for the first time. In June, Mr. Sarkozy oversaw the sale of a 35 percent stake in the aircraft engine maker Snecma, raising 1.15 billion euros.
 In addition to Areva, other government-owned groups slated for partial privatization next year include the utility group Electricite de France and Aeroports de Paris, the operator of the capital's two main airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 13, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Thursday about a French government plan to sell a one-third stake in the nuclear power group Areva misstated the period for the company's 7.7 billion euros in revenue ($9.9 billion). It was the first nine months of this year, not the 12 months ended in September. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the political affiliation of the finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, who announced the sale. It is the Union for a Popular Movement, a conservative party. (There is no French Conservative Party.)

HEADLINE: The Road From Here

BYLINE: By Abdullah II. 
Abdullah II is king of Jordan.

DATELINE: Amman, Jordan 

 BODY:
From time to time, history holds moments of great potential, when we can look forward with hope even as we experience crisis and uncertainty. In the Arab-Israeli conflict, just such a moment may be here. With the sad passing of Yasir Arafat, Palestinians have lost a leader who kept their hope of independence alive for more than half a century. Now, an opportunity exists to honor the best of that legacy, in a new drive for progress and peace, in a part of the world that has seen too much bloodshed.
 Today the Arab-Israeli conflict remains the world's central challenge. Israelis and Palestinians both need an end to its bitter violence. So do the global millions who suffer the collateral damage: ongoing extremist violence and deep cynicism about international justice. 
 In 2002, Arab countries took a bold step forward, committing themselves to a two-state solution that includes security guarantees for Israel to live in peace with its neighbors; a sovereign and democratic Palestine; and a process that leads to a comprehensive settlement, addressing the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. 
 The two-state solution recognizes what I and my late father, King Hussein, have long argued. For lasting peace, Israel must be fully integrated into the entire region, from Morocco to Yemen. But this depends on creating an independent Palestinian state, whose people are, at last, able to live in dignity and hope. Unless this happens, there will be no regionwide acceptance of Israel and no real peace. 
 In 2003, the parties agreed on the road map to peace. The United States and the eight leading industrialized nations are also on board. But the process has been trapped in an ongoing cycle of violence. Now, events provide fresh opportunities. New Palestinian leadership can carry forward the vision of a viable, independent Palestine by delivering on the reforms that statehood involves: competent governance, investments in public welfare, fighting corruption, tougher security against terrorism and a real partnership at the peace tables. 
 In Israel, the government can recommit to the road map and move swiftly to withdraw from Gaza and take other confidence-building measures that will refute the charge that its recent policies are intended to sideline the peace process and further divide people. Both sides can now make the compromises that a comprehensive, lasting and just peace requires.
 Just as important, with its elections over, the United States can now refocus on this critical issue. The world's most powerful, most visible democracy has a chance to send a strong message to the region's people, especially its youth -- a message of deeds, not words. That means fulfilling the promise of a rebuilt, violence-free, democratic and sovereign Iraq. And in the spiritual heart of the region it means leading the peace process and insisting that both sides engage in genuine dialogue and live up to their commitments spelled out in the road map -- one that President Bush has said could lead to the creation of a Palestinian state next year. 
 Americans know how important it is to reach the world's Muslims. In the aftermath of 9/11, American leaders pledged that the war on terror was not a war on Islam. They acknowledged Islam's commitment to peace and recognized the great contributions of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims. They called on people of all faiths to stand together, and called on all nations to join the United States in its fight.
 And for good reason. We can't win the war on terror if we don't act together. We Muslims were the first targets of the extremists, whose stated goal is to bring down moderate governments and stop the growth of democratic civil society. My country has played a significant role in the global alliance against terrorism, and more: we have led a regional effort for reform and development to counter the voices of hatred and cynicism. International reports have ranked our country first in the region in educational reform. In the economy, we have encouraged growth and opportunity; in public life, we have emphasized human rights and good governance. 
 My country's vision is of a modern civil society rooted in Arab-Islamic values. The Koran teaches: ''Be just: that is next to piety.'' As a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be unto Him, I am committed to the struggle for tolerance and progress. I believe Jordan's path shows what a homegrown Arab-Islamic model can accomplish in fostering development, combating extremism and providing new hope. 
 At the end of the day, the success of regional reform depends on a renewed commitment to peace and progress, supported by a courageous America. That achievement will bring global healing. Perhaps now, in a moment shaped by both loss and hope, the time has come.

HEADLINE: Accord Set On Efficiency For Cooling

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The combatants in a fight over how much electricity an air-conditioner should use have reached a truce that could eventually lead to savings for building owners.
 Manufacturers and efficiency advocates, after spending much of the last four years fighting in court over standards for residential central air-conditioning equipment, announced on Thursday that they had agreed on standards for equipment in commercial buildings. The agreement ended eight months of negotiations. 
 ''All sides felt it was better to negotiate,'' Steven Nadel, a spokesman for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a joint statement with the manufacturers and the Energy Department. 
 At the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group, the president, William Sutton, said, ''This agreement represents a win for the environment, for consumers and for manufacturers.'' 
 The models, Mr. Sutton said, would also be built to eliminate the use of chemicals called HCFC's, which deplete the ozone layer.
 Under the accord, air-conditioners and heat pumps in commercial buildings would have to be 26 percent more efficient beginning in 2010. Although the Energy Department would have to approve the agreement, it appears to reduce the potential for another protracted battle. For the manufacturers, the accord may also reduce the chance that the states would pass their own standards, creating a patchwork market.
 In a joint statement, David Garman, acting energy under secretary, said, ''Given how contentious appliance standard rule makings can be, I am very happy to hear that a broad segment of energy-efficiency advocates and manufacturers have reached agreement on a preferred approach.'' 
 By 2020, the efficiency advocates said, the new equipment would reduce power demand 7,400 megawatts, the amount produced by seven large coal-fired power plants. The equipment would cost about 10 percent more to buy than what is now available, but operating costs would be lower. That could save building owners a total of $2.4 billion from 2010 to 2020, the advocates said.
 Because most parties in an earlier dispute over residential air-conditioning are partners in the accord, a new confrontation seems highly unlikely. In the earlier fight, the Clinton administration approved in its final days a 30 percent improvement in whole-house air-conditioners. The Bush administration rescinded the rule and tried to substitute a 20 percent improvement. The efficiency advocates sued. Eventually, the 30 percent improvement was upheld.

HEADLINE: Dell Profit Rises 25% as Sales Beat Growth Rate for Industry

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Dell Inc. said yesterday that its quarterly profit climbed 25 percent, propelled by a steady increase in technology spending by American businesses and a surge in sales abroad.
 The company, the leading personal computer maker, said sales to the commercial sector in the United States rose 20 percent, ahead of the overall industry growth rate of just under 12 percent worldwide.
 ''Business I.T. spending has demonstrated steady and consistent strength since the end of last year,'' said Kevin D. Rollins, Dell's chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. ''Businesses are moving back to a scheduled purchasing pattern.'' 
 The company, based in Round Rock, Tex., reported net income of $846 million, or 33 cents a share, for the third quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $677 million, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago.
 Revenue rose 18 percent, to $12.5 billion, from $10.62 billion in the third quarter last year, well in line with analysts' forecasts as well as Dell's predictions.
 ''We're seeing healthy demand in key segments of our business,'' Mr. Rollins said.
 The numbers were helped by a 27 percent sales increase in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 25 percent growth in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan. Dell's unit sales in the Americas grew only 14 percent, Dell executives said, but that still was 3.7 times the rate of the rest of the market.
 Mr. Rollins said that Dell expected to reach its goal of roughly $60 billion in annual revenue by the end of the next fiscal year, a year ahead of projections. 
 The company reported after the close of regular trading. Shares of Dell closed up 40 cents, at $37.25, then rose as much as 78 cents more in after-hours trading.
 Dell said it sold eight million personal computers, notebooks, servers and other devices, setting a record in unit sales for any quarter. 
 Mr. Rollins, said the company gained market share in the personal computer market, now 18.1 percent of the worldwide personal computer market, up from 16.9 percent for the last year. 
 ''It's hard to find disappointment in these numbers,'' said Charles R. Wolf, a technology analyst with Needham & Company, who owns Dell shares and has a buy rating on the stock.
 But Alan Promisel, computer analyst at IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass., cautioned that Dell's success in the business market did not mean that corporate technology spending would return to its former pace anytime soon. ''I think there's still a reserved approach in enterprise buying,'' Mr. Promisel said. ''The economy is improving, but it's not resulting in a full refresh of technology that I.T. managers would like to see.''
 Dell also showed improvement in its operating margins, which increased from 8.6 to 8.8 points, approaching the company's goal of 9 points. 
 Dell expects fourth-quarter shipments to be about 20 percent higher than in the same quarter last year. This is expected to lead to revenue in the fourth quarter of about $13.5 billion, up 17 percent, and earnings of 36 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Rhinestones Are Next Door to Glass

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Death is not usually a good career move, even for artists. With the work of creation definitively ended, the final judgment of posterity looms. Biographers and scholars set to work, burnishing a reputation or dismantling it as they make startling discoveries in sock drawers or obscure troves of juvenilia.
 In the two decades since his unexpected death in 1983, Tennessee Williams has fared better than many. His major plays are revived consistently on important stages -- both ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' are expected on Broadway in the spring -- and a previously unknown Williams play from 1938, ''Not About Nightingales,'' unearthed in a Texas archive in the 1990's, was recently celebrated in London and New York as a significant addition to the writer's oeuvre.
 The success of that discovery naturally raised hope for ''Five by Tenn,'' a selection of Williams one-acts -- four exhumed from that Texas archive -- that opened last night at City Center, in a Manhattan Theater Club production. But in this case there is little cause for excitement. The newly discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. More like rhinestones. And to quote ''Streetcar's'' Stella, that's next door to glass. 
 The director, Michael Kahn, who presented a slightly different lineup of plays under the same title as part of the Kennedy Center's summer-long Williams festival this year, employs an actor portraying Williams himself to introduce the plays. The gesture, which is meant to underscore the personal nature of his writing, has a faint whiff of the apology about it, as if the plays would not merit our interest without the direct intervention of the great artist himself. (If that is the case, why produce them at all?)
 As played with much eye-twinkling by Jeremy Lawrence, this faux-Williams provides morsels of autobiography and scene-setting that do little to excuse the plays' weaknesses and also serve to help stretch the evening's running time to a wearying three hours.
 The first play, ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, is introduced as a thinly disguised slice of the playwright's own experience. Its principal characters prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' At a lakeside retreat, a terribly sensitive teenage boy (Cameron Folmar, sufficiently sensitive, hardly teenage) keeps his needy mama company while she frets about their uncertain future.
 The boy is appalled by a letter from his father urging him to get a menial job. His mother (Penny Fuller), a flighty, faded Southern belle who has lost her husband but none of her self-absorption, upbraids him for his dreamy nature. Glimmers of Williams's inimitable wit percolate, as when the young man scornfully describes his hatred of fire escapes: ''Don't they think people who live in apartments need to escape from anything besides fire?'' The play is just a fragment, a character sketch truncated by a glaringly melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the unmistakable hallmarks of Williams's style: it is compassionate, vivid, lyrical and true.
 Sadly, in the rest of the plays presented here, that voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. It is almost entirely absent from ''The Fat Man's Wife,'' from 1938. Here Williams is obviously attempting to write in a style entirely alien to him, trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size. 
 A grievously miscast Kathleen Chalfant plays the soignee, sophisticated Vera Cartwright, a Manhattan wife with a rich, boorish husband and a sensitive young admirer (a playwright, natch) who implores her to run off with him after they've swapped soulful confidences at a party. She gently declines, shedding a noble tear and gallantly sending him on his way: ''Now run along and be good!'' (Sniffle sniffle.) It's a measure of the play's mortifying silliness that Ms. Chalfant, who is rarely less than wonderful, is not only not wonderful, she's truly, inescapably bad.
 ''Adam and Eve on a Ferry,'' from 1939, is a mere curiosity. David Rasche plays none other than D.H. Lawrence, one of Williams's literary idols, in this comic sketch about a repressed, miserable woman (Ms. Fuller) who turns to the great novelist to help her come to terms with her regrets over a brief sensual encounter. The joke that brings the play to a sudden end suggests that, like the other early works presented here, ''Adam and Eve'' was written as an exercise or an exploration, at a time when the young writer was churning out plays, poems and stories with ''amazing profusion,'' as his biographer Lyle Leverich wrote. They bear the stamp of brisk, determined effort rather than heartfelt inspiration.
 The two plays dating from Williams's later years, after he'd risen to prominence as one of the country's most celebrated writers, are more theatrically sophisticated, but here, too, the authentic voice is rarely heard. The two-character chamber piece ''I Can't Imagine Tomorrow,'' from 1970, is the only previously produced and published play in this collection. But Williams had lost his artistic way in the preceding decade -- his last significant success was ''The Night of the Iguana'' in 1961 -- and was clearly casting about to find new, more fashionable forms for his personal vision.
 Here he apes the economical bleakness of Samuel Beckett. The characters, referred to simply as ''One'' and ''Two,'' are a shy, stuttering man (Mr. Rasche) and a dying woman (Ms. Chalfant) attempting to rub away the hard edges of their loneliness by keeping company. Both Mr. Rasche and Ms. Chalfant bring quiet intensity to these archly enigmatic figures, but Williams's rambling, symbolic and just plain obscure dialogue defeats them.
 The major disappointment of the evening is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality, a theme that haunts the fringes of several major plays.
 Williams often wrote with piercing empathy of the endless, sometimes desperate quest for affection, but he takes the idea to a seamy extreme here. His depiction of a New Orleans transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor he picks up in a bar is pitilessly frank, even clinical. (Tennessee Williams, clinical?) After watching Candy (the fine Mr. Folmar), a deluded antiques dealer, dodge and flirt and flatter in the face of persistent indifference, disgust and physical abuse, you may find you want to give the poor thing a swift kick, too.
 Among Williams's greatest artistic gifts was his ability to awaken compassion for the misfit and the lovelorn by revealing the poetry in their souls. But Candy's hasn't got so much as a sonnet in it, despite her professed affection for the art form. It's strange and a little sad that, in a rare depiction of a frankly gay character, this most compassionate (and gay) playwright should bring us to the edge of contempt.

HEADLINE: State's Failure to Pay Off Debt to U.S. Will Cost Employers

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The state's failure to pay back the federal government fully for nearly $1 billion the state borrowed to cover the costs of post-Sept. 11 unemployment benefits will result in the imposition of a temporary tax on employers for most jobs in New York.
 The levy, coming as statewide unemployment is dipping, is another lingering effect of the terrorist attack in New York City and shows how it continues to ripple through the state's overall economy more than three years later.
 By the end of January, more than 440,000 employers in the state will face an increase, on average, of $21 per employee in federal unemployment taxes to help pay off the debt the state incurred in 2002. As of late last month, the amount owed totaled more than $587 million, according to federal Department of Labor statistics. The fee could grow to $42 per employee if the debt is not completely erased by next November. 
 The state borrowed nearly $1 billion from the federal unemployment insurance system in 2002 as job losses from the attack helped drain the state's own unemployment insurance reserves, said Robert M. Lillpopp, a spokesman for the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki. Though the state paid back some of its debt, it missed a Wednesday deadline to get rid of all of it, prompting the federal government to begin collecting for itself by reducing certain tax credits that most employers usually claim.
 ''As a direct result of the World Trade Center disaster which, at the time, affected over 105,000 people laid off, you had a very unexpected drain on the state's trust fund,'' Mr. Lillpopp said. ''We could not anticipate something of the magnitude of 9/11 and then, when you add on the effects on Wall Street, which is located in New York, it made it even worse; you had another drain.''
 The terrorist attack came around the same time a national recession was bearing down on New York. While the state unemployment insurance fund might have withstood the economic downturn, the attack made it harder to keep the fund solvent, Mr. Lillpopp said. Because the fund is supported by payments from employers, and paid according to a formula based on how many workers are employed, the extreme job losses served as a kind of financial double blow: More funds were needed just at the time fewer employees were in the system.
 But Andrew Stettner, a policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group for the unemployed, said that New York was not well prepared for the recession in the first place because it was holding inadequate reserves in its unemployment insurance trust fund at the end of 2000, before the downturn began.
 ''At the start of the recession, New York had less reserves than any other state, except for Texas and North Dakota, when you compare the size of the reserves to the size of the state's economy,'' said Mr. Stettner, who said that other states passed laws to improve the overall solvency of their funds and more effectively used private borrowing. He said New Jersey, where the economy also suffered from the attack, was not forced to borrow money from the federal government, ''because they saved in advance.''
 Mr. Lillpopp said new legislation to make the state's fund more durable, including, possibly, ways to build up its reserves, had been drafted but not yet introduced. 
 Robert B. Ward, the director of research for the Business Council of New York, a lobbying group, said that paying the tax would be the least harmful way of dealing with the federal debt. But he criticized Mr. Pataki and state lawmakers, of both parties, for failing to improve the business climate so that more private-sector jobs could be created. 
 ''The fundamental problem is we are not creating enough jobs in New York,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Insurgents Attack Fiercely in North, Storming Police Stations in Mosul

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Friday, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The sounds of automatic rifles firing, rocket-propelled grenades exploding and helicopters buzzing through the sky reverberated through the northern city of Mosul on Thursday, with a ferocity that took some residents back to the early days of the invasion of Iraq.
 Halla Mukdad, a professor of economics and business administration at Mosul University, said she could not leave her home. ''The armed people are right outside our house door,'' she said. 
 In the spring of 2003, it was American armor rolling in. Now, it was insurgents -- storming police stations and stealing guns, ammunition and body armor; setting fire to buildings and police cars; and even making off with a generator. 
 Later, gun battles with American and Iraqi forces broke out at the five Tigris River bridges the insurgents had seized. Kiowa helicopters swooped above the palm trees and sand-colored buildings, surveying the streets. 
 Mosul, the third largest city in Iraq, has been torn by deadly violence throughout the occupation, with car bombings and assassinations becoming almost a routine part of daily life. 
 But the assaults have grown so incendiary over the last two days, the Stryker Brigade, the light-armored mobile unit charged with controlling the region, is pulling its battalion out of the Falluja operation to send it north. Three Stryker battalions are already in the Mosul area. 
 American commanders have said insurgent leaders probably fled from Falluja in the days or weeks before the offensive there and may be organizing the wave of counterattacks roiling central and northern Iraq. Mosul has seen the toughest fighting outside Falluja. 
 In the morning, as the attacks on the police stations began, 13 sedans full of jihadists pulled up to the police academy. They opened fire with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. When they realized no one was inside, they broke open the doors and began looting.
 The same thing happened at the Zuhoor police station, where the generator was carted away.
 One group laid siege to the headquarters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the country's main Kurdish political parties. The building once housed the local offices of the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein and was set back from the residential areas. A half-dozen Kurdish militiamen managed to hold off the attackers with heavy machine guns.
 Near Mosul University, insurgents chased down two vehicles used by the Iraqi National Guard and set fire to them.
 The governor of Nineveh Province had imposed a round-the-clock curfew starting Wednesday, when battles first flared. Few people were out on the streets on Thursday. But they seemed to be staying indoors more out of fear of the fighting than out of obedience to authority.
 ''I've got to stay home because of the events,'' said Sheiban Sabir, a salesman in a pest extermination company. ''It's too scary to venture out in such an insane time.''
 The American counteroffensive had begun in an area called the Yarmouk Circle and later spread to other neighborhoods in the south of the city, said Lt. Col. Paul Hastings, a spokesman for the task force that includes the Stryker Brigade. Insurgents melted away whenever the brigade's high-speed vehicles approached, he said.
 Colonel Hastings said the insurgents had made only limited inroads. ''There are pockets of insurgents,'' he said. ''The city is not falling apart by any stretch of the imagination.''
 An Iraqi reporter for The New York Times who drove around Mosul on Thursday saw some Stryker vehicles in the suburbs and on the highway to the airport, but few in the city. He encountered no Iraqi policemen, but saw carloads of insurgents brandishing Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenade launchers
 The government center in the middle of town came under attack by guerrillas. A self-proclaimed holy warrior who gave his name as Abu Ibrahim said by telephone that his comrades had overrun the center by 6:30 p.m. But a government employee, Said Jasim Muhammad, said by telephone Thursday evening that American and Iraqi forces had defended the center.
 ''The building is still under American protection, and I'm in it right now,'' Mr. Muhammad said.
 There were other failed attacks. The guerrillas tried to seize a television and radio broadcasting building but were repelled by security forces. They stormed a pediatric hospital, only to have the workers persuade them to leave. 
 Mosul is a diverse city with large numbers of Sunni Muslims, Christians and Kurds. It seems clear that the Sunnis are spearheading the attacks. It is less obvious who is leading them. 
 On Wednesday, as guerrillas fought American troops in eastern neighborhoods, the American military began dropping leaflets picturing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who is Iraq's most wanted insurgent leader. 
 Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, commander of the Stryker Brigade, said in an e-mail message that the leaflet drop was nothing new. The military just wanted to remind people that there was a $25 million reward for Mr. Zarqawi, he said.
 In the early hours of Friday, mosque loudspeakers in a fundamentalist neighborhood called Al Ar Rabi blared a simple message: ''Don't go outside tomorrow because it will be a big day.''

HEADLINE: As Baby Boom Ages, Era of Guaranteed Retirement Income Fades

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
WE live in an age when a lot of promises regarding retirement are going to be broken. Just how they are broken, and what replaces them, will have profound effects on the future of the industrial nations that have dominated the world economy in the last century.
 What is at stake is a reversal of perhaps the most important economic trend in developed countries since World War II, that of guaranteeing financial security for their citizens. In most major countries, governments came to provide health care and an assured pension. In the United States, some of that came from employer-financed health care and pension plans, but the results were often similar. 
 Now, increased competition stemming from globalization has left many companies scrambling for ways to cut costs. And many pension and health care plans are pay-as-you-go systems whose generous benefits while the baby boomers were working now seem unsustainable as that huge population group begins to retire.
 In Europe the problems have been clear for years, although governments have been slow to enact unpopular changes. But there is a widespread expectation that change is inevitable. Bond-rating agencies cite that belief as a reason for not cutting sovereign debt ratings, and it is likely that spending by Europeans has been depressed by worries over just what will be there when they retire.
 In the United States, an understanding of what must be done is less well formed. While some companies, like United Airlines, have eliminated defined-benefit pension plans in the glare of publicity, many more have quietly frozen their plans -- keeping employees from earning additional benefits -- or have barred new employees from joining plans. The number of employees in traditional plans fell to 17.2 million last year, down 23 percent since 1988.
 Pension plans seemed to hold their own in the late 90's, when a soaring stock market allowed companies to assume that they did not need to put money in. But the bubble burst, and now the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the numbers at some companies that may be using generous assumptions to make their pension picture look prettier than it would otherwise appear.
 Workers without traditional pension plans generally have defined contribution plans like 401(k)'s, but these leave the risk of market losses with the employee.
 Similarly, it appears likely that President Bush will propose a revamping of Social Security that would reduce guaranteed benefits at some point while creating savings accounts that leave the worker with the possibility -- but not the assurance -- of coming out ahead.
 One can, as Mr. Bush does, hail the trend as part of an ''ownership society,'' in which individuals will prosper if their investments do well, and the markets' strong performance in the 1980's and 90's has left many Americans confident. The hostility to elected governments seen in Europe -- partly due to the financial strictures officials have proposed -- is not evident in the United States.
 But there is a risk of a negative cycle as the increased risks become understood. Americans could conclude that they need to save more and spend less to offset these risks, thereby slowing the economy and perhaps worsening the performance of the investments, which could cause them to want to save even more. And the transition to a new Social Security system must involve benefit reductions in the near future or a huge transfer from other tax revenue, meaning either tax increases or rising budget deficits.
 Even if there are more winners than losers from such new models, societies will have to confront what they want to do for the losers. Sorting out the new reality will be a major challenge on both sides of the Atlantic.

PERSON: Yasir Arafat

HEADLINE: Yasir Arafat, Palestinian Leader and Mideast Provocateur, Is Dead at 75

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat, who died yesterday morning in Paris, was the wily and enigmatic father of Palestinian nationalism who for almost 40 years symbolized his people's longing for a distinct political identity and an independent state. He was 75. 
 No other individual so embodied the Palestinians' plight: their dispersal, their statelessness, their hunger for a return to a homeland lost to Israel. Mr. Arafat was once seen as a romantic hero and praised as a statesman, but his luster and reputation faded over time. A brilliant navigator of political currents in opposition, once in power he proved more tactician than strategist, and a leader who rejected crucial opportunities to achieve his declared goal. 
 At the end of his life, he governed Palestinians from an almost three-year confinement by Israel to his headquarters in Ramallah, on the West Bank. While many Palestinians continued to revere him, others came to see him as undemocratic and his administration as corrupt, as they faced growing poverty, lawlessness and despair over prospects for statehood. 
 A co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1994 for his agreement to work toward peaceful coexistence with Israel, Mr. Arafat began his long political career with high-profile acts of anti-Israel terrorism.
 In the 1960's, he pioneered what became known as ''television terrorism'' -- air piracy and innovative forms of mayhem staged for maximum propaganda value. Among the more startling deeds carried out by groups under his authority was the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. In 1985, a group linked to Mr. Arafat but apparently acting independently seized the Achille Lauro cruise ship and then threw overboard an elderly American Jew in a wheelchair.
 In 2000, after rejecting a land-for-peace deal from Israel that he considered insufficient, Mr. Arafat presided over the Palestinians as they waged a mix of guerrilla warfare and terror against Israeli troops and civilians that has lasted more than four years.
 Indeed, shifting between peace talks and acts of violence was the defining feature of his political life. In his emotional appeal for a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, he wore a holster while waving an olive branch. After his pledge of peace with Israel in 1993, Palestinians associated with him carried out suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He officially condemned such violence but called for ''martyrs by the millions'' to rise for the Palestinian cause. 
 Mr. Arafat assumed many poses. But the image that endures -- and the one he clearly relished -- was that of the Arab fighter, the grizzled, scruffy-bearded guerrilla in olive-green military fatigues and his trademark checkered head scarf, carefully folded in the elongated diamond shape of what was once Palestine.
 He seemed to thrive when under siege. Surrounded in the spring of 2002 by Israeli tanks in two rooms of his compound in Ramallah, he cried out, ''Oh God, grant me a martyr's death.''
 Until 1988, he repeatedly rejected recognition of Israel, insisting on armed struggle and terror campaigns. He opted for diplomacy only after his embrace of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 -- and the collapse of the Soviet Union -- left his movement politically disgraced and financially bankrupt, with neither power nor leverage.
 In September 1993, he achieved world acclaim by signing a limited peace treaty with Israel, a declaration of principles that provided for mutual recognition and outlined a transition to Palestinian autonomy in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories that Israel had controlled since its decisive victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The culmination of secret negotiations in Oslo, the agreement was blessed by President Bill Clinton and sealed with a stunning handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Mr. Arafat on the White House lawn.
 But in 2000, he walked away from a proffered settlement based on the Oslo accords proposed by Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- the biggest compromises Israel had ever offered.
 The Israeli proposal appeared to meet most of his earlier demands, but Mr. Arafat held out for more. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak charged that he had failed to respond with proposals of his own, effectively torpedoing the American-brokered talks. The Palestinians had a different interpretation, saying that despite being pushed into negotiations before they were ready, they had nonetheless responded with counterproposals but that the Barak offers kept shifting and ultimately fell short of their needs. 
 After the talks collapsed in 2000, Ariel Sharon, then in the opposition in Israel, visited the Jerusalem plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque in late September. Palestinians erupted in protest, igniting what came to be called the second intifada. That campaign has killed more than 900 Israelis and almost 3,000 Palestinians, and plunged the Palestinian Authority into armed conflict. 
 Mr. Arafat died without achieving any of the essential goals he had espoused at various stages of his career: the destruction of Israel, the peace with the Jewish state he backed after 1988, or the creation of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Moreover, the political concessions that produced the 1993 Oslo accords -- accords for which he, Mr. Rabin and Shimon Peres of Israel shared the Nobel Peace Prize -- deepened both the admiration and hatred of him. Few Arabs or Israelis were neutral about Mr. Arafat or his Oslo deal with Israel.
 Mr. Arafat leaves an ambiguous legacy. He succeeded in creating not only a coherent national movement, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization, but also the very consciousness that made it possible. A master of public relations, he made the world aware of Palestine as a distinct entity. And he helped persuade Palestinians, who now number five million to six million, to think of themselves as a people with a right to sovereignty. ''He put the Palestinian cause on the map and mobilized behind his leadership the broadest cross section imaginable of Palestinians,'' said Khalil E. Jahshan, an Arab-American political activist who knew him well for more than a decade.
 His detractors, however, grew more numerous over time. Mr. Arafat, those critics contended, betrayed the Palestinian and Arab cause to maintain his own power. They called him a traitor for having accepted what Hisham Sharabi, the Palestinian scholar and former supporter, called an Arab Bantustan, an entity that was neither politically coherent nor economically viable. Critics noted that while ''President Arafat'' toured the globe being welcomed by world leaders, Israel doubled the size of its settlements on what was envisioned as soil for a future Palestinian state.
 Other detractors argued that he had waited too long to accept political reality. His reluctance to recognize Israel's existence and renounce the violence that claimed hundreds of Israeli and other lives prolonged the pain of the Palestinians and left a new generation stateless, ill treated under Israeli occupation and by most Arab governments. Palestinians in many Arab countries, including Syria and Lebanon, were restricted to camps and denied citizenship, while their host governments spoke in heartfelt tones of the Palestinian cause.
 Both admirers and enemies agreed that like King Hussein of Jordan, his late rival and eventual partner in peace with Israel, Mr. Arafat was a survivor. Having experienced perhaps 40 attempts on his life by Israelis and Arabs, he was strengthened as a revolutionary leader by single-mindedness in pursuit of his dream and uncanny energy. Yet after Oslo, his enemies said he continued living mainly because Israel permitted him to do so. 
 Until 1991, when he wed Suha Tawil, his Palestinian secretary, and had a daughter, Zahwa, he was married only to his cause. He slept and ate little, took no vacations and neither drank nor smoked. People viewed his role in various ways -- terrorist, statesman, dreamer, pragmatist, his people's warrior, his people's peacemaker. Even admirers described him as a chameleon. Virtually all the biographies about him express bewilderment about his actions and character, about what an Israeli author, Danny Rubinstein, in his book ''The Mystery of Arafat,'' called ''this strange phenomenon.''
 Many Palestinians compared him to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founder and first prime minister, seeing him as an Arab pioneer who struggled to lead his people back to their promised land. Many Israelis, by contrast, regarded him as an archterrorist, an opportunist who endorsed peace merely as a tactic to destroy Israel -- ''a beast on two legs,'' as the late Israeli leader Menachem Begin once called him. 
 After the Oslo accords, Mr. Arafat became as controversial among Arabs, especially Palestinians: revered by many as the father of their country, reviled by others as an autocrat, a divisive and sometimes indecisive buffoon, a traitor. Even many Arab supporters of his 1993 agreements with Israel eventually came to loathe him for what they saw as his political duplicity, his administration's endemic corruption and his dictatorial tendencies. 
 An exasperating and mercurial man, Mr. Arafat, with his ever-present silver-plated .357 Magnum, was one of the most recognizable of world figures. He was known by many names: Abu Ammar, his nom de guerre; the ''chairman,'' after he became leader of the P.L.O. in 1969; and the ''old man,'' the name he once said he preferred because in Arabic it conjures an image of a beloved uncle. At the end of his life, he referred to himself as ''general,'' often speaking of himself in the third person. 
 Over the years, ''old man'' became apt. His once-taut stomach gave way with age to paunch despite his frequent walks and the treadmill behind his office. What remained of his hair, almost always hidden by his trademark head scarf, turned gray. The face, with its three-day stubble, became visibly lined, his eyes weary.

The Young Guerrilla
 The mystery surrounding Mr. Arafat starts early, as accounts of his origins vary. The man who became ''Mr. Palestine'' was probably not born there. He has claimed to have been born on Aug. 4, 1929, in Jerusalem, or alternatively in Gaza. What seems certain is that this son of a lower-middle-class merchant spent much of his childhood being shuttled among relatives in Cairo, Gaza and Jerusalem after his mother, who came from a prominent Jerusalem family, died when he was 4.
 In 1949, he began studying engineering at Cairo University, where he was prominent in Palestinian student affairs. When Israel, Britain and France invaded Egypt in 1956, Mr. Arafat, as an Egyptian military reservist, is said to have taken a course in which he learned how to use mines and explosives, skills that proved useful. That same year, he also began wearing his trademark kaffiyeh, which impressed both Arabs and Westerners when he first traveled to Europe in a Palestinian student delegation.
 After graduating, he worked as an engineer in Egypt and moved first to Saudi Arabia, then to Kuwait in 1957, where he plunged into clandestine Palestinian nationalist activities.
 In October 1959, he and four other Palestinians founded Al Fatah, or the Conquest, which later became the core of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 From the beginning, Mr. Arafat was intent on building a revolutionary organization with three hallmarks: unity, independence and relevance. He knew that all three were essential to prevent the Arab nations, torn by bitter rivalries, from exploiting the Palestinian cause for their own purposes. He spent brief stints in prison in Egypt, Lebanon and Syria. 
 In May 1964, Egypt created the P.L.O. under Arab League auspices, but only as a front for the Arab nations. Ahmed Shukairy, an Egyptian bureaucrat who headed the P.L.O. and had never held a gun, resented Mr. Arafat and Al Fatah, denouncing them as ''enemies'' of the liberation movement.
 The 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which brought humiliating defeat to the Arabs' conventional armies, gave Mr. Arafat's group a chance to become heroes to Arabs desperately in need of some. But it still took Mr. Arafat two years to wrest control of the P.L.O. from the lower-key Palestinians to whom the Arab states had entrusted it.
 His genius for attracting media attention became evident in the spring of 1968, when he made his first appearance on the cover of Time magazine.
 That March, the Israeli Army attacked Karameh, the Jordanian town east of the Jordan River where Al Fatah had set up headquarters. Mr. Arafat insisted that his commandos not retreat. After the Israelis withdrew, he staged a victory celebration around several destroyed Israeli tanks that was attended by representatives from many Arab countries and, of course, the news media.
 Calling Karameh ''the first victory of the Arabs against the state of Israel,'' Mr. Arafat, with his kaffiyeh and Kalashnikov, became an instant sensation and a leading spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Money and volunteers poured in. Guerrilla training camps sprang up in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and Al Fatah became paramount among Palestinian guerrilla groups.
 At the same time, wrote Abu Iyad, a late top aide to Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian National Council, the P.L.O.'s parliamentary body, adopted Al Fatah's goal: ''Creating a democratic society in Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews would live together in complete equality.''
 Though such a state would have meant the destruction of Israel, Mr. Arafat and other Palestinians kept openly advocating it until the early 1980's. 

The Evicted Guest
 The guerrillas' power grew steadily in Jordan, to which 380,000 Palestinians had fled after Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, joining others who had arrived in 1948 when Israel was founded. By 1970, thousands of guerrillas were there, many of them adherents of Al Fatah.
 Spurred on by Palestinian radicals, Mr. Arafat committed what was to be the first of several blunders: He countenanced an attempt to wrest power from King Hussein, whose grandfather, a religious and tribal leader from Saudi Arabia, had been placed in charge of the country when Britain recognized its independence in 1923.
 Palestinian guerrillas began interfering with highway traffic, controlling Palestinian refugee camps, clashing with the Jordanian Army and systematically defying the government. In September 1970 -- later known to Palestinians as Black September -- King Hussein sent troops and armor into Amman, his capital, to suppress the P.L.O. After days of shelling refugee camps where some 60,000 Palestinians lived, the army drove the would-be usurpers out of Jordan. 
 Conservative estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. Mr. Arafat, who made his way unharmed to Cairo, later claimed that Jordan's Army had killed 25,000. By the following summer, the army had nullified the P.L.O. as a military power in Jordan. Sapped and shaken, the guerrilla movement drifted into Lebanon. 
 In Lebanon's atmosphere of banking secrecy, duty-free trade and political freedom, Al Fatah expanded its political and military institutions as never before. Working among some 400,000 Palestinians in the country, the P.L.O. built its own police force, clinics and hospitals, a research center and a network of business interests that made it a virtual state within a state.
 Moreover, it set about developing a formidable military arsenal.
 By 1974, the P.L.O. became, in effect, the sole representative of the Palestinian people, and that November, Mr. Arafat became the first Palestinian leader to plead his people's cause before the General Assembly.
 Mr. Arafat and his P.L.O. seemed at their peak, but as he had done in Jordan, he soon overplayed his hand. In 1975, tensions between Palestinians and Lebanese helped set off the Lebanese civil war. Despite some antagonism, he maintained his headquarters in Beirut for several years, and during this period armed Palestinians based in southern Lebanon harassed northern Israel.
 Sensing an opportunity to rid itself of Mr. Arafat and his movement, Israel invaded Lebanon and laid siege to Beirut in 1982. General Sharon, who later complained that he should have killed Mr. Arafat in Lebanon when he had the chance, dealt the Palestinians heavy blows before an agreement sponsored by Washington led to the withdrawal of thousands of P.L.O. guerrillas in August 1982. The guerrillas scattered to eight Arab cities, with their leaders fleeing to Tunis, the new Palestinian headquarters.
 Mr. Arafat ventured back to Lebanon in 1983. But rebel Palestinian guerrillas backed by Syria challenged and besieged him and his commandos in northern Lebanon, shelling their positions. After a six-week siege in December, the anti-Arafat Palestinians drove him out.
 Thus Mr. Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization lost a base of military operations near Israel, as well as a sense of unity. And in moving to Tunis, a political backwater, he also jeopardized his organization's relevance in any peace talks.

The Pragmatic Survivor
 Mr. Arafat still managed to stage a limited revival. Traveling incessantly in Arab countries, he refilled his organization's depleted coffers and commanded world attention, especially when he escaped death in 1985 in an Israeli attack on his compound.
 But weakened and increasingly on the margins of Arab politics, he and the P.L.O. leaders gradually became convinced that political survival demanded a shift in both propaganda and tactical courses.
 The man who had vowed in 1969 to ignite ''armed revolution in all parts of our Palestinian territory'' in order ''to make of it a war of liberation'' against Israel, realized that while he had exhorted and overseen many armed actions against Israel, the terrorism had never amounted to a war of liberation. He and his advisers became increasingly convinced that Israel could not be vanquished by force.
 Moreover, the cold war was ending; the Soviet Union, a crucial patron, was broke and uninterested in his cause. The only Arab nation that had succeeded in reclaiming land lost to Israel was Egypt, whose president, Anwar el-Sadat, had been denounced by Mr. Arafat as an American ''stooge.'' Increasingly, however, the United States seemed like the only power that could press Israel to make political concessions.
 The outbreak of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising that erupted without the P.L.O.'s approval or encouragement in the Israeli-occupied territories in late 1987, also pushed Mr. Arafat toward greater pragmatism, if not moderation.
 In November 1988, after considerable American prodding, the P.L.O. accepted the United Nations resolution that called for recognition of Israel and a renunciation of terrorism.
 Yet this achievement was soon eclipsed by yet another miscalculation: Mr. Arafat's support for President Hussein in the Persian Gulf war enraged his remaining wealthy Arab patrons. The Persian Gulf states and other backers cut off at least $100 million in annual support, and the P.L.O. became even more isolated.
 Mr. Arafat, however, did not see it that way, and later claimed that he had not sided with the Iraqi dictator. In an interview in Tunis soon after the gulf war, he insisted that the P.L.O. was at its ''peak'' and that he was ''more popular than ever before'' with the ''Arab masses, the Muslim nation, the third world.''
 But with his coffers bare and Palestinians increasingly calling for his ouster, he had little choice but to grab the lifeline of peace talks that Israel had thrown him. Though Prime Minister Rabin was initially reluctant to engage the P.L.O. in secret peace talks, his fear of the growing power of Hamas, the militant Palestinian Islamic movement that had taken hold under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, was stronger than his disdain for Mr. Arafat and his bedraggled guerrillas.
 Mr. Arafat endorsed the Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in Madrid in October 1991, with Palestinians (but not the P.L.O.) taking part. The Arab participants sought a settlement under which Israel would yield land it occupied. Concurrently, in early 1992, secret contacts between representatives of the P.L.O. and Israel got under way in Tel Aviv. The talks continued, at Oslo and other sites, and by early September 1993, the essence of the proposed pact was generally known: mutual recognition and the creation of self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, with that autonomy envisioned as the beginning of a larger transfer of authority to the Palestinians in the occupied lands.
 The Oslo peace accords of 1993 were the first between Israeli officials and the P.L.O., and many Palestinians and Israelis argue that with the organization and even his own Fatah so divided about the accords, only Mr. Arafat could have secured their approval.
 But many diplomats and scholars say he could have secured a better deal for the Palestinians much earlier had he not placed priority on his organization's survival and unity rather than on establishing autonomy and a state on any sliver of his people's original land that he could secure.
 In 1978, Mr. Arafat joined most Arab nations in rejecting Mr. Sadat's peace with Israel under the Camp David accords. But unlike the others, Jordan and the P.L.O. would have had something to gain by taking part. The accords provided for an end to Israeli occupation of vast sections of the West Bank and Gaza and for ''autonomy'' for the Palestinians there, the possibility of eventually establishing the kind of national autonomy the P.L.O. had been seeking since 1974.
 William B. Quandt, a scholar and former American official who was intimately involved in Israeli-Arab diplomacy for years, said even the Camp David accords would probably have provided a better deal than the one Mr. Arafat ultimately accepted in 1993. ''In 1975, there were only 10,000 Israelis on the West Bank,'' he said. Today, there are 225,000 in the West Bank and 200,000 more Jews in East Jerusalem. 
 Some of Mr. Arafat's most euphoric and frustrating moments occurred after the 1993 Oslo accords. Among the highlights was his triumphal return to Gaza in July 1994. Welcomed by tens of thousands of cheering Palestinians and a city bedecked with the red, green, black and white colors of the Palestinian flag, he established the first Palestinian government.
 The assassination of Mr. Rabin by a Jewish hard-liner in November 1995 was a personal and political blow to Mr. Arafat, according to several associates, including Edward G. Abington, the American consul general in Jerusalem until mid-1997. Mr. Abington said Mr. Arafat ''broke down and sobbed over the phone'' after learning that Mr. Rabin had been assassinated. 
 But in January 1996, the Palestinian leader presided over one of the freest elections ever held among Arabs. Some 85 percent of the Palestinian electorate chose from a bewildering array of 700 candidates for an 88-member Palestinian Council.
 With 88 percent of the vote for him as president, Mr. Arafat became the undisputed leader of his people -- no longer (or so it seemed) dismissible by Israelis as a terrorist who derived his authority from the gun, or by Islamic nationalists who had assailed him as the hand-picked collaborator of Israel and the United States. ''This is a new era,'' he said after the 1996 elections. ''This is the foundation of our Palestinian state.''

The Besieged Symbol
 Such optimism proved short-lived. The Palestinian Authority was soon locked in increasingly bitter struggles with Hamas, which insisted on the continuing need to stage terrorist attacks not only against Israeli soldiers and settlers in their midst, but also on civilians inside Israel. 
 Opposition to Mr. Arafat and his Oslo accords also increased among secular Palestinians. Some of the most vehement critics accused him of having betrayed the Palestinian cause.
 Palestinians grew ever more critical of his autocratic style and what they called his inept stewardship, the brutal, arrogant methods of his 14 security services, his crackdown on dissenters and the corruption among the ''outsiders'' who had accompanied him from Tunis.
 In Israel, opposition was also building to what Mr. Arafat had once called the ''peace of the brave.'' After Mr. Rabin's assassination, a series of lethal suicide attacks by Hamas helped elect the hawkish government of Benjamin Netanyahu in May 1996.
 Palestinian hopes for economic development were also repeatedly dashed, partly by punitive Israeli actions that denied Palestinians jobs in Israel and work at home. In 1996, the border with Gaza was sealed by Israel for 3 days of every 10. By 1997, three years after Mr. Arafat's triumphal return to Gaza, the Palestinian economy was stagnant and per-capita annual income in Gaza had declined by $100, to $1,050. Refugee camps remained mired in squalor.
 Mr. Arafat's penchant for trying -- once more -- to satisfy all constituencies further undermined confidence in his leadership. Successive Palestinian crackdowns on Hamas and other militants invariably gave way to deals, pledges of forgiveness and rounds of kisses.
 Still, Mr. Arafat presided over an autonomous Palestinian sector that was, relative to most Arab states, tolerant and politically free-wheeling. And his popularity prevailed relative to challengers.
 Ever the careful balancer, he insisted on making decisions alone and in private. Indeed, he found himself increasingly isolated in his final years, with almost all his former close aides having been killed over time by Israeli or Arab assassins.
 Plagued by a neurological illness that doctors said stemmed from an airplane crash in the Libyan desert that nearly killed him in 1992, Mr. Arafat slowed down. No longer able to work his legendary 18-hour days, he was forced to delegate some power, if not real authority, as he grew ever more frail. His trembling lower lip and shaking hands increased Palestinian concerns about the future. He had not appointed or groomed an obvious successor.
 Some Americans and Israelis involved in the Oslo peace negotiations continued to view him as the only Palestinian leader willing and able to make the compromises needed to end the bitter conflict. They disagreed with the growing number of Israelis who suspected that he secretly sought Israel's destruction while negotiating for peace.
 This upbeat assessment, however, was challenged in Israeli and American eyes by the collapse of the Oslo talks at Camp David in July 2000 and a last-ditch round of negotiations that continued despite growing violence until January 2001. The talks with Mr. Barak's Labor government failed despite the intervention of President Clinton, who offered Mr. Arafat an 11th-hour peace package to secure a final settlement before the end of his term in office and before Mr. Barak faced elections in February 2001. 
 The package would have given the Palestinians all of Gaza and more than 94 percent of the West Bank, much closer to Mr. Arafat's goal of securing the return of all the territories lost in 1967 than he had ever come before. The Israelis also agreed to give Palestinians full sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem and air rights over Israel. But Mr. Arafat, who had already blessed the uprising and was facing growing Palestinian criticism of his stewardship, still insisted, among other things, on the right of return of refugees into Israel. 
 Henry Siegman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Arafat's rejection of the American-brokered peace package a ''disastrous mistake.'' But, he added, ''based on my 14 years of dealings with Arafat, I reject the notion that he was bent on Israel's destruction.'' Rather, he said, Mr. Arafat's decision reflected his political weakness, a result partly of Israel's acceleration of settlement expansion and Mr. Barak's lack of interest in peace with the Palestinians until his own government began collapsing.
 But Dennis B. Ross, who spent 12 years trying to negotiate an Arab-Israeli peace settlement in Republican and Democratic administrations, ultimately concluded that while Mr. Arafat might have been prepared to die with Israel in existence, he was not prepared to have history regard him as the man who betrayed the vision of a single Palestinian state. ''In the end, he was not prepared to give up Palestinian claims and declare that the conflict is over,'' Mr. Ross said in an interview. 
 Even worse, Mr. Ross wrote in his book documenting the collapse of the American-brokered peace effort, ''he continued to promote hostility toward Israel.'' To avoid potential opposition, he remained a ''decision-avoider, not a decision-maker,'' Mr. Ross wrote, ''all tactics and no strategy.'' 
 In the February 2001 elections, Mr. Barak lost to Mr. Sharon, the candidate of the conservative Likud Party and a figure hated by Palestinians for his invasion of Lebanon, his settlements policy and his September 2000 visit to the Jerusalem plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque, an act intended to demonstrate Israeli sovereignty over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary.
 After Mr. Sharon's election, the newly elected Bush administration refused to help broker a serious peace effort similar to that of Oslo or the Madrid conference staged by the first President Bush. As a result, Palestinians argue, Mr. Arafat and others who ostensibly favored a diplomatic option lacked the political leverage they required. 
 Mr. Arafat's critics, by contrast, maintain that it was he who set off the violent Palestinian protests in September 2000, using the weapons and terrorist infrastructure he had secretly built alongside Israel while he negotiated for peace. 
 After almost 60 suicide bombings in 17 months, Mr. Sharon surrounded Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah in late March 2001 and later confined him there, leaving the Palestinian leader to rail against Jewish ''extremists'' as his cellphone battery died and his entourage ran short of food. 
 Pressure by Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies prompted the Bush administration to re-engage in an American-sponsored peace effort in the summer of 2001. Although Mr. Bush had been tentatively scheduled to meet Mr. Arafat on the periphery of the United Nations General Assembly in the fall of 2001, the session was canceled after the attacks of Sept. 11. Mr. Bush never met with Mr. Arafat. 
 The White House's hostility to the Palestinian leader hardened over time as American intelligence officials informed the White House that he was lying about his opposition to violence against Israelis. Officials said Mr. Bush came increasingly to equate Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians with militant Islamic attacks on Americans. 
 Mr. Ross, the longtime negotiator, said a low point came in January 2002, when Israelis interdicted in the Red Sea the Karine A, a ship carrying Iranian arms for use against Israelis. In a letter to Mr. Bush, Mr. Arafat disavowed any connection to the ship, though it turned out that the shipment had been arranged by a crucial Arafat aide, and the pilot was a Palestinian navy officer. Mr. Bush angrily dismissed the letter, insisting that Mr. Arafat must have known about the weapons. Though Mr. Arafat finally acknowledged responsibility for the arms, the diplomatic damage was done.
 Increasingly, the United States looked on with indifference as Prime Minister Sharon took unilateral steps to protect Israelis that infuriated the Palestinians, including building walls to cut Israel off from suicide bombers and ordinary Palestinians, dividing up the West Bank into supposedly temporary zones of security and more permanent zones of settlement.
 Efforts by the Bush administration to force Mr. Arafat to share power with other Palestinian leaders also failed. Because he steadfastly refused to designate a successor, a generation of lieutenants has been jockeying for power.
 The International Crisis Group, an independent Brussels-based group that studies global issues, partly blamed the Palestinian leadership. ''Recent power struggles, armed clashes, and demonstrations do not pit Palestinians against Israelis so much as Palestinians against each other,'' the report stated. 
 Under Mr. Arafat, local figures like mayors, kinship networks and armed militias competed for authority in the vacuum. One result, the report said, was growing chaos. 
 Nor did Mr. Arafat deliver prosperity. According to United Nations figures, 50 percent of the 2.2 million Palestinians on the West Bank live below the poverty line, compared with 22 percent in 2001; the figure is now 68 percent in teeming Gaza, with its 1.3 million residents. 
 Despite deteriorating political and economic conditions, many Palestinians blamed Israel and not their leader for their plight. For many, until the end, Mr. Arafat remained the symbol of Palestinian aspiration to a state, the only man who could have sold the painful compromises for peace to his people had he chosen to do so.

HEADLINE: Harry Schwartz, 85, Times Editorial Writer

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Harry Schwartz, an editorial writer for The New York Times from 1951 to 1979 and a specialist in Soviet and East European affairs who wrote and lectured extensively on the cold war and later on health care, died on Wednesday at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 85.
 The cause was heart failure, said his son Robert S. Schwartz.
 In a career that began in World War II and spanned nearly half a century, Mr. Schwartz was a government economist, a military intelligence analyst, a professor of economics and international affairs at several universities and the author of 22 books and thousands of editorials and interpretive articles for The Times. 
 While he was never a correspondent in Moscow, Mr. Schwartz, who taught himself Russian while serving with the wartime Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, began writing about Soviet affairs from New York in the late 1940's, when the Kremlin censored news reports, and even basic facts about Soviet political and economic life were regarded as state secrets.
 Mr. Schwartz regularly perused 35 Russian publications. By reading between the lines, by drawing on the observations of diplomats and others returning from Moscow and by studying pictures of Kremlin leaders on ceremonial occasions, he often deduced power shifts around Stalin, Khrushchev and other leaders and uncovered problems, like food production shortages, long before they became apparent.
 The controlled Soviet press called many of his articles slanderous and denounced him as a ''capitalist intelligence agent.'' He was denied a visa to go to Moscow, but he traveled in Eastern Europe and continued to write and lecture critically on Soviet economic and political policies. His books included ''Russia's Soviet Economy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1951), ''The Red Phoenix'' (Frederick A. Praeger, 1961) and ''Prague's 200 Days,'' (Frederick A. Praeger, 1969). 
 In the 1970's, in part because of a son's illness, Mr. Schwartz's interests turned increasingly toward health policy. His book ''The Case for American Medicine'' (David McCay, 1972) , argued that the increasing socialization of medicine would erode the quality of health care. Over the next two decades, he wrote about infant mortality, organ transplants, heart disease, AIDS and other health-related matters.
 Harry Schwartz was born in New York City on Sept. 10, 1919. At Columbia University, where he studied economics, he was valedictorian of his 1940 graduating class and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and received a master's degree in 1941 and a doctorate in 1944. In 1942 he was an economist with the War Production Board and the Department of Agriculture in Washington.
 He was drafted into the Army in 1943 but after basic training was transferred to the O.S.S. and sent to Europe as a specialist in Soviet economic intelligence. He was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1945.
 In 1946 Mr. Schwartz joined Syracuse University as a professor of economics. In 1947, he began writing for The Times on Soviet affairs, and in February 1951 he joined the staff of editorial writers full time. 
 Until 1953 he continued to teach at Syracuse. Over the years, he also lectured at Columbia University, New York University, American University, Brooklyn College, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and other major universities. In 1973 and 1974 he was a visiting professor of medical economics at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia.
 After retiring from the editorial board, he continued to write for The Times and for academic and economic journals. 
 Besides his son Robert, of Fresh Meadows, N.Y., Mr. Schwartz is survived by his wife, the former Ruth E. Blumner, whom he married in 1941; another son, Dr. John L. Schwartz, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Broadway

+ 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95.
BEN BRANTLEY

+ 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25.

* 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.

* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. 7 p.m. curtain through Nov. 18. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.

Off Broadway

'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.

*+ 'GUANTANAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60.

++ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.

'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.
LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

+ 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe, and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

Now Playing

'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies (see, at your peril, the oeuvre of the filmmaker James Toback), but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.
A.O. SCOTT

'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere wrote many scripts for Luis Bunuel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. As the mood shifts ingeniously from gothic to romance to comedy of manners, her emotions play in counterpoint, flickering from light-heartedness to uncertainty to full-eyed sorrow. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can.
SCOTT

'ENDURING LOVE' Starring Daniel Craig, Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton. Directed by Roger Michell (R, 100 minutes). In the new British film ''Enduring Love,'' Mr. Ifans plays the part of the scorned lover with neurasthenic delicacy and a spidery creepiness. Lanky and loose-limbed, Mr. Ifans has fine flaxen hair that occasionally brushes into his eyes, a bit of peek-a-boo that in the role of Jed Parry, scorned lover and full-bore psychopath, the actor transforms into a gesture of unsettling coquetry. Jed loves Joe (Mr. Craig), who in turn loves Claire (Ms. Morton), who in the way of the world and tragic romances, mostly seems to love herself. Theirs is a roundelay of misunderstanding and bruising, modern disconnection. Based on the novel by the English writer Ian McEwan and directed by Mr. Michell, an Englishman who's probably best known for the grating romantic comedy ''Notting Hill'' and should be known more for the pulp thriller ''Changing Lanes,'' ''Enduring Love'' is a serious movie about love, principally its petty cruelties and monstrous disguises. Soft, tender love, the kind that wraps you in comfort and warmth, much less the kind that sends you over the moon, is almost nonexistent in this curious, lachrymose story.
DARGIS

'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganza in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke as the team's star runner and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback.
SCOTT

* ''GARDEN STATE,'' starring Zach Braff, Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. Written and directed by Mr. Braff (R, 102 minutes). This small, smart, off-kilter comedy has the cheek to present itself as ''The Graduate 2004,'' although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as ''The Anti-Graduate 2004.'' From its story of the waking up of an emotionally numbed young man (Mr. Braff) to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack, the movie obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles, is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because ''The Graduate'' established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through ''American Beauty'' and beyond, you expect ''Garden State'' to uphold the cliche. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, ''Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliche by turning it inside out is a worthy one.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat goes meo-o-o-ow.
DARGIS

* 'I <heart> HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, Mr. Russell says, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I <heart> Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope.
DARGIS

* 'THE INCREDIBLES' With the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee. Written and directed by Brad Bird (PG, 118 minutes). A family of superheroes try to fit in in the suburbs after a public backlash against costumed crime fighters has forced them into dull, ordinary lives. Mom and especially Dad -- once known as Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible -- are stuck in a midlife, middle-class malaise until a supervillain named Syndrome emerges to call them back to their old identities. Anything but dull and ordinary, this computer-animated feature has a clean and vibrant visual style and is organized around a strong, fascinating idea. Mr. Bird (''The Iron Giant'') uses the plight of the superheroes as a way to protest against the celebration of mediocrity in a world where ''everybody is special, so no one is.'' His fusion of Ayn Rand's philosophy with classic comic-book aesthetics results in a film that is witty, elegant and heartfelt. It falls short of its potential, though, when it succumbs to the imperatives of blockbuster ideology and trades in its subtlety for noise and over-familiar thrills.
SCOTT

'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism.
DARGIS

* ''MARIA FULL OF GRACE,'' starring Catalina Sandino Moreno and Yenny Paola Vega. Written and directed by Joshua Marston (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Ms. Sandino) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms. Sandino's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromise but never undermine her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed.
HOLDEN

* 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.

* 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.

'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.''
HOLDEN

'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.
SCOTT

* 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.
DARGIS

'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women.
SCOTT

* 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism.
SCOTT

* 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ERIC ANDERSEN, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Since the 1960's, Eric Andersen has been picking his guitar and singing about love in wistfully graceful songs like ''Thirsty Boots'' and ''Blue River.'' Lately, he's started to reflect about the passing decades and collaborate with songwriters like Lou Reed and John Prine. Tonight at 9:30; tickets are $20 and there is a $12 minimum.
JON PARELES

BACILOS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144.

Sunday night at 8; tickets are $30.
PARELES

BEASTIE BOYS/TALIB KWELI, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, L.I., (631) 888-9000. The Beastie Boys are now old-school and proud of it, and their most recent album, ''To the Five Boroughs'' (Capitol), harks back to the electro blips of one of their early idols, Afrika Bambaata. Now that they're filled with good intentions, they're not as much fun as they were in their early days as uninhibited brats. Talib Kweli is an ambitious rapper who packs everything into his rhymes from politics to romance to anti-gangsta admonitions, all without forgetting to boast. Tonight at 7: tickets are $30.50 to $41.
PARELES

EARLIMART, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Earlimart has a streak of Neil Young folkiness, a streak of psychedelia and, on its latest album, an eerie echo of Elliott Smith, combined in ever-shifting proportions. Tonight at 9, with Midnight Movies, Silver Sun Pickups and the Love Story opening; admission is $8.
PARELES

FATBOY SLIM, Drive-In Studios, 443 West 18th Street, near Ninth Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 807-6795. Formerly a superstar D.J., now merely a star D.J., Fatboy Slim pursues his own gregarious vision of dance music: he likes big, memorable vocal samples; basslines so fat you can sing them, not just dance to them; exuberant beats that evoke the buoyant spirit (and sometimes sound) of pre-disco dance music. His new album, ''Palookaville'' (Astralwerks), is even more song-oriented than its predecessors -- it includes ''Put It Back Together,'' a lovely ballad sung by Damon Albarn of Blur. Unfortunately, the album is mainly filled with thin grooves and threadbare ideas. (The low point might be Bootsy Collins singing Steve Miller's ''The Joker.'') But this should be a good party regardless -- don't be surprised if Fatboy finds ways to bring many of these album tracks to life. Tomorrow night at 9:30 ; tickets are $40.
KELEFA SANNEH

* GIANT SAND/HANDSOME FAMILY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Howe Gelb's songs for Giant Sand ponder big questions of mortality, love and fate in music with a skewed Southwestern spirit: sometimes quiet, sometimes twanging and lurching toward chaos. Brett and Rennie Sparks, who are husband and wife, write music and lyrics respectively for the Handsome Family. Their songs are part of alternative country's surreal and morbid wing. In stately melodies, often waltzes, Brett Sparks's serene baritone imparts tales of lost love and sentiments like, ''It's only human to want to kill a beautiful thing.'' Tonight, with Low Skies opening at 8:30; admission is $15.
PARELES

ROBYN HITCHCOCK, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Tightly wound melodies and unsprung narratives meet in Robyn Hitchcock's songs, which bridge the psychedelia of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett and the archetypal English ''nonsense'' of Edward Lear. Behind the whimsy is an acute observer of love, death and the entire evolutionary continuum from plants to bugs to humans. Onstage, Mr. Hitchcock free-associates stories that can be as improbably touching as his songs. At Southpaw, tomorrow night at 7, admission is $15. At Maxwell's, Sunday night at 9, with Shearwater opening; admission is $15.

INTERNATIONAL POP OVERTHROW FESTIVAL, Arlene Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1652, and Acme Underground, 9 Great Jones Street, (212) 677-6924. Love songs driven by electric guitars were synonymous with Top 40 pop in the days of the Beatles, and still hanging on more self-consciously in the 1970's with groups like the Raspberries. But gradually, power pop became the province of collectors, revivalists and songwriters who couldn't wait to get their hearts broken so they could come up with another song. The International Pop Overthrow Festival in Los Angeles has rallied power-pop bands regularly for years, and it has spread to England and the East Coast. It continues tonight at 8 at Arlene Grocery, with the Grip Weeds (at 10:15) and other bands associated with the Rainbow Quartz label. Then it moves to Acme Underground for shows tomorrow and Sunday afternoons at 1 and evenings at 7, with bills of eight bands each (including a set Sunday afternoon at 3:30 by the tuneful and hard-nosed Marianne Pillburys) and it concludes at Acme on Monday night with another eight bands. Admission to each show is $10; the full lineup is at www.internationalpopoverthrow.com/eastc.html.
PARELES

J-LIVE, VAST AIRE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A hip-hop show starring a couple of local cult favorites. J-Live is a hardcore formalist, known for his rigorously constructed rhymes: in one of his tracks, ''One for the Griot,'' the rapper tells a story and then doubles back twice to provide alternative endings. He is to be joined by Vast Aire, from the duo Cannibal Ox, known for dense, murky, half-speed rhymes that you don't hear so much as absorb. Tomorrow night at 11, with MC Double AB; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 at the door
SANNEH

* KAYHAN KALHOR, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Playing classical Persian music on the kemancheh, an upright fiddle, Kayhan Kalhor is a fiery improviser who moves from sighing, songful lines to fiercely percussive pizzicato fusillades and swirling arpeggios. Ali Akbar Moradi, who plays the tanbur (a three-stringed lute), shares the bill. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $28 and $35.
PARELES

MARCEL KHALIFE, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. The oud player and singer Marcel Khalife, from Lebanon, moves easily between traditional Arabic music and his own settings of contemporary poems; he has written a concerto for oud and orchestra and dipped into jazz. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25, $35 and $45.
PARELES

DAVID LINDLEY, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The guitarist David Lindley was once Jackson Browne's utility sideman. He went on to record albums of his own featuring his collection of cheap guitars, and has traveled the world soaking up string traditions, from Hawaii to Turkey, Ireland to Madagascar. Tonight at 8; admission is $23.
PARELES

LONG ISLAND REGGAE MUSIC FESTIVAL, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000. A lineup of longtime reggae stars includes Jimmy Cliff, Bunny Wailer, Maxi Priest, Luciano, Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt, Sly and Robbie, Half Pint, Tony Rebel and others, covering the spectrum from lovers' croons to righteous resistance. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $45 to $85.
PARELES

* MUDVILLE, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, below Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. Mudville is a duo: Marilyn Carino sings about troubled longings and bleak surreal visions, while Ben Rubin surrounds her melancholy voice with brooding, minor-key tracks that start with electric piano and venture into smoky, ominous lounge territory, somewhere between Fiona Apple and Morcheeba. Tonight at 10:30, with Henry Shead at 9:30, Nikki Borodi at 8:30 and Jaymay and Ivan Sandomire at 7; admission is $8.
PARELES

NEVILLE BROTHERS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The Neville Brothers have been at the center of New Orleans funk since the 1950's. Art Neville, on keyboards, is a funk mastermind; Aaron Neville sings ballads with a voice of angelic purity and vulnerability. The Nevilles apply all their experience in syncopation to their own songs and, lately, cover songs like ''Ball of Confusion.'' Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $40.
PARELES

* OOIOO, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Yoshimi, the playful multi-instrumentalist who plays with the long-running Japanese free-rock group the Boredoms, also leads OOIOO, an all-female quartet known for shape-shifting, semi-improvised compositions that often sound both rigorous and delicate. The most recent OOIOO album is ''Kila Kila Kila'' (Thrill Jockey), a confounding but warmly enveloping disc that shows the group to be a (welcome) new sort of jam band, one content to concentrate on a single musical texture for minutes at a time, then suddenly switch directions with a series of woozy jump cuts. Tonight at 11, with Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, who is to be accompanied by Ikue Mori and Jim O'Rourke; tickets are $14.
SANNEH

PROJECT OBJECT, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Frank Zappa's music was never easy to play. It called for players who loved both basic three-chord rock and all the whizzing, swerving, whimsical complexities that Zappa could devise. Musicians are still willing to devote themselves to its wayward intricacies, and Project Object has been working its way through the Zappa repertory for years. Its guests include past members of Mr. Zappa's bands: the guitarist Ike Willis and the singer Napoleon Murphy Brock. Sunday night at 8, tickets are $18 in advance, $22 Sunday.
PARELES

THE RADIATORS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The second-line backbeat of New Orleans funk is the heartbeat of the Radiators, a rock band that has been together since the 1970's. As band members sing about woman trouble and other frustrations, the groove keeps people shimmying. Tonight at 8; admission is $25.
PARELES

THE STRAWBS, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The Strawbs, led by David Cousins, were part of the 1970's wave of English traditional rock, setting their own takes on ancient legends to rich, modal melodies. They return minus the electric guitars. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow.
PARELES

* MATTHEW SWEET, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Power pop is a balance of yearning, melody and muscle, and Matthew Sweet likes his on the burly side. He shields his feelings behind noisy guitars, but he still reveals a tender heart. Tonight, doors open at 8 and Velvet Crush shares the bill; tickets are $25.
PARELES

DEREK TRUCKS, the Chance, 6 Crannel Street, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (845) 471-1966 and Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. Joining a southern rock dynasty, the slide guitar player Derek Trucks splits his time between the Allman Brothers Band, which includes his uncle Butch Trucks on drums, and his own blues-rocking band, which constantly works the jam-band circuit. At the Chance tonight at 8:30; tickets are $20. At Spirit tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $25.
PARELES

* THE USED, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. In 2002, the members of this Utah band put together a fragile, ferocious self-titled debut, full of hair-trigger love songs that kept devolving into screaming chaos. Now comes ''In Love and Death'' (Reprise), an impressive follow-up -- weird and catchy and unexpectedly funny. ''Listening'' wraps a frustrated anti-love song around a screamed, kindergartenish refrain: ''I'm not listening!'' And it ends with ''I'm a Fake,'' during which the singer, Bert McCracken, frantically shuttles between voices and attitudes. ''Look at me, look at me now,'' he pleads. Then the raw-throated rejoinder: ''I'm a fake! I'm a fake! I'm a fake!'' Tonight at 6:45; tickets are $22.
SANNEH

WU-TANG CLAN, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900. A decade ago, Wu-Tang Clan was hip-hop's unstoppable vanguard alliance, encompassing brains, ferocity, comedy, romance, kung-fu trivia and all the ominous urban ambience that its producer and conceptualist, the RZA, could conjure. Uncounted solo albums later, the RZA, the GZA, Ghostface, Method Man, Raekown, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa and Ol' Dirty Bastard have reunited. Their past live shows always verged on anarchy, and there's no reason to expect anything different now. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 and $47.50.

MONTY ALEXANDER'S JAZZ PARTY, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Columbus Circle, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9800. Mr. Alexander, a jazz pianist originally from Jamaica, has often refitted reggae songs and steel-drum sounds for a jazz-trio context; it's breezy, amiable stuff, and he can summon good swing. His band for this weekend includes the remarkable drummer Herlin Riley, and Clark Terry, a trumpeter and fluegelhornist who is one of jazz's great soloists. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 o'clock set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables and $5 at the bar.
BEN RATLIFF

GATO BARBIERI, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. All gatos have a few lives, and Mr. Barbieri, the saxophonist, has had three: first as a free-jazz wailer in the early 1970's, then as the soloist on the celebrated ''Last Tango in Paris'' soundtrack and now as a smooth-jazz balladeer. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10, Sunday at 8:45 and 10 p.m.; covers charges, $32.50 tonight and Sunday, $35 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum all nights.
RATLIFF

* CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Here is jazz fusion, the real article. The overall sound may be dated, but Mr. Corea's Elektric Band -- which existed from the mid-80's to early 90's, and has recently been resurrected, in a different lineup -- can be fascinating to hear. In the amped-up clatter of 16th notes, there are differences among players. The saxophonist Eric Marienthal injects a kind of soul, in longer, more expressive notes. Mr. Corea generally changes his rhythmic orientation every couple of bars. And the guitarist Frank Gambale, the bassist Ric Fierabracci and the drummer Dave Weckl can play like stylish nail guns. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $45 and there is a $5 minimum.
RATLIFF

ELLERY ESKELIN-ANDREA PARKINS-JIM BLACK, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. The saxophonist's trio, with Andrea Parkins on accordion and samplers and Jim Black on drums, is now in its 10th year; it's a frisky group, fracturing Mr. Eskelin's blues-and-bop roots with jagged backdrops. Music begins Sunday night at 9:30; the cover charge is $10.
RATLIFF

BENNY GOLSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Golson, in his mid-70's, is an unlikely jazz hero: upbeat, fascinated with technique, a nonpurist who has spent equal time among the different aesthetic dispositions of East and West Coast jazz, a tinkerer who has written soul-jazz standards like ''Killer Joe'' as well as his own classical music. Above all, he is a first-class saxophone improviser, a Philadelphia colleague of John Coltrane going back to the mid-1940's whose own notions of phrasing and harmony have been deeply influenced by his friend's. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25.
RATLIFF

* 'JACK JOHNSON FESTIVAL,' Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. A new Ken Burns documentary produces a cross-marketed pileup of culture, and his latest, ''Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,'' is no exception. The full biography that drives it, written by Geoffrey C. Ward, is already in bookstores; Mr. Burns's film will be shown on PBS in January; and Blue Note records will release Wynton Marsalis's soundtrack to the film on Nov. 30. This weekend at Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center puts on an evening that's half film, half music. First Mr. Burns previews sections of the film; then Mr. Marsalis and his septet play sections of the soundtrack. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 to $150.
RATLIFF

* JOE LOVANO NONET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. A sock-to-the-gut band, with room for fun. It spans the last 50 years of jazz, with new arrangements of bebop-era tunes, some Coltrane writ large and Mr. Lovano's playful, sometimes calculatedly abstract, up-to-date originals. There are great players here representing the bricks and mortar of New York's jazz-club scene, including the saxophonists Steve Slagle, Ralph Lalama and George Garzone, and the drummer Lewis Nash; they create a great ruckus and heft, and leave you feeling that jazz is doing all right, thanks very much. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; the cover charge is $30.
RATLIFF

* DJANGO REINHARDT FESTIVAL, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. An annual event, and a surprisingly potent one. Django Reinhardt's slashing swing rhythm and overpowering sense of romantic melody makes imitation a worthwhile goal. This year's supplicants to the altar include the French guitarists Dorado Schmitt and Mayo Hubert, as well as the Basily Gypsy Band, from the Netherlands, and two other Dutch musicians, the pianist Peter Beets and guitarist Martin Limberger. Sitting in as guests are Gil Goldstein, on accordion, tonight, and Dave Samuels on vibraphone on Sunday. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 11; cover charge, $35 tonight and tomorrow night, $30 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum all nights.
RATLIFF

JALEEL SHAW QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. A young alto saxophonist who has proved himself around New York recently; his band now includes Robert Glasper, a pianist of great promise, the similarly impressive guitarist Lage Lund, and the drummer Greg Hutchinson. Sets are tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set, $10 for members.
RATLIFF

HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID, Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, Manhattan, (212) 594-7149. Mr. Threadgill's newest band plays pieces shorter than his works in recent years, and an oud changes the texture; otherwise, Zooid is a refinement of the sweet-and-sour, jazz-tango-Balkan-funk matrix (always with a tuba) that Mr. Threadgill, one of our great composers, refined through the 90's. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20.
RATLIFF

THREE GUITARS: LARRY CORYELL, JOHN ABERCROMBIE, BADI ASSAD, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. It's Larry Coryell and John Abercrombie -- not unlikely colleagues -- as well as the Brazilian guitarist and singer Badi Assad; together they play sets that flicker between classical music, relaxed jazz and Brazilian song. Sets tonight through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday.
RATLIFF

MICHAEL WEISS TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. Michael Weiss, a longtime member of the saxophonist Johnny Griffin's band as well as a leader in his own right, has the charging rhythms of bebop playing under his fingers, and he can focus the intensity in a tune as well as any pianist in the jazz mainstream. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; the cover charge is $10.

Cabaret

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

KLEA BLACKHURST, Opia, 130 East 57th Street, (212) 688-3939. ''For me, all musical comedy roads lead to Ethel Merman,'' declares Klea Blackhurst late in her show, ''Autumn in New York: Vernon Duke's Broadway.'' This singer from Salt Lake City makes good on that comparison the moment she opens her mouth and unleashes a bright, brassy rallying cry that is the vocal equivalent of strong home-brewed coffee without sugar or cream. She delivers an upbeat musical biography of the composer of ''April in Paris,'' ''Autumn in New York'' and ''I Can't Get Started,'' buttressed by the light swing arrangements of the Pocket Change Trio (Michael Rice on piano, Ray Kilday on bass and David Strauss on guitar and banjo). Tonight and Sunday night at 7 and tomorrow night at 9. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.
STEPHEN HOLDEN

BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blase but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.

BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.

* PAULA WEST AND THE ERIC REED TRIO, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. This San Francisco jazz singer has always relished transgressing stylistic conventions. Her new show includes a folk-jazz-rap version of Bob Dylan's ''Subterranean Homesick Blues,'' which she turns into a slurred mouthful of pure jazz rhythm. Her mischievous streak also asserts itself in slyly updated versions of Cole Porter's ''At Long Last Love'' and ''Anything Goes,'' that mention phenomena like nonfat creamer, the Hilton sisters and reality television. Her thoughtful renditions of ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Black and Blue'' find her emerging as a heavyweight balladeer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.

Opera

'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty opera-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival, which appears tonight for the last time this season: Irina Mishura takes on Carmen; and Richard Leech sings Don Jose. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Micaela, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. Paul Nadler conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office.
ANNE MIDGETTE

'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' Opera's favorite double bill has returned in the Metropolitan Opera's venerable productions of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.'' Go not for a famous cast but for Mascagni's lightning-bolt blood and guts and Leoncavallo's equally sinister exercise in revenge and murder. Dennis Russell Davies conducts both operas. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.
BERNARD HOLLAND

'CINDERELLA' Opera meets Broadway in more ways than one at City Opera this week. The company is giving itself over entirely to 13 consecutive productions of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical (not, admittedly, one of the duo's greatest hits, but enjoyable nonetheless) with a starry cast of a decidedly nonoperatic bent. Sarah Uriarte Berry, who's done ''Beauty and the Beast'' on the Great White Way, takes the title role, but more than likely two other contenders will be duking out who's to steal the show: the cross-dressing John (Lypsinka) Epperson as the Stepmother and the great Eartha Kitt as the Fairy Godmother. Gerald Steichen conducts. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Remaining tickets: $27 to $105 tonight, $32 to $115 tomorrow and Sunday.
MIDGETTE

'I VESPRI SICILIANI' The convoluted story and clunky libretto to Verdi's ''Vespri Siciliani'' has probably kept this mature and stirring opera from gaining repertory status. So it's good to have this neglected and important work back at the Met after 22 years, a revival of John Dexter's grimly abstract 1974 production. In the impassioned and stylish performance by the conductor Frederic Chaslin and a strong cast, ''I Vespri Siciliani'' emerges as a musically distinguished opera that, with its French inflections, anticipates Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlos.'' Don't fret if the story, based on the 1282 uprising and massacre by the people of Palermo, Sicily, against their hated French occupiers, seems implausible. Just let yourself get swept away by the music and relish the work of the compelling soprano Sondra Radvanovsky, the husky-voiced (and husky-framed) tenor Francisco Casanova, the elegant baritone Leo Nucci and the stentorian bass Samuel Ramey. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC One of the best places to hear chamber music in New York is a converted barge docked in Brooklyn right next to the Brooklyn Bridge. Founded in 1977 and still run by the grandmotherly violinist Olga Bloom, Bargemusic presents concerts in a wonderfully intimate wood-paneled room with thrilling views of lower Manhattan and excellent acoustics. Tonight the cellist Leonid Gorochov and the pianist Niklas Sivelov play works by Stravinsky, Schnittke, Haydn and the ever-popular ''Arpeggione'' Sonata by Schubert. Tomorrow evening and Sunday afternoon these two players will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov, who is also Bargemusic's adventurous artistic director, for a program of music by Beethoven for piano trio, including the deceptively noble but actually radical Trio in E-flat (Op. 70, No. 2). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, $25 for students.
TOMMASINI

BELCEA QUARTET This young string quartet, founded a decade ago in London, proved impressive in its New York debut as part of Carnegie Hall's Distinctive Debuts series in 2000. Now it expands on that success in a pair of concerts. Tomorrow night it plays one of the same works, Britten's Quartet No. 3; a different Haydn quartet; and Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 4. On Sunday it plays a shorter program: Wolf's ''Italian Serenade'' and Beethoven's Opus 132. Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; tickets $35. Sunday at 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; tickets $20.
JAMES R. OESTREICH

CHAMPAGNE CLASSICAL CONCERTS In the 1920's, it was not unusual for swanky hotels or restaurants to present classical music concerts, often with several well-known performers each contributing short sets. The Rainbow Room is hoping to revive that quaint tradition, or at least, a hint of it, with a series of Sunday afternoon piano recitals by young, accomplished players. Each recital lasts about 75 minutes, with no intermission, and the somewhat hefty ticket price ($75) includes a drink before the performance and dessert after it. The musical fare is light (if sometimes virtuosic), in keeping with the setting and format. This week the soloist is Richard Dowling, who is devoting his program to ragtime works by Scott Joplin, Zez Confrey, Joseph F. Lamb and others. Gershwin favorites round out the recital. Sunday at 5, the Rainbow Room, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor, (212) 632-5000. Tickets: $75.
ALLAN KOZINN

EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Frederick Renz and his enterprising ensemble have become deft arrangers of thematic programs, although sometimes an asterisk or two is required to explain programmatic loopholes. This week's program is called ''Renaissance Women,'' which might lead a listener to expect a full program of works by the comparatively few female composers whose works have been discovered and identified. There is, after all, more than enough of it to sustain a full program. As it turns out, four women are represented, including the extraordinary Barbara Strozzi, and three composers who were also nuns, Lucretia Vizzana, Suor Maria Xaveria Perucona and Chiara Margarita Cozzolani. There is also, however, lots of music by men. In some cases, the work is about a woman, most notably the Virgin Mary, as in a Palestrina setting of Salve Regina and a pair of devotional motets by P. de la Farge and Laurus Pativinus Mantuae. Other works, including a group of chansons by Crecquillon, are based on secular texts written from a woman's perspective. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330. Tickets: $35.

PAUL GROVES. This Louisiana-born tenor is best known to New Yorkers for his regular work at the Metropolitan Opera since his 1992 debut. James Levine has taken a special interest in his career. When Mr. Groves made his 1996 New York recital debut in Lincoln Center's Art of the Song series, Mr. Levine was his accompanist. Mr. Groves will sing again in that series on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, a recital accompanied by the Bosnian-born pianist Pedja Muzijevic, and others. Their program offers works by Faure, Liszt and Rachmaninoff. But of special interest will be Britten's seldom-heard and challenging Canticle III ''Still Falls the Rain -- the Raids, 1940, Night and Dawn,'' and also the composer's ''Winter Words,'' a moody and affecting song cycle that sets eight poems by Thomas Hardy. Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $48.
TOMMASINI

JUILLIARD SCHOOL BAROQUE CONCERT Until recent years, this might have seemed an oxymoron. The once-staid Juilliard School was slow to come to terms with the early-music movement. But now it has a Baroque specialist, the harpsichordist Lionel Party, on its faculty, and it has taken to showing off its wares in this line. Here Mr. Party leads performances of Bach's Cantata No. 51, ''Jauchzet Gott in Allen Landen,'' Handel's ''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' and other pieces. Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Free, but tickets are required.

* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC You could say the Philharmonic is crossing the Finnish line. The wonderful soprano Karita Mattila is making her New York Philharmonic debut this week in a set of songs by one of today's best composers, Kaija Saariaho, written expressly for her. The fine young conductor Sakari Oramo will lead the orchestra for the second time. The program includes the New York premiere of Sibelius's tone poem ''The Bard.'' The only non-Finnish element on the program, in fact, is Tchaikovsky's ''Manfred'' Symphony. In short, there's nothing not to like; all indications point to a really worthwhile evening. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.
MIDGETTE

ORCHESTRA 2001 This chamber orchestra, directed by James Freeman, was founded in 1988 to perform contemporary music. It has built a strong following in Philadelphia, where it is based, and it visits New York periodically as well. Mr. Freeman and company will be here on Sunday to perform two song cycles by George Crumb, ''The River of Life'' and ''A Journey Beyond Time.'' Both composed in 2003, the cycles are the first two books in Mr. Crumb's four-volume ''American Songbook.'' These two volumes are based on spirituals (among them, ''Shall We Gather at the River,'' ''Deep River'' and ''Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child''), and they are to be sung here by the sopranos for whom they were written: Ann Crumb, the composer's daughter, will sing ''The River of Life,'' and Barbara Ann Martin, who has long been closely associated with Mr. Crumb's music, will sing ''A Journey Beyond Time.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights. (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $25 to $30.
KOZINN

POMERIUM This magnificent early-music choir, founded in 1972 and led by Alexander Blachly, consistently offers thoughtful and enlightening programs. Mr. Blachly is devoting the group's program this time to the music of Ockeghem, one of the great 15th-century Flemish composers, and a pivotal figure: he studied with Dufay and probably Binchois, and taught Josquin. The program includes three of Ockeghem's Masses, including his two best-known settings, the Missa L'Homme Arme and the Missa Prolationum. The Missa au Travail Suis, an Ave Maria setting and a lamentation on the death of Binchois round out the program. Tomorrow night at 7:30, the Great Hall at Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 62+.
KOZINN

TRIO MEDIAEVAL Iraq wasn't the only thing ''handed over'' last summer. What's more, the handover of hegemony between female vocal groups in the not always placid world of early music was orderly. Anonymous 4 disbanded after last season and a New York farewell appearance at Corpus Christi Church, where it had performed for years. Now the Oslo-based Trio Mediaeval, which made its New York debut last season, takes over in the church's invaluable series Music Before 1800, performing the 13th-century ''Messe de Tournai'' and other works. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $40 and $25; $35 and $20 for students and 62+.

Dance

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances:
nytimes.com/dance.

IVY BALDWIN The wildly imaginative Ms. Baldwin, a product of the North Carolina School of the Arts and New York University's Tisch School, has conjured up a scarily nutty world in her new ''Now Leaving Vanderville.'' Citizens go to war only on Mondays. (Well, that doesn't sound too bad.) They also stuff ducks for a living, however, as they wait patiently to be annihilated every week. All this is set to a score of songs by Kurt Weill, performed live by Franz Nicolay and Carrie Lewis. Also on the program is ''la table,'' a duet for snobs. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Prince and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org. Tickets: $10 and $15.
JENNIFER DUNNING

* BLAKTINO PERFORMANCE SERIES Things are getting complicated in the world of ethnic nomenclature. This series, for instance, celebrates art by black, Latino and ''Blatino'' artists in two programs by Bronx-based companies this weekend. Tonight, Kim Vasquez's Kush troupe will perform West Indian dance that ends with a drum-and-dance jam, followed by Pedro Raposo's all-female Caracol troupe, which performs Afro-Dominican dance. Tomorrow the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater will present an evening of new and recent modern-dance pieces, set to scores that include music by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, created by Mr. Aviles, a Bill T. Jones alumnus whose choreographic voice is distinctively brash, sweet-tempered and thoughtful. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, BAAD! (the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance), 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, South Bronx, (718) 842-5223. Tickets: $15.
DUNNING

DELFOS DANZA CONTEMPORANEA A dance troupe from Mexico that takes its name from the Delphic oracle of Greece makes its New York debut in choreography that combines great physicality with sensual and poetic imagery. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $34.
JACK ANDERSON

* CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, of which Mr. Dennis is a co-founder. His film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters who include Mark Russell, for many years the theater's director and animating spirit. Sunday at 2 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5.

'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m., Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85.

HOI POLLOI Sara Sweet Rabidoux, the company choreographer, describes her work as deliberately awkward and creepily dear, borrowing techniques from film and fiction writing that include internal dialogues and dream sequences. Joining this modern-dance troupe will be the singer Heloise and the Savoir Faire Dancers. ''Think Blondie meets Fraggle Rock,'' Ms. Rabidoux comments. Nice of her to warn us. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Joyce SoHo Theater, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $10; $8 for students and 65+.

ANDERSON

BARBARA MAHLER AND MEG WOLFE Barbara Mahler's ''Fragments'' is based on solos for herself. But some of her movements also filter into the choreography performed by Amy Kail and Vicky Shick. In Meg Wolfe's ''Stormy Days With Josephine,'' past and present collide on a Los Angeles freeway. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.

Brown and Susan Marshall -- each of whom worked with a single class of young Juilliard dancers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m., Juilliard Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 799-5000.
DUNNING

* STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7; Sunday at 3 p.m., S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15.
DUNNING

VENCL DANCE TRIO Susan Vencl performed with choreographers like Albert Reid and Elaine Shipman before embarking on her own career of making dances.

Tonight at 9; tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.
MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

* 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

* 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Bocklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.
ROBERTA SMITH

'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.
GRACE GLUECK

'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Aveune, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. Cut mostly from thin slabs of marble or wood, the cleverly joined parts are notched to fit into each other without benefit of glue, nails or other fixatives. They form a quintessentially Noguchi synthesis of the human and totemic. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. A small gallery displays the quirky abstract sculptures he called ''Lunars'' that, rigged out with light bulbs in odd places, made lamps of a fine, goofy sci-fi quality that must have seemed off the wall in 1943. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Overall, a well-planned presentation that moves engrossingly along. Hours and admission: see above.
GLUECK

* 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, a mother-of-pearl cup in the shape of a parrot, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.
KIMMELMAN

'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. ''The Skater (William Grant),'' done in 1782, is a stunning full-length figure of an acquaintance from Stuart's London days performing a graceful maneuver on the ice. It is, far and beyond being a portrait, a haunting work whose liberating air seems to extol the individual as master of his fate. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.
GLUECK

'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10.

'BOB THE ROMAN: HEROIC ANTIQUITY AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF ROBERT ADAM,' Gallery of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street, (212) 472-1500, through Dec. 4. Not for nothing did the Scotsman Robert Adam (1728-1792) playfully restyle himself ''Bob the Roman'' after soaking up the Eternal City on his youthful grand tour of Europe. Nearly everything he turned his hand to later as the celebrated architect, designer and interior decorator of late 18th-century England evoked the classical spirit of his beloved Rome. This show of more than 80 drawings made in the Adam office (Robert's brother, James, was his partner) is an enlightening introduction to the Adam brothers' scope. The works range from a nine-foot-long view of the facade of an intricate fantasy palace to numerous plans and proposals for town houses, villas and castles, along with their ornamentation, many of which actually got built.
GLUECK

BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead.
KEN JOHNSON

ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Alfred Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world whose studio was a center of happenings and other events besides painting. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points.
GLUECK

* 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism.
SMITH

'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Solorzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape painted in orange and white on the wall; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jose Davila.

Galleries: 57th Street

SAM CADY: 'MAINE, NEW PAINTINGS,' Mary Ryan Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669, through Nov. 24. The state of Maine may have inspired more artists than any other in the Union, and here's another devoted example. In this group of canvases, closely tailored to fit the subjects, Mr. Cady celebrates the coastal village he lives in, where boats are built, fish are caught and seagulls clamor. His chef d'oeuvre, ''Morning Mirage, Jones Garden,'' depicts a long, narrow, horizontal stripe of shore eight feet long by a little over three inches wide called ''Morning Mirage, Jones Garden.'' No sky and no water are shown, but tiny islands appear at the top of the construction, giving the effect of a very distant view from a boat out in the water. Other ingenuities include cut-outs in the shape of a small dory; the hulls of a couple of boats being built, and a snow-covered dock from a walk-on perspective. But the painting is a little too slick to be all that down-homey.
GLUECK

WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely.
JOHNSON

Galleries: SoHo

'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 3. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.
JOHNSON

* 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.

Galleries: Chelsea

SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet to be published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog.
JOHNSON

RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies.
JOHNSON

NICKY NODJOUMI: 'PRIVATE AGENDA,' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, through Nov. 24. Born in Iran in 1942, Mr. Nodjoumi moved to New York in the 80's to escape censorship by the new fundamentalist government. With a skillful painterly touch and in muted colors he creates darkly humorous, poetically haunting political allegories like the image of the United States president and vice president with heads bowed in prayer carrying on their backs, respectively, a giant heart and a bundle of dried shrubbery.
JOHNSON

'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Nov. 21. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the president's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the President humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq.
JOHNSON

Other Galleries

SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.
JOHNSON

'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.
COTTER

ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting.

Last Chance

'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through tomorrow. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tomorrow and Saturday, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3.
JOHNSON

GORDON COSTER, Keith de Lellis, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482, through today. This retrospective exhibition of more than 60 photographs dating from 1925 to 1950 documents the career of a versatile and skillful photojournalist. It includes semi-abstract still-lifes and nudes, documentary pictures of inner-city life and labor and civil rights strife and pictures of idyllic family scenes made for magazine ads that are, in some ways, among the show's most provocative images.
JOHNSON

* FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through tomorrow. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses.
SMITH

DONALD JUDD/ROBERT MANGOLD, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, through tomorrow. The pairing of the paintings and sculptures of these major Minimalist artists is a no-brainer, especially since both are represented by this gallery. But it looks surprisingly fresh and is beautifully installed. Each artist works with simple volumes of space, whether actual or illusionistic, that are divided and measured with the addition of repeating related elements. In Mr. Mangold's work two or three lines undulate or curve from top to across the lightly gridded monochrome color-fields of his tall ''Column'' paintings. The divisions of Mr. Judd's boxed or columnar volumes of space proceed with perpendicular planes or repeating, sometimes sub-divided units.
SMITH

JEFF LADOUCEUR: 'SCHMO,' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-1088, through tomorrow. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopuses and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching.
JOHNSON

KURT LIGHTNER: 'A VIEW ALMOST PICTURESQUE,' Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937, through tomorrow. A single huge and enthralling landscape occupies Clementine's main gallery. Measuring 12 by 22 feet, it presents a life-size, magically vivid squirrel's eye view into a forest. Part Pre-Raphaelite, part Charles Burchfield and part Walt Disney, it was made by gluing thousands of individual images of plants, trees, stones and ferns -- each painted in acrylic ink on Mylar -- onto big paper panels.
JOHNSON

TOMOKO SAWADA: 'COSTUME,' Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1224, through tomorrow. In the tradition of Claude Cahun, Ana Mendieta and Cindy Sherman, the Japanese artist Tomoko Sawada puts female identity through its paces, but without limiting her role-playing to the studio. She enters the real world, to pose as a dentist, policewoman, secretary, nun or tea-house hostess in what might be called their natural habitats. What's most interesting is the way Ms. Sawada adjusts her facial expression and body language to each persona and, moreover, to our preconceptions about the women's social status and psychological profile. The images need one another to be most effective, but in nearly every case, Ms. Sawada's performance is more than skin-deep, which is why it unsettles.
SMITH

DONALD SULTAN: 'NEW POPPY PAINTINGS,' Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through tomorrow. Mr. Sultan builds his massive pictures of flat, brightly colored poppy blossoms on velvety black fields out of industrial strength materials: plywood, Masonite, linoleum, tar and enamel paint. Far from heavy-handed or over-bearing, however, his works exude a suave and seductive blend of visual and tactile sensuousness.
JOHNSON

VICTOR VASARELY: 'BLACK AND WHITE PAINTINGS FROM THE 1950'S,' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774, through tomorrow. This small but surprisingly interesting sideshow presents just six black-and-white paintings dating from 1952 to 1962. This Hungarian-born painter, who lived from 1906 to 1997, came to be thought of as a visual cheap trickster, but the optically tantalizing compositions of stripes, grid patterns and patterns like bar codes on view here have a fine, concentrated rigor.

HEADLINE: Weakness in Demand Shrivels Japan's Output

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Japan's economy grew at a worse-than-expected annual pace of 0.3 percent in the third quarter as exports and capital expenditures weakened, indicating that slowing demand overseas was having a big impact on Japan.
 Growth in the nation's gross domestic product was considerably slower than the 2 percent predicted by economists. Demand waned for some Japanese electronic goods. 
 Growth failed to pick up from what was already a surprisingly weak annual pace of 1.3 percent in the second quarter and was well shy of growth rates in the two quarters before that of 6 percent and more annually. 
 That spurt of rapid expansion had been seen by many here as the end of Japan's ''lost decade'' of stagnant growth. Economists did not generally predict a continuation of such strong growth, but most expected the economy to settle into a healthy upturn.
 Through the current recovery, which is in its second year, the economy has been firing on just two of four cylinders. While exports and capital spending have moved ahead, consumption and government spending have been stagnant or falling. 
 That changed somewhat in the third quarter as capital spending slipped 0.2 percent from the previous quarter and export growth slowed. Government spending fell, in line with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's pledge to trim the national debt. Private consumption, which accounts for more than half the economy, rose 0.9 percent. 
 Economists no longer expect a sustained rebound in consumers' spending. Wages have not yet turned higher and no one really sees Japanese consumers starting to spend more until they earn more. 
 This means that any recovery continues to depend on the ability of exporters to find buyers for their cars and electronic gadgets. But there are signs that demand for many of Japan's crucial exports is softening.
 All three of Japan's top three carmakers -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- recently reported declines in profit for the most recent quarter as pricing pressure intensified in the United States market. And while booming sales of digital cameras, flat-panel television and other digital devices have generated large profits for Japanese electronics giants, several of them warn that they expect slower growth for the rest of the year.
 Japan's current-account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade, tourism and financial flows -- slumped by a seasonally adjusted 14 percent in September from August. Part of the decline came as a result of higher oil prices. But exports also fell as an oversupply of flat-panel displays and computer chips drove down prices.
 Peter Morgan, economist at HSBC Securities here, said, ''It looks as though this soft patch that exports have hit is probably going to continue for the time being and that will bring down the growth of things like capital spending.'' 
 There is evidence that the link between slowing exports and weaker capital spending is already in place. Orders for machinery unexpectedly fell 1.9 percent in September, on steep declines in orders from electronics companies and steel makers, according to government figures released Thursday. Mr. Morgan forecasts that the economy will grow 4.3 percent this year. But weakness in exports and capital investment, he said, suggests that growth is likely to slow to 2.2 percent next year. 
 In addition, the strong yen is taking its toll on Japanese exports. The yen settled in New York late Thursday at 106.53 to the dollar. 
 While economists do not expect growth to accelerate appreciably in the next year, most also agree that a return to the on-again-off-again recessions of the 1990's is unlikely.

HEADLINE: Lost in Exurbia? Well, You're Not Alone

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Take a Ride to Exurbia'' (column, Nov. 9), David Brooks suggests that exurbia is created by a yearning from some portion of American society to escape urban or suburban life, but Americans move to exurban communities for the same reasons they move anywhere: decent-paying jobs, affordable housing and easy access to shopping.
 The complete franchising of American business makes it easy to create a ''community,'' as large landholders in exurban areas have found. Bring in business with tax incentives, build large housing tracts at cheap prices, add a Wal-Mart, a Target, some restaurant franchises and, of course, some fast-food franchises and -- voila! -- a new community. 
 Along the way, there is lots of money to be made as well. Imagine that! 
 People don't move away from their homes because they want order in their lives. They move for economic reasons.

HEADLINE: Broad Gains by Shares Lift S.&P. Index to 3-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares rose yesterday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest close in more than three years and putting the Dow Jones industrial average into positive territory for 2004.
 A drop in the price of oil, along with a statement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday that the economy and labor market were improving, spurred the advance.
 Falling energy costs ''will be a positive for the market,'' said David Jordan of First Focus Funds in Fort Collins, Colo. ''The economy is growing,'' he said, adding, ''We could see a pretty good rally over the next three to six months.'' 
 The S.&P. 500, a broad-based index of large stocks, rose 10.57 points yesterday, or 0.91 percent, to 1,173.48, its highest close since Aug. 27, 2001. The Dow industrials added 84.36 points, or 0.81 percent, to close at 10,469.84; the index, consisting of 30 blue-chip stocks, is now up 0.15 percent this year after an extended time in negative territory.
 The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 42 percent of its value from computer-related stocks, rose 26.71 points, or 1.31 percent, to 2,061.27. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gained 6.69 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 616.30. 
 Nearly three stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board was 1.39 billion shares, down from 1.52 billion on Wednesday. 
 Oil, which has weighed on stock prices this year, fell for the third day in four. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for December delivery declined $1.44, or 3 percent, to settle at $47.42 a barrel. 
 On Wednesday, the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee increased the benchmark federal funds rate for a fourth time in recent months by 0.25 percentage point, to 2 percent. 
 Technology stocks led yesterday's gains. Intel, the largest maker of computer semiconductors, advanced 31 cents, to $23.17, after announcing that its board had approved the selection of Paul S. Otellini, its president, to succeed Craig R. Barrett in May as chief executive. Mr. Barrett will succeed Andrew S. Grove, an Intel founder, as chairman. 
 Advanced Micro Devices rose $1.30, to $18.59, as Merrill Lynch recommended buying shares of the company, Intel's biggest competitor in personal computer chips. A Merrill Lynch analyst, Joseph Osha, raised his recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral.
 Microsoft, the largest software maker, gained 25 cents, closing at $29.98. On Wednesday, the company introduced a search engine intended to compete with Google's. 
 PeopleSoft fell 36 cents to $22.43. It rejected a takeover bid from Oracle for a fifth time. 
 PalmOne, the maker of hand-held computing products, rose $3.04, or 9 percent, to $36.76, after saying on Wednesday that its fiscal second-quarter sales would meet its earlier guidance for a 36 percent increase and that demand for its digital organizers remained strong.
 The retreat in oil prices helped airline stocks, with AMR gaining 36 cents, to $9.20.
 Hollywood Entertainment, owner of the Hollywood Video chain, rose $1.13, to $10.93, in Nasdaq trading. Blockbuster, the nation's largest video-rental chain, made an unsolicited $700 million bid to buy Hollywood Entertainment. Blockbuster's shares advanced 82 cents to $8.20.
 Shares of Coca-Cola and Tiffany fell after the companies reduced their earnings targets. Coke, the world's largest soft-drink maker, fell 21 cents, closing at $40.96. It said it was now looking toward sales growth of 3 percent to 4 percent, instead of previous targets of 5 to 6 percent, and operating income growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, down from 10 percent. It indicated that the situation next year might be even weaker. 
 Tiffany, the luxury retailer, fell $1.84, to $30.29, after forecasting 2004 profit as high as $1.48 a share, down from its previous estimate of at least $1.55 a share.
 The bond market was closed for Veterans Day and will reopen today.

HEADLINE: Bush May Call for Major European Role in Post-Arafat Peace Effort

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush is expected to call on Europe to assume a key role in helping the new Palestinian leadership build and support institutions and prepare for negotiations with Israel, American and European diplomats said Thursday.
 Such a call would represent a notable increase in cooperation between Washington and its European allies over the Middle East. An issue of contention until now had been the Europeans' continued communications with Yasir Arafat, who died early Thursday. The United States, along with Israel, believed that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be solved only without the involvement of Mr. Arafat. 
 The new role for Europe is likely to be discussed publicly on Friday after the president's meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the diplomats said.
 Also on the agenda is a possible American endorsement of a conference that Mr. Blair wants to hold on the Middle East early next year in Britain, the diplomats said.
 Another goal of some Europeans is to gain American support for jumping over the narrow issues of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and going directly to discussing the boundaries of a Palestinian state. Many in Europe also want Mr. Bush to appoint a special envoy for the Middle East.
 American officials say the Bush administration is highly unlikely to go that far, or even to press Israel at this point on freezing settlement expansion in the occupied lands and other matters. Instead, American willingness to engage Europe is likely to focus on encouraging moderate Palestinians to take leadership roles, helping them conduct elections, re-establishing security and working with the World Bank to finance the takeover of buildings in Gaza once Israel pulls out. 
 Mr. Bush was said to appreciate not simply Mr. Blair's willingness to involve Britain but also the involvement of President Jacques Chirac of France in Mr. Arafat's final days, principally in clarifying some details of his illness and arranging for him to be buried in Ramallah, on the West Bank, rather than the more explosive location of Jerusalem.
 Administration officials said two experienced mid-level envoys would represent the United States at Mr. Arafat's funeral in Cairo, though not at the burial in Ramallah. 
 The delegation is to consist of William J. Burns, assistant secretary of state for Middle East affairs, and Gamal Helal, who has been the interpreter for presidents and secretaries of state over the years in delicate negotiations on Israel and Palestinian issues.
 Mr. Blair arrived in Washington on Thursday night and immediately joined Mr. Bush at an informal White House dinner. The two were expected to hold meetings Friday morning to discuss the rapidly changing situation in the Middle East, including developments surrounding the death of Mr. Arafat and plans for his funeral and burial.
 ''The administration is going to be very supportive of engaging Europe on the Middle East,'' said an official familiar with the British-American discussions. ''Bush and Blair will lay out a vision of what they would do and how helpful it will be. But it's not clear how many details they will offer at this time.''
 Publicly on Thursday, the United States maintained its low-key reaction to the death of Mr. Arafat's, careful to avoid praising him too specifically while noting that his passing was a source of sadness among Palestinians.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that Mr. Arafat was ''a significant figure in the history of the region and the world'' and that ''in the eyes of the Palestinian people,'' he embodied ''their hopes and dreams'' for achieving statehood.
 Mr. Bush's discussions with Mr. Blair and expected encouragement of European involvement with the Palestinians are occurring as administration officials wrestle with what some acknowledge is a major quandary for them in the aftermath of Mr. Arafat's death.
 The president is described by aides as not wanting to change course on the Middle East, and certainly not wanting to drop his demands that the Palestinians do more to establish civilian institutions, reform their finances and political systems and disarm and arrest militant groups responsible for suicide bomb attacks on Israelis.
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel wants American acceptance of his plans to continue expanding settlements and building a barrier in the West Bank while he carries out his disengagement plan from Gaza, a policy supported by the United States.
 On the other hand, European leaders, led by Prime Minister Blair, want American help in getting Israeli concessions in the West Bank to strengthen the hand of Palestinian moderates struggling to emerge after Mr. Arafat's death.
 According to many officials and diplomats who deal with American envoys, the administration is still thinking through which way it wants to go, but there are signs that some in the administration favor a change in the American approach of backing Mr. Sharon's settlement expansions and his hard line in the West Bank.
 ''No one knows for sure how this is going to come out,'' an administration official said of the American quandary. ''A lot of it goes back to the fundamental question of how much the United States is willing to pressure Israel now that the American election is over. Quite honestly, Tony Blair is the only one who can get Bush to go down that road.''
 In recent months, the administration has given Mr. Sharon leeway to proceed with West Bank settlement expansion and other issues, hoping that the latitude he gets will enable him to get support from Israelis for the withdrawal of troops and settlers from Gaza.
 Lately, however, European, Arab and Palestinian leaders have begun expressing disdain for the Gaza plan as a ruse, not a real plan but a ploy to bury the idea of a Palestinian state. They cite Israel's settlement construction in the West Bank and its building of a barrier near Palestinian communities and its construction of a crisscross network of roads in the West Bank.
 Senior Arab and Palestinian leaders say Israeli moves in the West Bank totally undermine the credibility of the Gaza withdrawal.

HEADLINE: Mayor and Party Feuded Over Convention Speech

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
New Yorkers who sat through the Republican National Convention last summer saw thousands of protesters, hundreds of balloons, and people from Montana and Utah wearing giant rhinestone ''W'' pins. What they never saw was a behind-the-scenes clash between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Bush campaign aides over whether the mayor could give a speech lashing out at the Republican-led Congress for failing to deliver on post-9/11 security aid.
 Less than three hours before the speech was to be delivered, Mr. Bloomberg directed an aide to tell the Bush team that they would now have ''eight more minutes to fill'' in their schedule, because he would not be giving his speech, according to aides to both camps. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has often chided his Republican colleagues in Congress in the last year over the way they have calculated domestic security funds, and he wanted to make that point again in his welcoming remarks, the aides recalled. Bush campaign officials, who read the speech the night before the convention began, were not amused by the idea of Mr. Bloomberg slamming members of his own party at their convention. 
 At 8:30 the next morning, as he stood in the kitchen of his townhouse on the Upper East Side, campaign operatives on the other end of the phone ordered Mr. Bloomberg to remove that portion of his remarks. Mr. Bloomberg, lacing his response with some language that was decidedly not borrowed from his party's platform, said he would not be giving a speech at all. His name was even deleted from the program of speakers. 
 Only after tense down-to-the-wire negotiations did Mr. Bloomberg take the stage, according to aides from the Bloomberg administration and the president's campaign. In the end, a single sentence -- a line directly attacking Congress -- was excised, they added. Mr. Bloomberg did say, ''We all must recognize that homeland security funds should be allocated by threat and no other reason,'' a line that was greeted with stony silence.
 The next day, the matter was seemingly already in the past. Word of the hidden drama emerged only after the election, and the details were confirmed in interviews yesterday. When contacted, both Mayor Bloomberg's aides and those who worked on the Bush campaign were reluctant to discuss publicly an incident they considered long over. 
 The incident may be the most illustrative example of how Mr. Bloomberg struggled to balance his role as reluctant Republican with that of convention host in a town that was deeply ambivalent about its guests. Mr. Bloomberg personally raised millions of dollars for the convention, promoted the event for months beforehand and took a hard line with protesters who tried to disrupt the proceedings. But he also spent the week trying to avoid direct contact with President Bush -- keeping out of his photo ops and his box at Madison Square Garden -- and held parties for gay Republicans as well as for Republicans who support abortion rights. 
 Mr. Bloomberg had maintained for a year that Congress's formula for distributing antiterrorism money should be based on risk, not population. The fact that it cost millions to secure the city for the convention seemed to underscore his point, and aides said he wanted to make it in his speech. 
 ''The convention was a boost economically for New York City and gave us a great opportunity to make our case to the country,'' said Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary.
 But from the Bush-Cheney re-election team's perspective, it was unbecoming of Mr. Bloomberg to make any critical remarks of other Republicans during their moment in the spotlight in a such a fiercely contested election.
 The way Mr. Bloomberg saw things, he had undertaken the enormous security and political risks associated with the convention, put up $7 million of his own money for the event and was entitled to speak about whatever he wished, and his wishes ranged from factoids about New York City to domestic security. 
 So it was that while few people even bothered to show up for the speech -- 11:15 a.m. on opening day of the convention was not prime speaking time -- Mr. Bloomberg kept his remarks pretty much as he wrote them, and delivered them to a crowd that was more concerned with practicing line dancing and chatting. 
 ''I will repeat this message to my fellow Republicans, Democrats and independents as many times as it takes so we can keep New York safe and secure,'' he said during his remarks. Only when he praised Mr. Bush profusely was he applauded thunderously. 
 Nicolle Devenish, Mr. Bush's campaign communication director, would not comment directly on the dispute, but said, ''Mayor Bloomberg was an extraordinary host, and his contributions and his role were second to none.'' She added, ''It was very important to us, and we were honored to have Mayor Bloomberg speak at the president's nominating convention -- we would have been sorely disappointed if anything had prevented him from speaking.''
 National Republican officials said that as much as the mayor's help was appreciated, they could not approve a speech critical of party members at their own convention. The Bush team had gone to lengths to keep a show of unity, avoiding an ugly public platform fight and carefully vetting all convention speakers. A welcoming speech by Mr. Bloomberg in which he criticized the domestic security formula, these officials said, would have set the wrong tone.
 The standoff was solved only after the president of the city's host committee, Kevin Sheekey, made an urgent call to Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, to inform him of the situation as Mr. Rove was giving a speech in the Midwest. At that point, Mr. Bloomberg's advance team was informed that he would not be going to Madison Square Garden, and his name was deleted from the program.
 Mr. Rove finished his speech, then read the section of Mr. Bloomberg's remarks that were in question and the incident officially ended there. 
 Mr. Bloomberg gave his speech three minutes early, and then rushed off to run the city.

HEADLINE: For the First Time Since Vietnam, the Army Prints a Guide to Fighting Insurgents

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and THOM SHANKER; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
For the first time in decades, the Army has issued a field guide to counterinsurgency warfare, an acknowledgment that the kind of fighting under way in Iraq may become more common in the years ahead.
 The Army field manual on counterinsurgency operations is the first since the early Vietnam era, and the first ever intended for the kind of regular Army units now embroiled in battles in Iraq, as opposed to the Special Operations forces who have taken the lead in previous counterinsurgencies.
 Under orders issued in February, the manual was prepared on an accelerated basis by the Combined Arms Center in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and was distributed to all officers, in Iraq and elsewhere, beginning last month. An introduction says the ''aftermath of instability'' in Iraq that followed the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime underscored the need for an updated Army guide to counterinsurgency warfare. 
 Until now, formal American military doctrine for fighting insurgencies has been so limited that many Marines were deployed to Iraq with copies of the Marine Corps' ''Small Wars Manual,'' issued in 1940. The most recent Army guides on the subject, written principally for Special Operations forces, were prepared in 1963 and 1965, in the early stages of the Vietnam War. Like the Army, the Marine Corps is also updating its manual.
 The new Army guide contains instructions on such matters as searching a family car and setting up a hasty checkpoint. Other passages address the role played by ''transnational insurgents,'' like the foreign fighters in Iraq, and emphasize the role of intelligence, rather than Vietnam-era search and destroy missions, in finding insurgents.
 The guide also includes a stark warning about the dangers of prolonged counterinsurgency operations, saying that the longer American forces take the lead in such efforts, the greater the resentment they breed among the host-country population.
 ''A long-term U.S. combat role may undermine the legitimacy of the H.N. government and risks converting the conflict into a U.S.-only war,'' the manual says, using an abbreviation for host nation. ''That combat role can also further alienate cultures that are hostile to the U.S.''
 In some ways, military officials said, the guide just reflects tactics, techniques and procedures that troops in Iraq and Afghanistan already use, such as armoring vehicles against improvised explosives. 
 But for a hierarchical organization like the Army, the distribution of the guide is a sign of the importance being attached to the issue.
 Army officers who have recently returned from yearlong duty in Iraq applauded the doctrine, but said its methods were nothing new to field commanders, who have been employing and refining such tactics for months. The guide's distribution in October came nearly 18 months after the Iraq insurgency began in May 2003, following President Bush's declaration of an end to major combat operations. Army officers have acknowledged that the Army was ill-prepared to contend with the new environment.
 ''The important point here is that the Army has again, a bit late, recognized the importance of counterinsurgency, and is working to improve its capability to fight and win low-intensity conflicts,'' said an Army officer who recently returned from Iraq and demanded anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.
 The document is unclassified, but the Army has limited its distribution to Defense Department personnel, ''to maintain operations security,'' the document says. A copy of the document, dated October 2004, was posted Thursday on a Web site run by the Federation of American Scientists.
 Officially, the document is a ''field manual interim,'' a new designation that allows the Army to accelerate its normal schedule for preparing doctrine. The guide's principal author, Lt. Col. Jan Horvath of the Army, said in a telephone interview that it was completed in just five months; the Army usually insists on developing new doctrine over a period of three years.
 ''The stunning victory over Saddam Hussein's army in 2003 validated U.S. conventional force T.T.P.,'' the document says, using an abbreviation for tactics, techniques and procedures. ''But the ensuing aftermath of instability has caused review of lessons from the Army's historical experience and those of the other services and multinational partners.'' 
 According to the field manual, known as F.M.I. 3-07.22, the impetus for its creation ''came from the Iraq insurgency and the realization that engagements in the Global War on Terrorism (G.W.O.T.) would likely use counterinsurgency T.T.P.'s.'' It says its purpose is to review ''what we know about counterinsurgency'' and to explain ''the fundamentals of military operations in counterinsurgency environment.''
 Even before the document was published, military officers said that the Army's main training centers at Fort Polk, La., and Fort Irwin, Calif., had begun to consider lessons and comments from soldiers engaged in the Iraq counterinsurgency. 
 One purpose for the manual, Colonel Horvath said, was to update archaic language and concepts. The ''Small Wars Manual,'' which many Marines carried to Iraq, includes sections on the ''management of animals'' like mules, and assertions like a warning that mixed-race societies are ''always difficult to govern, if not ungovernable, owing to the absence of a fixed character.''
 The Army did issue a manual in 1990, F.M. 3-20, on the subject of military operations in low-intensity conflict, and that document included a section on counterinsurgency. But Colonel Horvath said that his commanders, including Lt. Gen. William Wallace, a top Army commander during the invasion of Iraq who now heads the Combined Arms Center, had found it to be inadequate.
 Senior Army officials said that events on the ground in Iraq and in Afghanistan made it clear months ago that the service had to revamp its doctrine for fighting insurgents.
 ''We needed to update the counterinsurgency doctrine,'' General Wallace said in an interview in late summer, as the document's authors were putting on the finishing touches. ''That hadn't been looked at since the post-Vietnam era.''
 General Wallace, who commanded the Army's V Corps during the Iraqi war, said that Army authors worked closely with the Marine Corps and with the British military, which has extensive counterinsurgency experience in places like Northern Ireland. But General Wallace cautioned that successful counterinsurgencies required calibrating the right degree of force with economic development and political institutions.
 ''We've got to strike the right balance,'' General Wallace said. ''Security has to be there for the economy and government to work. But having an economy and government is essential for security.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Don't Deter Shoppers; Consumer Confidence Index Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Consumers shrugged off record oil prices to increase spending at the start of the fourth quarter, data released Friday by the Commerce Department showed.
 Retail sales rose 0.2 percent as expected last month, but stripping out weaker car sales the underlying message from the consumer was strong, the Commerce Department said. 
 A solid advance in the University of Michigan's November consumer survey to 95.5 from 91.7, signaled that the mood of shoppers might have brightened now that uncertainty over the presidential election has lifted. 
 In other data, the Commerce Department said business inventories barely rose in September, falling short of expectations by rising only 0.1 percent compared with a 0.5 percent forecast as retailers emptied stocks at a rapid pace. 
 Economists, who concentrate on retail sales as the dominant component in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output, found the evidence encouraging. 
 ''Retail sales were much better than expected,'' said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, adding that the firm had raised its estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.9 percent from 3.4 percent amid broader evidence of rising demand. 
 Wall Street had predicted that retail sales would advance slightly after September's car-fueled performance, which was revised to show a 1.6 percent gain compared with the 1.5 percent rise initially reported. 
 Excluding auto sales, retail sales were up 0.9 percent compared with forecasts for a 0.5 percent gain.
 The September gain was 0.8 percent, revised up from 0.6 percent. 
 ''Consumer spending is quite solid and with jobs possibly being created again, we just might have a decent holiday shopping season,'' said Joel L. Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisers, referring to the 337,000 new jobs created in October.
 Sales of motor vehicles and parts declined 2.2 percent, a performance that had been anticipated after September's strong incentive-induced 4.3 percent surge as dealers cut prices to increase end-of-season sales. 
 But the numbers do show that record oil prices made themselves felt at the start of the fourth quarter. Sales at gasoline stations increased 4.3 percent, reflecting the effect of crude oil prices of $55 a barrel during the month. 
 Oil prices have since slipped back below the $50 a barrel threshold, indicating that gasoline prices may have peaked, and sales in other areas were also solid. 
 Economists said the benefits of cheaper gasoline might already be visible in the University of Michigan's latest consumer survey, which had been forecast to advance to a more modest 93.0. Expectations rose to 88.7 compared with 83.8 in October while current conditions improved to 106.2 from 104.0.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Rising Euro Gathers Much Angst

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Bruno E. Salzer insists he is too busy to worry about exchange rates. But Mr. Salzer, chairman of the German fashion house Hugo Boss, has kept a watchful eye on the galloping euro.
 ''We're still doing fine,'' he said in an interview Friday, as the euro skirted another record of $1.30 against the dollar. ''Even if it goes to $1.40, that would be O.K. But above that, it would be a problem.'' 
 Europe is in the midst of another bout of angst about its currency, which has risen nearly 7 percent in the last two months, amid signs the Bush administration will tolerate a prolonged weakness in the dollar.
 The skittishness has been compounded by new data showing that Europe's recovery sputtered in the third quarter -- dragged down by its two anchor economies, Germany and France. Each grew just 0.1 percent, compared with the previous three months, well below expectations.
 The reason the rising euro is viewed with such alarm is because it could choke off the exports -- like Hugo Boss shoes and Mercedes sedans -- that have been the engine of Europe's recovery. In Germany, where consumer spending is moribund, exports supply what little momentum the country has.
 But the strengthening euro is only one of multiple forces buffeting Europe. Rising oil prices were probably the bigger culprit for the latest weak numbers, according to economists. In France, which released new figures Friday, exports and consumer spending were both sluggish.
 ''French consumption was extremely strong at the beginning of this year,'' said Nicolas Sobczak, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Paris. ''We knew there would be a correction, but it was deeper than we expected.''
 The bad news in France and Germany more than offset better results in Belgium and Greece, to leave the 12-nation ''euro zone'' with an overall growth rate of 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Greece reaped a one-time gain from the Olympic Games, which brought tourists and trade to Athens. 
 Now, the European Commission and private economists are scrambling to reduce their forecasts for the rest of this year and 2005. While nobody is hoisting the red flag of recession, some economists said that growth in Germany, at least, was at risk of petering out entirely.
 Jorg Kramer, the chief strategist at Invesco, an asset management company in Frankfurt, said there was a significant risk that Germany could suffer zero growth for a time. ''I've been labeled a pessimist,'' he said, ''but even a pessimist can be overly optimistic.'' 
 Mr. Kramer's pessimism is widely shared in this case, because most economists expect the euro to rise further in 2005. The persistent budget and trade deficits in the United States, and the reluctance of Asian countries to let their currencies rise in value against the dollar, suggest that the euro will continue to absorb the bulk of the pressure from a weak dollar.
 At its current rate of increase, the euro would hit $1.40 by the middle of January. On Friday, it was trading up a bit from the day before, but down from its peak on Wednesday of $1.3006.
 ''We have to accept that we are in a long-lasting dollar bear market that will drive the euro to new heights,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''If it happens in an orderly way, Europe can handle it. If it comes as a shock, it will pull the seats out from under people.''
 Officials from the European Central Bank fanned out again on Friday to try to talk down the euro. Lucas Papademos, the vice president, said in a speech in Tokyo that ''excessive volatility is not desirable and not conducive to economic growth.'' Another board member, Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, said that ''brutal moves'' in exchange rates were not welcome.
 Short of intervening in the market, there is little the bank can do to stem the rise. Analysts said it was not likely to raise interest rates, because that could derail Europe's already fragile economies. The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has fretted about the damping effect of oil prices.
 ''They seem to be torn,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''They're trying to balance the upside risk of oil prices with the downside risk to growth of the euro. The market has been confused by the different comments.''
 The best remedy, some economists suggest, may be to avoid dwelling too much on the exchange rate. Martin W. Hufner, the chief economist at the HVB Group in Munich, noted that only 9 percent of Germany's exports go to the United States, compared with 43 percent in other euro countries.
 A strong euro, Mr. Hufner noted, raises the purchasing power of Europeans. This not only makes a vacation to Las Vegas or Hawaii cheaper, but it lowers the price of imports from the United States. In Germany, that could help revive the lackluster spending of consumers. The euro is also an insulation against rising oil prices, since those are calculated in dollars.
 ''We do have a chance, if oil prices come down, to foster more consumption in Germany,'' said Michael Heise, the chief economist of the Allianz Group. ''There could be a switch from export-led growth to domestic-led growth. Then we could get a pretty strong pickup next year.''
 For his part, Mr. Salzer of Hugo Boss is looking to Germany as an opportunity rather than an obstacle. The company, which is based in the southern German town of Metzingen, reported a 10 percent jump in sales in its home market, in the first nine months of 2004.
 ''I'm confident that after six or seven years of declining sales, Germany has hit the bottom,'' Mr. Salzer said.
 Hugo Boss, a unit of Marzotto of Italy, still depends on the United States, which is the second-largest market for its men's clothing after Germany. But the company produces 90 percent of its suits for the American market at a factory in Cleveland, which gives it something of a hedge against the vagaries of exchange rates.
 If the euro had not risen, Mr. Salzer estimates, Hugo Boss would have grown by 12 percent, instead of 10 percent. But, he added, ''nobody can predict exchange rates over the next five years.''

HEADLINE: Fed's Meeting in September Foresaw More Rate Increases

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve Board policy makers said at their September meeting that more interest rate increases would be needed to make sure inflation remained under control, but they also said that future moves should be tied closely to the economy's overall performance, according to the minutes of their discussions made public today.
 The central bank pushed rates up by another quarter-point this week, the fourth increase this year, putting the federal funds rate -- the amount of interest that banks charge one another -- at 2 percent. The figure reached a 46-year low of 1 percent earlier this year, before the Fed began its credit-tightening moves in late June. 
 In the minutes of the Sept. 21 meeting, Fed officials said that recent information about economic growth and the labor market had ''boosted their confidence that moderate economic growth would continue and that inflation would be contained.''
 The Fed officials said they believed that economic demand would expand at least as rapidly as the economy's ability to produce goods and services in coming months. For that reason, the policy makers continued to see a need for further rate increases, according to the minutes.
 ''However, in the view of many members, policy actions would need to be increasingly keyed to incoming data,'' the minutes said.
 Many private economists said before this week's meeting that they believed the central bank was moving from a position where rate increases were almost automatic to a position where the rate increases, while likely at each meeting, would depend on incoming data.
 The September minutes even noted comments of financial market participants that they were not interpreting the Fed's pledge to raise rates at a ''measured'' pace as an indication that the central bank felt the need to move at every meeting, or by the same amount every time.
 The Fed has raised rates by a quarter-point at every meeting since June. Many analysts predict that those regular, modest rate increases will continue in December and then for most of next year, although private economists said after Wednesday's rate increase that the central bank could decide to pause at some point to determine what impact the earlier rate increases were having.

PERSON: George Gross

HEADLINE: George Gross, 70, Reorganizer Of New York Social Services

 BODY:
George Gross, who reorganized New York's vast and troubled Human Resources Administration as its commissioner in the mid-1980's, died on Wednesday in Washington. He was 70 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md. 
 He had lung cancer and died after surgery to remove a section of his lungs, said his son, Julian. 
 At a time when New York's crack epidemic and its disruption of poor families made his position a lightning rod, Mr. Gross divided the Human Resources Administration, the city's social services agency, into three departments that have remained autonomous. Today these functions are known as the Human Resources Administration, concerned with public assistance; the Department of Homeless Services; and the Administration for Children's Services. 
 He also tried to reduce homelessness by shifting funds to organized shelters, reflecting his longstanding interest in building inexpensive housing. 
 In 1986, he left the Human Resources Administration to become executive director of the Financial Control Board, created during New York's fiscal crisis in the 1970's to monitor and approve the city's budget. 
 Earlier he was a behind-the-scenes architect of the federal government's most popular grant program for community development, the Community Development Block Grant. He had championed the program, and several housing measures, while he was chief counsel of the House Banking Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development in the 1970's.
 ''Before something even got to us, he really had a major role in the design of the programs themselves,'' said Thomas Ludlow Ashley, a former congressman from Ohio who was chairman of the subcommittee.
 Born Gabor Grosz on May 1, 1934, in Hungary, he emigrated with his family to Connecticut shortly before Hitler closed the country's borders. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Connecticut and a law degree from Boston University.
 In Washington, he joined the Department of Housing and Urban Development, at the time called the Housing and Home Financing Agency, as a staff attorney. 
 He was later executive director of the House Budget Committee and was chief lobbyist for the National League of Cities in 1978. In 1989, he became a federal lobbyist for the Magazine Publishers of America. Last year he was lured out of retirement for about nine months to become chief administrator of Bridgeport, Conn., his childhood hometown.
 His marriage to Marcy Gross ended in divorce. He is survived by a son, Julian, of San Francisco; a daughter, Alexandra Drees-Gross, of Washington; a brother, Joseph, of Fairfield, Conn.; and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Agrees to Destroy Antiaircraft Missiles

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, on the second day of a mission to strengthen security ties across Central and South America, received an unambiguous promise on Friday that Nicaragua would destroy all of its portable antiaircraft missiles supplied by the Soviet Union and Cuba during the 1980's.
 More than 2,000 of the shoulder-fired SA-7 missiles remained in the Nicaraguan arsenal at the start of this year, a potent remnant of a time when the former Sandinista government here received military assistance from the Communist world.
 After meeting with Mr. Rumsfeld, the Nicaraguan president, Enrique Bolanos, said it was in Nicaragua's best interests to destroy the entire stockpile of missiles. 
 In past negotiations, the United States had pressed Nicaragua to quickly destroy its arsenal of the missiles. Pentagon officials say such missiles are prized by terrorists, who could use them to bring down a commercial airliner, a military passenger plane or helicopter ferrying government and military personnel. And they express fears that the lucrative black-market price for the missiles, which are suitcase-sized and can be easily smuggled, would be too tempting for officers who controlled the country's armory. 
 But Nicaraguan officials have been quoted in the local news media as saying that they planned to keep about 400 of the weapons to help defend the nation in a border dispute with Honduras, or that they would demand hefty compensation from the United States for their total destruction.
 ''We seek no compensation for destroying the missiles,'' President Bolanos said at an afternoon news conference with Mr. Rumsfeld.
 Earlier this year, Nicaragua destroyed about 600 antiaircraft missiles out of its stockpile of more than 2,000. On Friday, after issuing his pledge to complete its program of ridding Nicaragua of the weapons, President Bolanos estimated that it would take about a year and a half more to destroy all of the missiles.
 In recent weeks, American intelligence agencies have tripled their formal estimate of the number of shoulder-fired missile systems believed to be at large worldwide, since determining that at least 4,000 of the weapons in Iraq's prewar arsenals cannot be accounted for. In 2002, attackers fired two of the small Russian-made SA-7 missiles and almost hit a commercial aircraft taking off from Mombasa, Kenya.
 Although Mr. Rumsfeld is journeying through Central and South America to discuss regional security issues, the war in Iraq and the current offensive in Falluja have been repeatedly raised.
 Earlier Friday in El Salvador, Mr. Rumsfeld awarded American Bronze Star medals to six Salvadoran soldiers who repelled a band of 15 to 20 Iraqi insurgents attacking a convoy carrying six American officials on March 5.
 El Salvador is the only other country in the Western Hemisphere with troops in Iraq. The six Salvadoran soldiers, members of the 370-strong contingent of Salvadoran special operations troops based in south-central Iraq, were guarding a convoy rolling south from Baghdad that included the American diplomat serving as the senior Coalition Provisional Authority official in Najaf.
 The Salvadoran troops' defense against the ambush was an example of ''courage and calm under fire,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said in awarding the Bronze Stars for ''exceptional, meritorious service.''

HEADLINE: Rally on Retail Sales Data Gives Shares 3rd Weekly Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street closed its third consecutive winning week with another rally yesterday, advancing as a new retail sales report and a consumer confidence reading showed that Americans are growing more confident about the economy.
 The latest Commerce Department report said retail sales rose 0.2 percent in October. 
 Stabilizing crude oil futures once again helped stocks. A barrel of light crude settled at $47.32, down 10 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''The retail report, along with oil and the elections and the economy, they've all contributed to a very nice run we've had, and should continue to have through the end of the year,'' said Hans Olsen, managing director and chief investment officer at Bingham Legg Advisers in Boston. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.17 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,539.01. It was the Dow's best close since April 6, as the index continued to move into positive territory for the year to date, now up 0.8 percent.
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 10.69 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,184.17, its best close since Aug. 24, 2001. 
 The Nasdaq composite index gained 24.07 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,085.34, its best showing since Feb. 11.
 Wall Street finished its third consecutive week in positive territory thanks to broad buying across all sectors. While the post-election rally continued, the exuberance of investors in the last two weeks was replaced by more caution, though lower oil prices and a reassuring statement from the Federal Reserve helped fuel steady buying.
 For the week, the Dow gained 1.46 percent, the S.&P. 500 rose 1.54 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.28 percent.
 Analysts said yesterday's retail sales figures showed that consumers' view of the economy was improving just in time for the holiday shopping season. That was confirmed by the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which posted a preliminary 95.5 reading for November, up from 91.7 in October and far better than the 93 reading Wall Street had expected.
 The Commerce Department report helped retail stocks, with the discounter Target rising $1.25, to $52.02, and Wal-Mart Stores climbing 23 cents, to $56.85. Shares of major automakers were mixed on the report. Ford Motor lost 2 cents, to $14.23, while General Motors was up 31 cents at $40.21.
 Dell gained $3.19, to $40.44, after the company posted record third-quarter sales and a 25 percent increase in profit. The company's results were in line with Wall Street estimates. Dell also said it would see $60 billion in annual revenue by 2006, a year ahead of schedule. The company's confidence could help revive flagging interest in computer stocks over all, analysts said.
 ''It wasn't necessarily the numbers that got them moving, it was their tone and confidence in their report,'' said Keith Keenan, vice president for institutional trading at Wall Street Access. ''Dell has managed to become the Wal-Mart of the PC space, with excellent service and really low costs. They're proving you can turn a serious profit.''
 Pixar Animation Studios, producer of ''Finding Nemo'' and ''The Incredibles,'' beat Wall Street's profit forecasts by 14 cents a share. Pixar surged $6.60, to $86.54 a share.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 26/32, to a price of 100 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.18 percent from 4.28 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Consumer Inflation in China Is Up, but the Pace Slowed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
After two years of accelerating inflation, consumer prices in China unexpectedly rose more slowly in October than in any month since April, as a bountiful harvest led to less-rapid increases in food prices. 
 But as consumer inflation slowed a bit, wholesale prices accelerated last month. Faced with the divergent numbers, economists said it was unclear whether Beijing had really succeeded in addressing the breakneck growth in some sectors of the economy that has pushed up prices around the globe for industrial commodities like steel. 
 The National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that China's consumer price index rose 4.3 percent last month after climbing 5.2 percent in September and 5.3 percent in July and August. The producer price index jumped 8.4 percent last month after increasing 7.9 percent in September and 6.8 percent in August, the bureau said.
 Tao Dong, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that the slower increase in consumer prices in October was unlikely to prove a watershed. While rising food prices are no longer a problem for Chinese consumers, he said, many of those consumers will soon face rising prices for other purchases.
 Prices will start rising faster in a few months, he said, because of higher oil and commodity prices, higher utility charges for water and electricity, and higher costs for manufactured goods as the wages of migrant workers increase.
 ''It's premature to call it a turning point; we're in a valley between two inflation drives,'' Mr. Tao said.
 Ifzal Ali, the chief economist of the Asian Development Bank, said in an interview here that the slowing in food prices was a surprise. While the harvest may have been good, many government policies in China now seem aimed at increasing farmers' incomes, he noted.
 Elsewhere, China's commerce ministry predicted on Friday that the country's rapidly growing trade would expand more slowly next year -- a development that, if it happens, could result in lesser inflationary pressures. Exports and imports together will rise only 15 percent next year after expanding 30 percent this year, the ministry said.
 The ministry attributed the slowdown to rising oil prices that would leave consumers in the United States, Europe and elsewhere with less money to spend on the wide range of manufactured goods that China churns out in such abundance, from wristwatches to microwave ovens.

HEADLINE: In an Ohio Town, Same-Sex Marriage Ban Brings Tensions to Surface

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

DATELINE: GRANVILLE, Ohio, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
A couple of nights after Election Day, the Rev. Dr. Rick Mixon, the interim pastor of the First Baptist Church here, had dinner with the Rev. Karen Chakoian, his friend and counterpart at the town's Presbyterian church. The conversation turned to how they planned to approach their congregations now that the election was over.
 Dr. Mixon, who is openly gay, ministers to an energetically liberal congregation, one he expected to find somewhat disconsolate on Sunday morning, after Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. He asked Ms. Chakoian how she intended to deal with the election. By avoiding it and talking about Communion, she said. Nearly two-thirds of the men and women in her congregation in this rural community had voted for President Bush, she figured, so what was there to say?
 Granville, which occupies a four-square-mile patch of central Ohio about 30 miles east of Columbus, is home to markedly divergent social ideologies that have, until recently, lived in parallel seclusion. For years, the rural town of 3,100 has embraced both a conservative evangelical community and an impassioned liberal one that includes a subculture of left-leaning gay Christians. Until last week, they quietly coexisted. 
 Senator John Kerry took Granville by 40 votes, and the same-sex marriage ban was defeated by 544 votes, though many of the votes against the amendment came from the precinct that is home to Dennison University and its liberal student body. But 1,060 Granville residents contributed to the ballot item's 2-to-1 victory in surrounding Licking County, one of the state's most conservative. 
 Gays and lesbians in and around Granville say the success of Issue 1, as the marriage amendment was called, exposed biases they had assumed were not so firmly in place.
 ''Knowing that your neighbors, the people who you wave and say hi to, looked at that amendment and voted yes is very unsettling,'' said Stephen Trumbull, who moved to Granville from Long Beach, Calif., with his partner three years ago to run his small music publishing business and pursue the comforts of rural life.
 Since the election, Mr. Trumbull said, he has found himself going to town less frequently; last week he did not go at all. He has avoided his usual lunch spot, he said, and preferred to socialize in what he feels is the more comfortable metropolitan atmosphere of Columbus. ''Part of it is that I'm always wondering, is this person in front of me someone who has denied me my rights?'' Mr. Trumbull said. ''Is it the bank teller, is it the waitress where I normally eat lunch? Is it the shopkeeper?''
 For members of the more conservative religious community, the passage of Issue 1 was met with a sense of satisfaction in knowing that their faith-oriented beliefs were shared by many. Some saw it as an important corrective to what they perceived as the news media's ''normalizing'' of gay relationships.
 ''Many Democrats I know are fearful about the economy, but I feel that if you go back to the basics, things will fix themselves,'' said Marla Krak, a mother of three who said she believed that homosexuality was a choice.
 Ms. Krak is a member of Spring Hills, a Southern Baptist church whose congregation expanded when the town's First Baptist Church began welcoming gay congregants in the 1980's. Spring Hills, which has about 1,300 members, posted a sign in its parking lot this month that read, ''Righteousness exalts a nation.''
 Each time Nancy Snyder, a gay Christian single mother, drove by, she said, she felt a sense of dislocation. ''It's a sinking feeling to think that you live in a place where some people have just voted to say that you are not a real person,'' she said.
 At First Baptist, whose congregation numbers about 300, one-quarter are gays and lesbians. Dr. Mixon is one of two gay clerics in town. Every Sunday, the Rev. Marj Creech, a lesbian minister, officiates a service in her home, a converted barn here, for the eastern Ohio chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, a Christian fellowship begun for gays and lesbians in the late 1960's. 
 Last Sunday, after the service, Ms. Creech, who graduated from Drew Theological Seminary, held a get-together in her home for a dozen or so members of the Granville-area gay community, nearly all of whom expressed dismay and confusion after Issue 1's passing.
 Many in the group said that until the election they had believed that the migration of gays and lesbians to the suburbs and beyond had fostered more rather than less acceptance in Ohio and elsewhere.
 Ms. Snyder said that when she went into town last week for dinner with friends, she ''felt extremely uncomfortable.'' ''I kept thinking we are the only gay people here,'' she said. Ms. Snyder, who participates in Bible study and prayer groups, said that she also felt alienated from her faith. She has been thinking about taking her daughter to parks in Columbus instead. 
 Other gays say they feel compelled to avoid retreat. Ms. Creech said, ''I want to be out and active more than ever.'' Since the election, she has been motivated to organize gays in rural Ohio. A few days after the election, she held a social gathering for 50 in her home.
 ''I used to think that I was on the religious right's side of the culture wars,'' Ms. Creech said. ''I have never thought of myself as a relativist. I believe in a right and wrong and that God determines right and wrong,'' she continued. ''But I guess now I feel more closely identified with the left.''
 Granville had witnessed little activism until last year, when John Moreland, a high school senior, came out and started a gay youth alliance. Mr. Moreland was the group's only gay member, but 20 of his heterosexual friends joined him in support. The group disbanded when he went to college in Washington this fall.
 Among those religious people who supported the amendment, some say it has brought a more focused attention to the complexity of gay issues. Emily Cramer, a nurse practitioner who lives here and is a Methodist, said she voted for Issue 1 because it upheld biblical teaching. 
 ''I'm aware that it will cause difficulty for others, and part of the calling of a Christian is to be sensitive to others,'' she said. ''I certainly don't have all the answers.''
 Ms. Cramer said she had never had a gay neighbor but hoped that if she did, she would treat that neighbor with kindness and also ''feel that at some point, after a good relationship were developed, that I could feel free enough to voice my beliefs.''
 Julie Uible, also a member of Spring Hills Baptist Church, said that although she had voted against the amendment, her opinions about civil unions were not yet solidified. ''A knee-jerk reaction is not where I'm at,'' she said. ''And I do feel as though I am in a bit of a bubble here. I rarely get opinions that come from outside Christian culture anymore. When I worked, I used to be around different viewpoints that really challenged you and made you think.'' 
 Dr. Mixon, the gay pastor at First Baptist, has been doing some thinking in recent days. He has frequented a local coffee shop for some time now. After the election, he said, an acquaintance told him, ''we can't go to that coffee shop anymore; it's run by fundamentalist Christians.'' Dr. Mixon briefly thought about taking his business elsewhere but talked to a friend, a retired professor of ethics.
 In the end, Dr. Mixon decided that was not the way to bridge Granville's gap. ''That's just not the answer,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption on Nov. 13 about Ohio's vote for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages, and its reception in the town of Granville, which has strongly committed liberal and evangelical Christian congregations, misstated the position of Julie Uible, a member of Spring Hills Baptist Church. Ms. Uible, who said she was resisting ''a knee-jerk reaction'' on civil unions, told of having voted for the amendment, not against it. 
 Because of an editing error, the article also misspelled the name of a local university where students are generally liberal. It is Denison, not Dennison.

HEADLINE: As the Dollar Declines

 BODY:
For all its professed desire for a strong dollar, the Bush administration has apparently decided that letting the dollar slide is a good way to shrink America's trade deficit. This is dubious economic policy. It provides a modicum of relief to American exporters, but it increases the nation's vulnerability to higher prices and higher interest rates, while ignoring fiscal measures that would more assuredly anchor the United States in the global economy. 
 The dollar, which has declined nearly 30 percent against the euro since President Bush took office in 2001, fell to a record low this week. The decline has not been as marked against other currencies, largely because China and Japan prop up the dollar by investing heavily in United States Treasury securities -- in effect, lending us money so we can buy their goods. Meanwhile, the Treasury secretary, John Snow, has largely eliminated the phrase ''strong dollar'' from his workaday vocabulary. 
 The underlying problem is that deficits in America's global transactions are at record levels, putting Americans at risk of either a slow deterioration in living standards or abrupt spikes in inflation and interest rates. There are three ways to get that deficit down: America can reduce the federal budget deficit, thus lowering the amount of interest we pay foreign countries to finance that deficit; trading partners like Europe and Japan can expand their economies, increasing their demand for American goods; or America can allow its dollar to fall to increase its exports.
 The only lasting remedy is to reduce the federal budget deficit. That, in turn, calls for specific policies, like -- we may have mentioned this before -- rolling back the Bush tax cuts. Letting the dollar weaken is a far less responsible approach, an unwieldy and risky attempt to reduce the trade imbalance without the political pain of deficit reduction. 
 During the Bush years, 92 percent of the nearly $1 trillion increase in publicly held debt has been financed by foreign lenders. Foreign ownership of Treasuries has tripled from the peak of the Reagan deficits in 1983. Because of this enormous dependency, anything that might affect foreign lenders' willingness to invest in Treasuries -- including dismay over the United States' long-term fiscal disarray, better investment opportunities elsewhere, or geopolitical or economic strife -- could cause the dollar to tank. 
 No one knows if or when that would actually happen, though the dollar's slide since the election doesn't inspire confidence. But we do know that financial flows are quick and unsentimental. A fiscal policy that esteems controlling the deficit over tax cuts is the best way to avoid a debilitating dollar decline. 
 There is truth to the complaint that countries in Europe and elsewhere are not doing enough to bolster consumption within their own economies. But there's precious little the United States can do about it. Instead of complaining, Washington should get its own affairs in order. 
 The president, wed as he is to deficit-bloating policies, is not likely to step up to that responsibility without a stern shove from Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike. While they're at it, they should press Mr. Bush to choose Treasury officials who are true economic stewards, not merely cheerleaders for his ''tax cuts above all'' policies. If leadership is not forthcoming, the invisible hand of the global financial community is all too likely to provide the push.

HEADLINE: U.S. and U.N. Are Once Again the Odd Couple Over Iraq

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan's reluctance to commit staff members to Iraq in large numbers and a series of comments he has made about the war have strained relations with the Bush administration and left many Americans bewildered, according to both supporters and critics of the United Nations.
 Mr. Annan withdrew international staff members from Iraq in October 2003 in the wake of attacks on relief workers and the bombing of the United Nations' Baghdad headquarters, which killed 22 people, including the mission chief, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Although the United Nations has been assigned the task of setting up elections scheduled for January, Mr. Annan has declined to send more than a handful of electoral workers to Iraq, citing the lack of security forces to protect them. 
 ''The Iraqis and the Americans are completely frustrated,'' said a senior American official at the United Nations, reporting views he said he heard in the White House this week. ''The secretary general is still recommending many thousands of peacekeepers in Sierra Leone and the Congo, and yet there are seven election workers in Iraq. That tells the whole story.''
 This official said that warnings were resurfacing at the White House that the United Nations was risking becoming irrelevant and that such comments were now being combined with a dismissive attitude toward Mr. Annan himself.
 ''We're beyond anger,'' the official said. ''We won re-election, Kofi's term is up in '06 and though we have been asking him to define the U.N. role in Iraq, he is thumbing his nose at us.''
 William H. Luers, president of the United Nations Association of the United States, acknowledged concern among the organization's backers. ''I think a lot of Americans who are very sympathetic to the U.N. are confused with this last phase,'' he said. 
 ''Most Americans don't really take into account the rule-of-law aspects of international behavior,'' Mr. Luers said. ''We generally think what we do is right and in a certain sense we set the rules. Nonetheless, the world doesn't see it that way, and I think Kofi is talking to that world. I think he almost has to be where he is, but it's a tough time for him among Americans.''
 In an interview Thursday night at his office overlooking the East River, Mr. Annan said he was distressed by the criticism. 
 ''I have tried to be as helpful as possible, and I have stated at every opportunity that the stabilization of Iraq is everyone's responsibility,'' Mr. Annan said. ''I have argued that regardless of one's position on the war, we must all come together to stabilize Iraq.''
 At issue are three recent actions by Mr. Annan. In September, he suggested in a BBC interview that the war in Iraq was ''illegal.'' He barred lawyers with the United Nations war crimes tribunal from taking part in training sessions last month for Iraqi judges and prosecutors who will be trying Saddam Hussein and other former Iraqi leaders. And two weeks ago he sent a letter to the United States, British and Iraqi governments warning that a military assault on Falluja could further alienate Iraqis and undermine the elections scheduled for January.
 ''All of these actions were unhelpful,'' said Rich Williamson, who was a deputy United States ambassador to the United Nations from 2001 to 2003. ''Iraq is a place where the U.N. could show that it can make a valuable and important contribution, but it is just hurting itself in not helping the Iraqi people and sitting on the sidelines.''
 Further jeopardizing Mr. Annan's image in American eyes are the allegations of corruption and a cover-up in the scandal-ridden oil-for-food program and the intense anger on Capitol Hill at the refusal of the independent investigation headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to share documents with the various Congressional committees conducting their own inquiries.
 Officials in Mr. Annan's office say they fear a return to the mood of the 1980's when the United States, the organization's single biggest donor, reacted to Congressional displeasure with the United Nations by withholding payments.
 In the interview, Mr. Annan denied that he was being obstructionist over Iraq, and he contended that the United Nations had been instrumental in selecting the interim Iraqi government and had succeeded in training 6,000 election registrars and opening up hundreds of registration places across the country, despite a low number of United Nations staff members now in Baghdad. 
 Asked if he was under pressure from countries opposed to the war not to cooperate with the Americans, he replied: ''Actually, it's the other way around. I am the one who is always telling governments, including those that did not support the war, that the civilization of Iraq is everyone's business because we cannot have a chaotic Iraq in the middle of that region.''
 He said he had had little success in persuading any countries to contribute troops to a 4,000-member force called for in a Security Council resolution in June that was intended to protect the United Nations and allow it to increase its presence in Iraq. Asked why countries were resisting, he said, ''I think they are concerned about the security situation, and they probably have their own public opinion and parliaments to convince.''
 He said he was concerned about the damage to the United Nations' reputation caused by the oil-for-food scandal and accusations that he was being passive in reacting to it. But he said his interest in protecting the integrity of the Volcker investigation and his obligation to maintain its independence prevented him from taking any individual action. 
 As for the requests from Congressional committees for records and documents, he said, ''It's a bit like having a case in court in New York, and you have several other courts from other places that want to deal with the same case.''
 Speaking of his directive preventing United Nations judicial officials from helping to create the Iraqi courts, he noted that there was no Security Council mandate for such assistance and cited the organization's formal opposition to judicial systems that include the death penalty. ''As you know,'' he said, ''quite a few members of this organization won't even extradite someone to a country where the death penalty exists.''
 With the United States pressuring him to increase the United Nations presence in Iraq and with the unions representing the world body's 60,000 employees around the globe demanding that the organization leave Iraq all together, Mr. Annan said he had to find creative ways to maintain a balance. ''At least we are there, and many others are not there,'' he said.
 ''Without being boastful,'' he said, ''I think that except for these activities of ours, we would not have moved as far as we have, whether it was the establishment of an interim Iraqi government or the preparation for the elections. I think our role has been essential, and not one that is played by an organization that is irrelevant.''

HEADLINE: Under the Beauty, an Up-to-Date Beast

BYLINE: By RICHARD FEAST

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
TO the short list of the year's most exclusive works of kinetic art Bentley Continental GT, Ford GT, Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Porsche Carrera GT -- you can add a new and remarkable bit of sculpture, the Aston Martin DB9.
 Automotive fashionistas, including those who rarely give obscure Aston Martin a second thought, are going to find its latest car hard to resist. Even in Britain, where the sight of an Aston Martin is perhaps a bit more common than in the United States, pedestrians stop in their tracks and stare. Other drivers' eyeballs lock on the DB9 and swivel as it passes. Young men -- and the not so young -- want their pictures taken next to it. The car generates grins and thumbs-up signs wherever it goes. 
 While it remains true that beauty is in the beholder's eye, and there is a faint chance that Americans will be less impressed, the reactions I recorded while driving the DB9 suggest that on a desirability scale of 1 to 10, the new Aston Martin rates about a 12. Over many years of driving fancy new cars, this writer has never spent time in one that won such universal acclaim. 
 The shape was created by Henrik Frisker, the Danish design director of Aston Martin. Its lineage is clear. While essentially a new car, the DB9 is an evolution of the DB7, which owed its inspiration to postwar Aston Martins. The graceful look is similar, yet smoother and more modern. 
 Making judgments purely on aesthetics is not enough, however. The pretty profile is matched by Olympian performance thanks to a revised 5.9-liter V-12 engine that now pumps out 450 horsepower. 
 The first United States customers will take delivery of their cars this week. What will they get for their $160,000 (including a $3,700 gas-guzzler tax)? 
 Exclusivity, certainly. Aston Martin, which is now part of Ford's Premier Automotive Group, has made no more than 20,000 cars in its 90 years of existence. Until a few years ago, most of those were sold to British enthusiasts, which means an Aston Martin of any sort is as rare in the United States as a cricket champion. 
 This will not change much. A Volante convertible arrives next June, but production of all DB9's will barely reach 2,000 a year. Only a third will come to North America; Aston Martin now sells cars in 32 countries.
 In contrast, thousands of Ferraris and Porsches roam American roads. Dr. Ulrich Bez, chief executive of Aston Martin, sees that as an advantage. ''People always look for the alternative,'' he said in an interview, adding that Ferrari and Porsche owners ''are all potential customers for us.''
 Aston Martin's alternative is a two-door coupe 185 inches long. The manufacturer asserts that the car, with its minuscule back seats, has 2-plus-2 seating, but it would be an act of cruelty to require anyone but a child to sit in the rear for more than a couple of miles. 
 Indeed, a weak point of this rather large car is its rather tight space. The trunk is so-so. Each door pocket can accommodate little more than an iPod, and the glovebox is good for gloves and little else. Heavens, there is no place for a Michelin Guide. 
 Even so, Aston Martin trims the nearly useless rear seat to the same beautiful standard as the area in front. Most surfaces, including seats, transmission tunnel, dashboard and doors, are covered in soft leather. Wood trim -- a choice of walnut, mahogany or bamboo -- is restricted to the console and the caps of the doors.
 A crystal starter button is prominent on the console, and it is flanked, on cars with the automatic transmission, by buttons that select park, reverse, neutral and drive. These are complemented by paddles on the steering wheel that permit the driver to zing through the six speeds like a real racer. There is no shift lever.
 The DB9 is the first Aston Martin to use the bonded aluminum-alloy chassis that will underpin all future models. The company says the structure combines light weight with exceptional rigidity and durability. The car's bodywork, its engine and most suspension components are also made of aluminum alloy.
 The V-12 is an exclusive Aston Martin engine that has its origins in two Ford V-6's. Its output is enough for most people: 450 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m. and 420 pounds-feet of peak torque at 5,000 r.p.m.
 To create a well-balanced car -- for good handling and high-speed stability -- the engine sits well back in the chassis, and the transmission is situated with the differential in the rear axle. Two six-speed transmissions are offered, an automatic by ZF or a manual by Graziano. 
 The DB9 complies with the formula laid down for high-performance cars from the earliest days of motoring: lightweight construction, a mighty engine, the latest technology.
 The fuel economy rating is predictably poor: 11 m.p.g. in town, 19 on the highway. But the performance is prodigious. The company claims a top speed of 186 m.p.h., and it says the stick-shift model will leap from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in 4.8 seconds and howl its way to 100 m.p.h. in only 10.8 seconds. Of course, performance of this caliber is merely the entry ticket to the supercar club these days.
 Rival cars may be even quicker, but the matter is academic. The DB9 is plenty fast for almost anyone, few of whom have access to places where such performance can be verified. 
 But driving this car on any road elevates the ego and sharpens the senses. Its size and low seating position require fine judgments when maneuvering in traffic -- the car demands concentration. The DB9 is generally refined and quiet until the throttle is floored, and then there is a wonderful howl from the exhausts at just over 3,000 r.p.m. It is reassuringly well mannered on corners.
 What ultimately distinguishes the DB9 is the lovely simplicity of Mr. Frisker's design. While the engineering of rival cars may be equally dazzling, they are often visually derivative, lumpy or just plain ugly. In contrast, the DB9 is an understated modern marvel that cloaks its prowess in the trappings of elegance.

HEADLINE: Trade Issues Sour U.S.-Canadian Friendships

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: COURVAL, Saskatchewan, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Gerry Duckworth nails posters around his cattle ranch just north of the Montana border warning American hunters to get off his land as long as Canadian cattle are banned in the United States. ''NO BEEF = NO HUNTING,'' the signs scold. 
 Those are fighting words and reflect the deep feelings of chagrin among western Canadians, who normally look kindly on the United States. Mr. Duckworth has printed thousands of the signs, and they are appearing across Canadian prairies, where American hunters were once welcomed with open arms. 
 The ranchers are frustrated by the lingering American ban on live Canadian cow exports, a ban that began when a single cow was found to have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in neighboring Alberta in May 2003.
 ''I got a lot of friends down there, and two-thirds of my herd comes from the United States,'' Mr. Duckworth said. ''Are there hard feelings? Yes, I'm disheartened.''
 Canadians contend that their cows are indistinguishable from American cows because they cross the border so often, and say that regulations to prevent the use of cattle feed that can spread mad cow disease are virtually identical in both. But the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, an American group that has successfully sued to restrain imports of Canadian beef, says that the Canadian cattle pose a health hazard. 
 The Canadian cattlemen's assertion that the ban has become nothing more than protectionism pushed by a powerful lobby is echoed by thousands of other rural Canadians who cut lumber and produce wheat and hogs and also face trade challenges from American competitors. 
 The trade disputes get scant attention in the United States and are small in the context of the largest free trading relationship between any two countries in the world. But they are corroding Canadian feelings toward the United States, which has complicated efforts by Prime Minister Paul Martin to promote security and military policies that are closer to American positions.
 ''Over 96 percent of our trade is dispute-free, but these high profile disputes do poison opinion,'' said Canada's international trade minister, James S. Peterson.
 Daily trade between the countries amounts to $1.2 billion, with Canada enjoying a $70 billion surplus with the United States last year. That surplus is the main motor for Canada's surging economy and currency.
 But disputes over a handful of agricultural products have become a major issue because of nationalistic feelings in Canada, where plummeting prices for cattle and land have put financial pressure on local banks and other businesses that serve the ranchers. More than 6,000 jobs related to cattle have been lost since the ban on live imports was imposed.
 ''This has brought anti-Americanism in this country to levels I've never seen in my life, and I find it very disturbing,'' said Lyle Stewart, a conservative member of the Saskatchewan provincial legislature.
 High United States tariffs on Canadian lumber have also forced a consolidation of that industry in Canada, and about 50 mills have closed. Some companies have bought mills across the border to avoid the tariffs, moving jobs to the United States. 
 ''Economic terrorism, that's what we call it,'' said Barry Howardson, a 40-year-old electrician who lost his job when Interfor, a lumber company, closed its sawmill in Squamish, British Columbia, last year as a result of a 27 percent American tariff levied on many wood products in 2002. He now works with other former full-time employees disassembling the Squamish mill.
 Talks between Canada and the United States on the timber issue have sputtered for years, with the dispute centering on the differences in the two lumber economies. American timberlands are privately owned with harvesting rights auctioned off at market rates, but most Canadian timberlands are owned by provincial governments, which set timber fees that American lumber lobbyists say are kept artificially low.
 But a panel of the North American Free Trade Agreement ruled against the tariffs in August, saying that Canadian pricing policies did not pose a threat to American lumber. It was one of several Nafta and World Trade Organization findings that went against Washington.
 Canada is urging the United States to refund to Canadian companies $2.5 billion in duties held in escrow, but the Bush administration may challenge the ruling. American officials say the dispute is far from over. 
 Since the initial ban on Canadian cattle, the United States border has been reopened to some beef products, although hopes that it would be lifted completely faded last December when a Washington cow with mad cow disease was found to have been born in Canada.
 ''All I can say is there's light at the end of the tunnel,'' Paul Cellucci, the American ambassador to Canada, told reporters this week. 
 In the meantime, American and Canadian companies are building meat packing plants on the Canadian side of the border in case the ban on live cattle lingers.
 ''You're lucky we can't declare war on you,'' said Doug Hetherington, an owner of Roberge Transport Inc., Canada's largest livestock trucking fleet, which has lost half its business as a result of the ban. ''But hell, some of my best friends are Americans.''

HEADLINE: A Seashore Fight to Harness the Wind

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: FALMOUTH, Mass., Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Nantucket Sound lies between Cape Cod, Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard, some of the nation's best-known vacation spots. Now a private company is proposing to build the world's largest offshore wind power plant right in the middle of it. Depending on who is talking, the results would be either a hideous blot on the landscape or a significant step toward clean power and energy independence.
 The argument over the proposal intensified last week, when the Army Corps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statement finding few flaws in the plan. But instead of helping to settle the question, the report fed the debate over building there and where -- or whether -- other wind farms should be built in the nation's coastal waters.
 The 4,000-page draft gives new support to environmental groups that praise the project as a safe, nonpolluting and desperately needed alternative to fossil fuel power plants. But opponents challenge the report, the process that produced it and the idea of building the turbine array in the first place. 
 Regardless of its environmental impact, they say, it is just too ugly -- an industrial development that would wreck pristine vistas in a major tourism area. Many add that no offshore energy projects should be considered until the government establishes a better review process for proposals to use federal lands offshore.
 The project would be the nation's first offshore wind power plant, and it is being closely watched up and down the Eastern Seaboard. A similar proposal is under consideration off Jones Beach, on Long Island, and officials in New Jersey are looking into offshore wind power. 
 The Corps of Engineers' draft concluded that the project, proposed by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, would not unduly hinder ferry operations, commercial and sport fishing, boating, aviation or other activities at its site, a 24-square-mile area in the part of Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoals. It said the project's 130 support towers, turbines and blades, which together would rise about 420 feet above the water, would not seriously affect currents, waves, water quality, sand movement, fishing conditions or noise levels. 
 Adequate steps can be taken to protect marine mammals and shellfish, the report said. Birds will fly into the towers and die, the statement says, but probably at a rate of only about one a day, not enough ''to cause bird population declines.''
 And while opponents predict that the field of towers would drive away tourists, the corps said the project might actually attract sightseers.
 The report is preliminary, and the public will have at least until Jan. 10 to comment on its findings, said Karen Adams, who supervises the permit process for the Corps of Engineers. A final environmental review may be completed as soon as a year from now, she said. 
 Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must still raise capital for the project. But if all goes well, he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007. The power would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod and the islands, he said. But on a day with average wind, it would produce about 420 megawatts -- three-fourths of average electricity needs for the local area. 
 ''Many of the more hysterical fears that opponents had been speaking of in the past three years were not supported in this analysis,'' Mr. Rodgers said of the impact statement.
 But that is no surprise, according to the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization that opposes the wind farm. As is required, Cape Wind paid for the work that went into the report. ''As a predictable result,'' the alliance said, ''the document is strongly biased toward Cape Wind.''
 Ms. Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism. The corps requires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said, because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them. The corps independently chose the experts who produced each section of the report, she said, and Cape Wind willingly financed whatever the work the corps requested. 
 She added, however, that some in the corps did not expect to find themselves in the position of issuing federal permits for the project. ''We had to do a lot of learning real quick,'' she said. 
 But some officials -- including Gov. Mitt Romney, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Bill Delahunt, whose Congressional district includes the project site, say the project should not go forward yet. They say offshore projects of all kinds need a more systematic federal review process. 
 Advocates of the wind farm say establishing such a process would only mean unnecessary delay. And several environmental organizations have found themselves in the unaccustomed position of praising the Corps of Engineers, which many have criticized in the past as being too quick to approve development projects. 
 ''At first, obviously, it was pretty frightening because of their history,'' said Kert Davies, United States research director for Greenpeace, which favors the project. But he added, ''I think the effort was very solid, and they were under a lot of scrutiny.''
 Mr. Davies also dismissed as ''an elitist and local view'' assertions that the wind turbine array would spoil a pristine environment. Nantucket Sound is far from that, he said, filled as it is with ''mega boat traffic and jet skis and fishing boats and ferries -- it is not the Grand Canyon these guys are painting it to be.''
 Others say that regulatory issues aside, the aesthetics are perhaps the biggest issue standing in the project's way. ''It's a legitimate concern,'' said Bruce Bailey of AWS Truewind, a research firm in Albany that consulted on the Cape Wind project. 
 But, he said, ''it's based on expectations, not based on what people have actually seen.'' He said photo simulations of what the wind farm will look like from shore -- it will be 4.7 miles away at its closest point -- assume the clearest of weather conditions. Often, he said, the distant view from shore is obscured by haze. 
 Besides, advocates say, a diminished view is a small price to pay for clean power. ''If we are not willing to accept that tradeoff, I think it says something pretty profound about our priorities and our commitment to moving to cleaner sources of electricity,'' said Randy Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association, which represents developers, suppliers, consultants and others in the wind power industry.
 The corps's statement did not address in detail another criticism opponents have voiced: that the project is economically viable only because of tax credits or because the federal government is giving the company free use of the site, issues that some say should be considered in a broader federal review of development of offshore lands. 
 But advocates contend that all kinds of fossil fuel energy projects benefit from federal incentives. And Mr. Rodgers, the Cape Wind spokesman, said that ''non-extractive'' users of coastal lands -- companies that run telecommunications cables and the like -- are not required to pay for the privilege. Still, he said, should the federal government decide to require lease payments, the company would ''absolutely'' pay.
 Mr. Rodgers said the site offered several important advantages. It is in the middle of an area whose population -- and electricity demands -- are growing. And it is a short distance to Barnstable, where power generated by the windmills can feed into the national grid.
 Similar considerations are prompting interest in wind power off Long Island and in New Jersey, several experts said. ''It's difficult to site a large wind development in the Northeast,'' Mr. Swisher said. 
 Advocates of wind power cite Denmark as an example, saying it generates 20 percent or more of its energy from wind, and Mr. Davies of Greenpeace says the record there suggests that offshore wind farms can become tourism destinations. ''In Denmark, day sailors take off and sail to these things,'' he said.
 He and others at environmental groups said they hoped the Cape Wind proposal would win final approval and would become the first of many offshore wind projects. ''The United States,'' he said, ''is way behind in the clean energy race.''

BYLINE: By ANDREW ZIMBALIST. 
Andrew Zimbalist is a professor of economics at Smith College. He was a consultant for Forest City Ratner Corporation on the Atlantic Yards arena proposal in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
Loath as I am to question the authority of Joe Namath on the question of sports and economic development, there are some issues I wish he'd address in his radio commercials for the proposed Jets stadium on Manhattan's West Side. 
 First, documents received under the Freedom of Information Act suggest that the true cost to the public of building this football stadium may be at least 25 percent higher than the announced $600 million ($300 million each from the city and state). The added cost is embedded in several construction projects proposed for other elements of the comprehensive West Side redevelopment plan: without a stadium, it's inconceivable that these structures would exist.
 Not included in the $1.4 billion stadium budget, for instance, is $55 million for a platform over the West Side Highway that would connect the stadium to the waterfront. This platform is not budgeted as a stadium expense. Yet the Jets include the platform in their visual presentations of the stadium. (The Jets' plan calls for extensive use of boat service to deliver fans from New Jersey.) 
 Then there's the $66 million budgeted for a park, stairs, elevators and other structures adjacent to the stadium's north side. In the team's images of the stadium, this area is described as the ''game porch'' and is one of the stadium's major entrances. There is also a $30 million allotment for a pedestrian tunnel linking the stadium to the Javits Convention Center and the No. 7 train. 
 Together, these three structures effectively add at least $151 million to the stadium's price tag. And most or all of that amount is likely to be paid by the public. What's more, the project plan released and approved by the Empire State Development Corporation on Nov. 4 states that the Jets are responsible for just half of the cost of a pedestrian bridge to be built at 39th Street over the West Side Highway. 
 The proposed financing plan for the stadium contains other hidden public costs. Under the plan, the city and state would form a local development corporation. Among other things, this quasi-public entity would issue bonds to finance roughly $400 million of the Jets' $800 million contribution. The team would cover the debt service on those bonds. But it would do so under a financial arrangement known as a ''pilot,'' or payment in lieu of taxes. To the extent that this payback scheme is in place of the Jets' paying sales and property taxes, doesn't it make sense for the $400 million to be considered a public, rather than a private, contribution? 
 This creation of a local development corporation to finance the stadium has another troubling consequence. As long as the stadium project is not included in the city's capital budget, it can proceed without City Council approval. Not only does this violate democratic norms, it contravenes the 1998 council resolution authorizing the city to pursue the possibility of acting as host to the 2012 Olympic Games. That resolution stated that any financing related to the pursuit of the games must be approved by the council. Because the International Olympic Committee seeks to avoid controversy, this scheme may further reduce the city's chances of playing host.. In any case, should the city win the bid, the project plan states that the Jets do not have to pay the costs of converting the stadium into an Olympic arena and back again. These costs will be borne by a local Olympics committee and by the city and state.
 Finally, the Jets' claim that the stadium, with its retractable roof, would double as a significant convention center is unconvincing. In a radio interview on WNYC in October, L. Jay Cross, the Jets president, said that the venue would attract 30 conventions yearly. The city's Independent Budget Office, however, puts that number at about 15 -- with only 10 of these being events that otherwise would not have been held in the city. 
 All in all, the entire financial picture increasingly resembles a house of cards. Too many of the variables are uncertain, including the wherewithal of the Jets organization to meet its promised contribution and the ability of the state to pay its share. (A footnote in the Empire State Development Corporation's plan reveals that the city is to cover the state's $300 million obligation should the Legislature demur.)
 When Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, he opposed the idea of a referendum on public financing for a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West Side. His reasoning was that were it put to a referendum, New Yorkers would vote it down.
 Now Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is doing Mayor Giuliani one better. He plans not only to avoid a popular vote but also to bypass a budgetary vote of the people's elected representatives on the City Council.
 If the stadium's economic benefits are as obvious as Joe Namath asserts, the project's supporters should have no problem with standard democratic operating procedures and full disclosure.

HEADLINE: Open Season On Others' Ideas

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: sunbiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A BOOTLEGGER sells an illegal copy of a movie. A teenager trades music files over the Internet. An American patient imports prescription drugs. In each case, someone is benefiting from the intellectual efforts of others without paying full freight.
 I do it myself. A good chunk of my life savings is invested in a mutual fund that passively mimics the performance of the Wilshire 5000 stock index. Index funds tend to outperform their actively managed peers in part because indexing avoids the heavy costs associated with researching stocks and conducting transactions. Those costs are borne by other investors, whose decisions to buy, sell or hold stocks perform the crucial function of setting market prices. Index investors just ride along. 
 There have always been free riders in various walks of life. But the digital revolution and the rise of networked computers have brought us to the brink of a halcyon age for those who want something for nothing. Intellectual property is the new currency, and it appears that free riders have hit the jackpot. Their time is at hand, and we'd better deal with it.
 The ascendancy of this eager tribe was driven home recently when the movie industry announced plans to file lawsuits over swapping of films on the Internet. The music industry, meanwhile, continues to battle Internet music swapping even as peer-to-peer sharing continues unabated. Books are next. Already, volumes that originally cost $30 in stores can often be had on the Internet for less than the cost of shipment. When books (and periodicals) are more commonly read in electronic form, we can expect that the practical barriers to illegal distribution will crumble, just as they have for music.
 Free riding is human nature, and on the Internet, even the free riders sometimes have free riders. Four years ago, a study by Eytan Adar and Bernardo A. Huberman, now researchers at Hewlett-Packard Labs, found that on Gnutella, an Internet system used by many people to exchange recordings, just a small fraction of users contributed most of the files while everyone else simply downloaded. That is still the case on most such file-sharing systems, said Peter Druschel, a computer scientist at Rice University.
 Nor is the age of free riding limited to cultural products. The discovery by American patients and politicians that Canada is a cheaper place than the local pharmacy for buying medications was a sign that, inevitably, Americans would rather join the growing legions of global free riders than underwrite health care innovation for everyone else. Prescription medications are cheaper in Canada and Europe because Americans have been willing to foot the staggering cost of research by paying higher prices, making it sensible for drug makers to sell their wares elsewhere for something closer to the cost of merely manufacturing and transporting them. In other words, consumers in other countries have been free riding on drug research that Americans pay for.
 Somewhere along the line, of course, someone must pay for the investment required to produce intellectual property. This is true whether that property is a prescription medication or a movie, or even a business innovation that can be copied almost instantly halfway around the world, sometimes to be exported back to the country of origin. 
 While the free flow of intellectual property can be wonderful, there is something to be said for the profit enjoyed by creators of patented or copyright-protected ideas or products. The prospect of such profit draws talent and capital into a process whose fruits benefit everyone and make modern life possible. So before we bury these monopoly rents, we should carefully appraise them, if only so we can grope our way toward some functional digital-age replacement that will reward -- and thereby encourage -- creativity. 
 The growth of drug importation, index investing and Internet music-sharing suggests that free riding will be a central economic problem of the digital age, and it is unlikely to have a single solution. Palliative action by intellectual property owners -- the movie industry's planned lawsuits, for example -- underscores the need to come up with fresh market-based approaches. There is no alternative because in a world of free riders, everyone will be taken for a ride.

HEADLINE: New Life for a 1964 Film

BYLINE: By VICKI VASILOPOULOS

 BODY:
MICHAEL ROEMER has lived in Yonkers in a small house on a tree-lined street for 44 years. Since 1966, he has commuted a couple of times a week to New Haven, where he is an adjunct professor of film and American studies at Yale University. But Mr. Roemer, 76, is also a part of film history.
 In 1963, when he was 35, he directed ''Nothing but a Man,'' a feature film about a black man in Alabama whose marriage unravels as he finds it increasingly harder to earn a livelihood and maintain his dignity in the Jim Crow South. 
 The film, released in 1964, was a pioneer effort on several levels. Independently made, when many movies of the time were still the product of the studio system, it concerns the contemporary life of blacks, a subject that few studios were willing to tackle. At the same time, it was written, directed and produced by whites. 
 And although the story inevitably lends itself to political interpretation, the film is free of rhetoric, and is distinguished by a naturalistic visual style, almost like a documentary.
 ''Nothing but a Man'' won two prizes at the Venice Film Festival and was well received at the New York Film Festival. The Nation of Islam newspaper, Muhammad Speaks, endorsed it. But unlike ''Lilies of the Field,'' a studio film of the era that starred Sidney Poitier, it fared poorly at the box office. 
 Nearly 30 years later, in 1993, the film was rereleased theatrically to wide acclaim. The Washington Post called it ''one of the most sensitive films about black life ever made in this country.'' The movie was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1994. This fall, a 40th-anniversary DVD came out.
 To Mr. Roemer, who said he did not make a profit from the movie until its rerelease, the late success of ''Nothing but a Man'' is sweet.
 ''I'm slightly out of sync with my own time,'' he said in an interview in his cozy living room. 
 Mr. Roemer was born in Berlin in 1928. When he was 11, he was sent to England to escape the Nazi regime. In 1945, he came to the United States, where he attended Harvard. 
 After college, he began working for the independent producer Louis de Rochemont. He wrote the screenplay for ''Nothing but a Man'' with Robert Young, a classmate from Harvard who had made documentaries. Mr. Young was also the cinematographer on the movie. 
 While Mr. Young was interested in the civil rights struggle of the era, and had made a documentary for NBC on the sit-in movement, Mr. Roemer wanted to explore an intimate story of a marriage set against the backdrop of the economic effects of racism. Neither thought the film should be overtly political.
 ''We thought that the most powerful, useful political statement would be a human one,'' Mr. Roemer said. 
 He added that in writing the script, he drew on his experience of growing up as a Jew in Nazi Germany with its attendant economic deprivation.
 ''My family was fairly well to do and everything got taken away from them,'' he said. ''I think I understood what it's like to be robbed of the ability to support your family. It certainly happened to my grandfather and my father. If you're unemployed you don't feel like you're a man, at least my generation didn't. That's not black; that's all of us.''
 With the help of the N.A.A.C.P., the filmmakers traveled the South for three months researching their script. They narrowly escaped the race riots in Oxford, Miss., that erupted after a black student tried to register at the University of Mississippi, Mr. Roemer said.
 ''Bob and I were completely fearless, which was a bit stupid,'' he recalled. ''People were killed for doing nothing.''
 The film was shot around Atlantic City and Cape May, N.J., in the summer of 1963 on a budget of $230,000. Everyone on the crew was paid $100 a week. Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln played the couple. They and the rest of the cast took a day off to march on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. The filmmakers finished production when the church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., made headlines. 
 The soundtrack features music from Stevie Wonder, the Marvelettes and Martha and the Vandellas. The rights were procured for $5,000 from Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records. ''That was pure luck,'' Mr. Roemer said.
 He explained that Mr. Gordy's lawyer, George Schiffer, was his college classmate, and that his office was around the corner from where Mr. Roemer worked on the editing of ''Nothing but a Man.''
 ''I went down to have lunch with him,'' Mr. Roemer said, ''and he said: 'I just started representing a small record company in Detroit. Maybe you'd like to hear their music?' I went back to his office with him and he handed me a stack of these 45's.''
 Mr. Roemer recalled his reaction: ''I said, 'This stuff is great!''' 
 Mr. Roemer said that today ''for a white filmmaker to make a black film is sort of superfluous.'' ''Nothing but a Man'' was produced before directors like Spike Lee and John Singleton had materialized, and long before Hollywood took up black subjects. And at the time, Mr. Roemer said, independent producers were ''anomalies.''
 Soon after its original premiere, ''Nothing but a Man'' was released in 16 millimeter, and found a black audience when it was shown in churches and schools, Mr. Roemer said. 
 Mr. Roemer's second feature film was ''The Plot Against Harry,'' a comedy about a Jewish gangster, made in 1969. It failed to find a distributor because no one found it funny, he said. It sat on the shelf for 20 years until Mr. Roemer submitted it to the New York Film Festival in 1989. It was accepted there, and subsequently released theatrically, to rave reviews.
 ''It was kind of a redemption and a very odd experience because I had been so sure of my own failure, and so had everybody else,'' Mr. Roemer said. 
 ''The Plot Against Harry'' is to be issued on DVD in March.
 ''I don't think I've made a film that isn't as alive today as it was when we made it,'' he said. ''I feel good about that. Everything still looks like it happened yesterday rather than 40 years ago.''

HEADLINE: THE GUIDE

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:

After World War II
 Fairfield County artists, who recorded World War II on canvas, as posters, sketches and personal images sent home, are featured in an exhibition of the work many of them produced while on active duty. They were infantrymen, marines, combat artists and photographers, naval officers, members of the Army's 23rd Special Troops, Army Air Corps, and one of them fought with the Polish resistance against the Nazis in 1944.
 After the war they came back to Connecticut and pursued successful careers. Their names, and the names of some stateside wartime artists in the exhibition, are familiar: Steven Dohanos, Victor Dowd, Sydney Greenberg, Dough Leigh, Mary McKay Maynard, Howard Munce, Clark Robinson, Arthur Shilstone, Tracy Sugarman, Lubomir Tomaszewski and Ed Vebell. The exhibition, in the Carriage Barn of the New Canaan Society for the Arts at Waveny Park, Route 124 (South Avenue), will remain through Dec. 12.
 Viewing hours are Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m. Information: (203)972-1895. 

Santa, Sedaris Style
 ''The Santaland Diaries,'' David Sedaris's wicked sendup of unrelenting Christmas cheer is being played out on the stage of TheaterWorks in Hartford through Dec. 23. Andrew Benator portrays the unemployed actor who takes a job as one of Santa's elves at Macy's in this adaptation by Joe Mantello. 
 Performances are Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30; Friday and Saturday at 8; Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2:30. Tickets are $35, $45 and $55. Information: (860)527-7838. 

Works for Lute
 A recital of solo works for the lute will be performed by Hopkinson Smith, acknowledged grand master of the instrument, Sunday at 3 in the second floor gallery of the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, 15 Hillhouse Avenue. 
 Works by John Dowland and other 17th-century English composers will be featured. Tickets are $20. Information: (203)432-0825. 
 Free programs at Yale include works by a Dowland contemporary, Henry Purcell, particularly highlights from his ''King Arthur,'' to be performed Wednesday at 5:15 by the Yale Collegium Musicum and the Yale Collegium Players at the Beineke Library, 121 Wall Street.
 At 8 p.m. the Yale Jazz Ensemble will present the music of Duke Ellington, Thad Jones, County Basie, Charlie Mingus and Mongo Santamaria in Sprague Hall at College and Wall Streets.
 And a special guest, the French composer Tristan Murail, a founder of spectral music that emerged in France during the 70's, will be present for New Music New Haven's presentation of his major work ''Desintegrations,'' Thursday at 8 p.m. in Sprague Hall, along with works by Yale composers. 

Books by and About Jews
 A Jewish book festival under way in Woodbridge until Nov. 21 offers daily lectures by authors, at the Jewish Community Center, 360 Amity Road. 
 A film called ''Trembling Before God,'' scheduled for Sunday at 6 p.m. is a prelude to a discussion at 7:30 by Rabbi Steven Greenberg on his book ''Wrestling With God and Men: Homosexuality in the Jewish Tradition.'' Rabbi Greenberg, who is Orthodox, declared his homosexuality in 1999 after struggling with two identities for a decade. The film and his book take their theme from biblical verses that have been interpreted by some as condemning homosexuality to the extent of punishment by death. Admission is $5.
 ''Still Life With Bombers: Israel in the Age of Terrorism'' by David Horovitz, editor of The Jerusalem Post, will be the subject for discussion Monday, and Stephanie Wellen Levine's ''Mystics, Mavericks and Merrymakers: An Intimate Journey Among Hasidic Girls,'' is featured on Tuesday, both at 7:30, admission $5.

HEADLINE: Does Your Portfolio Need a Dividend Kick?

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
INVESTORS who shun stocks that dole out seemingly trivial dividends of 1 or 2 percent may want to take a second look. 
 For more than two decades, dividend payers, often pokey but stable enterprises, have generally done a better job than other companies when it comes to enriching their shareholders. This year is no different. Through Thursday, the dividend-paying stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a total return of 13.8 percent, according to S.&P., versus a gain of 3.8 percent for the nonpayers -- often flashier, high-tech companies that aim for huge growth. Indeed, since 1980, a period that embraces the longest bull market in history, dividend payers have outperformed nonpayers by almost three percentage points a year, on average, according to Howard Silverblatt, a market equity analyst at S.&P.
 Last year, when the government cut taxes on dividend income to a maximum of 15 percent from as high as 35 percent, Wall Street rushed to create new vehicles for dividend investors. ''After the dividend tax relief was passed, we had demand from our clients for dividend-centric strategies,'' said Richard Duff, co-head of the private client group at BlackRock, an investment firm that manages more than $300 billion. 
 Today, investors can buy individual dividend-paying stocks or choose mutual funds like Franklin Rising Dividends or Electric City Dividend Growth, both of which have produced solid returns this year. Or they can buy iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend Index, an exchange-traded fund based on 50 high-yielding stocks that have returned nearly 16 percent this year. Two new closed-end funds, BlackRock Dividend Achievers and BlackRock Strategic Dividend Achievers, are publicly traded like E.T.F.'s but offer actively managed portfolios. By the end of November, PowerShares Capital Management will introduce its own E.T.F. for dividend-paying stocks.
 Investment theme parties have a way of fizzling, however, and investing in dividend payers may be no different. A steep climb in interest rates, for example, would improve the returns on competing investments like certificates of deposit and money market funds, shrinking demand for dividend-paying stocks. If share prices of dividend payers rise faster than their dividends, meanwhile, yields would shrink and the stocks would become less attractive. And the dividend tax cut is scheduled to expire in 2009, though the Bush administration has indicated that it favors extending it.
 For now, at least, dividends are in demand, and investors seem to have moved from simply buying stocks that pay high yields to finding those with a steady history of dividend growth. Both BlackRock and PowerShares have licensed a method developed by Mergent Inc., a provider of financial information, that identifies and ranks companies that have raised dividends for at least 10 consecutive years. ''Once you have increased dividends for 10 years in a row, there is a high probability of future dividend increases,'' said Roby Muntoni, director of index operations at Mergent. 
 Other managers use variations on the dividend growth theme. Donald G. Taylor, of the Franklin Rising Dividends fund, looks for companies that have raised dividends in at least 8 of the last 10 years. But he also searches for stocks whose dividends have doubled over the last decade, and for companies whose yearly dividend payout represents less than 65 percent of earnings. 
 Beyond running those screens, Mr. Taylor looks for companies with low debt and with shares that are currently in the lower half of their historical ranges. Franklin Rising Dividends has outperformed the S.&P. 500 over the last five years by 13 percentage points, annualized. The fund was up 6.6 percent this year through Thursday, slightly behind the 7.1 percent return of the S.&P. 500. Like other money managers, Mr. Taylor views a history of rising dividends as a sign of financial strength -- and of future dividend increases.
 One of Mr. Taylor's holdings is Leggett & Platt, which makes components for reclining chairs and other furniture. The company is mildly cyclical, he said, but ''dividend growth continued even in the years earnings were down.'' The annual dividend of 60 cents a share represents about 40 percent of earnings -- a reasonable ratio that should allow for continued dividend increases, he said. 
 By contrast, Mr. Taylor has consistently declined to invest in Merck, a company that met his fund's performance criteria. He was put off by one telltale sign -- a slowing rate of dividend growth. 
 Merck's tumble demonstrates that dividend stocks are not without risk, but it also points out the problems of an alternative approach to dividend-centric investing: the Dogs of the Dow theory. Using this method, investors bet on the 10 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials with the highest yields -- the dividend rate divided by the share price. Often, the stocks' yields are high because their prices have been beaten down. From 1973 to 1996, on average, the Dogs of the Dow outperformed the Dow, but more recently they have been less consistent. This year, even as their fellow dividend payers have rallied, the Dogs have been sound asleep, losing an average of 4.4 percent. 
 A 2004 member of the Dogs, Merck began 2004 with a yield of 3.2 percent, the sixth-highest in the Dow. But like its kennel mates Altria, AT&T and General Motors, Merck had a high yield partly because concerns about fundamental problems had held down its share price. When Merck announced that it would stop selling Vioxx after studies found that the pain medication increased the risk of stroke and heart attack, the stock tumbled further, losing roughly a third of its value. So Merck was not an attractive purchase with a yield of 3.2 percent. Is it a good buy now, with a yield of 5.8 percent? 
 Neil Hennessy, the president of Hennessy Funds and the manager of two funds that invest in Dogs of the Dow stocks, says he thinks so. ''They canceled a drug with $2.5 billion in revenues, and the market cap of the stock has dropped by over $25 billion,'' Mr. Hennessy said.
 Not so sanguine is Richard Evans, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. He estimates that Merck faces potential liability of $12 billion from Vioxx lawsuits. Does he think Merck's dividend is in danger? ''I think it's very safe through mid-2006,'' Mr. Evans said; after that, patent expirations raise further concerns. He has a neutral rating on the stock.
 Merck's problems show the danger of buying stocks just for high yield. James Denney, manager of the Electric City Dividend Growth fund, said he would prefer a company with a 2 percent dividend whose payout was growing 15 percent a year to one with a 4 percent dividend that was unlikely to rise further. The first stock ''will go up in tandem with the increase in the dividend,'' he explained.
 Mr. Denney calls Wolverine World Wide the type of ''conservative and boring'' company that he favors. Although its business, shoemaking, is an ''out of favor'' industry, Mr. Denney said, he likes Wolverine's strong balance sheet and powerful brand name. The dividend rate, at less than 1 percent, is not impressive, but the dividend has been raised for 10 consecutive years and he expects further increases. He also says he thinks that the investment company T.Rowe Price, with a current yield of about 1.5 percent, ''will continue to increase their dividend significantly.'' 
 Can dividend stocks, which have outperformed nonpayers for nearly a quarter of a century, keep up the pace? Fans of these stocks see further gains as baby boomers nearing retirement seek ever-safer investments that produce income. ''I just don't see the next 5 or 10 years being favorable towards high-growth areas,'' Mr. Denney said. ''I see an environment friendly to dividend growth stocks.''

HEADLINE: Do New Drugs Always Have to Cost So Much?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
AMERICAN politicians are so perplexed about how to deal with prescription drug prices that the best solution they can offer is to effectively import a Canadian law -- by buying drugs subject to Canadian government price controls -- rather than pass one of their own. 
 There are, however, more straightforward ways to get cheaper drugs than by borrowing price fixes from across the border. Some economists say the government can reduce pharmaceutical prices by changing how the nation pays for innovation. 
 Prescription drugs are expensive by design. They cost a lot to invent but are relatively cheap to make, so companies receive patents from the government that grant them a monopoly and enable them to sell the medicine at a premium. In doing so, the idea goes, drug makers recoup their investments in research and development and are encouraged to invent more. 
 But some economists say that there is no inexorable economic reason for drug prices to be as high as they are. ''Patents are one way to get medical innovation, but they are not a fact of nature,'' said Michael R. Kremer, an economics professor at Harvard. ''It is worth looking for alternatives.''
 Strong patent protection has allowed substantial spending on innovation. American drug companies invested $33 billion in it last year, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobbying group. But this arrangement has a measurable economic cost, keeping drugs from consumers who would buy them if they were priced like other competitive commodities -- marginally above production costs. 
 That is not the only inefficiency that patents breed. In the insured health market, where neither patients nor their doctors actually pay for drugs, drug companies are subject to all manner of perverse incentives. For instance, they can reap more from investing in marginal improvements over existing therapies -- and buying ads to persuade patients to pay big markups for them -- than from investing in riskier, ground-breaking drugs. 
 The Food and Drug Administration has classified only about 20 percent of the drugs developed over the last 10 years as qualitative breakthroughs. Even though they spend more on research, pharmaceutical companies are finding fewer new drugs. In a report this year, the F.D.A. said that the way drugs are developed ''is becoming increasingly challenging, inefficient and costly.'' 
 One alternative is to have the government pay directly for research, which some economists say could maintain innovation while reducing drug prices. The government already spends almost $30 billion a year on basic drug research at National Institutes of Health laboratories and at universities, much of which results in new drugs. It would be relatively straightforward to extend this to cover the research now done in drug company labs, economists say.
 There are other alternatives. For example, the government could compensate drug companies for their inventions as an incentive for them to keep innovating. How to determine how much an innovation is worth? One possibility would be for the government to selectively buy patents at a premium over the price a private bidder was willing to offer, and then put them into the public domain, Professor Kremer said. Aidan Hollis, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Calgary in Alberta, devised a different approach: the government would set up a fund to compensate drug companies based on how much their new drugs improve the quality of life and how often they were used.
 These alternatives would carry several benefits, economists say. In addition to making drugs available at lower prices, they would make it much less profitable for pharmaceutical companies to spend millions of dollars to develop drugs, like Nexium and Clarinex, that are protected by patents but offer little improvement over similar drugs already on the market. 
 The goal is not to spend less to develop new drugs, Professor Hollis said, but to get more therapeutic bang for the buck -- by channeling investment to where it matters most -- as well as to increase access to the resulting drugs. ''This can be done within the same budget as we devote to pharmaceuticals now,'' he said.
 There is an incentive for the government to seek ways to control drug costs. Through programs like Medicare and agencies like the Veterans Administration, its spending on prescription drugs is growing more than 10 percent a year and will hit $46 billion in 2004, almost one-fourth of the nation's total spending on these drugs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The expansion of Medicare's drug coverage will add more than $50 billion a year to the bill, on average, over the next decade.
 Drug companies, of course, do not like any of this. They have mustered lobbyists to oppose such ideas and have referred to research that supports strong patent protections. 
 Patricia M. Danzon, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania whose work is often cited by drug makers, said that lack of access to prescription drugs was not a big problem in the United States. Most Americans have health insurance with drug coverage, she said; for those who don't, the solution is to provide them with coverage -- not to upend the patent system. ''I'm not sure what all this gains us,'' she said of the call for reform. 
 She added that ''small adjustments in the patent system would be a more appropriate way to address'' the investment in ''me too'' drugs. And changing the rules of the game might itself introduce inefficiency.
 Another critique, by Joseph A. DiMasi of Tufts University and Henry G. Grabowsky of Duke University, compared proposals for government rewards for research to the way the old Soviet Union gave prizes to its inventors. The Soviet ''record of innovation was not impressive,'' they said.
 There are potential problems to be considered in the alternatives. Political decisions could skew government-financed research, misallocating investment. Governments short on cash may be tempted to underpay for private-sector invention, reducing companies' incentives to innovate. 
 Auctions like the one proposed by Professor Kremer could be manipulated or undermined by corruption, while bids for patents might be low because most drugs would be sold as cheap generics. Pricing techniques like those proposed by Professor Hollis would require controversial decisions about issues like the monetary value of an extra month of life. 
 Professor Kremer, Professor Hollis and others say their proposals will probably need to be tweaked. They could be made voluntary, for instance, letting companies keep their drugs out of a new system but providing enough rewards to entice them in. 
 Other ideas should be explored and tested, too, they say, urging policy makers to remember the main point: the current system is not working well. ''The pharmaceutical market is probably the worst-functioning market that there is,'' Professor Hollis said. 
 SO what's the chance it will change? Last month, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination this year, introduced a bill in the House to essentially replace drug patents with direct government financing of research. But even Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who advised Mr. Kucinich on the idea, is skeptical of the bill's prospects. ''Today all of these proposals are going nowhere,'' he conceded.
 But the nation's bill for prescription drugs is forecast to reach $520 billion by 2013, more than twice its current level. At some point, something may crack. ''We're on a path that is clearly not sustainable,'' Mr. Baker said. Then, perhaps, the current system could change or die. 
 Until then, the United States can rely on Canada.

HEADLINE: City Still Hopes To Bring Life To Railyard And Barge Link

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
It was a plan that looked forward in part by looking back. 
 In August 2000, New York City announced that it had taken a long unused freightyard on the Brooklyn waterfront, cleared out the weeds, replaced rusted old equipment and prepared the 33 acres to be an active yard. City officials said that freight could once more be transferred from railroad cars onto trucks there, and that loaded rail cars could be floated from the yard to New Jersey on barges -- a method once widespread in New York Harbor but now rare.
 Four years later, the vast 65th Street Railyard in Bay Ridge is little used, with only a single company shipping freight there. The new equipment built to move rail cars on and off barges has never been used. 
 The disappointing results show how even a simple municipal project -- no tenants had to be evicted, no competing uses for the land defeated -- can still founder because of the difficulty of finding the right strategy and picking the right private partner.
 But the city says it has not given up on the yard, which it and the state spent a total of $20 million to rehabilitate. 
 ''We are evaluating our options for maximizing its use,'' said Joan McDonald, senior vice president for transportation at the city's Economic Development Corporation. 
 A spokeswoman for the agency, Janel Patterson, said the Bloomberg administration was negotiating with a freight railroad, the New York & Atlantic, for it to take over the site and ''optimize'' its use after the company that the city originally selected to operate it, the Canadian Pacific Railway, could not make a go of it.
 She said the problems at the yard should be seen in the context of the administration's overall effort to improve the Brooklyn waterfront, including recent agreements with cruise lines for building a new terminal there.
 The Bloomberg administration is the latest of several New York City administrations to be involved with the yard, which fell into disuse after a wave of railroad bankruptcies in the 1960's and 70's. The city bought it in 1982 when the Koch administration hoped to restore it as part of an effort to bolster the local freight handling business.
 But the city's financial problems and changes in the rail freight industry put off completion of the project until the Giuliani administration. In its August 2000 announcement that the yard was ready for business, the Giuliani administration invited railroads to submit proposals for operating it under a lease from the city.
 In the announcement, the Economic Development Corporation highlighted the site's capacity for floating freight cars as well as its proximity to manufacturing, commercial and warehousing businesses.
 ''For too long we have suffered from over-reliance on trucks to move our freight, with serious consequences to our economic vitality and quality of life,'' the agency said. ''By putting a rail car float system into operation on the Brooklyn waterfront, we could potentially divert approximately two million tons of freight a year from truck to rail and eliminate tons of air pollutants annually.''
 In early 2001 the agency selected a bidder, Canadian Pacific, to operate the yard, even though, as a spokesman for the railroad recently said, it had no desire to operate the float system. ''We did not want to run it,'' said the spokeswoman, Denyse Nepveu. ''And it was not in our lease that we would.'' She said Canadian Pacific had wanted the yard for transferring cargo from rail to trucks.
 Though the lease was signed in February 2002, several weeks after the Bloomberg administration took office, the terms had been largely negotiated by the Giuliani administration. Ms. McDonald's Giuliani-era predecessor at the Economic Development Corporation, Seth Kaye, said recently that to the best of his recollection, Canadian Pacific was selected because ''it had a superior proposal for generating activity and usage'' in the overall yard. 
 Ms. Nepveu said that Canadian Pacific's lease ''did not prevent'' the city, as the yard's owner, from bringing in another company to run a float operation. But Ms. Patterson of the Economic Development Corporation said that because the only float facility on the New Jersey side of the harbor was owned by another company, Canadian Pacific had ''to negotiate with them to land there.''
 That other company, New York Cross Harbor Railroad, runs the only rail car float business operating in New York Harbor. It floats about 2,200 loaded rail cars a year between Jersey City and its New York base, at a site it leases from the city on 51st Street on the Brooklyn waterfront. That number is a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 rail cars that were annually transported by barge into and out of New York City from World War II until the 1960's.
 Cross Harbor bid in 2000 to move the Brooklyn end of its float operation to the rehabilitated 65th Street yard because ''we can do four and five times as much business'' there than with the ''antiquated facilities'' at 51st Street, said Wayne A. Eastman, Cross Harbor's president. The bid was not accepted.
 By then Cross Harbor's relationship with the city had soured. In 2001, the city moved to evict the company from 51st Street, contending, among other things, that it had illegally buried hazardous material there. 
 Cross Harbor has disputed the accusations, and Mr. Eastman said in a recent interview that the issues with the city had arisen under ''past management'' and that the current one was working to resolve them. In July, a federal appeals court overturned a ruling by a federal regulatory agency, the Surface Transportation Board, that had granted the city's eviction application.
 Inactivity at the float facilities at 65th Street, however, was only part of the problem there. There was also Canadian Pacific's inability to attract long-term business of any kind to the yard, except for a single company, operating there now, which ships bricks.
 ''The whole idea when we entered the agreement with Canadian Pacific,'' said Ms. McDonald of the Economic Development Corporation, ''was to have a Class I railroad do a significant amount of marketing to use the yard to its capacity.'' It was thought, others involved with the yard said, that with its operations and contacts throughout the United States and Canada, Canadian Pacific could identify and attract potential users of the yard more readily than a line with narrower operations.
 Mr. Nepveu of Canadian Pacific said, ''We certainly marketed the yard, but it did not bring back the kind of activity we were expecting and was not an asset, as we thought it would be.'' The railroad and the city agreed to end Canadian Pacific's involvement there in August, six months before its lease was to end.
 Now the Economic Development Corporation is thinking differently about a suitable operator for the yard. New York & Atlantic, with which it is negotiating to replace Canadian Pacific, runs the freight service on the Long Island Rail Road track system and was a subcontractor to Canadian Pacific at 65th Street, handling switching and other activities there.
 ''Growing a business in New York City requires local knowledge and understanding of local business needs,'' Ms. Patterson said. ''A smaller railroad with this kind of expertise should be able to fully market the yard for rail services.''

THE DRUG COMPANIES
How They Deceive Us
and What to Do About It.

POWERFUL MEDICINES

 DURING the past year, when I was driving my children to school, I'd hear the same advertisement on the radio again and again. You've probably heard it too: as somber music played in the background, a young man, his voice cracking, explains how he developed a rare and deadly form of cancer. He wonders if he will ever play baseball with his son, and then relates how, thanks to a company called Novartis and its new cancer treatment (never mentioned, but a drug called Gleevec), he's been given a new lease on life. 
 What is most fascinating about this ad is that it should seem necessary. As Marcia Angell points out in ''The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It'': ''Truly good drugs don't have to be promoted. A genuinely important new drug, such as Gleevec, sells itself.'' So why advertise a cancer drug that cures a fatal leukemia and has no competition? The answer, of course, is that Novartis is not advertising Gleevec, but the company itself -- and the virtues of the drug industry as a whole. Why? Because, as Angell notes, a ''perfect storm'' of indignation -- on the part of consumers, regulators+and even doctors -- may be developing around the pharmaceutical business.
 In just one week this summer, the news included reports that Schering-Plough pleaded guilty to cheating Medicaid; the city of New York sued leading pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and Merck, for inflating costs and defrauding taxpayers; Janssen Pharmaceutica Products admitted it had withheld from the public information about potentially fatal side effects in a schizophrenia drug it markets; and Wyeth settled yet another in the multibillion dollars' worth of lawsuits against it by people who suffered permanent injury from use of the fen-phen weight-loss drugs. All this against a broad public perception of price-gouging, lack of innovation and bombastic self-congratulation. And that brings me back to the Novartis ad.
 An alternative history for Gleevec is recounted in both Angell's methodical multicount indictment of the drug industry and Jerry Avorn's entertaining jeremiad, ''Powerful Medicines: The Benefits, Risks and Costs of Prescription Drugs.'' In this less heroic version, several decades of dogged research by academic scientists -- much of it paid for by American taxpayers through the National Institutes of Health -- had teased out the molecular details of chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare and fatal hematological cancer. Researchers at Novartis (then Ciba-Geigy) created several compounds that in theory might throw a monkey wrench into the process by which blood cells become cancerous. But these potential miracle drugs sat on the shelf untested, until Brian Druker, a researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University, asked for the compounds and became the first to discern their anticancer properties in the lab dish. Even that wasn't enough. As Avorn tells it, ''Novartis had so little interest in committing resources to the drug's development that cancer researchers had to resort to the bizarre tactic of sending a petition to the company's C.E.O., signed by scientists in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America, imploring him to make more drug available for clinical studies.''
 Novartis has overcome its lack of enthusiasm -- it now charges $27,000 for a year's supply of Gleevec. But those heart-warming ads, now the centerpiece of the Novartis corporate identity, say more than intended about how today's pharmaceutical industry takes credit where little is due. As both Angell and Avorn lay out in painstaking, often enraging, detail, a self-serving mythology -- promulgated on a scale possible only in a business with annual worldwide revenues of $400 billion -- has enveloped the pharmaceutical industry. Angell and Avorn cut through the haze, arguing persuasively that Americans are paying an enormous amount of money for some very mediocre medicines.
 The rising voices of disillusionment have the credentials to back up their scorn. Two of the season's most stinging anti-drug-industry analyses come from former editors in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine. Marcia Angell is one. Jerome P. Kassirer is the other; the title of his book, ''On the Take: How America's Complicity With Big Business Can Endanger Your Health'' (Oxford University, $26), says it all. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School, helps decide what drugs are used in Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. And John Abramson was a doctor in family practice until, as he recounts in ''Overdosed America: The Broken Promise of American Medicine'' (HarperCollins, $24.95), he began to detect what might politely be called statistical legerdemain in articles promoting new drugs in the aforementioned New England Journal. 
 These books are not simply diatribes against high prices and lagging development of new medicines. More disturbingly, the authors contend that the drug industry has polluted the scientific basis of modern medicine with rigged market-driven clinical studies that inflate the effectiveness of new, high-priced drugs while concealing their risks to patient safety. Angell's occasionally strident language, laced with terms like ''bribes and kickbacks'' and ''faux research'' seems hyperbolic -- until you consider that one week's worth of headlines.
 The reasons for the transformation of the industry's image from life-saving pioneer to robber baron are many. But at root is a profound shift in the hierarchy of influence and decision making within the companies themselves over the last two decades, as the traditional emphasis on research and development has given way to marketing. The change is everywhere apparent: in the background of many company executives, in the annual balance sheets (in 2001, Angell estimates industrywide marketing budgets at $54 billion, almost double research-and-development outlays, which the industry lobby puts at $30 billion), in the army of 88,000 salesmen (or detailers), trained to bird-dog doctors and persuade them to prescribe their company's drugs. Though much drug industry research remains outstanding, the system rewards what Avorn calls ''trivial pseudo-innovation''; shifting the emphasis from research to marketing was, he says, ''just responding rationally to the legal, regulatory and economic pressures of a marketplace that had become perverse.''
 Angell, who gives a vivid historical context, dates the ''watershed year'' to 1980, on the cusp of a era in which it became ''not only reputable to be wealthy, but something close to virtuous.'' The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 basically turned academic labs into farm teams for industry research, allowing publicly funded researchers in academic institutions (where much of the real enterprise and innovation occur) to patent their discoveries and license them to the private sector; the law has created a thicket of licensing and royalty relationships, wink-and-nod consultancies and conflicts of interest. As Angell tellingly relates, the authors of one New England Journal article collectively owned up to so many financial conflicts that they had to be listed separately on a Web site. The headline on the editorial she wrote about the episode was ''Is Academic Medicine for Sale?'' One cynical reader replied: ''No. The current owner is very happy with it.''
 Then there was was the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, which did what it was ostensibly designed to do, make it easier for generic drug makers to put cheaper medicines on the market -- but at enormous cost to the consumer. In Angell's view, Hatch-Waxman was a Trojan horse bill; its loopholes meant that pharmaceutical companies could, with patent infringement suits costing, say, a mere $5 million, extend government-granted monopolies on popular drugs like Prilosec and Claritin, in some cases for more than four years, yielding them billions of dollars in additional revenue. 
 It gets worse. Laws passed in the 1990's gave drug companies extraordinary financial influence over their primary regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, through so-called user's fees to expedite reviews of new drugs. And both Angell and Avorn quote Senator Bill Frist's devastatingly candid remark revealing that one respected candidate for the agency's top job in 2002 apparently lost industry support because ''there was a great deal of concern that he put too much emphasis on safety.'' 
 As for the recent Medicare reform bill, with its prescription drug benefit, Angell considers the measure a huge windfall for industry, because it explicitly forbids Medicare to bargain on prices. Indeed, Angell foresees a grim day of reckoning, and calls for its immediate repeal.
 Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's lobbying group, has tirelessly argued that high drug prices are needed to support the high-risk endeavor of drug discovery and development. Yes, the business is risky. But Angell gives us good reason to dispute the much-quoted figure of $802 million as the average cost for developing a new drug, and the assertions of innovative research and development. She cites studies showing that between 1998 and 2002, 415 new drugs received F.D.A. approval; only 133 were ''new molecular entities,'' or genuinely novel compounds, and of those, only 58 -- or 14 percent of all new drugs for the five-year period -- were considered likely by the F.D.A. to be ''a significant improvement'' over existing products.
 Avorn covers much the same ground, but comes at it by statistical analysis of drug effectiveness and safety. As a ''pharmacoepidemiologist,'' he studies large patient databases to determine how often certain medications are used and how well they work. His watchword is ''evidence-based medicine'' -- the use of randomized controlled clinical trials, in which participants are randomly assigned to receive, for example, a drug being tested or a dummy pill, or of large-scale epidemiological studies to determine with statistical rigor exactly which drugs are safest, most effective and, increasingly, most cost-effective. He laments that ''we have begun to allow the marketplace to usurp the place of evidence in determining which treatments are effective.'' The marketplace has also been very good about playing down side effects: Avorn's accounts of the systematic ''obfuscation of risk'' for two drugs ultimately withdrawn from the market, the diet drug Redux and the diabetes drug Rezulin, are stomach-turning in their detailing of corporate indifference. 
 What to do? Angell's most urgent recommendation (among many) is to establish an independent mechanism within the National Institutes of Health, for testing prescription drugs against each other without involving the industry. Avorn, in arguing for more evidence-based medicine, lays out several nonprofit and for-profit scenarios for precisely that kind of independent, data-driven drug assessment. (My own view is that there will be a McDonald's on Mars before drug companies relinquish head-to-head clinical testing of their products -- precisely because high-quality data is a poison pill to most of their marketing.)
 In 1906, Upton Sinclair documented abuses in the meat-packing industry; his book, ''The Jungle,'' catalyzed outrage and helped lead to the Food and Drug Act of 1906, which set the first national food and drug regulatory processes. I doubt either of these books will have a similar impact. Public policy these days is mostly driven by events, not books. My guess is that it will take the pharmaceutical equivalent of a plane crash -- perhaps a devastating new influenza epidemic, a disease for which, as this flu season's experience makes painfully clear, fewer and fewer companies bother to make vaccines; or a hugely successful life-saving cancer drug whose high cost would make the economic wall between the haves (who get to live) and the have-nots (who don't) politically unsustainable. That unpleasant day of reckoning is almost upon us. These fine books go a long way in explaining how our medicine, once so vaunted, has become so bitter. hThe authors of one scientific article had so many conflicts, they needed a Web site to list them.

HEADLINE: What Is an American Movie Now?

BYLINE: By Lynn Hirschberg. 
Lynn Hirschberg is editor at large for the magazine.

 BODY:
Is the Face of America That of a Green Ogre?This year's Cannes International Film Festival epitomized the extraordinary global reach of American films -- sometimes to the point of absurdity. There were thrilling movies at Cannes -- movies that told original, compelling stories about life in Senegal and upper-middle-class Paris and the jungles of Thailand. But those movies (and many others) contrasted sharply with the American films spotlighted at the festival, whose chief purpose, it seemed, was to please the widest possible audience. 
 Along with weapons, movies are among our most lucrative exports to a waiting world, and in the last seven years or so, it has become clear that the expected audience for nearly all American-made studio movies, the audience they are designed and created for, has shifted from the 50 states to the global marketplace. This change in perspective has, naturally, resulted in a change in content: nuances of language or the subtleties of comedy do not translate easily between cultures, but action or fantasy or animation is immediately comprehensible, even if you live in, say, Japan, which is the country that most big studios long to reach. Films like this year's ''Troy'' (which was shown at Cannes), ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and ''Van Helsing,'' which are not dependent on dialogue, did not play as well as expected in America but became huge hits in many other countries, making several times what they made in the U.S. box office. Thankfully, the so-called specialty divisions of the big studios still try to depict the prevailing mood of the country. But consider a specialty film like ''Sideways,'' which is the best American movie I have seen this year: it has no international stars and no action, and because the film shifts in tone from comedy to drama in nearly every scene, it is not likely to be easily comprehended by a worldwide audience. As far as the big studios go, ''Sideways'' is essentially a foreign film made in America.
 But ''Shrek 2'' is not. An American entry in this year's Cannes competition, ''Shrek 2'' continues the animated saga of the lovable, irascible green creature (whose voice is that of the international star Mike Myers doing a Scottish brogue); his bride, the princess; and his faithful donkey (voice by the very funny Eddie Murphy). ''Shrek 2'' has the added bonus of Antonio Banderas, who gives the growing Latin market a chance to cheer for his Puss in Boots. As charming as ''Shrek 2'' is, I found it an unsettling example of how big studios represent the United States to the world. While other countries have interpreted globalism as a chance to reveal their national psyches and circumstances through film, America is more interested in attracting the biggest possible international audience. At Cannes, war-torn Croatia was shown through the eye of the director Emir Kusturica, the French elite was exposed in ''Look at Me,'' the fear of female genital mutilation was depicted in Senegal's ''Moolaade.'' And so on. America had a green fantasy creature and Michael Moore, who went on to win the festival's top prize with his documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11.''
 Wandering through Cannes and fighting my way into screenings, I felt a growing frustration that what I loved about American movies (and, by extension, about America) was in short supply, and when I mentioned this to Walter F. Parkes, head of motion pictures at DreamWorks SKG, he said: ''I know what you're talking about.'' Parkes, like most of the big studio heads, is in a bind: corporate finances dictate that they cast the widest net possible. That has become the mandate of the studio president. DreamWorks, for instance, made ''Shrek 2'' and is trying to parlay the $436 million success of the film (it is currently the third-highest-grossing movie of all time) into a profitable I.P.O. for its animation division. ''Films are the one product that we have that's the first choice around the world,'' Parkes continued. ''So, then, the questions to ask are: Is this the one place that people's fears about globalization are coming to fruition? Is America dominating world culture through the movies it produces? And if so, does that come with certain responsibilities beyond economic ones? These are questions that we have to ask ourselves. And they are different questions than we asked even five years ago.''
 The day before ''Shrek 2'' was set to have its premiere at Cannes, DreamWorks's representatives placed large plastic bags full of green Shrek ears along the Croisette, the bustling beachfront walkway that dominates the action in Cannes. Even before the festival began, it was feared that protesting French workers would shut it down over a labor dispute. On this day, a group of hundreds gathered outside the Carlton Hotel to denounce the war in Iraq. They were chanting in French for about 45 minutes, until the police broke up the demonstration. Then, as the protesters dissipated into the throng on the Croisette, I watched them, one by one, put on the free Shrek ears. They were attracted, it seemed, by the ears' goofiness and sheer recognizability. Immediately, the crowd, once filled with political fervor, was transformed into a sea of cartoon characters.
 I felt embarrassed: America seemed, at best, an absurd, vaguely comic place. 
 When you look at the big international hits of the year, it is easy to understand why the world views America with a certain disgust. Shrek may be a lovable (and Scottish) ogre, but nearly every other global hero in American movies is bellicose, intellectually limited, stuck in ancient times or locked in a sci-fi fantasy. American films used to be an advertisement for life in the states -- there was sophistication, depth, the allure of a cool, complex manner. Now most big studio films aren't interested in America, preferring to depict an invented, imagined world, or one filled with easily recognizable plot devices. ''Our movies no longer reflect our culture,'' said a top studio executive who did not wish to be identified. ''They have become gross, distorted exaggerations. And I think America is growing into those exaggerated images. 
 My fear is that it's the tail wagging the dog -- we write the part, and then we play the part.''

II. Sorry, We Don't Film Here Anymore
Several months after I returned from Cannes, I phoned nearly every big studio chief and queried them about the wages of globalization. Not surprisingly, they all maintained that they chose movies on the basis of whether a script or story grabbed them, and not according to the dictates of a global audience. And yet they also acknowledged that they typically build their slate around the so-called event films, like another ''Harry Potter'' or ''Star Wars'' or ''Matrix'' installment. Event films are big and expensive and conceived for the largest audience imaginable. To keep costs down, most of them are shot in other countries. ''It used to be Canada,'' said Jeff Robinov, president of production at Warner Brothers Pictures, the industry leader in the global film business. ''But the Canadian tax-incentive laws were redefined. London has instituted rebates that have lured production there.''
 Between mid-October and the end of the year, Robinov will travel to Australia and Rome and twice visit London, Paris and Canada. He's checking on all of his films. He's accustomed to this: the ''Matrix'' movies were shot completely in Australia (except for a freeway scene shot outside San Francisco). Shooting overseas saves money and adds to the universal appeal of the films -- the films are set in a movie world with no distinct sense of place; they could happen anywhere.
 Sherry Lansing, Paramount's chairwoman, who just announced her plans to step down, noted that the world marketplace has only recently become an important factor. ''I think CNN brought the world together,'' she told me. ''When I worked as a producer and we made 'Fatal Attraction' in the mid-80's, we never even thought of the global audience. Back then, we thought, If it does well in America, it will do well over there.''
 But the international success of ''Titanic'' in 1997 helped to change everything. ''When 'Titanic' opened at only $28 million in the U.S.,'' recalled Nina Jacobson, president of the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group at Disney, ''everyone called 20th Century Fox and offered their condolences. But 'Titanic' turned out to be the ultimate international movie. It played very well in America, but in Japan they loved it, loved it, loved it. It eventually made $900 million in rentals worldwide. That movie is so big internationally that no one can touch it, but everyone tries.''
 ''Titanic'' was a rarity: a special-effects marvel that helped create two stars (Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet) and won a hoard of Oscars. (The success of ''Titanic'' is daunting even for its creator -- James Cameron has not made a film since.) In 2003, another global milestone was established by the second ''Matrix'' film: at the suggestion of its producer, Joel Silver, the movie was released simultaneously all over the world. ''Day and date'' releases are increasingly necessary to capitalize on audience interest and, more important, to limit piracy. ''If you don't release your movie at roughly the same time all over the world, the video of your movie will be sold on the streets of Singapore within days of its first release,'' Jacobson explained. ''I don't want to be the one to say this, but the song is correct: it's a small world, after all. The audience has merged.''
 Like other studio heads, she said this matter-of-factly, a statement of fact. But clearly her decision-making has been affected by her observations. Of course, it's not all blockbusters at the big studios these days. Warner Brothers, for example, is currently making ''Syriana'' with George Clooney. Described by many as one of the best scripts in Hollywood, it is a dark tale about the global oil business that intertwines Middle Eastern politics and a story line involving the C.I.A. Meanwhile, Sony, more than most studios, is diversified, green-lighting ''Spider-Man'' and ''Closer,'' a $30 million drama, directed by Mike Nichols, about two couples who are undone by an affair. Perhaps wisely, the studio is hedging its bet by stocking ''Closer'' with the international stars Julia Roberts and Jude Law. ''It's always a decision,'' Jacobson told me. ''You might make a choice, for instance, to put John Travolta in 'Ladder 49,' as we did, to heighten the national and international profile of a film. And you have to realize that if you put a sports movie into production, it will do disastrously internationally. It won't travel no matter how good it is, so you adjust the budget accordingly. The world just doesn't care about other people's sports.''

III. Who Is the Bad Guy Now?
Part of the reason I find the globalization of American movies unsettling is that I can't remember a time when the dialogue at cocktail parties or between friends or in office meetings has been so lively and political. The shift in the national conversation is missing in our global film identity. For the most part, present-day politics may be too complicated a subject for Hollywood to handle -- at least in ambitious feature films.
 ''You have to make different decisions now,'' said Lansing, whose company, Paramount, made ''Team America,'' the puppet comedy in which Kim Jong Il is the archenemy. ''It's hard, for instance, to pick a villain with a global audience in mind. If we're in a global market, it's going to be a challenge to find credible villains.'' The movie ''Pearl Harbor'' played well in Japan, but generally the studio heads agreed: countries (with the possible exception of North Korea, which is not a big movie market) can no longer be demonized. 
 Strangely, politics, especially anti-American politics, just might have global appeal. Insiders predict that ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' with its vague Halliburton-esque conspiracy plot line, will play better to an anti-American international audience than it did here. Warner Brothers has high hopes for the ambiguous villain in ''Syriana.'' ''The enemy is a combination of global business and politics,'' Jeff Robinov said. ''We think that will play well to international markets.''
 For the most part, however, studios are more comfortable with plots and characters from a parallel universe that does not mirror ours or, really, anyone's. If you want to find anything like the voice of America, you have to see a documentary or a smaller film from one of the specialty divisions of a studio. Jacobson told me: ''The chitchat that precedes every pitch meeting has changed. But the pitches haven't. In the movie business, it's hard to be in the moment or of the moment -- the economics are too great. That's why there are smaller divisions. They have a different audience.''

IV. Why Small American Movies Don't Travel
Unfortunately, the much-admired mini-majors are not always content with a small domestic audience. While I have an enormous weakness for Harvey Weinstein's passion for films, the truth is that he has radically departed from the original idea behind his company, Miramax. Initially, Miramax embraced challenging movies like ''My Left Foot,'' ''The Crying Game''
 and ''Pulp Fiction.'' Weinstein was brilliant at marketing these films, and he developed a brand: a Miramax movie was aimed at certain members of the audience (me, for instance) who wanted an alternative to what the major studios were producing. 
 After ''Pulp Fiction,'' which was rejected by major studios, Weinstein himself started thinking big. Suddenly, small films about fascinating characters were not as appealing as large-scale epics like ''Cold Mountain'' or ''The Aviator,'' directed by Martin Scorsese and coming soon from Miramax. ''Selling a small movie takes an amazing amount of work,'' explained one longtime Hollywood observer. ''And then you make 8 or 10 million dollars. Harvey saw what the big studios had always seen: if you go big, your presence is larger and your profit is larger. A mediocre film released in thousands of theaters will usually be more successful than a small movie, without stars, that requires clever marketing. Harvey got tired of working that hard. It's easier to put in a big star.''
 At the moment, the old Miramax model has been adopted by Fox Searchlight, headed by Peter Rice. Searchlight largely concentrates on reaching a small North American audience, and this mandate allowed a director like Alexander Payne to cast four relative unknowns in ''Sideways.'' Because of its casting, Universal rejected the movie. Actually, George Clooney had sought a part in the film, but Payne said that because of his superstar status he was wrong for the role. ''To ask the audience to believe one of the world's most handsome and successful movie stars is now playing one of the world's biggest loser actors is too much,'' Payne has said. (Clooney agreed: ''Alexander was right. I am too famous for what he had in mind. But isn't that part of the problem? As an actor, you don't want to be locked in to big action films. Alexander found the two best actors for the job, but we're all attracted to interesting stories, even so-called stars.'') 
 Other studios are paying attention to Fox Searchlight. Tom Freston, co-president of Viacom, has plans to reinvigorate his own specialty division, Paramount Classics. Still, the specialty division is not a panacea. Payne's stubborn (and correct) belief in his casting choices is unusual enough to be noted in virtually every mention of ''Sideways.'' In America, most directors have begun to think strategically, like businessmen, and their films have suffered. The studios long for stars, global stars, and the filmmakers, who want to get their movies made, comply. 

V. Why Small American Movies Don't Play Well at Home Either
In 1980, Pauline Kael wrote an essay in The New Yorker titled ''Why Are Movies So Bad? Or, the Numbers.'' After taking a sabbatical from film criticism and working in Hollywood for about a year, she came to believe that television was ruining the movies. She said that TV watching reduced the attention span of viewers and that the need to sell films to reach these TV-saturated viewers had led to truncated plot lines and worse. Kael longed for the days of the moguls, who, she said, had courage and a respect for quality. She was also a believer in the filmmakers of the 70's. Among her favorites were Hal Ashby, Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Bernardo Bertolucci and Warren Beatty, who lured her out to Hollywood to work in the business. ''In the 70's, audiences were willing to be surprised,'' Beatty told me recently. ''Now people want to know what they're going to get. The studios want to make whatever successful movie is in their rear-view mirror. Now there are two ways of trying to make money on a movie.
 You either need to have a brand or you need a sound bite on TV to get audiences into the theater. If those are the rules, then the movies have to conform. And the hallmark of the 70's, the hallmark of any artistic endeavor, was nonconformity.''
 Oddly, television itself -- or cable television, anyway -- may have become a refuge of nonconformity. HBO's film division, which is run by Colin Callender, has the luxury of a built-in sophisticated audience. Last year at Cannes, it won the Palme d'Or for ''Elephant,'' Gus Van Sant's personal meditation on the Columbine massacre. And this year, it presented ''The Holy Girl,'' a moody story about a teenage girl's emerging sexuality. ''In the U.K., where I am from, they believe that you can travel easily between TV and films,'' Callender explained over lunch in Cannes. ''And when you're thinking of HBO, the old paradigms do not apply. We feel we have to offer our subscribers something they can't find anywhere else, not even in movie theaters.'' HBO Films flexibly adapts its projects to both the big and the small screens. The award-winning film ''Maria Full of Grace'' plays in the multiplex, and the award-winning ''Angels in America'' spilled over two nights on TV and is sold on DVD. ''Our audience is, first and foremost, the domestic audience,'' Callender continued. ''That helps dictate the focus of the work.''

VI. The End of American Movie Influence (or Where Are the Men?)
Today's global audience, it seems, has little interest in the next generation of American leading men. As a rule, international stars, a field dominated by men (only Julia Roberts is truly an international female star), are not American if they are newly emerging. Sure, Tobey Maguire was a great Spider-Man, but he doesn't have a global reach without the red hood. Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt may still draw crowds, but the world's newest stars come from other English-language-speaking countries, like Ireland (Colin Farrell), England (Jude Law, Clive Owen), Scotland (Ewan McGregor) or Australia (Russell Crowe). ''What is that?'' said Amy Pascal, chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, who just cast Heath Ledger (Australia) as a Los Angeles skateboarder in ''Lords of Dogtown.'' ''I guess all the American men became comedians. They all wanted to be funny. The next generation of stars seem to be a more international bunch, which is great: your access, as a studio, is not limited to the boy or girl next door.''
 Actually, American movies used to concern themselves with the boy or girl next door. I liked that -- those characters had real complications and possibilities, and still do. But the arrival of globalization is not complicating the American stories being told; it is simplifying them. And that has consequences. If you think about your life, you may find that films have been extraordinarily influential. The way you dress, act, talk or walk often follows what you saw in the movies. And now, instead of being known for our sense of conversation or style, we are known for our blood and gore. ''I noticed a few years ago,'' Walter Parkes said, ''that gangstas in urban movies all carried their guns sideways, and wondered if this created a style for the real world as opposed to being a reflection of the real world.''
 But what else? I am back to ''Shrek.'' In that movie, the dialogue is intentionally spoofish. The movie is a long riff on pop culture. It is funny, but it does not inspire, or stir up any large emotions. In the end, it has no resonance, nor does it aspire to any. 
 In the past, cultures would influence one another through film. The sensibility of the French New Wave and the Hong Kong action picture affected countless young Americans. But that sort of broad foreign influence seems to be waning. As I write, the biggest hit in America is ''The Grudge,'' which is a remake of a Tokyo horror film directed by Takashi Shimizu. He has already directed the original and three sequels in Japanese. Although it received poor reviews, ''The Grudge'' made nearly $40 million on its first weekend and will probably become a global sensation. In the late 60's and 70's, horror films had the scope of ''Rosemary's Baby,'' which raised the genre to a meditation on urban anxiety and rampant ambition. It is doubtful that anyone harbors similar hopes for ''The Grudge.'' If this is the new global cinema, it could give the term ''horror film'' new meaning.

HEADLINE: Even for Thrift Stores, Harder Times

BYLINE: By Louise Kramer. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN its new home in a former Fauchon pastry shop on the Upper East Side, the Arthritis Thrift Shop is posting the best sales in its 50-year history, and no one could be more relieved than its director, Joe Moore.
 The store brought in $91,500 in October selling cast-off furs, Chanel-style suits and enough gently used designer shoes to outfit the cast of ''Sex and the City'' for weeks. The shop, at 1383 Third Avenue, could approach $1 million in revenue in 2005 if business keeps up. The money benefits the New York chapter of the Arthritis Foundation. 
 Mr. Moore is relieved because the thrift shop is proving to be a rare success in a shrinking segment of New York retailing. He has devoted 20 years to thrift shops and has never seen conditions so tough.
 Thrift shops used to be low-rent enterprises run by volunteers. Now they are operated as serious businesses, and their employees must be paid as if they were working at Bloomingdale's. Soaring real estate prices and a diminishing supply of high-end donations are forcing many to shut down. A decade ago, New York City had 88 thrift shops. Today, that number has dwindled to fewer than 60.
 ''We have to pay the same rents as Duane Reade, and we don't get any break from Con Ed or Verizon or anybody,'' Mr. Moore said. ''A lot of people just think you're playing store, but these shops have to be effectively run to survive.''
 The Irvington Institute thrift shop on the Upper East Side, once a must for bargain cognoscenti, closed in 2001. The institute owned its space and realized that it could make more money by renting it to a commercial business, said Kerry Walsh, executive director of the medical research organization. The space is now leased to a children's store.
 In August, the Salvation Army shut down its shop in SoHo because of a steep rent increase. Good Old Lower East Side, a housing advocacy group, closed its store on Avenue B because it was not making enough profit to justify the costs, said Mr. Moore, who sits on the organization's board.
 Several thrift shop directors said the quality of merchandise they receive has gone down. ''Slower economic times have made people want to hold onto their items,'' said Shana Maron-Ames, director of stores for Housing Works, an AIDS advocacy organization. Consignment shops, eBay and auction houses are adding new competition, Mr. Moore said.
 It takes an unusual combination of skills to run a thrift shop effectively. A manager needs to set out merchandise to alluring effect, train a sales staff, keep the books and keep the peace among shoppers who might start fighting over $50 Prada pumps.
 Diplomatic skills come in handy, too, which Mr. Moore seems to possess. As he was leaving his store for lunch one recent afternoon, a shopper who looked to be in her 70's stopped him to solicit his opinion about a tiny sweater she held up to herself. ''Darling, it's too small,'' he said in a gentle manner. ''If it doesn't fit, it's not a bargain.'' She put it back and continued her hunt.
 When he was growing up in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Moore never envisioned a career running thrift shops. ''There are not many people who do what I do,'' he said. ''You can't go to college and learn it.'' 
 He studied art history and criminal justice at Youngstown State University. Then he went to law school, ''hated every minute,'' and dropped out. In 1980, he drove to New York for a summer vacation and never left. He sold fine china and glassware at Tiffany & Company before a customer lured him to a job in an importing company.
 Then a chance meeting with a former Tiffany colleague changed things. She was a board member of Planned Parenthood, and she persuaded Mr. Moore to become assistant director of the organization's thrift shop, now defunct. His experience at the high end of retailing, along with a desire to ''give back,'' proved a good combination, and he went on to run thrift shops for several nonprofit groups. He became president of an industry trade group and consults for other thrift shops as far away as Berlin.
 In 1997, Ross Alfieri, president of the New York City chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, recruited Mr. Moore. ''He gets the most out of the bottom line of anyone I know,'' Mr. Alfieri said. ''He gives people a lot of great feeling about being associated with the shop.''
 Mr. Moore, who lives in Staten Island, favors spare decor. He buys his clothing from retail stores. ''The more of this you do, the more of a minimalist you become,'' he said. ''You deal with so much merchandise that you want less stuff in your own life.''

HEADLINE: A Dutch World, Distant but Familiar

BYLINE: By HELEN A. HARRISON

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD 

 BODY:
LIKE family albums filled with intimate snapshots, Jan Luyken's so-called emblem books offer a fascinating glimpse of Dutch daily life in the late 17th century. More than 100 of Luyken's sketches and prints, on loan from the Amsterdams Historisch Museum in the Netherlands, are featured in ''Playing, Learning, Working in Amsterdam's Golden Age,'' on view through Dec. 5 at the Emily Lowe Gallery of the Hofstra Museum, on the campus of Hofstra University in Hempstead.
 The selection, culled from the last 4 of 11 popular picture books Luyken produced between 1671 and 1712, focuses on learning, work and human development. One series traces the cycle from cradle to grave, while others illustrate the crafts and trades, household furnishings and community life. Such picture essays, captioned to reinforce each image's educational message, were to the Holland of 300 years ago what Life magazine was to 20th-century America. 
 The exhibition includes many of Luyken's original ink-and-wash drawings, the work of a fine draftsman with a gift for capturing both character and setting. He was also a skilled printmaker, who trained his son Casper to transfer the pictures to etching plates for publication. In several cases the display compares the drawing with the etching, showing how line was used to create tone and texture in the printed version, which is a mirror image of the original drawing.
 In ''The Beginning, Middle and End of Man,'' Luyken's charming genre scenes depict mothers caring for their infants, children at play and youngsters on the way to school. Their clothes are long out of fashion, but many of their toys, like the kite, top and hobbyhorse, have modern counterparts. And their games, from jump-rope and hopscotch to archery and golf, are still played today. 
 ''The Mirror of Human Occupations'' deals with the workaday world -- including Luyken's own professional milieu, the printing shop and art studio -- where apprentices learn a variety of occupations. Some, like lantern making, are antiquated, but others continue to be practiced. Today's potter throws a vessel on the same sort of wheel used by his 17th-century counterpart; the tailor, bricklayer and baker are familiar figures in the modern era.
 Commerce, especially shipping, was the lifeblood of Holland's economy, and Luyken does not neglect Amsterdam's merchant fleet. Ship's carpenters, sailmakers and rope walkers ply their trades in the busy port, where sailors eagerly anticipate the next profitable voyage. 
 The world reflected in Luyken's mirror is both distant and familiar, an industrious society that was transplanted to the Dutch colonies of New Netherland, the forerunner of modern New York.
 ''Playing, Learning, Working in Amsterdam's Golden Age'' is at the Emily Lowe Gallery of the Hofstra Museum, on the campus of Hofstra University in Hempstead, through Dec. 5. Information: (516)463-5672 or www.hofstra.edu/museum.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face of the Island's Labor Force

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
NEARLY seven years ago, a young veterinarian closed his small clinic in rural Loja, Ecuador, said goodbye to his parents, wife and three children, and began walking to the United States. 
 ''Banks had money to lend big companies but not to small business owners,'' the man said in Spanish, explaining why he closed his business. ''There was no capital for people like me.''
 The man said he traveled on foot through Ecuador and Colombia, then through Central America and Mexico, living on what he could earn as a day laborer. Somewhere in Mexico, he said, he agreed to pay a smuggler for a ride across the border in a crowded van. The van proceeded up the East Coast; at the end of the ride, he opened his wallet and handed over all his money -- a total of $20. 
 It wasn't nearly enough. The smuggler became belligerent, and demanded more. ''I thought I would have to fight,'' the man said. He mimed a show of fists, trying to communicate despite his lack of English. Then, he shrugged and smiled gently, suggesting that he knew he had gotten off easily.
 The man, who identified himself only as Angel because he immigrated illegally, got out in Newark and made his way to Worcester, Mass. There, another immigrant told him that plentiful work and higher pay abounded on Long Island. 
 ''He asked me did I want to come with him,'' Angel said. ''I said yes.''
 Today Angel rents a private room in a house in Hicksville that he shares with six other Latino immigrants.
 On most mornings he takes the bus to the New Frontier, a hiring hall in Glen Cove run by an Hispanic advocacy group. Inside the hall, a spartan room decorated with travel posters and English-language vocabulary charts, Angel awaits potential employers. On a recent week, he found work four out of five days: moving boxes in a warehouse for two days and working for a landscaper the other two. The going pay rate: $10 an hour. Living frugally, he said, he managed to wire home about $1,000 last year.
 ''No one,'' he said, ''has ever asked me to show papers for anything.''
 People like Angel are, increasingly, the face of working-class Long Island. They are often paid off the books, washing the dishes, mowing the lawns and harvesting the crops in a society that does not officially recognize their presence.
 But the presence of immigrants, both legal and illegal, is increasingly obvious. During the 1990's, the population of foreign-born residents in Nassau and Suffolk grew by 45 percent, reaching nearly 400,000, according to a Brookings Institution study, ''The Rise of Immigrant Gateways,'' released in March.
 Estimating how many people are here illegally is difficult and loaded politically. Government officials shy from the subject, fearing the reaction of Hispanic groups and civil-rights advocates, many of whom contend that focusing special attention on the legal status of Latino immigrants is a form of racism. Federal agencies like the Immigration and Naturalization Service have in recent years been reorganized, their missions altered.
 ''Most government officials won't touch the subject,'' said James M. Staudenraus, the Eastern regional director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The organization, called FAIR, is, a private, nonprofit group in Washington that advocates reducing immigration quotas and strengthening border patrols. Mr. Staudenraus estimates that as many as 13 million illegal immigrants live in the United States.
 Mr. Staudenraus, who lives on Shelter Island, said that based on national immigration patterns, Long Island is probably home to at least 183,000 illegal immigrants. 
 Isabel Sepulveda de Scanlon, a Chilean immigrant and Hispanic advocate in Southampton who became a naturalized citizen last year, said native-born Americans should not presume to know a person's legal status based on apparent ethnicity. At a public forum on immigration and assimilation held last summer on the East End, Ms. Sepulveda, who helped organize an Hispanic community group called Organizacion Latino Americana of Eastern Long Island, known as OLA, challenged a speaker who suggested that the dozens of men who seek day jobs in Southampton, gathering in front of a convenience store, were illegal immigrants.
 ''They are not all illegal,'' she said to scattered applause. ''We are not all illegal. I'm not illegal. My daughters are not illegal. You can't say that about all of us.''
 Employers shy away from the question. The situation ''is getting to be a real problem in terms of policing who is legal and who is not,'' said Joseph Gergela, the executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau. He said that the farmers, nursery owners and agricultural businesses that are members of the bureau abide by the same federal hiring rules as other employers. They are not obliged, he said, to be more vigilant about screening out illegal immigrants than any other employers.
 ''We don't ask these questions, so long as the worker is able to fill out the I-9 form,'' said Mr. Gergela, referring to the Internal Revenue Service document that requires employees show proof of legal residency. ''Our job isn't to enforce immigration laws.''
 For employers, the economic incentive to hiring illegal immigrants off the books is powerful. Irv Miljoner, a federal Labor Department official in Hempstead who monitors compliance with rules regulating hourly labor, said he believed the underground economy on Long Island was expanding. More employers, he said, are calling to tip him off about their rivals' hiring practices.
 ''In increasing numbers, we get complaints from employers about the guy down the block paying cash off the books or not paying overtime to immigrants,'' Mr. Miljoner said. Companies that play by the rules, he said, ''feel they cannot compete.''
 Gregory DeFreitas, an economist at Hofstra University and the director of the its Center for Labor Studies, said that many businesses favor expanding immigration. ''In some ways corporate America is very pro-immigrant, especially pro-low-wage immigrant,'' said Dr. DeFreitas, who has studied immigration issues for nearly 20 years. 
 Mr. Staudenraus of FAIR said the cost of gray-market labor was ultimately paid by everyone. Employers who hire off the books ''get a minimum-wage worker, but the public gets a subsidized worker,'' he said. ''The subsidy is paid in the cost of schools, health care, the courts and the penal system. The cost-shifting that goes on is enormous.''
 Health care offers a vivid example, he said, and he cited Southampton Hospital as an example. The hospital, in one of the wealthiest communities on Long Island, finished 2003 with $7.3 million in uncompensated costs, much of this amount run up by illegal immigrants who do not pay for the medical care they receive, hospital officials said. And the costs are rising; in 2002, uncompensated care totaled $4.7 million.
 Annette Leahy, the hospital's chief executive, said the growing numbers of illegal immigrants on the East End helped drive up uncompensated costs, but that they were not the only recipients. ''There is a growing number of uninsured and underinsured people'' in the area, she said. 
 Mr. Staudenraus recommends strict border patrols and deporting anyone who breaks immigration laws. 
 Mr. Gergela, the Farm Bureau director, takes a different tack. ''From a practical standpoint it will be impossible for the U.S. immigration force to be large enough to get those people to go back where they came from,'' he said. To try to do so, he said, ''is not reasonable, possible or sensible.''
 ''Our economy needs to bring them in, have them pay taxes and Social Security,'' he said. But he also acknowledged that offering amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants was politically risky.
 ''This isn't popular in some quarters,'' he said. ''But if you think these people are going to go away, you are mistaken.''

HEADLINE: Sticker Shock at Gas Pump and Oil Tank

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
ROBERT PASTORELLI of Dix Hills pulled his Lincoln up to the self-service island at the DJM Service Station in Deer Park, handed the clerk $25 and began pumping.
 ''I put in $40 every three days,'' he said. ''I'm always broke.''
 Mr. Pastorelli noted that the price for premium gasoline had recently risen from $2.30 a gallon to $2.39. ''It was $2.45 this summer,'' he said. 
 A few minutes earlier, Carol Barbieri of Dix Hills had stopped her Jaguar sedan at the full-service pump and had handed $20 to the station owner, Mitchell Macy. She got a little more than seven gallons of premium, at $2.65 a gallon. 
 ''I don't pay attention to the price,'' said Ms. Barbieri, who owns her own jewelry store, Details, in Garden City. ''I just know it costs $51 to fill up the car.''
 She said she heats her home with gas and does not keep track of the of the bill. ''I pay it,'' she said with a shrug as her 8-year-old son, Paul, played in the back seat.
 Others are more cost-conscious, Mr. Macy said, and the high gas prices have caused some of his regular customers to shop elsewhere. ''Since April, gas consumption is off 15 percent from last year,'' he said. 
 Now that the heating season has arrived, homeowners have to budget for skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices, too. 
 Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in Manhattan, a nonprofit research group set up by oil companies to study energy economics, said he expected home heating oil prices to increase even more than those for gasoline.
 ''Home heating oil and gasoline prices will look very much alike,'' he said. ''Homeowners are going to be paying $700 to $1,000 more for home heating oil, depending on the volume used. Consumers' pockets are being picked clean.''
 The average price of home heating oil on Long Island rose to $2.25 on Nov. 1 and then dropped to $2.22 last Monday, according to the State Energy Research and Development Authority. And in the last two weeks, the average price for gasoline has dropped about 2 cents a gallon, to $2.14 for regular and $2.37 for premium, according to the American Automobile Association.
 ''This is starting out as the winter of our discontent,'' said Kevin Rooney, the chief executive of the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island, which represents retail oil companies. ''The wholesale price for oil on the futures market is 80 percent higher now than it was last year. That has put companies in a tremendous cash problem.''
 One of them, Petro, the Island's largest oil company, reported in mid-October that it had experienced liquidity problems and was unable to pay a dividend to its shareholders.
 On its Web site, Star Gas Partners of Stamford, Conn., Petro's parent company, attributed the problem to an ''inability to pass on the full impact of record heating oil prices to customers'' and to unusually high customer attrition. Star cited an attrition rate of 4 percent nationally but did not give a Long Island figure. 
 Mr. Rooney said there were about 130 oil companies on Long Island but he did not know any others with similar difficulties. About two-thirds of the Island's homes -- 600,000 in all -- heat with oil, he said. 
 The high price of home heating oil has prompted many homeowners to shop around for the best price, said Joseph Roy, the Long Island coordinator, in Huntington, for the New York Public Interest Research Group's fuel buyers. ''People are in a panic and looking around to secure prices,'' he said, adding that the peak in oil prices may have already been reached.
 Mr. Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation said that in 10 of the last 11 or 12 years, home heating oil had been less expensive than natural gas. But he said he expected oil prices to be higher this year. 
 Nancy C. Cianflone, the director of regulatory affairs for KeySpan Energy Delivery, which provides natural gas on Long Island, agreed. ''Right now the market is volatile, and KeySpan has things in place to help minimize volatility, like storing gas in the summer and financial hedging arrangements that entails futures buying,'' she said. ''The point of our hedging is not to speculate on a price but to mitigate volatility and to try to prevent price spikes. This is a procedure KeySpan has had in place many years. We lock in prices for half of our supply.''
 Ms. Cianfione said although prices for natural gas were up 10 to 15 percent this year compared with last year, it would be less expensive than oil this heating season. The price of natural gas in October was equivalent to $1.86 a gallon, she said, compared with heating oil at $2.03 a gallon. 
 Mr. Rooney of the Oil Heating Institute of Long Island had a slightly different take on the situation. He said the price of the two fuels was now roughly the same: $2.17 a gallon for home heating oil and the equivalent of $2.20 a gallon for natural gas.
 Homeowners and drivers are not the only people, of course, whose budgets are being wrecked by energy prices. For Suffolk's county government, utility and energy costs (electricity, water, gasoline and fuel oil) will rise from $26.8 million in 2003 to a projected $35.1 million next year, said Robert C. Bortzfield, the county's budget director. 
 Barry S. Paul, Nassau County's deputy budget director, said the county's expenses for heating oil, electricity and water would increase from $23.8 million in 2003 to a projected $25.5 million next year. Figures for gasoline and diesel fuel were not available.

HEADLINE: Dead Zone: A Coliseum Without Hockey

BYLINE: By JOSH BENSON

DATELINE: UNIONDALE 

 BODY:
BUSINESS is down at Champions, a memorabilia-decked sports bar on the ground floor of the Marriott hotel next to the Nassau Coliseum. 
 The managers there, casting about for ways to bring in customers, recently introduced Islanders Classics Night, a weekly promotion that will feature videotapes of New York Islanders hockey games from the team's halcyon years in the early 1980's.
 The first Classics Night -- held on Election Night -- attracted just a handful of customers. But the staff remained upbeat.
 ''We're trying to reach out to the fans with some new promotions like this one,'' said Jerry Rizzo, the director of food and beverage service at Champions. ''We know that the fans formed a real alliance with the older players during those years, and we're hoping to get some of them in here for that.'' 
 Welcome to Nassau County in a hockey season without hockey. 
 A labor dispute that has shut down the National Hockey League has left a gaping hole in the social calendars of the Islanders' dedicated fans, creating an area around Nassau Coliseum on many days to something like an asphalt desert and reducing a popular local sports bar to showing reruns. 
 Unlike other New York-area hockey sites -- the archrival New York Rangers share Madison Square Garden with the Knicks and the New Jersey Devils' arena in the Meadowlands is also home to the Nets -- Nassau Coliseum has no professional basketball team to soften the impact of the hockey lockout. On Long Island, the Islanders are it as far as major-league professional sports teams go, and without them the 16,300-seat Coliseum begins to resemble the pejorative nickname for it employed by disdainful Rangers fans: the Mausoleum.
 The area around the arena has indeed become something of a dead zone. ''I really can't imagine a single reason to go there now,'' said Mike Kuo, who said he attends dozens of Islanders home games each season. ''There aren't any other events at the Coliseum that I'd go to, and there's no other shopping around there.''
 On days and nights when local bars and restaurants would be overrun with thirsty, free-spending fans in blue, white and orange hockey sweaters, many of those same sites now find themselves overstaffed and underpatronized. 
 Revenues at Champions are already down by 1 to 1.5 percent for the last 12 months, Marriott management said, with the probability of a much more severe dip as more and more scheduled games in what would have been the 2004-5 season are missed. And with prospects remote for a quick settlement of the labor dispute, seasonal jobs are not being filled. ''We didn't have to expand as we normally do going into hockey season,'' Mr. Rizzo said.
 The Coliseum Deli, which sits just across the Hempstead Turnpike from its namesake, has depended on the custom not only of fans but of Coliseum employees and management, and of the Islanders coaches and players themselves. 
 ''We usually do business with the team -- there are a hundred people in the organization who eat here,'' Rich Comito, a co-owner of the deli, said as he stood beside the cash register on a recent Saturday. ''And there's always lots of media and television crews on game days. And needless to say, with the fans before the games, this place is rocking. We live off of that. And now it's not there.''
 Mr. Comito said the deli still had a catering service that was unaffected by the hockey stoppage, and also the business generated by football's New York Jets, whose practice facility is nearby at Hofstra University. 
 But Mr. Comito fears that the current N.H.L. impasse (over the league's attempt to impose a salary-cap system) could have a dampening effect on the area's future, potentially derailing plans for a grand redevelopment of the area recently proposed by the Islanders' owner, Charles Wang, whose heavy spending on players had brought about at least a limited revival on the ice. 
 ''We were really getting excited about the new expansion, but this kind of took the air out of the balloon,'' he said. 
 While it is not clear whether the lockout will last long enough to have an impact on the Wang proposal, which was unveiled a month ago, it seems certain that the conflict will go on well into the season. Earlier this month the league announced the cancellation of its All-Star Game, which was scheduled for Feb. 13. And there has been little indication since then that either side intends to budge in time to rescue what is left of the season: there have been no new negotiations, with an increasing number of players drifting off to skate out their seasons in independent leagues in North America or in Europe.
 In the meantime, the lockout's depressing effect is spreading beyond mere business considerations. For the team's fiercely dedicated fans, the impasse forces an unwelcome change of lifestyle.
 ''I've got nothing -- it's a void,'' said Mike Marino, a longtime Islanders fan who lives in Levittown and works nights at a sports equipment store in Carle Place. ''I coach a high school team in Bethpage, so that kind of keeps me in the loop. But without something to come home and watch, I'm lost. I had to watch Minnesota versus Wisconsin on Saturday. College hockey. That's what I'm reduced to.''
 Mr. Marino, who estimates that he normally goes to see the Islanders between 25 and 30 games at home and once or twice on the road per season, noted regretfully that he had to cancel a planned trip to Canada to see the Islanders play the Ottawa Senators. Despite everything, though, he remained optimistic that Islanders hockey would be part of his life again before long. ''They haven't canceled the games in January yet, so I think something's going to happen soon,'' he said.
 Ever searching for a bright side, perhaps, some fans feel that the lockout may turn out to be a blessing for a league that seems to have expanded itself into insolvency. ''I think that the strike may be kind of necessary,'' said Dan Dolgin, who is a graduate student at Tufts University outside Boston, and whose family has had season tickets since 1981. ''In a league where so few of the teams make money, the arrangement just didn't make sense. The product has suffered, and I hope at least that the strike will prompt them to rethink the whole thing. They'll have to start from scratch.''
 Mr. Kuo, an urban planner, said he hoped that the stoppage might benefit not only the league, but the Islanders -- relative, in particular, to one certain other team. ''I think the Islanders have always had a disadvantage in terms of economic competitiveness compared to the Rangers, who have the flexibility to buy any players they want,'' he said. ''If this whole strike results in a more level playing field, I think it will be a real victory for Islander fans.''
 Others wonder whether the fans will ever come back. It has become a common, almost celebratory refrain in sports columns and on talk radio forums that normally devote far more time to basketball, baseball and football than to hockey that the lockout will cost the league whatever fans it has left, with many disgusted spectators staying away permanently.
 In the meantime, about the only organization deriving any benefit from the lockout is the Islander club itself. Like many teams in the league, the Islanders have hemorrhaged money lately, losing approximately $20 million last season alone, the team says. Because of the lockout, team officials say, this year's losses are projected to be considerably less.
 But the Islanders' spokesman, Chris Botta, betrayed no hint of satisfaction over the current situation, saying that the team's management was ''extremely disappointed'' for the team's fans, who had demonstrated for 30 years ''how much this team and the N.H.L. mean to them.'' While Mr. Botta did not express any particular optimism for a speedy resumption of play, he did say, ''For everyone's sake, we're hopeful for a resolution in the very near future.''
 That, it seems, is a sentiment shared with gusto in the area around the Coliseum. At Champions on a recent Saturday, Mr. Rizzo gestured at the half-empty room. ''If there was a hockey game on today, we would be three deep at the bar,'' he said, shaking his head. ''I'd just love to have the season back.''

HEADLINE: Razing Apartments: Farmingdale Calls It A Revitalization Project. The Critics Describe It As Ethnic Cleansing.

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE 

 BODY:
FRANK LoPICCOLO, a retired teacher, was standing in his backyard in Farmingdale a few weeks ago, staring at the house next door. Sometime last year, a group of Latino men had moved in, and ever since, Mr. LoPiccolo said, there had been more and more people, playing loud music, gathering outside on weekends and, he suspected, overcrowding the house. He watched as a man walked into the driveway, glanced across the fence and then darted into the back door.
 ''I have no idea what people live in this house, and that's a problem,'' said Mr. LoPiccolo, moving back into the shadows of his own backyard.
 Though outsiders sometimes confuse it with Farmingville, the Suffolk County hamlet 25 miles to the east where a string of violent acts aimed at day laborers brought national attention, the relationship between immigrants and longtime residents has been much quieter in Farmingdale. But mutual suspicions are not far from the surface in this Nassau County village of 9,000. Now a real confrontation is brewing here after the village resurrected a proposal to condemn and redevelop, under eminent domain law, the buildings in a part of town where much of the Latino population lives. 
 Village officials say the redevelopment project is only intended to restore what many describe as a village in decline. But people who live in the area think otherwise, and say it is only the latest chapter in the village's attempt to clear them out for good. And for the first time, local immigrant advocacy groups, working on behalf of the tenants, have contacted a lawyer.
 Farmingdale has been a destination for migrant workers since the 1940's, but the latest wave of Mexican and Central American day laborers started coming in the middle 1980's. According to census data, the Hispanic population just about doubled between 1990 and 2000, from 545 to 1,073, and as of the last census, made up more than an eighth of the village population. Many of them are illegal aliens.
 With little guidance or experience, Farmingdale and other municipal governments have been left to their own devices in addressing the impact of growing immigrant populations. Since 9/11, federal immigration authorities have focused most of their attention on homeland security. Little direction has come from New York State, and only recently have county governments begun exploring the formation of countywide policies. 
 The Suffolk county executive, Steve Levy, announced in August an ongoing sting operation aimed at unlicensed contractors, many of whom employ undocumented laborers. He also proposed to grant local police officers the powers of federal immigration agents, which has invited skepticism from some police officers.
 In Nassau County, Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive, said he was considering forming a countywide policy and has been discussing the issue with immigrant advocacy groups. He is likely to take a different approach from Mr. Levy, if his tenure as mayor of Glen Cove is any indication. There, he helped set up a system of collaboration between city authorities and La Fuerza Unida, the city's main immigrant advocacy group.
 But as there is still no countywide policy in Nassau, Farmingdale has been trying a whole range of measures, from supporting the creation of a temporary hiring spot to strictly enforcing traffic regulations to discourage contractors from stopping to hire day laborers.
 On any given morning on Conklin Street, the two-lane extension of the Hempstead Turnpike that runs through the center of the village, dozens of vans and trucks pull onto side streets to pick up the day laborers waiting on the corner. It is a sight that has changed little for years, despite the village's efforts.
 In 1999, Mayor Joseph Trudden put up signs forbidding drivers to stop or stand on Conklin Street between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m., hoping that strict regulations would deter contractors from coming to Farmingdale for workers. And in 2000, Mr. Trudden designated an empty lot on Elizabeth Street where the day laborers could convene and wait for contractors. Combined, he hoped, the sight of day laborers waiting on the side of the road would go away.
 ''It's a Band-Aid on a surgery,'' he now says.
 The hiring spot raised the ire of nearby residents, who accused the laborers of misbehaving, leaving trash and harassing passers-by. In less than a year, the village closed off the site, putting up fences and more No Stopping signs. The next year, local immigrant advocacy groups rented out space for a hiring site in East Farmingdale, just over the border in the Suffolk County. Almost immediately, according to those who ran the site, there were several incidents that terrified the laborers and intimated the advocacy groups helping run the site. Employees of a nearby manufacturing company shouted at the workers from passing cars, threatening to call the immigration authorities. In less than a month that site was closed, too.
 While all of this was going on, Mr. Trudden and the Board of Trustees decided that several properties on the east end of the village had become eyesores. Although the boundaries of the study area varied over the years, there were essentially six acres in question, the primary address being an apartment complex at 150 Secatogue Avenue, which houses about 150 people. Most of the tenants are Latino; many of them identify themselves as day laborers.
 In the spring of 2000, Mr. Trudden said, the village tried to persuade the owners of the properties to tear down the buildings and put up new housing. Suggestions ranged from upscale condominiums with underground parking to subsidized apartments for senior citizens. Mr. Trudden said the village intended to find housing for anyone who was displaced, but he admitted that the complex at 150 Secatogue and one nearby at 130 Secatogue were ''really the only apartments in Farmingdale.''
 ''Whatever it is, I just want to see the town look nice,'' Mr. Trudden said.
 Though the owner of the building at 150 Secatogue, John Tosini, said he was interested in redeveloping, the village began proceedings to claim the properties under eminent domain law. The tenants were for the most part unaware of the plans, though local immigrant advocacy groups protested at public meetings.
 ''We said at the time: 'This is absurd. You're just getting rid of them,''' recalled Janet Liotta, a member of Farmingdale Citizens for a Viable Solution, an immigrant advocacy group. ''They just said, 'We don't know when this is going into effect.'''
 But the proposal languished, and it was not until the summer of 2004 that the village began to seriously consider it again. In the meantime, the building at 130 Secatogue had been damaged by fire in January 2003, leaving it unoccupied. The 30 or so residents scattered, some of them moving into the larger complex at 150 Secatogue.
 The main catalyst was the arrival of a new village government in April 2004, after a challenger to Mr. Trudden and two candidates for the four-member village board were elected after campaigning on what they described as a need for revitalization in Farmingdale.
 The new mayor, George Graf, pledged in his campaign literature to ''get these day laborers off our streets,'' saying that Mr. Trudden ''embraces day laborers.'' Once he was in office, Mr. Graf imposed stricter fines for contractors who stop their vehicles to pick up laborers, though in an interview he said the changes were more about reducing traffic congestion and keeping streets safe than discouraging contractors from picking up laborers.
 Michael Grello, the founder of Concerned Citizens Association of Farmingdale, describes the empty storefronts along Main Street, the gang-related graffiti he has been seeing recently around the village and a killing and a stabbing that took place in the past two years. All of these things relate, in some way, to the presence of the day laborers, he said, though the Nassau County Police Department says there is no connection between the day laborers and gang activity.
 ''The bottom line is they're here now and it's not working,'' Mr. Grello said of the immigrants.
 At a September meeting, the village board announced that it was reviewing the eminent domain plan and had decided to form a committee to study the area. ''By replacing dilapidated housing with new businesses and residential housing we will put valuable property back on the tax rolls,'' Mr. Graf wrote in an opinion essay in the local newspaper, The Farmingdale Observer.
 Mr. Graf insists that there is still no specific plan and that the village is simply reviewing what the previous administration had done. ''Everyone is concerned about maintaining property values and having their village in the best shape possible,'' he said. ''It's in our interest to take a look at what's been done before.''
 Supporters of the plan deny that the project has anything to do with the day laborer issue, saying that most of the workers standing on Conklin Street come from Hempstead, not Farmingdale. They also say that the village will compensate the tenants and help them find other housing.
 ''It's not about putting day laborers out of work or removing the Latino population out of Farmingdale,'' said Mr. Grello, who supports the eminent domain proposal. ''Most people in Farmingdale don't have a problem with the Latino population.''
 The project, as it now stands, covers about six acres. The apartment complex at 150 Secatogue is by far the biggest property, with 56 apartments and about 150 people. The village attorney, Greg W. Carmen Jr., said the project area also includes an office building, a commercial strip along Conklin Street -- a pizzeria, a Chinese restaurant, a liquor store, a deli and a gas station, one of the main gathering sites for day laborers each morning -- and 11 multifamily houses and 7 single-family homes. None of the owners of the multifamily properties live in them; the houses are investment properties, and one of the owners happens to be the town clerk, John Giordano. Mr. Giordano said he had opposed including his property in the plan. 
 Like the mayor, Mr. Carmen emphasized that the project was still in very early stages, and that every possibility was still on the table. But he said the board wanted to put the project on the ''front burner,'' and that he had already spoken with developers, engineers and the owners of the properties.
 ''I think the village wants to see this entire area get redeveloped, through the process of eminent domain or something else,'' he said. ''We want to revitalize this area.''
 Mr. Carmen said that the process would be transparent and that public hearings would be held every step of the way.
 No one disputes that the buildings in this area are run down. Mr. Tosini, the 150 Secatogue landlord, has been issued citations for 14 code violations, including wall and ceiling damage, roof holes, vermin and mold, according to Mr. Carmen. Tenants complain of a lack of hot water and heat during the winter, and standing outside, one can see paint peeling off the doors and windows. Mr. Tosini said that he had recently installed new boilers, but that generally he was not investing in improvements because he was waiting to see what the village was going to do.
 ''It wouldn't make sense for me to do the capital improvements if the buildings are not going to be there,'' he said.
 At this point, further deterioration of the buildings may not be a factor in whether or not the village designates the area as blighted and proceeds with eminent domain. In fact, legal experts say, the definition of blight is so vague that the village would hardly have to make a case for it at all.
 ''It is a totally meaningless, amorphous term,'' said Gideon Kanner, a professor emeritus at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a specialist in eminent domain law. Mr. Kanner said that courts, particularly in New York State, have repeatedly deferred to municipalities' definitions of blight, while municipalities have been stretching the definition to mean any area that could bring in more tax dollars if it were redeveloped.
 Dana Berliner, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm in Washington, agreed. ''Blight in New York is basically going to be the same thing as approving this study that says there's something wrong with the area and it must be changed,'' she said.
 Courts generally support economic redevelopment efforts, and because of this, opponents of redevelopment projects have to act quickly. ''Once they designate it as a redevelopment area and approve a project,'' Ms. Berliner said, ''there's a short window of time to object to the future condemnation of the property.''
 For local immigrant advocacy groups, that window opened in October. They have been meeting with tenants in a little office a few blocks away from 150 Secatogue. One night a week, after English classes, Carlos Canales has been teaching some of the tenants of 150 Secatogue exactly what eminent domain is and what they can do about it.
 Mr. Canales is a member of the Workplace Project, a Hempstead-based group that supports Latino workers, and he hopes to assemble a solid majority of tenants in organized opposition to what he describes as ''ethnic cleansing of Latinos.'' At the first meeting, on Oct. 21, the tenants who were present elected a 15-person committee. 
 ''Their task is to represent the whole 150 Secatogue building,'' Mr. Canales said. ''To represent the organization to the village and to spread the news, and educate the rest of the tenants.''
 Five days after the meeting, the tenant of one of the apartments at 150 Secatogue called the police about a leaky pipe in the basement. The fire department arrived and, seeing smoke, discovered that the water was leaking into a circuit breaker panel. Around 1 a.m., after turning off the water, the electricity and the heat, the firefighters went from door to door in the complex, evacuating all the tenants, according to Mr. Giordano. The Red Cross set up a shelter for the residents at the gymnasium of State University of New York at Farmingdale, and the village promised residents that they could move back in after the buildings were thoroughly inspected.
 But in a tense atmosphere, rumors of an imminent condemnation were flying, and Mr. Canales met later that day with Professor Stefan H. Krieger of the Housing Rights Clinic at Hofstra University School of Law. Two legal interns from the clinic, Kerry Galvin and Farrel Donald, were appointed to represent five tenants of 150 Secatogue. They first went to the village officials, questioning the need for the evacuation and inspection of the entire complex. Most of the 150 Secatogue residents moved back in after two days, and now Ms. Galvin and Mr. Donald are studying their options.
 ''Basically our goal is just to make sure that the tenants can remain in the housing complex,'' Ms. Galvin said. ''That they're not forced out for any particular reason and that the housing complex stays up to par, that living standards are met.''
 In other words, Mr. Donald and Ms. Galvin will be negotiating with both sides, arguing to Mr. Tosini that the property at 150 Secatogue is in serious need of repair, while arguing to the village that it is not so blighted as to call for condemnation. They said they were not accusing anyone of discrimination. But given that the area consists almost entirely of Latinos, Mr. Donald said it's definitely an avenue they were thinking about.
 In the wake of the evacuation, the village is performing a full inspection of the property, and has asked permission from Mr. Tosini to enter the apartments of tenants who have not yet registered complaints. The code enforcement supervisor, Ron Craig, says he is compiling a comprehensive report of code violations to submit to the village board. The board, not Mr. Craig, holds the power to designate blight. But Mr. Craig, who has the power to cite Mr. Tosini for code violations, did say that during the inspections he has been finding ''situations that don't appear to meet the standards for habitable conditions.'' 
 Despite the lawyers, the tenants are already talking about moving to Uniondale or Brentwood, giving up their jobs in Farmingdale and taking their children out of the local schools.
 Dawn McMahon, a tenant, said she was already looking for apartments elsewhere, saying she is worried that if the property is condemned and ''if we're all looking at the same time, it's going to be hard.''
 Ely Chavez, an eight-year resident of the complex who works for a nearby manufacturer of vinyl sheeting, said his daughters were frightened by the recent evacuation and worried that next time everybody was going to be turned out for good. He's looking for a place in another part of the Island.
 Many of the tenants are convinced that the village is trying to get rid of the Latino population. Armando Martinez, a Mexican, said he has lived at 150 Secatogue for six months. Asked why he thought the village was condemning his home, he said the village has ''a problem with the Hispanic community in general.'' Ms. McMahon, who is white, said: ''I know what this is all about. They want my neighbors gone.'' 
 Kumar Mishra, an engineer from India who has lived at 150 Secatogue for three years, said that although he was unsure why the village was going forward with the plan, he had never felt any enmity from the village himself. But things had changed, he said, in the past two weeks. On the night of the evacuation, he said, he felt the village officials treated him differently.
 ''It's slow poison,'' he said. ''It's all a game plan: 'Slowly, slowly we can kick these people out, because these are the kind of people who do not pay attention.'''

HEADLINE: Drawn by the Prices, Betting on the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By NANCY BETH JACKSON

 BODY:
WITH a good eye for real estate, Mother Cabrini, later the patron saint of immigrants and the first American citizen canonized, traveled by horse and buggy to northern Manhattan in 1898 to acquire a tract of land at 190th Street and Fort Washington Avenue. 
 In the fresh air near the highest point on the island, she established a boarding school for daughters of the Italian immigrants Pope Leo XIII had dispatched her to serve.
 Today about 50,000 pilgrims annually visit the Washington Heights shrine where Mother Cabrini is entombed. This weekend, the saint's feast day will be celebrated with masses in five languages, including Spanish, now spoken by about 70 percent of the neighborhood, according to the 2000 census. Mother Cabrini High School thrives as a day school for 400 girls, most from Dominican families, and says it sends almost all of its graduates to college. 
 Washington Heights traditionally has been where immigrants seek refuge and a future. Noted for its European Jewish immigrants in the 1930's and 1940's, including Henry Kissinger's family, and for the Dominicans who made the neighborhood the unofficial capital of the Dominican Republic in the 1980's, Washington Heights continues to welcome immigrants. The latest to come are other Hispanics, Russians, Africans, and Asians. Newcomers also include gays, biracial couples, doctors, graduate students, young professionals, musicians, actors and anyone looking for more space than they can afford farther south in Manhattan.
 ''There is such an amazing mix here that anyone can fit in,'' said Lynne Herndon, a public school teacher who moved from the West 40's with her husband, Akbar Ali Herndon, a private school administrator, when their 5-year-old son, Liam, was a toddler. ''For us, the kind of mix we have up here is part of the appeal.''
 Washington Heights occupies two ridges, with Broadway, once an Indian trail, running down the valley. The neighborhood is well connected to the rest of the world with six bridges (including the George Washington Bridge), three major highways, Bronx and Manhattan buses, the A train express subway line and the 1 and 9 lines. 
 The Hispanic Society of America museum and library on Audubon Terrace and the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park bookend the neighborhood, which also has Fort Washington Park, an extension of Riverside Park, and High Bridge Park to the east. Smaller green spaces include J. Wood Wright Park, with its playground bridge a model of the George Washington, and Bennett Park, where American patriots lost the Battle of Fort Washington on Nov. 16, 1776. 
 Restaurants have moved beyond mouth-watering Dominican chicken to sushi and brunch but don't rival those downtown. Christina Harris, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at City University of New York who rents a large studio for less than $1,000 a month, regrets that few friends trek up to visit her. 
 ''There's not much nightlife, although the Monkey Room at 187th and Fort Washington has an excellent karaoke night on Thursdays, and the D.J., Willard Loue, does a great Elvis,'' she said.
 That there's any nightlife at all will surprise anyone who remembers Washington Heights in the 1980's and early 1990's when it was considered one of the city's most ''murderous'' neighborhoods and drug gangs ruled the streets. Since 1994, when the 33rd Precinct was created out of the 34th, crime rates are down almost 70 percent in the 34th and almost 60 percent in the 33rd. But last month, residents at a community meeting complained that crimes like burglary were rising in the 34th while dropping elsewhere. 
 Anne Born, a Columbia University administrator and divorced mother of four, couldn't be happier with the changes she has seen since she bought a four-bedroom on 180th Street for $120,000 in 1998 after renting for a year. ''I am so crazy about the police because I've been full cycle,'' she said. 
 Education is also a hot-button topic. Two years ago, the Herndons, the couple who moved up from Hell's Kitchen, worked with other parents for more school choices in a neighborhood known for crowded classrooms and low test scores. This fall their son is one of 19 kindergartners in the fledgling Washington Heights Academy, a parent-involvement program housed at Public School 178. The families reflect the educational, economic and ethnic diversity of Washington Heights.
 Some parents try for Public School 187 (Cliff Heights), which sends graduates to the most competitive public high schools. At lunch, first through fourth graders listen to classical music. Other options are alternative public school offerings in Inwood, and parochial and private schools in the Bronx and Manhattan. Under a recent reorganization, some intermediate schools have been divided into smaller units. George Washington High School now houses independent programs in international business, communications, law and public service, and health careers and science. 
 The report card is still out on how effective the changes will be. 
 Dr. Ileana Vargas-Rodriguez, a pediatric endocrinologist, can walk to work at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia Presbyterian. In 1998, the job drew her back to the neighborhood, rich with memories: her family's first home after moving from Puerto Rico, her school days at Mother Cabrini, the one-bedroom apartment where she and her husband, Dr. Jose A. Rodriguez, an orthopedic surgeon, had begun their family before moving to the East Side. Four years ago, the couple and their two school-age children moved into a three-bedroom apartment. 
 ''But when we say we live in Washington Heights, we do get some looks,'' she said. ''Two physicians, and you live in Washington Heights?''
 Housing stock is mostly five- and six-story prewar apartment buildings, many still in their original configurations. ''They were considered modest, but they were not modestly constructed,'' said Simone Song, the principal broker at Simone Song Properties in the Hudson Heights section, where most co-ops are situated. Among the best known are Hudson View Gardens, a Tudor-style complex built in 1924, and Castle Village, five towers constructed in 1939. 
 Hudson View apartments sell in the half-million-dollar range and Castle Village units for around $750,000 or higher, Ms. Song said, noting that a four-bedroom Castle Village apartment was recently under contract for $1.15 million.
 Other apartments can be had for far less. Gary Seligson, the drummer for ''Wicked,'' the Broadway musical, and his wife, Lucy, a former actress, bought a two-bedroom apartment two years ago for less than they would have paid for a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side.
 Condos and new construction units are rare, but the Cliffside Condominium, a 20-unit development with apartments priced at $340,000 to $895,000, opened recently on Cabrini Boulevard, at about 188th Street. The Bennett, 55 units at 736 West 187th Street, initially priced between $295,000 and $653,000, is expected to be finished next summer.
 Owners who bought in the neighborhood only a few years ago report they've been approached to sell their apartments for twice what they paid. Perry Payne, a former actress who became an agent with Stein-Perry Real Estate and president of her co-op board after buying an apartment south of the George Washington Bridge, said one junior four-room apartment bought from the sponsor for $90,000 in 1998 was sold in 2002 for $375,000. And the second buyers just sold it for $425,000. Reasons for selling were less flipping than transition. The first buyers moved upstate, the second had a growing family.
 Most of the co-ops and more upscale rentals are west of Broadway, although Louis Pulice, a Stein-Perry agent who grew up east of Broadway as a son of Italian immigrants, sees deals in his old neighborhood. Bargains can also be found in low-owner-occupancy buildings where sponsors have put units on the market, said David Purdy, a mortgage consultant and Washington Heights resident. 
 Always in transition, Washington Heights is no longer a default neighborhood. It has become a destination all its own.

HEADLINE: Plant Shortage Leaves Campaigns Against Malaria at Risk

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
A Chinese herbal drug that is strikingly effective against malaria is in critically short supply because of rising demand, public health officials and pharmaceutical executives say.
 As a result, prices for the drug, artemisinin, have quadrupled, and the few companies that make compounds containing it have drastically cut back production. Supply crises are looming in 40 tropical countries that have recently made it the centerpiece of their antimalarial efforts.
 Malaria kills about one million people a year, most of them children. Strains resistant to older drugs have spread rapidly, and artemisinin (pronounced are-TEM-is-in-in), which is extracted from the sweet wormwood plant, was embraced this year by Western health agencies and donors as the most cost-effective solution. 
 The sudden shortage ''has created a major wave of shock in our organization,'' said Dr. Andrea Bosman of the World Health Organization's malaria control team. Paul Lalvani, procurement manager for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, said the countries that had just adopted the drug were ''really in a bind.'' 
 While other drugs are available, switching to a new one takes up to a year and can create dangerous confusion, especially in a poor country, he explained; the new drug must be registered, doctors and nurses must be retrained in dosages and side effects, and rural pharmacies must be alerted and restocked.
 ''Now they're sitting on the fence wondering if they should go ahead, or wait until the price drops, or pick another drug,'' he said.
 Wormwood is an ancient Asian fever treatment, and Chinese military doctors trying to aid the Vietcong in the 1970's proved that its extracts kill malaria parasites. It has been popular in Southeast Asia, but was largely ignored in the West until this year.
 Although sweet wormwood grows wild around the world, virtually all of the cultivation is in the hills of China and Vietnam.
 Each crop must be planted in January, harvested in the fall, and then dried and processed. Some would-be growers outside China are complaining that they cannot buy seeds.
 The shortage began soon after a series of meetings in April at which the Global Fund, the W.H.O., the World Bank, Unicef, the United States Agency for International Development and other donors jointly announced that they wanted malaria-prone countries to phase out older drugs like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and adopt multidrug combinations containing artemisinin or its derivatives artemether or artesunate.
 Even though the new drugs cost 10 to 20 times as much, the donors chose them because resistance to older drugs was running as high as 60 percent in parts of Africa. (A typical adult course of 24 of the newer pills costs the W.H.O. $2.40, as against 20 cents for chloroquine.)
 Until early this year, the world consumed about 30 tons of raw artemisinin a year, mostly in Asia, and the price had been steady for several years at about $115 a pound. 
 But immediately after the W.H.O.'s April forecast that the world would need 130 to 220 tons in 2005, the price rose to $180 a pound. It is now $365 to $455 a pound.
 Drug companies in Switzerland and India say they cannot get enough at any price, and blame is being directed at all corners.
 Mr. Lalvani, the Global Fund procurement specialist, said the refiners stopped selling this summer, ''waiting for the prices to stabilize or go higher.''
 Pradeep Nambiar, an executive at Ipca Laboratories, an Indian company, said that its Chinese suppliers had reneged on contracts and that he believed they could be ''holding back stock anticipating a price rise.''
 The most vivid evidence of the shortage emerged last Monday, when Novartis, a major Swiss drug company, said it could produce only about half of the 4.5 million courses of its Co-Artem drug that it had promised to deliver to the W.H.O. by March. Its lone artemisinin supplier in China had fallen short, it said.
 Co-Artem is the only malaria drug prequalified by the W.H.O., an endorsement of its safety. It also combines two drugs in one pill, making it harder for a patient to give away or sell part of a dose. 
 As a result, many poor countries, encouraged by donors and Novartis, specifically adopted Co-Artem. Now some, like Zambia and Ethiopia, will have their supplies rationed.
 Novartis has a 10-year contract to make its ''reasonable best effort'' to supply, at cost, all the Co-Artem the W.H.O. asks for. It had made a commitment to deliver 60 million doses by the end of 2005, but even its relatively small first batch will fall short. 
 Daniel Berman, a campaigner for lower drug prices at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, criticized Novartis, saying it had underestimated how much raw material it would need and had relied on one supplier. Daniela Currie, a Novartis spokeswoman, said the W.H.O. had made its forecast only after the 2004 crop was in the ground and some planned extraction plants were still not built. ''These are things we can't really influence,'' she said, adding that Novartis has now found two more suppliers.
 She said she had ''no evidence'' that the company's Chinese suppliers, who also make drugs that compete with Co-Artem, had cut it off in hopes of taking some of its market share now that the W.H.O. is under pressure to prequalify more drugs. 
 In conversations with visiting experts from two Western public health agencies, summaries of which were obtained by The New York Times, executives from several Chinese artemisinin refiners blamed their own suppliers for the sudden rise in prices. After the April meetings, they said, the word spread in China that the West wanted the drug. 
 Because of the artemisinin shortage, the W.H.O. now ranks several pills made in India and China that combine artemisinin with other drugs like amodiaquine and mefloquine as ''approved for procurement in the absence of prequalified product.''
 Plans are also afoot to grow wormwood in India, Tanzania and southern Africa. Some farmers have had trouble getting potent seeds, but Mr. Nambiar said Ipca had stockpiled them.
 Mr. Lalvani said he was worried. 
 ''For 2005, we're stuck,'' he said. ''But let's not be stuck for the year after that. We need to come up with a solution for this -- and right away.''

HEADLINE: Good Deed or Conspiracy?

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD 

 BODY:
ALONG Palisade Avenue and on side streets peppered with ethnic restaurants, chic shops and art galleries, the talk lately in this diverse community has been about downtown redevelopment efforts and the recent death of the school superintendent who had been setting up a rigorous academy system to attract more whites to a high school that was 94 percent black.
 Englewood, a town of 26,000 residents just three miles from the George Washington Bridge and home to some of Bergen County's wealthiest residents -- like the hip-hop singer Lil' Kim -- as well as some of the poorest, is a place of extremes.
 These days, it is receiving some unwanted attention because of charges that the town's police chief, judge and a police sergeant forged a phony document to release a prisoner -- serving a 364-day sentence on a drug conviction -- from the Bergen County jail for his father's funeral.
 For now, the three have entered not guilty pleas to the charges brought by the state attorney general last month -- tampering with public records and falsifying records -- that could result in as many as five years in prison. No one disputes that the chief, David Bowman, and the sergeant, Emma Jackson, who knew the inmate's family, accompanied him to the funeral home and church and stayed with him the entire time before returning him to jail. 
 But lawyers for the defendants, who were suspended from the jobs with pay pending the outcome of the case, contend that the three were performing a humanitarian act. 
 ''It's clear that this was not motivated by any personal gain,'' Mayor Michael J. Wildes said. ''Clearly the chief and the judge were trying to do what they perceived to be the right thing by a family that wanted a son to attend the father's funeral.''
 Many residents turned out at a recent council meeting to support the three. ''In my congregation, they love and respect the chief and the judge as well,'' said the Rev. Vernon Walton, pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church who is also a councilman. 
 For now, Mr. Wildes, an immigration lawyer and former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, is trying to cool people's emotions. ''Everyone will be given an opportunity to explain their conduct in a court of law,'' he said. ''Public servants need to be held to a higher standard.'' 
 According to Chief Bowman's lawyer, Robert L. Galantucci, Sergeant Thompson is a friend of the inmate's family, while his client is an acquaintance. Judge Clark has served on the bench in Englewood for 29 years. 
 It is not the first time that Mr. Bowman has found himself tangled in controversy since becoming police chief about five years ago. Two officers in the department brought separate suits against him, with one of them charging that he tipped off an illegal gambling operation. While the county prosecutor never found cause to pursue the case -- Mr. Galantucci said the suits had no merit and were brought by people who were unhappy about reassignments -- there was a $130,000 civil settlement. 
 In this instance, Mr. Galantucci said, an officer in the police department who had been reassigned by the chief and ''somebody'' in the municipal court system who ''had it in for the judge,'' tipped county and state prosecutors to the prisoner's release, but that only Attorney General Peter C. Harvey was motivated to prosecute the case because he has been overshadowed by United States Attorney Christopher Christie. 
 ''The attorney general is always criticized because he can't make any corruption cases,'' he said, ''and he's seen his chance here.'' 
 The state sees the situation differently, however.
 The three are accused of not following the proper protocol, which would have entailed requesting that a state judge approve the temporary release of an inmate who would wear handcuffs and prison garb and be accompanied by county sheriff's officers. 
 Instead, according to prosecutors, a fictitious warrant was drawn up stating that the inmate, Lloyd Fields, 24, was required to appear in Englewood Municipal Court on March 8 to answer shoplifting charges, even though March 8, 2003, was a Saturday -- a day when the court is normally closed -- and the shoplifting charge was false. 
 Although the incident has raised some eyebrows and prompted whispers of impropriety -- renewing questions of ethics in the police department during the chief's tenure -- there has been little public outcry. 
 Chatting with a friend on Palisade Avenue, one resident, Susan Stancil, put it this way: ''I mean the boy was doing wrong, the drugs and stuff. But I didn't see anything wrong with them getting him out of jail for his father's funeral.''

 BODY:
WHEN you're competing for the arts and entertainment dollar and find yourself geographically sandwiched between two of the country's leading cultural centers, New York and Philadelphia, resourcefulness in marketing is not only a virtue but a downright necessity.
 With its member theaters perpetually faced with this challenge, the New Jersey Theater Alliance a year ago last month started an initiative aimed at broadening the audience base of the state's 32 professional not-for-profit theaters that it represents, as well as 10 performing arts centers.
 The concept was deceptively simple: a Web site called njArtsTix.org, where heavily discounted tickets to a range of professional performing arts offerings around the state would be made available for Internet sale within 24 hours of a performance. But, simple as it is, it was and remains the only such statewide discount ticket Web site for the performing arts in the country. 
 According to John McEwen, executive director of the New Jersey Theater Alliance, the site had 1,000 visitors in its first month of operation, a number that had grown to more than 14,000 last month. And its birth and initial year of life seemingly couldn't have gone smoother. 
 ''We were all kind of shocked at how painless it was, how relatively few glitches there were,'' said Michael Dundon, director of audience services at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn. 
 What's probably most important as the Web site settles into its second year is that the vast majority of the participating theaters say that it is achieving exactly what it set out to do, which is to lure new ticket buyers to their productions without turning the full-price audience base that already exists into discount buyers. ''This is not selling to our regular audiences,'' Mr. Dundon said, noting that 80 percent of the njArtsTix.org sales are to newcomers to Paper Mill.
 Citing a similarly high percentage of new-customer sales, Kelly Ryman, director of marketing and public relations at George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, referred to it as an audience-development tool.
 ''It's bringing in people who thought theater was cost prohibitive,'' she said, ''or simply wasn't on their radar.'' 
 A few of her colleagues at other theaters who asked not to be identified, however, weren't so sure, saying that not-for-profit theaters are being hurt by the current economic and political climate, and that discounting in general has become a way of life that really hurts these organizations.
 But even those New Jersey theater professionals with concerns about the impact of possible larger socioeconomic trends applaud the efforts behind njArtsTix.org. In fact, the only significant difference of opinion swirls around the subject of whether the participating theaters should promote the Web site in their own theater programs as the Alliance asks them to do. 
 Mr. Dundon, whose theater advertises njArtsTix.org in its program, doesn't see a downside, saying Paper Mill is not dependent on the sale of these discount tickets, which are at least 25 percent and usually 50 percent off full price.
 ''It's truly meant to ease out deadwood,'' he said, indicating that a partly-paid-for seat is better than an empty one.

HEADLINE: The Newark Dream

BYLINE: By TERRY GOLWAY

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES the mention of a single word can conjure not just memories, but smells and sounds and sights and stories of a time that only the foolish would regard as long gone. 
 For thousands of Jews who lived in Newark during and immediately after World War II, that one word is Weequahic. Immortalized in Philip Roth's novels --most recently ''The Plot Against America'' -- Weequahic occupies a place in the nation's literary imagination as well as in the memories of those who strolled along Chancellor Avenue in the 40's, 50's and 60's.
 Yet a few miles northwest of Roth Country, in another part of Newark, the children and grandchildren of Catholic immigrants were playing their own parts in the drama known as the American Century. Their neighborhood was Vailsburg, in the westernmost part of Newark -- the only part of the city that jumps the artificial boundary known as the Garden State Parkway. 
 What Weequahic was to the Jews of Mr. Roth's generation, Vailsburg was to a mixture of Irish, Italian, German and Ukrainian immigrants and their children. Many of them had fled other parts of the city -- the Irish from Down Neck, the Italians from the 14th Ward. The breadwinners were police and firemen, operating engineers, brewery workers, Board of Education employees and, in the brick homes along Eastern Parkway, doctors, lawyers and dentists.
 Vailsburg was also home to Newark's governing elite, beginning with a prominent lawyer who went on to become a Supreme Court Justice, William Brennan, the son of an Irish immigrant and labor union organizer. Mayors like Vince Murphy and Leo Carlin and Hugh Addonizio lived in Vailsburg, along with countless members of the City Council and chairmen of the Essex County Democratic Party. Two future Democratic state chairmen, Ray Durkin and Thomas Giblin, grew up within shouting distance of each other. 
 And most were parishioners of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church on South Orange Avenue. 
 ''That church was the locus of life in Vailsburg,'' said State Supreme Court Justice James Zazzali, a Rumson resident who was born in the neighborhood in 1937 and lived there until his marriage in 1967. ''It was a classic immigrant church, and was the largest church in the city at the time.''
 In those years before the race riots of 1967, Vailsburg was the political capital of Newark, its influence felt in Newark City Hall as well as the State House in Trenton.
 ''It was very much a political culture,'' said Brendan O'Flaherty of Maplewood, a professor of economics and of international and public affairs at Columbia University who lived in Vailsburg from 1958 to 1994. ''It was the political hub of the city.''
 Over the years Vailsburg's political influence has waned, but its influence over its exiles has not. In less than two weeks, on Nov. 23, former Vailsburg residents will gather at Cryan's Beef and Ale House in South Orange -- a bar with its own Vailsburg roots -- for an annual reunion. That is in addition to the Vailsburg reunions held every winter by the Giblin Association, run by Mr. Giblin's family, and the Cryan Association, run by the tavern-owning family.
 The reunions this year will have a special significance, because Vailsburg is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its incorporation into greater Newark. It has existed as an independent town for 10 years, but was swallowed in the age of urban consolidation, the same impulse that led to the creation of greater New York in 1898 with the addition of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. 
 To commemorate the anniversary, Professor O'Flaherty and Ed Lewinson, a retired history professor at Seton Hall University, will give a talk on the neighborhood's history at Cryan's on Monday.
 In Mr. Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ''American Pastoral,'' the chapter on life in Weequahic during the post-war years is entitled, ''Paradise Remembered.'' That might well serve as the subtitle for the Vailsburg reunions coming up. ''It was very family-oriented,'' said Eileen Smith, a 65-year-old West Orange resident who attended Sacred Heart School and lived in Vailsburg's Ivy Hill Apartments in the 1960's. ''My parents never had a car. We walked everywhere, and it was safe. You could take a bus downtown and come back at night without having to worry about crime.''
 But it was not necessary to take a bus downtown, unless the excitement of Broad and Market Streets simply was irresistible. With two movie theaters, the Stanley and the Mayfair, a butcher, a clutch of 5-and-10-cent stores and a noteworthy collection of bars along South Orange Avenue, Vailsburg was a self-contained neighborhood. 
 And then there was that other form of entertainment. 
 Mrs. Smith served as vice president of one of the neighborhood's most active community organizations, the Young Democrats of Vailsburg. The president of the group at the time was Ray Durkin, who would go on to be chairman the Essex County Democrats and the state Democratic Party. Today, the 68-year-old Mr. Durkin remains a potent force in state politics. 
 ''But of all the titles I've had,'' he said, ''the one I valued most was president of the Young Democrats of Vailsburg. Everybody wanted that.''
 As late as the late 1950's and early 60's, life in Vailsburg -- with a population of 35,000, about the same as today -- seemed unchanged, even as highways like the Parkway and Interstates 78 and 280 opened up broad swaths of the state. Sacred Heart parish grew so big that a new parish, Immaculate Heart of Mary, was founded in the late 1950's on the Maplewood-Newark-Irvington border. Sacred Heart itself built a new school to relieve overcrowding. 
 And then the riots erupted in 1967. It would take some time for the residual effects of the violence to cross the Parkway, but by the mid-1970's flight was under way. It was more than just a reaction to urban disorder. ''Jobs were leaving the city,'' Mr. Giblin noted. And people followed.
 By the early 1980's, Sacred Heart ''was a shell of what it had once been in terms of numbers,'' said Drew Bauman, a Maplewood lawyer who served the parish as a priest from the late 1970's to 1982. 
 Still, the school somehow stayed open, and today the parish's current pastor is a young priest named Andrew Prachar, who grew up in Vailsburg and said he was inspired by people like Mr. Bauman. Father Prachar's assignment these days is in many ways more difficult that his predecessors -- he is fighting not only changes in the neighborhood, but changes in society as well. Sacred Heart no longer is the locus of Vailsburg, and the rich would-be patrons are scattered throughout the state.
 Still, the exiles do come back on occasion. Sometimes they return in a coffin for a funeral service in the old neighborhood. Other times, they help out at functions sponsored by the Unified Vailsburg Service Organization, which helps the community's poor. Or they turn out for reunions in the huge Sacred Heart school cafeteria.
 They are decades removed from the neighborhood, but not really. ''Growing up in Vailsburg really was a wonderful experience,'' said Justice Zazzali, ''and so many people who are products of the Vailsburg experience really regret that that their children didn't have that city experience.''
 But you can be sure that they have heard the stories.

HEADLINE: Finish the Revolution Without Me

BYLINE: By Michael Pye

 BODY:

THE STONE THAT THE BUILDER REFUSED
By Madison Smartt Bell.
747 pp. Pantheon Books. $29.95.
 YOUR standard 18th-century revolution comes with pictures to show what it all meant -- George Washington crossing the Delaware, the storming of the Bastille -- but not the other revolution, the one that turned the rich French slave colony of St. Domingue into the free, poor nation of Haiti. It was slave revolt, race war and colonial war all in one, more than 30 years of bloody murder. In books, it too often becomes a terrifying blur of violence, an awful warning; or else it is sanitized and simplified like many revolutions, turned into a tacky kind of ethnic inspiration in which we honor black slaves who made their own destiny and forget what actually happened. The greatest virtue of Madison Smartt Bell's extraordinary trilogy is that it has something powerful to do with reality.
 What Bell has given us -- in ''All Souls' Rising,'' ''Master of the Crossroads'' and now ''The Stone That the Builder Refused'' -- isn't just a single picture. It's a somber hall of narrative, full of dreams and horrors. It draws you along like any authentic history, day by terrible day, nerve ends raw because you have no sense of an author ready to intervene to save his characters. And despite a few tics that are only apparent when you read all three books together -- a bit too much merely exotic voodoo; too many mosquitoes ''crumbled''; too many images, like centipedes crawling out of the eye socket of a corpse, that seem too close to horror flicks -- it has its own strange authenticity. Atrocities that open the trilogy, page after page of them, now generate their own suspense in this final volume, as dreams, hallucinations or plain memory.
 The scale alone is extraordinary. But any fool can write 2,000 pages; that just takes time. What is truly impressive is the energy and concentration, right to the very end. Almost every moment is full, like some great narrative painting, alive with the detail that puts you on the road or in the house where some murder or meeting is about to happen. And almost every moment is imagined thoroughly. Late in this last volume, a sentry is killed on the front line, which is an ordinary enough event; but in Bell's supple, exact prose, the man's face changes as he falls -- because he's been beheaded from behind and his body seems to step forward to reveal his killer, giving battle its full, hallucinatory force.
 There are dozens of characters running through Bell's trilogy, but only two who organize his stories. Dr. Hebert, a Frenchman, carries the burden of optimism in what can sometimes seem a relentlessly grim story. Toussaint L'Ouverture is a coachman at the start; he is, as one character observes, the classic ''good'' black on whom the planter classes rely. Toussaint becomes a rebel chief who wishes to ''show the white people what we are . . . and also what we are not.'' The times change him into a revolutionary who turns against Christ, riding into a church to burn it, a leader who writes, ''I am prepared to sacrifice my children to my color.'' The slave metamorphoses into the myth: the leader on a great white war horse, emerging ''through a wreath of fire.''
 Toussaint is Bell's hero. He is a man who, as Dr. Hebert puts it midway through the trilogy, ''has worked for peace, in the main, and . . . has rendered justice wherever he was able.'' Bell loves Toussaint's virtues -- insisting that he fought for freedom and knew ''how to face death to keep it''; emphasizing his skill with healing herbs, his personal loyalty to his wife and children, his rather modern distaste for tobacco -- but he saves the man from becoming an icon. He even allows one strand of his plot to turn on the puritanical Toussaint's rumored flings with the white ladies.
 Toussaint's ambiguities are what keep him alive in our minds. He is sometimes famously merciful, but he is also a general whose armies use massacre as a tactic. He's welcomed to Port-au-Prince by ''young white women with flowers in their hands,'' but his commanders slaughter whole white populations -- Toussaint, as someone remarks, ''prefers not to bloody his own hands'' -- and in the end he slashes and burns an entire country to show the invading French Army ''the image of the hell which they deserve.''
 Toussaint fought for liberty for slaves and then sent them back to the plantations as conscript labor, forbade them to travel without permits, banned the whip even though his deputy Dessalines continued to punish miscreants with brutal bundles of thorny vines. ''It had been the same,'' Bell lets one ex-slave complain, ''in slavery time.'' In Bell's fiction, Toussaint is recognizably the man who, in one historian's view, ''sought to all intents and purposes to restore slavery with his Creole colleagues as masters and managers'' and ''hoped for power within the imperial system.'' Africans, naturally, disagreed.
 Yet Bell's Toussaint goes into exile warning the French that ''when you faced me, you faced one leader. When you removed me, you would face 500,000.'' These books, most remarkably, tell the exhilarating tale of how those 500,000 came alive as armies, capable of routing the fever-ridden French, when once they had been only living corpses, zombies to be sold into bondage. We know the story did not end well -- Haiti's economic ruin brought even more African slaves across the Atlantic, this time to Brazil, and gave the English excellent arguments against freeing their own slaves -- but we can ride the surge of hope and passion for a while.
 That is where Dr. Hebert comes in. If the books show Toussaint emerging as a leader, they also show the doctor going mercifully blind to race: a white man at Toussaint's side, as a healer rather than a fighter, who starts to call the French forces ''les blancs'' and asks himself, ''What had he become himself?,'' Hebert is a man who has ''forgotten that he was blanc, had come near to forgetting himself entirely.'' He's Toussaint's pupil in the matter of bush medicine, sometimes Toussaint's secretary and physician, a constant witness to battles and burning; and, at the end, when it comes to the matter of who will count as a citizen of Haiti, he is declared neg, or black, a citizen. He is our ambassador as much to the primping world of the colonial whites as to the world of Creoles, mulattoes and African blacks.
 In part because of him, we see a rather bleached view of Haiti. Africans in Bell's novels don't organize by nation, as they did in reality, and what we see of the planters' brutality is the arbitrary, willful kind, not the viciousness that was built into the system. The detailed intimacy of the whites is shadowed by the sketchy connections between the novel's black men and women; we know more about the marriage of the French general Leclerc and his flighty wife, with her grand connections as Napoleon's sister, than we ever do about Toussaint and his Suzanne. And history seems to stop when Toussaint -- our hero, our mediator -- dies.
 But that's a historian's objection. As fiction, these books do what novels are meant to do: they propose their own vivid and inexorable history.

HEADLINE: Of Growing Interest: How Green Is My Mountain?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SKIING at the great resorts of the West is one of those ruddy-cheeked, wind-whistling-through-the-trees activities that tend to make people misty-eyed about the natural world. 
 But environmentalists have complained for years that most resorts don't share the sentiment. Immense competitive pressures to add new slopes and chairlifts, and the trend toward four-season activities and real-estate development that bring more people, more months of the year, have significantly heightened environmental stresses, they say.
 Partly in response to such criticism, in 2000 the industry developed a voluntary environmental program called Sustainable Slopes, which now involves more than 170 resorts in North America. Under the Sustainable Slopes Program, resorts are encouraged to audit themselves under 21 criteria, from water and energy use to waste management and air quality. 
 But such voluntary environmental efforts have now themselves become a thorny issue for the industry, inviting questions about what is real and what is mere image cultivation.
 ''They've talked the talk, but they have not walked the walk,'' said Peter de Leon, a professor of public policy at the University of Colorado in Denver and an author of a sharply critical study of Sustainable Slopes published in August in Policy Studies Journal. 
 Dr. de Leon and his co-author, Jorge Rivera, of George Washington University, concluded that voluntary environmentalism without any outside monitoring was likely to be superficial and inadequate. 
 ''Members appear to be displaying free-riding behavior, expecting to improve their 'green' reputation without actually implementing it,'' the study said. ''Opportunistic ski areas may be expecting to pre-empt more stringent regulatory oversight.'' 
 The study, perhaps because its dry academic tone and peer-reviewed pedigree was so different from the usual environmental attack, struck a nerve. The resort industry's trade group, the National Ski Areas Association, published a lengthy rebuttal last month in its own journal, lambasting the report in part for using a source that the industry considers suspect: a citizens' group that grades resorts on environmental issues, but that, like Sustainable Slopes, isn't assessed independently, either.
 Professor de Leon said in an interview that the industry critique -- especially the point that his study was based on the early days of Sustainable Slopes, when efforts were still ramping up -- had inspired him and his partner to take a second look at the program, which they are working on now.
 Environmentalists and economists say that genuinely green ski resorts do exist. Sundance in Utah, Mount Bachelor in Oregon and Aspen in Colorado all usually get high marks. Environmentalists say that Aspen in particular has led the industry in areas like environmentally green building construction and energy use reduction. But a green cachet doesn't come cheap -- at $74 for a day pass, Aspen is one of the priciest resorts in the nation. A day at Mount Bachelor costs $46, while a full day weekend pass at Sundance is $40. 
 Resort companies that have often gotten low marks from environmentalists -- especially Vail, which operates four ski areas in Colorado and one in Lake Tahoe, Nev. -- say that the market itself is now pushing the industry toward better practices with or without programs like Sustainable Slopes. Rising costs are encouraging better efforts in energy, water and waste management, they say. ''Financial success and environmental stewardship do not need to be mutually exclusive,'' said Kelly Ladyga, a spokeswoman for Vail Resorts. ''They're intermingled. But we're undertaking these efforts regardless of any study or scorecard.''
 At Whistler/Blackcomb in British Columbia, resort managers say they have reduced solid waste output by 50 percent over the last six years and are now concentrating on energy savings, with a 20 percent reduction target this year alone. 
 ''It's not only good for the environment, but the business at the same time,'' said Doug Forseth, the resort's senior vice president for operations.
 But economists who study the tourism industry say that many resorts still rely on superficial symbols, like recycling bins and low-flow toilets, without really addressing the deeper issues of habitat protection and water and air quality.
 ''Ski area operators are concerned about environmental impacts only to the degree that they might get in trouble with skiers,'' said Thomas M. Power, chairman of the Economics Department at the University of Montana, in Missoula. Professor Power cautioned against nostalgia about the smaller-scale resorts of the past. He remembers, he said, skiing past the pipe that dumped raw sewage into a creek near one Montana resort in the 60's.
 And skiers themselves ultimately dictate what happens at the resorts, environmentalists say. If skiers expect new slopes and chairlifts every year, then expansion -- with all its environmental impact -- will be the order of the day.
 ''They vote with their feet,'' said Ms. Ladyga at Vail. She said that Ski Magazine's readers, for example, had recently ranked Vail as the top resort in North America for the third consecutive year. The failing grades on environmental performance issued earlier this year to three of the company's resorts, including Vail itself, by a group called the Ski Area Citizens' Coalition, an environmental group in Durango, Colo., have drawn only a handful of questions from prospective visitors, Ms. Ladyga said.

HEADLINE: Can't Sleep? Change Towns, Not Sheets

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IS downtown Detroit industrial America's answer to the Roman Forum, a haunting necropolis of ruins of the industrial age? Or is it an urban comeback in the making, the Boston Red Sox of American cities?
 I had no shortage of time to ponder those and other ethereal questions as I tossed and turned in bed one night last week, for the simple reason that for me Detroit was an iffy place to get a night of sleep. And sleep was the reason I was there in the first place.
 I had gone there after reading the results of a report called ''Sleep in the City'' -- one of the many that rank American cities as best, worst or in between -- that called Detroit the worst of 50 metropolitan areas in the United States for getting a good night's rest. It was a dubious distinction, certainly, but in one sense it also placed Detroit in the vanguard of life in America, where more and more people seem to get less and less rest. The National Sleep Foundation estimates that 60 percent of adults have trouble sleeping at least a few nights a week. New sleep-related crises are continually being declared: one recent study insists that millions of Americans go untreated for ''restless leg syndrome.'' (The study was financed by a company that makes a drug for the condition.) 
 Insomnia is sometimes described unscientifically as epidemic, and it even seems that sleeplessness is almost chic these days: look no further than Christian Bale's coolly existential performance as a man who has been sleep-deprived for a year in the new film ''The Machinist.'' If the 1990's were the decade of ''Listening to Prozac,'' when an antidepressant became a cultural as well as a medical phenomenon, the current decade might be one of listening to Ambien, the best-selling sleeping pill in a market estimated at $1.5 billion a year.
 ''One of the big causes of insomnia is stress,'' said Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a former president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and now a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba. ''Right now in the United States, there is a lot of stress for various reasons: the election, the war in Iraq, the economy. People are watching the news constantly, and most of it is bad.''
 Detroit has no shortage of stress inducers. Its rates of poverty and crime and divorce were all factors in its ranking at the bottom of the new sleep report, which was compiled by a company called Sperling's BestPlaces, in partnership with the makers of Ambien.
 The report was based on a collation of a broad array of data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies. It concluded that the chief factor in getting a good night's sleep is also one of the most abstract and elusive: happiness. ''What we found was that, almost in exact correlation, the more sleep people got, the better they felt physically and emotionally: basically feeling happy,'' said Bert Sperling, the president of Sperling's BestPlaces, best known for its ''best places to live'' reports for Money magazine. ''We can't go ahead and say good sleep makes you happy or that being happy makes you sleep better, but we do know that there's some correlation between the two. It is a measure of quality of life.''
 The reasons for Detroit's poor showing are familiar: the contraction of the automobile industry, for example, and the decline of the population by roughly 50 percent over the past half century. In April, after another quasi-scientific report in Men's Fitness magazine named Detroit the nation's fattest city, Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick began a yearlong health education program called Movement for Life. 
 ''We're No. 1 in sleep, too?'' Pamela Moore, a coordinator for the program, said with a chuckle, after learning of the sleep-deprivation report. She added that Movement for Life had already planned to focus on sleep and stress management beginning in January. 
 But there is another side to Detroit as well, a city whose downtown is being slowly rebuilt. Comerica Park, the splashy home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, opened in 2000, followed quickly by a Hard Rock Cafe. Nearby stands the new Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions football team and the 2006 Super Bowl. Residential lofts are starting to fill in some of the vacant skyscrapers.
 ''I sleep incredibly well,'' Jeanette Pierce, 24, a waitress at a restaurant in the downtown section known as Greektown, insisted a bit defiantly. On Monday night, Ms. Pierce was mingling with friends at the Beaubien Street Saloon near the gleaming Renaissance Center office tower. ''I can sleep through anything, and you have to with all this construction going on.''
 In Detroit, everything has edge: the music, the hockey fans, even the bed-and-breakfasts. I stayed in a charming one called the Inn on Ferry Street, comprising four regentrified Queen Anne-style mansions (and two carriage houses) so meticulously restored and quaint that they looked like a Bob Vila fantasy. Not long ago, they were rundown eyesores.
 Maybe that edge, in some small way, has something to with the apparent restlessness in the city. Even a casual visitor like me is hit immediately with a broadside of conflicting emotions: anxiety, exhilaration, wistfulness, hope.
 Even as a resident of frenetic New York -- which ranked only five notches higher than Detroit, just above New Orleans and below Las Vegas -- I found it a potent brew. I was still stirred up when I finally drifted off to sleep around 2 a.m.
ALTHOUGH the news media sometimes describe insomnia as epidemic, that is imprecise. Insomnia is a sleep disorder, an inability to fall asleep or stay asleep when one wants to; it becomes severe or chronic when it persists for several nights a week and months on end.
 ''Sleep deprivation'' can refer either to insomnia or to the more common problem that results when people try to squeeze too much into the day. There is often a vast gray area between the two, Dr. Kryger said. Even so, he said, the number of sufferers in both camps are huge: 40 million to 80 million in the United States. Like many other experts, Dr. Kryger maintains that the problem is getting worse, particularly as people embrace new technologies that help wring more play and more work out of each day.
 Another reason that more people seem to suffer from sleeplessness is simply that far more attention is being paid to the issue by both doctors and patients, said Michael L. Perlis, the director of the Sleep and Neurophysiology Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester.
 One reason for the new concern is that, increasingly, sleeplessness is seen by physicians as a possible contributor to afflictions like depression and hypertension. As recently as the 1970's, Dr. Perlis said, most sleepless Americans tended to suffer in silence, or perhaps to drop the occasional barbiturate like Tuinal, which could be habit-forming.
 ''The bottom line is, I don't care if it's an epidemic,'' Dr. Perlis said. ''Too many people have this problem. It's a wrong perspective to say, 'If you can't sleep, tough.' Treatment is available.''
 Short of prescription sleeping pills -- newer ones are generally considered by experts safer than drugs from earlier decades -- many other products and services have been introduced to appeal to a nation in search of shut-eye.
 Doctors continue to pioneer subniches in sleep research and often process their research into self-help sleep books. Hundreds of sleep treatment clinics exist across the United States.
IN response to surveys indicating that half of business travelers complained that they did not get enough sleep on the road, the Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts chain introduced the ''sleep advantage'' program, putting cushier pillows and mattress tops on beds, designating some floors as quiet zones from Sunday through Thursday and even providing a ''sleep CD'' of soothing jazz and Bach in the player by the bed.
 So I checked into the Crowne Plaza hotel in downtown Minneapolis, which the report ranked No. 1 for getting a good night's sleep. This is a city that takes its sleep seriously: in 1997 it pushed back high school starting times to 8:40 a.m. from 7:15, citing research that teenagers needed to sleep in to do well academically and stay healthy.
 Last year Minnesota changed closing times for bars to 2 a.m. from 1 a.m., to little interest. ''Only about 10 percent of the bars followed,'' said Jeremy Kummings, a manager at Murray's restaurant and cocktail lounge in Minneapolis. ''Usually it'll be last call by midnight.''
 Maybe it was the first chill of winter on the hotel window, but I wasn't thinking of anything so much as the word ''hibernation'' in my night there. I slept well in part because I felt secure and enveloped in those silky white sheets. Then again, I felt wonderfully secure and enveloped when I wandered outside, too.
 That's the odd thing about Minneapolis: it's entirely possible to live life at a perfect 72 degrees, an oasis in snowdrift country. Yes, the natives are quick to point out that they are an ''outdoors'' people -- Patagonia jackets are everywhere -- but they are smart enough to keep the outdoors out when it doesn't suit them. Much of downtown is connected by its network of glassy skyways linking office buildings. It's a human Habitrail, a city reimagined as a cocoon from the elements.
 ''Minneapolis is renowned for having a balanced lifestyle: people are into exercise and nutrition here,'' said Bill McLaughlin, president and chief executive of Select Comfort, a Minneapolis company that makes the Sleep Number bed, whose firmness is adjustable at a button's touch.
 And that -- balance -- appears to be the secret ingredient behind the happiness behind good sleep. ''People in Minneapolis have a very good sense of who they are,'' Mr. Sperling said. ''They aren't subject to vast booms or busts -- maybe by being isolated from either coast and the frenzy that goes on there -- the winds of change. They have a sense of taking care of their own business and people.''
 The whole idea is to find the porridge that's just right.
 Dr. Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, concurred. ''Generally, if you're feeling pleasant and satisfied you're going to sleep better, and Minneapolis is a pretty stress-free city,'' he said. ''I don't know what that says about Detroit,'' he added with a chuckle. ''But I'd rather sleep in Minneapolis.''

 BODY:

THE SMILING PREACHER: ''Think big. Think increase. Think abundance. Think more than enough.'' That's not Dr. Atkins telling you how much bacon and cheddar you can pound down on his counterintuitive diet. That's America's hottest young pastor, Joel Osteen, explaining in his new book, ''Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential,'' that God does not want you to be poor. Osteen's book is at No. 5 on this week's hardcover advice, how-to and miscellaneous list. Osteen, who is 41, runs the Lakewood Church in Houston, which in the last five years has become America's largest church -- some 25,000 people attend services there each weekend. His television show, seen in 150 countries, reaches millions more. Osteen definitely thinks increase: he plans to move his church into the Compaq Center, formerly home to the Houston Rockets, sometime next year -- after he has fitted it out with twin waterfalls. Osteen describes Lakewood as ''a nondenominational charismatic church.'' There's no fire-and-brimstone here, or in his book. Osteen has become known as ''the Smiling Preacher,'' and among the themes he hits regularly is the need to shed your ''poverty mentality.'' Having trouble at work? ''God may intervene in your situation,'' Osteen writes, ''replacing your supervisor so you can be promoted. One day, you may run that entire company!''

THE GROWLING COMIC: Joel Osteen's book is available at Wal-Mart. George Carlin's new one -- it is titled ''When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?'' -- is not. (The company ''didn't believe this particular product would appeal'' to its customer base, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman told The New York Post.) Nonetheless, Carlin's book is at No. 4 on the nonfiction list this week. Carlin has been around for a long time; he's released 18 comedy albums over the course of his career. But it's only in the last few years that he's begun issuing books, three in all, and all three have made the Times list. Carlin's books are hit-and-miss collections of his acid comic riffs, and he sprays fire in all directions. But ''When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?'' zeroes in with particular glee on religious pieties. (Carlin notes conservative politicians' fondness for the phrase ''faith-based initiative'' before adding, ''The destruction of the World Trade Center was a faith-based initiative.'') In George Carlin and Joel Osteen, extremes can sometimes meet. Osteen would never be in favor of abolishing the Tenth Commandment, as Carlin is. But Carlin's rationale chimes with Osteen's upbeat pro-capitalist message. ''Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going,'' Carlin writes. ''Coveting creates jobs. Leave it alone.'' Dwight Garner

HEADLINE: McGreevey's Dramatic Exit Leaves a Blustery Cast in the Wings

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Jersey City 

 BODY:
SO Gov. James E. McGreevey finally steps down after trading Machiavelli for Aeschylus (''In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart'') in the most tortured governor's valedictory ever.
 And Richard J. Codey, who has already pledged to work for a new Giants Stadium and racetrack video lottery terminals, takes over on Tuesday as governor, fittingly perhaps, planning to spend part of his first day visiting the Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.
 After the presidential election and Mr. McGreevey's operatic meltdown, the good news for New Jersey Democrats is that the political season has finally ended for a while. The bad news is that it's for a very short while. 
 In fact, as they finally finished counting the votes in the mayoral election here, the really bad news was that every politician in New Jersey and his or her dog were already circling one another in a game of political chicken that will combine the post-McGreevey era with the post-Bush-Kerry era.
 Next year is an off year almost everywhere but in New Jersey, where the race for the nation's most powerful governor's job will be dissected for whatever trends anyone can divine. (New York elects its mayor, but no one even pretends you can divine any national trends from that one.)
 On the Democratic side, of course, the big question is whether United States Senator Jon S. Corzine will decide that being King of New Jersey is more rewarding than playing perpetual second fiddle to Republican senators from Alabama and Mississippi. If he does, the betting seems to be that Mr. Codey will stay in the race and run against him. They may be joined by United States Representative Robert E. Andrews since the only thing worse than being a senator from the minority party is being a representative from the minority party.
 On the Republican side is a cast of thousands. There are old faces being retrofitted and repositioned. Douglas Forrester, who lost the 2002 Senate race against Frank R. Lautenberg, is going mano a mano against Dan Rather in ads calling for him to retire, a move that can't hurt his conservative credentials. Bret Schundler, who lost the 2001 governor's race to Mr. McGreevey, is now brandishing the banner of reform. His campaign centers on proposed constitutional amendments that would direct money from the state to local governments and schools, with spending limits to reduce property taxes. Odds are he'll promote that more conspicuously than the conservative values that Mr. McGreevey beat him up on three years ago. 
 From his mighty pulpit as mayor of Bogota (that's New Jersey, not Colombia), Steve Lonegan is already lobbing shells at Mr. Schundler from the right, saying that no sooner did Mr. Schundler get the nomination last time than he jumped into bed with the party's too-moderate dead-enders. (''It was as if we invaded Baghdad, and let Saddam Hussein remain in charge,'' harrumphed Rick Shaftan, an adviser to Mr. Lonegan.) There's John Murphy, an ambitious freeholder from Morris County; Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano of North Jersey; the businessman Robert Schroeder of Bergen County; and perhaps United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie and others. Everyone knows you have to lose a few times before you can win, so there's no harm trying.
 IN a state where government is the only recession-proof business, and governor is the only position in Trenton elected statewide, you'll never have a shortage of candidates.
 And when Mr. McGreevey bowed out, it created the most wide open race since 1989. When President Bush picked up 300,000 more votes in New Jersey than he did four years ago -- his biggest percentage improvement in any state -- it made New Jersey look a good bit less blue. 
 Both parties have more than jobs and patronage at stake. For floundering Democrats, losing New Jersey's governorship in next year's most conspicuous race would be disastrous. For national Republicans, creating a new star in the Northeast out of someone like Mr. Schundler or Mr. Christie would be a godsend.
 And both parties also have a lot to prove and overcome.
 Mr. McGreevey's departure may have largely defused the Republicans' best issue: the ripples of corruption that kept lapping at his heels. But Mr. Codey or Mr. Corzine has to find a way to remind voters that Democrats stand for something other than the mess that is the state's government at the moment.
 Republicans have to prove that the party has something to offer beyond the values-laden issues that made Mr. Bush a winner in the South and the Midwest and a loser in the Northeast and on the West Coast. They have to find someone who has enough appeal to the party's conservative base to be nominated and enough appeal to the rest of the state to be elected.
 Both parties have a lot to figure out.

HEADLINE: Despite Skepticism and Criticism, New York Olympics Can Succeed

BYLINE: By PETER V. UEBERROTH. 
Peter V. Ueberroth is the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee and was the president of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.

 BODY:
Tomorrow, New York will submit its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games to the International Olympic Committee, and next July, in Singapore, the I.O.C. will decide. After seeing Athens stage a superb Olympics despite criticism and doubters, and after seeing how the people of Athens embraced the Olympic family, I am confident that New York can win the Games with its remarkable plan and talented leadership. 
 Twenty years ago in Los Angeles, we were faced with numerous challenges in staging the Summer Games, including a boycott by the Soviet Union and more than a dozen other Soviet-bloc nations. But the Games succeeded, as did the Athens Games, because of the determination of the city's leadership and its people. From everything I have seen, all this can happen again in New York in 2012. 
 New York's Olympic bid is superb in every area. Its plan centers on the athletes, who will stay in a stunning Olympic Village across the East River from the United Nations. New York offers them the largest stage of their lives and the best resources and environment. The plan achieves technical excellence in addressing the Olympic requirements for competition sites, transportation and housing. 
 The NYC2012 plan also meets the critical I.O.C. requirement that the sites have a specific use after the Games and that major construction projects be clearly related to the city's long-term plans. This includes the construction of the Olympic Village, which will become a new neighborhood in Queens; the restoration of the historic 369th Regiment Armory as a multiuse community facility; the creation of a waterfront park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; the transformation of polluted lakes in Queens; and the development of an equestrian center on Staten Island. 
 Every aspect of NYC2012's plan will add to the quality of life for future generations of New Yorkers and leave one of the most impressive legacies of any Olympic host. 
 Being host of the Games offers a city the chance to develop needed projects that would ordinarily take much longer to complete. New York's bid emphasizes a rebirth of its waterfront and the development of the West Side, anchored by the New York Sports and Convention Center, which will serve as an inspiring Olympic Stadium, then contribute to New York's economy. This is the type of forward-looking thinking for a city's growth that the I.O.C. admires. 
 I have been impressed by the ways that New York's plan will contribute to the development of sport, the quality of life and the richness of New York's diverse communities. For New York and the nation, we will have new facilities for cycling, rowing, sailing, swimming and canoeing-kayaking, in addition to multiuse arenas for sports like fencing, badminton, judo and wrestling. Not to be discounted is NYC2012's plan for the involvement of more than 1,700 Olympians and Paralympians.
 We faced numerous challenges in Los Angeles after we were awarded the Games in 1978. There was opposition from community and interest groups. But more vociferous were the skeptics and naysayers, including some of the leading local news media, right up until the start of the Games. Traffic would be horrendous, they said. It wasn't. Finances would be disastrous, they warned. We turned a profit. In the end, we managed to stage a Games that made the millions of Los Angeles area residents and Americans proud. It's no different in New York. It's probably inevitable. But the city's leadership also has the persistence to complete the task.
 New York, one of the world's friendliest cities, has great assets as a host because it has residents who share the culture of every international athlete, coach and official, and every visitor to the Games. New York's spirit is much like the Olympic arena, where dreams are realized through hard work and opportunity. 
 New York also offers the Olympic movement an outstanding combination of marketing, financial and media power that can help the Games achieve a new level of global prominence. And New York's leadership has demonstrated its ability to harness this power as part of its bid.
 Next year, I believe most I.O.C. members will make their decision based on how sport, the athletes and the Olympic movement will be best served, not on a global popularity contest. New York's bid stands tall in each of those categories.
 There is much to be proud of in New York's endeavors, and there is a real opportunity to win something that will be another jewel in the crown of this unique and wonderful city. The process is intense and will be highly competitive. There will be rumors and speculation, alleged experts opining, and moments of doubt. But I am now certain, based on all my Olympic experience, that New York City can win the 2012 Olympic Games.

HEADLINE: A Hot Market Keeps Getting Hotter

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
GOOD gracious, imagine what houses will be selling for 10 years from now!'' exclaimed Jo Falcone, a real estate agent in White Plains, commenting on the record high median sales price for a single-family home in Westchester. ''Every year, we think the bubble is going to break, but it doesn't,'' said Mrs. Falcone, who works for Century 21 Wolff. ''The prices just keep going up and up.''
 According to data from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, the median price for a single-family home in Westchester soared to $686,000 in the third quarter, which ended on Sept. 30. That was 16.6 percent higher than the corresponding three months in 2003, when the median price was $588,250. 
 The latest figure tops Westchester's previous median price record of $660,000, which was set during the second quarter of this year.
 Riffling through listing sheets of houses that sold in July through September, Mrs. Falcone plucked one out of the stack and offered it as example of the stunning level of the current market. 
 The listing was a late-1950's split-level with three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms on slightly more than a quarter acre in White Plains. The house fetched $699,000 in early September. 
 ''I've been in this business for 20 years, and I never imagined that a split like this would go for so much money,'' she said. ''Here we are, almost at $700,000.'' 
 That same split-level home, according to Mrs. Falcone, would have sold for $125,000 to $150,000 in the early 1980's, when she began working as a residential broker in the county. Based on the rate that the overall cost of living has risen in the New York region, a house selling for $150,000 in 1980 would be expected to go for less than $370,000 now. 
 Not only has the median sales price for single-family homes soared, but sharp increases were registered in all categories of homes during the third quarter of 2004. The median price for a condominium reached $349,000, up 15.2 percent from a year earlier. For two- to five-family houses, the median was up 16.6 percent, to $495,000.
 The largest percentage increase, 27.2 percent, occurred in Westchester's co-op sector, where the median climbed by $34,000 from a year ago to a new high of $159,000. 
 About 25 percent of Westchester's single-family sales were for $1 million or more in the third quarter, up three percentage points from the second quarter of 2004. And 18 percent of the houses sold for $750,000 to $1 million.
 THE pace of sales activity -- as measured by the number of closings of properties -- was robust for all types of housing.
 Reaching its highest level in five years, the total number of closings in the third quarter was 3,267, the most for any quarter since the third quarter of 1999, when there were 3,359 closings. Real estate professionals say the third-quarter closings largely reflect marketing and sales activity that took place in the second quarter, April through June. Over all, 2004's third quarter sales volume was 6 percent more than last year's. 
 The Listing Service attributed the robust market to low interest rates for mortgages and favorable job conditions. At the end of October, when the report was issued, Westchester's unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage stood at an average of 5.84 percent for the area. 
 ''The late spring and early summer months provided a good environment for pumping up the local real estate market,'' the report said. It also noted that interest rates ''have not yet embarked on the climb that was anticipated to commence nearly a year ago.''
 Greg Rand, managing partner of Prudential Rand Realty, which has offices throughout Westchester, observed that while consumer confidence about the overall economy may be somewhat shaky, confidence in housing as an investment has been strong. He described ''a massive migration of wealth moving from Wall Street and banking investment vehicles'' toward investment in real estate, because of the volatility of stocks and bonds and their relatively low recent returns.
 But John Russell, a sales agent at Prudential Holmes & Kennedy's office in Chappaqua, is more restrained. Noting that the recent report reflects offers accepted earlier in the year, he said the market has slowed. ''There are definitely not as many buyers, and the ones there are seem willing to wait until they find the right house at the right price,'' Mr. Russell said. ''Sellers shouldn't expect that their houses are going to keep rising sharply up in value.''
 Meanwhile, the inventory of homes on the market has dropped, as it often does when sales are strong. For all categories of homes, inventory was down to 4,952, from 5,250 at the end of the second quarter. Nevertheless, the latest inventory level was 8.9 percent higher than the level of a year earlier. The listing service attributed the increase to homeowners who had previously hesitated but finally decided to put their homes on the market to take advantage of strong demand and high prices. 
 Based on the performance of the market so far this year, the listing service predicted that 2004 might challenge 1999 for the highest number of annual sales. At the end of September, 7,723 sales had been posted in Westchester this year, just 142 fewer than the number sold during the equivalent period in 1999.

HEADLINE: New Life for a 1964 Film

BYLINE: By VICKI VASILOPOULOS

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
MICHAEL ROEMER has lived here in a small house on a tree-lined street for 44 years. Since 1966, he has commuted a couple of times a week to New Haven, where he is an adjunct professor of film and American studies at Yale University. But Mr. Roemer, 76, is also a part of film history.
 In 1963, when he was 35, he directed ''Nothing but a Man,'' a feature film about a black man in Alabama whose marriage unravels as he finds it increasingly harder to earn a livelihood and maintain his dignity in the Jim Crow South. 
 The film, released in 1964, was a pioneer effort on several levels. Independently made, when many movies of the time were still the product of the studio system, it concerns the contemporary life of blacks, a subject that few studios were willing to tackle. At the same time, it was written, directed and produced by whites. And although the story inevitably lends itself to political interpretation, the film is free of rhetoric, and is distinguished by a naturalistic visual style, almost like a documentary.
 ''Nothing but a Man'' won two prizes at the Venice Film Festival and was well received at the New York Film Festival. The Nation of Islam newspaper, Muhammad Speaks, endorsed it. But unlike ''Lilies of the Field,'' a studio film of the era that starred Sidney Poitier, it fared poorly at the box office. 
 Nearly 30 years later, in 1993, the film was rereleased theatrically to wide acclaim. The Washington Post called it ''one of the most sensitive films about black life ever made in this country.'' The movie was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1994. This fall, a 40th-anniversary DVD came out.
 To Mr. Roemer, who said he did not make a profit from the movie until its rerelease, the late success of ''Nothing but a Man'' is sweet.
 ''I'm slightly out of sync with my own time,'' he said in an interview in his cozy living room here. 
 Mr. Roemer was born in Berlin in 1928. At 11, he was sent to England to escape the Nazi regime. In 1945, he came to the United States, where he attended Harvard. 
 After college, he began working for the independent producer Louis de Rochemont. He wrote the screenplay for ''Nothing but a Man'' with Robert Young, a classmate from Harvard who had made documentaries. Mr. Young was also the cinematographer on the movie. 
 While Mr. Young was interested in the civil rights struggle of the era, and had made a documentary for NBC on the sit-in movement, Mr. Roemer wanted to explore an intimate story of a marriage set against the backdrop of the economic effects of racism. Neither thought the film should be overtly political.
 ''We thought that the most powerful, useful political statement would be a human one,'' Mr. Roemer said. 
 He added that in writing the script, he drew on his experience of growing up as a Jew in Nazi Germany with its attendant economic deprivation.
 ''My family was fairly well to do and everything got taken away from them,'' he said. ''I think I understood what it's like to be robbed of the ability to support your family. It certainly happened to my grandfather and my father. If you're unemployed you don't feel like you're a man, at least my generation didn't. That's not black; that's all of us.''
 With the help of the N.A.A.C.P., the filmmakers traveled the South for three months researching their script. They narrowly escaped the race riots in Oxford, Miss., that erupted after a black student tried to register at the University of Mississippi, Mr. Roemer said.
 ''Bob and I were completely fearless, which was a bit stupid,'' he recalled. ''People were killed for doing nothing.''
 The film was shot around Atlantic City and Cape May, N.J., in the summer of 1963 on a budget of $230,000. Everyone on the crew was paid $100 a week. Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln played the couple. They and the rest of the cast took a day off to march on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. The filmmakers finished production when the church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., made headlines. 
 The soundtrack features music from Stevie Wonder, the Marvelettes and Martha and the Vandellas. The rights were procured for $5,000 from Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records. ''That was pure luck,'' Mr. Roemer said.
 He explained that Mr. Gordy's lawyer, George Schiffer, was his college classmate, and that his office was around the corner from where Mr. Roemer worked on the editing of ''Nothing but a Man.''
 ''I went down to have lunch with him,'' Mr. Roemer said, ''and he said: 'I just started representing a small record company in Detroit. Maybe you'd like to hear their music?' I went back to his office with him and he handed me a stack of these 45's.''
 Mr. Roemer recalled his reaction: ''I said, 'This stuff is great!''' 
 Mr. Roemer said that today ''for a white filmmaker to make a black film is sort of superfluous.'' ''Nothing but a Man'' was produced before directors like Spike Lee and John Singleton had materialized, and long before Hollywood took up black subjects. And at the time, Mr. Roemer said, independent producers were ''anomalies.''
 Soon after its original premiere, he said, ''Nothing but a Man'' was released in 16 millimeter, and found a black audience when it was shown in churches and schools. 
 Mr. Roemer's second feature film was ''The Plot Against Harry,'' a comedy about a Jewish gangster, made in 1969. It failed to find a distributor because no one found it funny, he said. It sat on the shelf for 20 years until Mr. Roemer submitted it to the New York Film Festival in 1989. It was accepted there, and subsequently released theatrically, to rave reviews.
 ''It was kind of a redemption and a very odd experience because I had been so sure of my own failure, and so had everybody else,'' Mr. Roemer said. 
 ''The Plot Against Harry'' is to be issued on DVD in March.
 ''I don't think I've made a film that isn't as alive today as it was when we made it,'' he said. ''I feel good about that. Everything still looks like it happened yesterday rather than 40 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Pivot Points in the Middle East

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Dexter Filkins contributed reporting from Falluja for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
NEUTRALIZING the threat from the green-domed mosque looked almost effortless. Marines in the dusty warrens of Falluja had been taking fire from one of its twin minarets. They called in air support. A 500-pound bomb slammed into a blue-tiled tower, obliterating a signature part of the Khulafa Al Rashid mosque, the city's most celebrated religious building.
 As in a fevered dream, that and other scenes of destruction played out last week in Falluja before the eyes of American troops, residents and reporters. By early Saturday, marines and soldiers had swept through most of the city and cornered insurgents in the south, leaving behind shelled buildings, bullet-riddled cars and rotting corpses.
 It proved one thing: That the Americans are great at taking things apart. What comes after the battlefield victory has always been the real problem for them during their 19 months in Iraq. 
 The commanders say their goals now in Falluja are to install a viable Iraqi government and security force, rebuild the city to win back the confidence of the residents and persuade the Sunni Arabs, who were Saddam Hussein's base of support and were ousted from power with him, to lay down their arms and take part in a legitimate political process.
 Difficult as all of that seems, it is the last aim -- persuading the Sunnis to act as a loyal minority in a democracy -- that may be the most improbable goal of the retaking of Falluja by storm.
 American officials say that if it can be done, Falluja, which has assumed mythic status across the Arab world for its resistance, could then serve as a model for the rest of Iraq, and Iraq as a model for the rest of the Middle East.
 But given the track record of the Americans and their allies, military analysts say, the immediate goals in Falluja seem naive, if not utterly inconsequential given the surging resistance across the Sunni-dominated regions of Iraq, almost certainly organized by the very leaders who fled Falluja before the offensive.
 ''Iraq is a complex problem,'' said Charles Pena, director of defense policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group based in Washington. ''Our problem is that we keep leading people to believe that there are simple solutions.''
 ''Our military action creates other problems that our military cannot solve,'' he said. ''And we haven't been very good at fixing what we broke in Iraq.''
 American commanders say they had no illusions that the Falluja offensive would let them capture the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the most wanted man in Iraq, or break the back of the insurgency.
 What they do not acknowledge is that seizing Falluja does not bring them much closer to solving the occupation's most intractable problem -- how to get Sunni Arabs to overcome their feelings of disenfranchisement and accept the role of a minority in a democratic Iraqi state.
 Sunni Arabs make up only a fifth of Iraqis; three-fifths are Shiite Arabs and the remaining fifth are mostly Sunni Kurds. But Sunnis dominate most of the Middle East and have ruled the region now called Iraq since the Ottoman Empire. There are few signs they are willing to accept a subservient role in the new government. 
 In anticipating a democracy, the Americans have signaled at every turn that they foresee power flowing to the majority Shiites, and the elections scheduled for January are a way to accomplish that in a manner that appears legitimate. Hammering Falluja is supposed to force insurgent Sunnis to realize the hopelessness of armed conflict and instead turn to the ballot box.
 But it is not so easy to convince people with little concept of minority rights that a Western-style democracy will work for them. For Sunnis to accept this new style of government, they will have to be persuaded that their rights will still be respected by an American-backed Shiite-dominated ruling class, and that they will have some power and autonomy -- concerns that to a lesser degree plague even the Kurds, perhaps the staunchest supporters of the American presence here.
 The American commanders here hold up their recent actions in the Shiite areas of Karbala, Najaf and Sadr City as models of how overwhelming force drove rebels into legitimate politics. Falluja will be no different, they say. But Moktada al-Sadr, the firebrand cleric who led the Shiite insurgency, has everything to gain and nothing to lose by taking part in elections. He can expect his hugely popular organization to win many seats in the national assembly and become part of the Shiite power establishment.
 There is no such hope for the Sunnis, which is why the leading group of Sunni clerics, the Muslim Scholars Association, called last week for a boycott of the elections. The group says it represents 3,000 mosques across Iraq and has been staunchly anti-American since the start of the war. Still, some secular Sunnis, like the former exile Adnan Pachachi, have been more welcoming of the American presence and say they intend to take part in the elections. 
 Installing a working Iraqi government and police force in Falluja is a less ambitious goal, but it too seems a stretch for the Americans. In the offensive, most of the Iraqi forces have done little actual fighting. They roll in after the Americans have already cleared city blocks of insurgents and are assigned to search buildings.
 Some seem disoriented as they stand in the debris-strewn landscape, their brown uniforms spotless from not having done a lick of fighting. Little has changed since last May, when the First Armored Division laid siege to Karbala, and Iraqi security forces merely cleared weapons out of mosques.
 In Mosul on Thursday, police officers at a half-dozen police stations scurried away as soon as insurgents began firing their rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles. Two weeks ago, bombings and mortar attacks left at least 30 dead in Samarra, only a month after American forces swept through the city and claimed a resounding victory. A senior American military officer in Baghdad admitted that after the Americans left, the insurgents were able to overwhelm the poorly trained Iraqi police.
 In Samarra, the guerrillas evacuated before American armor rolled in, and then bided their time, which is the greatest advantage an insurgency has, because the occupying force at some point will depart. The insurgents don't need a safe haven like Falluja to run down the clock. ''In fact, Maoist tactics would argue against trying to settle in a city and hold it at this stage of a weak insurgency, and for using the population as a sea to swim in,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 It is absurd, Mr. Cordesman adds, to believe that destroying Falluja and then rebuilding it will win support for the Americans and the interim government. The American military said it has put aside $100 million for reconstructing the devastated city. But that does not solve the much bigger problem of unemployment, now at 60 percent nationwide. That is a motivating factor for young men joining the insurgency.
 ''How much money and aid effort does it really take,'' Mr. Cordesman said, ''to jump-start an economy rather than provide welfare for Falluja?''

HEADLINE: What Is a Foreign Movie Now?

BYLINE: By A. O. Scott. 
A.O. Scott is a chief film critic of The Times.

 BODY:
One night during the Toronto film festival earlier this fall, I slippedinto a buzzing multiplex theater decked out with all the amenities of 21st-century moviegoing -- stadium seating, molded plastic cup holders, digital surround sound, decent concession-stand cappuccino. I was there, along with a gratifyingly large number of curious and enthusiastic Canadians, not to catch an early glimpse of possible Oscar contenders but to see a new movie from China called ''The World,'' directed by Jia Zhangke. I'd seen Jia's two previous films, ''Platform'' and ''Unknown Pleasures'' -- films that have won him a devoted following among critics and festivalgoers. 
 But his name is unlikely to be widely recognized either in the United States, where his films have received only brief, limited releases, or in his own country, where he has, at least until ''The World,'' worked independently of the official state production system, a decision that has kept his films out of most Chinese cinemas. 
 Jia is the kind of director who tells small stories with big implications, examining the lives of individuals (usually sullen young women and the sullen young men who tolerate their company) in a way that suggests large, invisible forces pushing them through their passive, melancholy lives. ''Platform'' (2000), for example, is about a troupe of performers in a provincial Chinese city who start out, just after the Cultural Revolution, as the Peasant Culture Group From Fenyang and evolve, by the end of the 1980's, into something called the All-Star Rock and Breakdance Electronic Band, a mutation that captures, with a deadpan precision at once mocking and tender, China's awkward post-Maoist embrace of Western-style popular culture.
 In ''The World,'' which is set in present-day Beijing, that embrace, long since consummated, has taken on the weary familiarity of a long, loveless marriage. The film's title, provocative in its ambition, is at once literal and layered with metaphor. The young lovers, like the consumer goods they covet and flaunt, are products of globalization, and also of China's transformation into a largely urban, fitfully capitalist and uneasily cosmopolitan society. Without lifting his eyes from their modest, hectic daily lives and inchoate aspirations, Jia embeds these elements of experience in a vast cosmos of similar stories. Tao and her sometime boyfriend, Taisheng, the film's ordinary and unheroic central couple, are stubbornly particular and, at the same time, implicitly universal. They are the world.
 They are also, more mundanely, the workers of the World, which is the name of a theme park in Beijing whose main attractions are scaled-down replicas of foreign tourist attractions -- the Arc de Triomphe, the Taj Mahal, the twin towers of the World Trade Center. (''Ours are still standing,'' one character boasts, in a perverse expression of national pride.) Taisheng is a security guard, while Tao is a dancer, shuffling in and out of various garish pseudo-traditional costumes for tacky song-and-dance routines. To an American viewer, the World, with its monorails and loudspeakers, is like a looking-glass version of one of our homegrown theme parks, and like those places it is at once a free-floating, featureless abstraction of what it represents and the peculiar artifact of a particular cultural situation. If ''The World'' is partly about the loss of a rooted, traditional identity based on kinship and place, it is also about the stubborn persistence of place in the age of telecommunications and transglobal travel. Though Tao spends her days dashing between simulacra of Paris, London and New York, neither she nor anyone she knows has ever ridden on an airplane or visited a foreign land. When she meets Anna, a Russian woman who briefly comes to work at the park, Tao expresses envy for her new friend's freedom to travel, oblivious to the fact that her globe-trotting is part of a grim international traffic in coerced labor. Not that Anna can understand a word Tao says. Since their relationship is one of the few in this bleak landscape that shows genuine warmth and fellow feeling, their mutual incomprehension is another of Jia's double-edged worldly metaphors. We can appreciate each other even -- or perhaps especially -- when neither one of us has the faintest idea what the other is talking about.
 That, at any rate, might describe my own response to Jia Zhangke (whom I know only through his movies) -- a mixture of intuitive understanding and obdurate bafflement. 
 To me, his world, in its various meanings and dimensions, is at once immediately recognizable and emphatically strange. This paradox is part of the structure of human experience, of course -- other people are necessarily both familiar and mysterious to us -- but in its modern incarnation, it is one that film as a medium seems uniquely empowered to illuminate. Because the camera is a surrogate eye, what it captures is immediately comprehensible, even if it is nothing we have seen before. Filmed images do not require translation; we know what we see. Narratives, of course, are another story; even when they seem to be transparent, they come encrusted with local meanings, idioms and references, some of which will inevitably be lost as they move from one audience to another.
 Movies, in other words, may be universal, but they are universal in radically distinct ways. Some of them we regard as foreign, a word I use with some trepidation. Though my purpose here is to wave the flag for movies from around the world, it is a banner whose slogans make me cringe a little. The phrase ''foreign film'' is, after all, freighted with connotations of preciousness and snobbery, and too often accompanied by dismissive modifiers like ''difficult,'' ''obscure'' and ''depressing'' (all of which I happen to regard as virtues, but never mind). Our own commercial cinema is increasingly devoted to dispensing accessibility, comfort and familiarity -- which can also be virtues. It is not necessary to rank, or to choose. As Atom Egoyan and Ian Balfour point out in their introduction to a new collection of essays and interviews called ''Subtitles,'' ''Every film is a foreign film, foreign to some audience somewhere.''
 In any case, I am most concerned with American audiences, and in particular with the parochialism that results from living in a country with a film industry so powerful and productive, so frank and cheerful in its imperial ambitions, that it threatens to overshadow everything else. It is not just the setting and content of a movie like ''The World'' that may seem foreign but also its visual strategy and storytelling methods, and above all its unsentimental commitment to the depiction of ordinary life, to a kind of realism that is in some ways more alien to us than the reality it construes. Hollywood studios, as they try to protect their dominant position in the global entertainment market, are ever more heavily invested in fantasy, in conjuring counterfeit worlds rather than engaging the one that exists, and in the technological R &D required to expand the horizons of novelty and sensation. And while we, along with everybody else, often go to the movies to escape from the pressures and difficulties of the actual world, we also sometimes go to discover it.
 Whether it takes the form of armchair tourism or of a harrowing, life-altering philosophical quest, such discovery has formed part of the appeal of movies from elsewhere -- a specialized appeal, to be sure, but also a remarkably protean and durable one -- since the beginnings of art-house film culture just after World War II. In the late 1940's, foreign movies began to arrive on our shores unencumbered by the restrictions of the Production Code, promising a frankness and sophistication, especially in sexual matters, far beyond what the studios were allowed. 
 Even sober works of Italian Neorealism were sold with a nudge and a wink, their print advertisements featuring suggestive line drawings and breathless exclamation points: Shocking! Daring! Uncensored! There was a degree of bait-and-switch in these come-ons, which were partly a way for the independent theater operators who booked the pictures to fill up empty seats, but there was also some inadvertent truth. Moviegoers who ventured to see ''The Bicycle Thief'' or ''La Terra Trema'' would encounter shocking glimpses of urban and rural poverty, the daring use of nonprofessional actors and real-world locations and an uncensored critique of European social conditions.
 Not that Italian Neorealism was the only outward-looking, far-seeing lens that curious Americans could peer through. And neither were all the vistas bleak and harsh. In any case, the art involved in capturing those images was at least as fascinating, as seductive and as new as the images themselves. Indeed, it was foreign movies that taught Americans to regard film as an art -- and, eventually, to appreciate the art that had been flourishing in American movies all along. It is hardly accidental that we still use a French word -- ''auteur'' -- to evoke the creative authority a director wields over his work. The film culture that emerged in the shabby art houses and cinema clubs where dubbed and subtitled prints of exotic movies were shown was organized not around the worship of stars, but around the connoisseurship of filmmakers, who became the objects of a sometimes fiercely partisan critical discourse. Were you for Ozu or Kurosawa? Antonioni or Fellini? Could you reconcile a taste for Bergman with an enthusiasm for Godard?
 Why did these names have such resonance? What did these auteurs give American movie buffs -- or cinephiles, if you prefer -- that the Hollywood studios, for all their inventiveness and eclecticisim, did not? What, in other words, made the category of ''foreign film'' something more than a convenient, catch-all phrase? Or, to echo Egoyan and Balfour, what made these films foreign to this audience? I think there are two answers, which suggest the existence of two linked, occasionally antagonistic cinematic impulses, neither of which has quite taken root in the United States.
 On one side you find movies mainly concerned with the lives of the rural peasantry or the urban proletariat, movies that emphasize the social situations of their characters and whose mode of representation is realist. On the other are movies about middle class or bohemian city dwellers, or wandering souls in evening dress with time on their hands and no visible means of support. The emphasis is not on social conditions but on psychological states and existential moods, and the narrative and visual style, in order to capture those moods, dispenses with realism in favor of something more expressive and oblique.
 For argument's sake, we can call the first kind of filmmaking humanist, the second modernist. Humanism's great prewar exponent was Jean Renoir, whose example and personal tutelage informed several Neorealists and also the Bengali director Satyajit Ray. Ray's ''Apu'' trilogy, with its meticulous attention to the details and rhythms of traditional Indian life and its quiet but unstinting concern with poverty and injustice, may well represent the apotheosis of cinematic humanism. Informed by a mild, melancholy form of Marxism, Ray's films are sad without slipping into pessimism or depression. The director and the audience, though not always the characters, are inoculated from despair by faith in the incremental but ultimately benevolent progress of history. This kind of filmmaking is fundamentally concerned with dramatizing, through close observation of individual lives, the process of historical change. Its subjects are at once dauntingly abstract -- the shift from agriculture to industry, the coming and going of colonial powers, the advent and aftermath of wars and revolutions -- and intimately concrete: a family, a child, a village. 
 In Europe, modernist cinema emerged in the wake of this humanism, and partly in reaction to it. The economic rejuvenation that followed the scarcity and anxiety of the immediate postwar years and the emergence of a generation of younger filmmakers with their own brand of restless cosmopolitanism produced a creative ferment. From the mid-50's to the mid-60s, American audiences witnessed the rise of an extraordinary collection of world-class filmmakers -- including Bergman, Kurosawa, the critics-turned-auteurs of the French New Wave, new Italian maestros like Antonioni, Fellini and Pasolini -- who seemed, with each new film, to expand the formal and expressive possibilities of the medium. Their predecessors' emphasis on social realities could feel a little restrictive when there were other possibilities -- sexual, psychological and aesthetic -- to explore. Like modernist literature, modernist cinema reveled in self-consciousness and reflexivity. Each new film was not just a new window on the world but also, at least potentially, a world of style, sensibility and invention unto itself, with its own rules, its own language, its own syntax. To see a movie like ''L'Avventura,'' 
 say, with its oblique, highly charged eroticism and its gorgeous vistas of alienation, was not to bear witness or to experience empathy -- the ethical and emotional bases of humanism -- but to immerse yourself in a state of altered perception. 
 Of course, not every foreign film fits neatly into the humanist-modernist schema. Plenty of directors -- Fellini and Visconti, for example -- moved easily from one to the other, and many beloved foreign movies -- costume dramas, action, crime and horror movies, star-heavy international co-productions -- don't fit comfortably within either one. But humanism and modernism together account for the foreignness of foreign films, for the sense of strangeness and discovery that kept both diehard cultists and idle curiosity-seekers lining up at the art house doors through the 70's, when VCR's began to shut the art houses down.
 The aftershocks of that golden moment continue to ripple through the world of film appreciation, not least because a number of the old masters, including Bergman and Godard, are still around making movies. But like the period in which it is embedded, and like the Hollywood new wave that followed on its heels, that heady moment in the history of world cinema -- the moment at which it became possible to use a phrase like ''world cinema'' in conversation -- has become encrusted with legend and nostalgia. Those who witnessed it firsthand look with pity on those who came too late and had to catch it all on DVD instead of at the New Yorker or the Thalia. We can never know an equivalent exhilaration of discovery, the frisson of seeing ''L'Avventura'' or ''Persona'' for the first time and trembling in awe and recognition.
 Except that we can, if only we will seek it out. The modernist and humanist impulses are both alive and well, flourishing and cross-pollinating on every continent and in new, transnational formations. The world is, if anything, much bigger than it was 40 years ago, even if the audience has shrunk and dispersed. What happened to that audience -- Did it age? Did its attention migrate toward homegrown ''independent'' cinema? Is it alive and well on the Internet or in the burgeoning DVD culture? -- is a topic of endless concern. But my point is that wherever the audience is, the movies are out there, trickling across our borders in numbers that only begin to suggest the volume and diversity of global film production today.
 This may come as news, since the cinematic story that is told again and again is one of Hollywood triumphalism, of a blockbuster globalism dissolving all vestiges of the local, the particular and the strange. 
 The decline of state-subsidized film industries was supposed to accelerate this trend, but predictions of a cinematic Pax Americana have proved premature, to say the least, since they have failed to take account of the continued vitality of the world's largest popular movie industry -- India's -- or the emergence (and resurgence) of vibrant commercial moviemaking in countries like South Korea, China and Mexico. While it is true that, on a given Friday, most of the world's multiplexes will be playing franchise products from American studios, it is not hard to imagine a future in which an American suburban marquee will boast a Chinese martial-arts picture, a Korean action thriller, a Mexican cop drama and a French romantic comedy. 
 Among the harbingers of that future are the domestic box-offices successes of movies like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' ''Amelie'' and last summer's ''Hero.'' Of course, if you count remakes, homages and rip-offs -- retooled versions of Japanese pictures like ''The Ring'' and ''The Grudge,'' say, or even Quentin Tarantino's ''Kill Bill'' movies -- then that future has long since arrived. What we think of as Hollywood is already a hybrid of influences from elsewhere to an extent not seen since the great wave of emigre talent that was European fascism's inadvertent gift to American culture. Anime, J-horror, Bollywood, telenovelas, chopsocky -- whether or not you are familiar with these terms, the visual languages they represent are already part of the movie lexicon.
 But at the same time, just as a lingua franca of reciprocal influences takes over the mass audience, the art-movie traditions of humanism and modernism continue to thrive, perhaps with greater urgency, and certainly in greater variety, than ever before. The humanist belief in dramatizing ordinary lives, in fashioning narratives that follow the quotidian rhythms of childhood, work and domesticity, has been the foundation of the extraordinary renaissance in Iranian cinema in the past 15 years, but it also shows remarkable tenacity in its European birthplace. The flowering of Iranian cinema has produced at least two stars of the festival circuit -- Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf -- but it has also opened Western eyes to a remarkably eclectic national cinema characterized by fierce social criticism and surprising sensual beauty.
 Iranian filmmakers have also provided some of the most powerful examples of how to make art that is at once formally innovative and ethically engaged -- movies that alert audiences to the plight of women, the poor, ethnic minorities and refugees without lecturing or preaching, and without denying them worldly pleasures or aesthetic challenges. Similarly, the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (''Rosetta'' and ''La Promesse'') and the French director Laurent Cantet (''Time Out'') have exposed the sorrows and cruelties of the postindustrial economy, bringing a strange, almost spiritual poignancy to naturalistic studies of work, immigration and other persistent social issues.
 Humanism, which is rooted both in human unhappiness and the capacity for hope, is an impulse that is unlikely to fade from screens, and indeed it has been showing up, adapted to local problems and traditions, in places as far-flung as South Africa, Brazil, China and Uzbekistan. The modernist impulse has undergone a simultaneous resurgence, in Iran, in Latin America and especially in the work of Asian filmmakers like Tsai Ming-liang, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Kim Ki Duk and Hong Sang Soo. They have explored the drift and loneliness that characterizes the lives of city dwellers, who navigate the gleaming world of modern capitalism in a state of moody perplexity. 
 In the work of these filmmakers, the strains of modernism and humanism have begun to mingle, as the boundaries between individual melancholy and social misery become harder and harder to trace. The cities they depict -- Seoul, Taipei, Beijing, Hanoi -- are at once teeming and desolate, full of the noise of history, commerce and tradition and at the same time governed by the silence of the emotionally stunted. This impression can be gathered from the fractured, sexually anarchic families in Tsai's movies (''Rebels of the Neon God,'' ''The River'') and the superficially more settled household of Yang's ''Yi Yi.'' Whatever held people together -- filial piety, cultural identity, religious practice -- seems to have melted away, and they drift toward one another like downcast atoms, piecing their lives together out of stray bits of feeling.
 But are they really alone? A defining modern mood -- one that is often evoked but hasn't adequately been named -- is the anxious, melancholy feeling of being simultaneously connected and adrift. In a recent essay in Salon, the film critic Charles Taylor identified this condition -- ''being in a world where the only sense of home is to be found in a state of constant flux'' -- as a central motif in movies ranging from ''Lost in Translation'' to the films of cinephile cult figures like Tsai and Wong Kar-wai. Taylor identifies an unstable blend of anxiety, curiosity and longing as the emotional condition that links the solitary, alienated heroes and heroines of the modern cinema of loneliness, among whom Tao and Taisheng in ''The World'' surely belong. There may be a measure of comfort in joining the international fraternity of the lost -- at least for audiences. The experience of dwelling in these movies is replicated, and to some extent redeemed, by the experience of watching them, of feeling estrangement and disorientation not only vicariously through the characters but also in relation to them as well. They encounter one another, in strange, indifferent cities, by chance, and their relations are at once affectless and charged with latent emotion -- all of which is just how we encounter them, alone in darkened rooms in the midst of our hectic and decentered lives.

HEADLINE: To the Lighthouse

 BODY:
Long Island, as the name suggests, is essentially horizontal. We live in a land of slabs and lawns, ranch houses and beaches. We don't do tall; we sprawl.
 This is one reason Charles Wang's plan to redevelop the site of the Nassau Coliseum is so jolting. He wants to build a $200 million mega-plex -- a mix of sports and entertainment venues, commercial space, retail stores and housing -- and cap it with a 60-story lighthouse, featuring condominiums all the way up to an observatory and a flashing beacon visible for miles. At 600 feet, it would be more than twice as high as any other structure on the island. 
 Even people not necessarily inclined to like Mr. Wang's proposal have called it breathtaking. We, too, will give him that much. We admit to being impressed by his ambition, and we like the idea of giving that dreary part of Uniondale a dose of vitality and magnetism. That's the point, after all -- the Wang plan is a critical part of County Executive Thomas Suozzi's goal to turn dumpy central Nassau into an economic engine for the region. 
 But we also admit to having some nagging questions: 
 1. What gives Mr. Wang, a software entrepreneur who has never built anything of consequence anywhere, the inside track to develop a 77-acre parcel that is probably the most valuable piece of real estate on Long Island? Mr. Suozzi has a simple answer: the project, he says, is not about lighthouses, it is about saving the Islanders hockey team, and the only developer who could afford to do that -- while also investing the hundreds of millions necessary to refurbish the coliseum and surrounding property -- is Mr. Wang, the principal owner of the team. 
 2. Doesn't the sale of public land require the county to request proposals from other developers? Mr. Suozzi says the county charter is clear: a request for proposals is not required and he will not do it. Mr. Wang is his man for the reasons above and soliciting bids, he says, is a time-wasting charade.
 3. With or without a public bidding process, can the project remain open and aboveboard? 
 4. Does Mr. Wang have the appetite to see this through? Other developers have been quick to list the hurdles awaiting a project this huge, like traffic surveys, environmental impact studies, even approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, because the lighthouse is so tall. The Town of Hempstead has final say over zoning. Will the hard-charging Mr. Wang have the patience to do the wooing and wheedling necessary to get all his permits in place? 
 If all these questions are answered satisfactorily, there is still the matter of whether Long Island is ready for this. We think Mr. Suozzi is right when he says that an economic hub like this is needed to keep the rest of suburbia -- single-family homes, lawns, quiet streets -- viable. 
 The soaring lighthouse may still be a tough sell. But the goal here is important enough to be worth pursuing -- with plenty of additional investigation and public input.

Wine Tour in Hungary

Q. We will be attending a university conference in Budapest in a few weeks and will have a couple of free days. Are there any guided tours to the wine centers of Tokay and Eger? -- B.L., Providence R.I.

A. Anika Sarkozy of the Hungarian National Tourist Office, 150 East 58th Street, New York, N.Y. 10155, (212) 355-0240, fax (212) 207-4103, www.gotohungary.com, suggested a Budapest tour company, Program Centrum Travel, (36-1) 317-7767 485-2762, fax (36-1) 317-9746, www.programcentrum.hu.
 But Miklos Barts at Program Centrum said its standard one-day tour for two or more people to Eger, about two hours northeast of Budapest, was given only from May through October. That tour includes bus travel, an English-speaking guide, a visit to the basilica and the castle in Eger, a three-course meal, and tasting of Eger wines in a local cellar. The price is about $115 a person, at 195 forints to the dollar. 
 Since Program Centrum also sets up private tours, though, it may be able to do a customized excursion to wine country. 
 Another company, Eurama, (36-1) 327-6694, fax (36-1) 327-6691, www.eurama.hu, says it will arrange private single-day tours to either region, or a two-day tour to both. Monika Zsebo of Eurama estimated that a two-day trip with a car and guide, a room in a four-star hotel in Eger, a city tour there, and wine tastings in each region would cost about $1,230.
 Another option is to arrange a customized tour set up by Monarchia Wines, an importer and distributor of Hungarian wines, through the Mosaic Group and ProTravel International, 515 Madison Avenue, New York N.Y. 10022, (800) 227-1059 extension 262, www.mosaicgrouptravel.com. 
 Nathalie Nagy, who arranges these trips, says a two-day tour with a driver and guide will cost $950 to $1,950, depending on the level of services. A luxury trip might include a stay in the Grof Degenfeld Castle Hotel in Tarcal in Tokay, and visits to the Hummerer Vineyards in Eger and the Tokay Hetszolo Estates and the Demeter Winery, both in Tokay.

Key West Christmas Dinner

Q. Our family of 15 will arrive in Key West on Christmas Day. Will many restaurants that can handle our horde be open? -- R.B., Gloversville, N.Y.

A. The Key West Restaurant and Bar Association expects a large majority of the town's 86 restaurants to be open on Christmas, says Andy Newman, a spokesman for Florida Keys tourism council (www.fla-keys.com). Many publish holiday menus on their Web sites, which you can link to at www.kwrba.com/members.cfm. The association suggests reservations and asking about cancellation policies.
 These are a few of the places that will be open: 
 A&B Lobster House, 700 Front Street, (305) 294-5880, www.aandblobsterhouse.com, has been around since 1947, with both indoor and balcony dining with marina views. Entrees costs $22 to $34, and children's items will be available. 
 Shula's on the Beach, 1435 Simonton Street, (305) 296-6144, www.donshula.com, is in the Wyndham Reach Resort. Part of the former football coach's steakhouse chain, it has indoor and outdoor seating with ocean views. Entrees: $25 to $42; children's menu. From 5:30 to 7:30, a limited three-course menu is $28. 
 Alice's Key West, 1114 Duval Street, (305) 292-5733, www.aliceskeywest.com, says it offers ''New World fusion confusion'' -- a mix of comfort food and exotic items like meatloaf and Cuban ostrich. The three-course Christmas dinner is $48, with entree choices of goose, lamb, beef, and shrimp and lobster. There's no children's menu, but Alice Weingarten, the chef, said she would try to accommodate requests for burgers and the like. 
 Mangoes Restaurant, 700 Duval Street, (305) 292-4606, www.mangoeskeywest.com, has outdoor and indoor seating and features eclectic, local foods. The Christmas menu will have traditional fare as well as regular items, and for kids, macaroni and cheese, soups and sandwiches. Entrees: $18 to $34.
 Abbondanza Italian Restaurant, 1208 Simonton Street, (305) 292-1199, is noted for its healthy portions. Entrees: $10 to $19. 
 El Meson de Pepe, 410 Wall Street, (305) 295-2620, www.elmesondepepe.com, features Cuban cuisine both indoors and in a garden on Mallory Square, where there is a daily sunset celebration with entertainment. Entrees: $14 to $23; children's menu. 

Leasing a Car in France

Q. I will be renting a house in France next summer and would like to rent a car for a month. Is there a cheaper way than week to week, and, if so, can it be done at the Marseilles airport? -- S.P., Sioux Falls, S.D.

A. A number of companies lease brand-new cars for long periods. In France, this can be done for a minimum of 17 days and a maximum of 175 days. A brief overview of regulations and a listing of car rental companies can be found on the Web at us.franceguide.com under Travel.
 Among the companies that lease cars at the Marseilles airport is Europe By Car, 62 William Street, New York, N.Y. 10005, (800) 223-1516, fax (212) 246-1458, and www.europebycar.com. The company's president, Alexander Roy, said that a 30-day lease could save 15 to 40 percent over week-to-week prices, mainly because such leases were actually with the car manufacturers, not the rental agents (his company offers Peugeots and Renaults). As a result, there are no local taxes or rental fees, no extra insurance is required and mileage is unlimited. 
 While the 2005 rates have not yet been set, Mr. Roy offered these current examples: a compact Peugeot 206 four-door is $945 for 30 days, while a midsize Renault Laguna 1 diesel with air-conditioning is $1,639. All the cars have AM-FM radio-cassette. Full prepayment is required and a 40-day notice may be required.
 Another agent is Auto Europe, 39 Commercial Street, Portland, Me. 04101, (888) 223-5555, www.autoeurope.com. For a 30-day lease in Marseilles next summer, it quoted rates of Peugeots from $923 for a gasoline-powered compact with manual transmission to $1,226 for a diesel manual economy model.
 A third choice is Renault Eurodrive, 8 West 38th Street, New York, N.Y. 10018; (800) 221-1052, fax 212) 730-0706; www.renaultusa.com. Sandrine Alkan, the marketing manager, said the summer 2005 rates would not be available until December (when early bird specials will be offered). But current 30-day rates range from $1,033 for the smallest automatic transmission model to $2,226 for a diesel seven-passenger van. RAY CORMIER

HEADLINE: Bollywood Confidential

BYLINE: By Suketu Mehta. 
Suketu Mehta is the author of ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found.''

 BODY:
Why do I love Bollywood movies? To an Indian, that's like asking why we love our mothers; we don't have a choice. We were born of them. Though Hindu gods are the obsession, even Muslims genuflect before the screen when they see their heroes walk on. It is significant that, except for Satyajit Ray, there isn't much of an internationally known Indian art cinema; the shadow of Bollywood is too long. Bollywood, and its cousins in the South Indian film industry, have beaten Hollywood at its own game: matching success at the box office with equal success in the battle for the hearts and minds of the audience -- conquering their very dream lives. Kitschy, illogical, often defying common sense, these movies have made me who I am. They shape the way I conduct my love affairs or think about religion or treat my elders. 
 But it's not just Indians who think this way. The Indian film industry has penetrated into vast, and unlikely, areas of the globe; a hit Hindi movie will be dubbed or subtitled in a dozen foreign languages -- French, Mandarin, Malay. In New York, whenever I get a haircut, I'm confident of getting a discount if the hairdresser is from the former Soviet Union. Indian movies became popular there beginning in the 1950's. The Soviets gave us arms; we gave them our kitsch movies in return. Israelis watch them. Palestinians watch them. Indians and Pakistanis watch them. Dominicans and Haitians watch them. Iraqis watch them. Iranians watch them. In a building full of immigrants in Queens, an Uzbek man once cornered me in a dark stairwell. I'd been mugged before, and I thought, Oh, no. As he towered over me, he started singing, ''Ichak dana bichak dana, . . . '' a Bollywood standard from the 50's.
 All these people watch Bollywood movies because the stories they tell are pre-cynical. Bollywood believes in motherhood, patriotism and true love. Hollywood is too ambivalent about family for their tastes. My friend Abdelkader, a Moroccan writer who grew up in the Netherlands, told me why Moroccans watch Hindi movies: ''We like that, in the end, everyone bows down and touches the mother's feet.'' 
 The standard Western complaint about Bollywood movies is that they're melodramatic, but for those who love them, melodrama in the defense of entertainment is no vice. Take this explanation from a Dominican cabby in New York, who, along with his 14 siblings, grew up watching Hindi movies. He couldn't remember the title of a single one, but he did remember what he liked about them. ''They have singing!'' he exclaimed. 
 Every Bollywood film is a musical, with between 5 and 14 songs. No blockbuster special effects, no interplanetary spaceships, no lone American singlehandedly taking on armies of brown people -- just singing, and respect shown to mothers.
My personal history of Bollywood is entwined with my personal history of Bombay (which I refuse to call Mumbai), where I grew up in the 70's. Bollywood lives in the middle of its created dream: Bombay. There is the Bombay of the auteur Raj Kapoor, where migrants struggle to survive on the city's pitiless sidewalks; the Bombay of gangsters and cops, as in the superstar Amitabh Bachchan's ''Deewaar'' and ''Zanjeer''; the Bombay of the striving middle class; the Bombay of yuppies. Bombay is a city whose contrasts are so extreme that only movies that make no claim to represent reality could do justice to it; a city where those confronted by difficult moral choices -- the loss of life or love -- burst into song.
 Going to the movies was a family enterprise in Bombay. The women in my parents' household would pack samosas so we wouldn't have to buy them at the concession stand. This small economy would compensate for the expense of paying scalpers outside the cinemas, often the only way of getting tickets for a hit movie. During the slower songs, as much as a quarter of the audience might get up for refreshments. We were allowed to talk back to the screen, to clap and whistle and jeer, to throw coins in praise when we were particularly pleased. 
 When I moved to New York in 1977 at the age of 14, I walked around the streets of Jackson Heights singing Hindi movie songs with my friends. In a Hindi movie, emotion is communicated through song, because song is more potent than dialogue. When there's overwhelming emotion -- love, hatred, heartbreak -- spoken words don't suffice. They have to be sung, and the singer has to be transported, on the wings of her song, to the Alpine meadows of Switzerland if she's falling in love (the Swiss Alps are a substitute for troubled Kashmir, the Indian honeymoon paradise) or to a temple in a thunderstorm if her mother is about to die. 
 We watched the movies every chance we got, in the ramshackle Deluxe Cinema in Woodside, at the Bombay Theater on Queens Boulevard. When the first VCR's started arriving in the late 70's, we gathered with other Indian families, watching three three-hour Bollywood movies back to back, with samosas and tears and laughter. Even the car games we played were based around Bollywood. We played Antakshari, in which one person sang a few lines of a Bollywood song, and the next person had to begin another song with the last syllable of the preceding song. We never risked running out, as we carried so many of these songs within us.
 Raj Kapoor gave me the perfect exile's song: ''Mera Joota Hai Japani.'' Raj Kapoor sang it -- or rather, lip-synched it -- to the great playback singer Mukesh, in ''Shree 420'':
 My shoes are Japanese
 My pants English
 On my head a red Russian cap
 Still my heart is Indian.
 When I am happy, I sing ''Deewana hua Badal'' (''The Maddened Clouds'') from ''Kashmir ki Kali,'' a song about the coming rains, set to the beat of a horse cart trundling across the Vale of Kashmir. When I'm sad, I sing ''Bicchad Gaye'' (''We Have Parted''). When I'm playful, I yell out ''Maalish! Tel Maalish!'' (''Massage! Oil Massage!'') after the comic head masseur in ''Pyaasa.'' When I want to express friendship, I sing ''Yeh Dosti Hum Nahin Todenge'' (''This Friendship, We'll Never Abandon''), which all boys growing up in India sang to one another, arms draped fraternally around one another's necks.
 We Indians carry these songs around with us. They form our vocabulary of love and grief, from country to country. My aunt's family emigrated to Uganda from India a century ago; she now lives in England and has never been to India, but she listens mostly to Hindi movie songs. When I visited her house in Leicester once, I noticed that none of the children under 5 in her extended family spoke English. They spoke Gujarati and film Hindi; in their house, the TV was on almost all the time, with Hindi movies playing back to back on the VCR. The children, two or three generations removed from India, were living in this simulated Indiaworld. 
At college at N.Y.U., I was vice president of the Indian students organization, and we organized regular showings of Hindi movies, driving out to Queens Boulevard to get the giant reels from Eros Entertainment. ''Amar Prem'' and ''Pyaasa'' were so popular in the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium that we had to show them twice. As the Indian-American girls watched the love stories and wept, they relaxed their defenses. They reached out for the boy from home. And when we were heartbroken, we turned to the dolorous Mohammed Rafi, or the ghazals -- lyric love songs -- sung by Jagjit & Chitra Singh or by Pankaj Udhas. Not film music, exactly, but close enough; the Urdu poetry expressed in extravagant fashion the torments of the heart: ''It feels good to cry against these walls. . . . ''
 My uncle in Chicago, who has worked for 25 years in a home-furnishings factory, became popular in gatherings of Indians in suburban basements. ''Give me the name of any song,'' he would challenge a hundred people after they had their samosas. ''Kabhi Kabhie,'' they might say, and he would sing the song in its entirety. And they all sang with him -- the doctors, the grocers, the engineers, ''Kabhi Kabhie,'' and their faces became soft and rosy in the singing. ''You are truly an encyclopedia of old songs!'' they would tell him.
 At Indian-American weddings, the women of the family choreograph and perform Bollywood song numbers. Many of the Hindu rituals have merged with scenes drawn from such wedding movies as ''Hum Aapke Hain Koun'' (''What Am I to You''), essentially an extended wedding video with 14 song sequences. When we want to educate our kids in Indian culture, we take them to the temple -- or to the nearest suburban multiplex showing Bollywood movies. This has spawned a wave of Indian-American hopefuls who return to Bombay every year -- or go for the first time, since many of them were born in America -- to try to become stars. But very few succeed; the local producers take their money and laugh at their American accents and their naivete; in desperation, their doctor or software-magnate fathers finance their children's movies, hoping to launch them in Bollywood.
It was not until graduate school that I became cynical about Bollywood movies. I too began to think that the plots were weak, melodramatic. At the University of Iowa's student-run movie theater, the Bijou, I could see two movies for five dollars, most of them European. I was introduced to Renoir, Fellini, Fassbinder, De Sica. I became, for many years after that, something of a cinephile. When I returned to New York I haunted the repertory theaters -- the Thalia, Film Forum, Anthology Film Archives, and, most of all, the Theater 80 St. Mark's.
 The Theater 80 was not a fancy place. It was run by a very old man who owned the prints of all the films he showed, and he showed them over and over again, each film 10 or 20 times a year. This had worn down the prints of the older, more popular films, especially the Bergmans, so that the print skipped, the sound was out of sync for whole scenes and all kinds of dots, flares and blots held wild parties across the screen. Nobody complained. For nowhere else in New York was it possible to see two films for $7, if it was possible to see such films at all: Antonioni, John Ford, Bunuel, Truffaut.
 After this wealth of the world's classic art cinema, the Indian movies seemed pointless and absurd to me (except for those of India's own new cinema -- Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and, for a while, Mani Kaul). It was only when I moved with my family to Bombay in 1998 that I began to get a sense of why Bollywood was important -- to the country and to me. There was a surge of national pride as our movies regularly made the list of top 10 box-office hits in the United Kingdom and started appearing in Blockbusters across the United States. It became acceptable -- in some parts, even hip -- to be Indian, which was not the case when I came to America in 1977. And I found that the Bollywood movies were, in the Indian context, progressive. They eliminated barriers between Hindus and Muslims and Christians (''Amar Akbar Anthony''); rich boys fell in love with poor girls (''Bobby''); untouchables were brought into patriotic service (''Lagaan,'' perhaps the first real crossover hit in the West). 
 The medium fostered new ways of looking at the caste system. And since Hindus and Muslims have always worked together in the determinedly secular Bombay film industry, new if not entirely accurate ways of looking at others, too. Growing up in Bombay with the movies, I had come to understand Muslims as lovable, Christian girls as flirtatious, Sikhs as loyally martial, Parsis as endearingly cracked. The movies trafficked in broad stereotypes, but they were, for the most part, good-natured stereotypes. 
 In 1998, I returned to Bombay to write a book on the city. I became involved in the writing of a big-budget movie, ''Mission Kashmir,'' and got to know the industry from the inside. I was valued in Bollywood because I had stories. I would roam among the gangsters and the bar girls and bring their stories back to the moviemakers. The gangsters and bar girls would give me their stories because I would tell them how the movie people lived, what they wore, what they ate, whom they slept with (mostly their wives). In Bombay, where people live in compartmentalized bubbles, I became a messenger between worlds.
 On one occasion, I went to meet Praveen Nischol, a film producer. He had heard me give a reading at a salon, and he wanted to talk about scripts I could write with him. ''It has to be about something ordinary,'' he told me. ''Onion prices. You and I can wonder why onions are so expensive, and then we discover that there's something more sinister behind it.'' We discussed the world of the beer bars, Bombay's version of geisha bars, which I'd investigated for my book. His last film, ''English Babu, Desi Mem'' (''English Gentleman, Local Girl''), had a bar dancer as the heroine and starred the superstar Shahrukh Khan. He had Shahrukh committed to doing one more film for him.
 Nischol asked about my book, and I described it to him.
 ''I want to throw a couple of ideas at you,'' he said. ''Let's make you the central character. An investigative journalist.''
 ''Ah.'' I nodded.
 ''But more . . . action-packed.''
 One would hope so.
 I met Shahrukh Khan, too. Like Tom Cruise, Khan can singlehandedly guarantee profit for a movie the day he signs on to it. Khan brings his own kinetic energy to his performances. I once watched him rehearse a scene in the film ''Duplicate,'' in which he had to stab the picture of his enemies with a knife, repeatedly, in great anger. As he knifed at the picture, his face glistening with fake sweat, his eyes bloodshot, a lamp in the background burst into flame. The orange plastic filter over it had caught fire. There was not a single fire extinguisher around, and the workers put the lamp out by stamping on it with their feet. I couldn't help thinking of the great classical singer Tansen, who, in medieval times, caused lamps to light spontaneously with the power of his singing ''Raga Deepak,'' ''the Raga of Lamps.''
 But for the most part, as I met the movie people firsthand, they seemed smaller than life. They did their accounts, walked their children to school and worried about their digestion. They worked too hard when away on location to have the multiple affairs that movie magazines like ''Stardust'' reported in every issue. They spoke English well and Hindi badly. (The great secret of Hindi films is that most of the scripts are written in English; an Urdu dialogue writer usually has to be found to translate the dialogue and give it punch. As the writer Ashis Nandy points out, English has been around in India for 200 years; Hindi for 100 years.) I saw them in their homes, I saw them on the sets. I didn't like the sets. Most of the time, on a movie set, people wait. For a writer, it's like watching grass grow. Shahrukh Khan plays video games in his trailer; the others talk endlessly on their cellphones. 
After I returned to America, I met up with some of Bollywood's stars again. A couple of weeks after 9/11, 16 of India's biggest stars got on an American airliner; 4 other passengers got off in fear. Anil Kapoor was reading a copy of Time with Osama bin Laden's picture on the cover; his manager advised him to fold the magazine so that the portrait wouldn't be visible. Aamir Khan reached for an orange and a passenger flinched. They were telling me these stories in the locker room of the Trenton hockey arena, one stop on their road show. They were going to tour 20 cities in 40 days, putting on a vaudeville act for their fans, immigrants from all the countries that love Bollywood. A song, followed by a comedy routine, followed by a re-enacted dramatic sequence from a hit film. 
 In the hockey arena, Aishwarya Rai, the world's second most beautiful woman according to Roger Ebert, was making herself up in the mirror of a bathroom in the basement, which doubled as her dressing room. We talked into the mirror; she talked to my reflection, I spoke to hers. Then she went onstage and I walked toward the backstage. A chorus girl with a purple ostrich-feather headdress, waiting on the steps for her turn on stage, had the hiccups. With each hiccup, her feathers quivered violently. Then the show began, and I was sitting right below the stage, with the photographers. Aishwarya came out clutching a red pillow embroidered with the words ''I love you'' and lifted it above her head. Then she saw me and tossed it lightly to me. I held it for half a second; then I heard the mighty, maddened roar. Thousands of screaming fans wanted that pillow, and hands were thrusting out behind me. Without a second thought, I tossed it over my back.
When we lived in Bombay, my son Gautama, then 4, sang ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' and ''Chal Mera Ghoda,'' in addition to ''Barbie Girl'' and ''Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.'' He was gathering his sources of pleasure from East and West. He was building his own vocabulary of Hindi film music. When he was in New York and missed Bombay, he sang ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' -- which is loosely based on Archie Comics -- on the sidewalks of the Big Apple. An Indian boy in America, singing a Hindi song from an Indian movie imitation of an American comic book: the Ping-Pong game of kitsch. Along with the Bhagavad-Gita and Thoreau, this, too, has wings.
 When we came back from Bombay in 2000, we enrolled Gautama at St. Ann's, a private school in Brooklyn. We were apprehensive about the school; it seemed to be full of rich white kids. How would it take our striving brown ones, with their accents, their utter lack of knowledge of American pop culture?
 One parent was making a documentary film of Gautama's first-grade class. The interviewer asked various questions of the children: What's your favorite color? What's your favorite storybook? When he came to Gautama, he asked him, ''What's your favorite movie?'' ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,'' my immigrant son said immediately. The name was flashed in subtitles, below Gautama's smiling face. None of his friends or their parents had any idea what he was talking about. But the elite school got used to it; the next year, for Gautama's second-grade play, his teacher mounted a Bollywood version of ''The Ramayana,'' and my parents had tears in their eyes as they watched 17 mostly white, rich, private-school kids, dressed in sari scraps, dancing to the irresistible beats of songs from the movie ''Lagaan'' in a school in Brooklyn. Gautama was the golden deer, but Yoni was the wise sage, and Sarah and Sofia were the 10-headed demon Ravana, and Henry was Princess Sita. They were all doing dance moves that were a combination of the classical Bharat Natyam and the decidedly unclassical ones from Bollywood. The 13th-floor dance studio had become a Bombay movie theater. And the immense power of pop culture, the global appeal of Bollywood, had made the unfamiliar . . . family.

I. Get Me Gene Hackman
For the past few years, Hollywood's weekend box-office tallies have come to represent a tidy bit of wisdom about American culture -- cold, bare numbers relayed around the world every Monday morning that tell us which stories and which celebrities are resonating with the moviegoing public. There is, however, another set of Hollywood statistics of enormous significance, and Tuesday is their day. How important are these numbers? Every Tuesday at lunchtime, Mike Dunn and Peter Staddon, the president and executive vice president, respectively, of 20th Century Fox's home-entertainment division, take the elevator from ther 25th-floor offices at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles down to their cars in the underground parking garage and from there drive out into the noontime traffic on their way to Best Buy, Target, Costco and Wal-Mart. Tuesday is the day new DVD's are released, the day Dunn gets a sense of whether the discs that his team has worked on for months -- or sometimes years -- will sell as well as planned. So the Fox executives wander the aisles of the big retailers. They eavesdrop. They size up the clientele. They take note of what's moving through the cash registers. Tuesday, not Monday, is their day of reckoning.
 And in many ways, the same is true for their parent company as well. From about 2002 on, the larger stakes in Hollywood -- the revenue that enables studios to finance blockbusters and to pay Brad Pitt and to keep the lights on -- have come to ride mostly on those little silver discs that go on sale four or five months after a theatrical release. This year, for instance, 63 percent of studio feature-film revenues in the United States will come from movies sold to retail stores; actual box office will generate only 21 percent. According to Tom Adams, a well-regarded home-entertainment analyst whose firm, Adams Media Research, tracks DVD sales and trends, studios often get twice as much revenue from a big film's retail sales as they do from its theatrical release.
 There's a fair amount of disagreement over whether the DVD is becoming the lead in Hollywood or whether it remains a supporting actor. It may well be, as several industry executives told me, that the huge sales of DVD's merely add another variable to the equation for which films get made and which don't. ''We factor it in,'' said Tom Rothman, the chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, ''but it's just one of many things.'' And yet it's not hard to find Hollywood insiders right now who think the movie theater as a communal experience is dying and that big-screen releases have little economic function beyond marketing for DVD rollouts. According to this point of view, the traditional balance in Hollywood -- among money and influence and, at times, creativity -- is shifting toward studios' home-entertainment divisions, which now manage DVD releases (and DVD marketing campaigns) with the same level of care that attends big-screen debuts. The possible consequences are compelling. A studio driven by home entertainment would need to focus less on what kinds of films fill seats at the multiplex and more on what kinds of films sell as DVD's at Wal-Mart. At the same time, in a culture focused increasingly on the DVD, the home theater becomes ascendant -- a familial or even neighborhood gathering spot for new releases, most definitely, but also, perhaps, a venue for character-driven movies or low-budget documentaries that aren't suited for the big time.
 The business of Hollywood, driven as much by relationships and celebrity as it is by economic rationality, doesn't necessarily behave logically. Nevertheless, the major studios -- now owned by publicly traded multinational corporations -- are increasingly aware of the fact that even as their theatrical divisions produce the glamour and buzz, their home-video divisions generate an increasing portion of the cash. (At one studio, they call DVD's ''the corporate A.T.M. machine.'') Like several other home-entertainment executives in Hollywood, Mike Dunn said he is always asked to chime in on the DVD prospects for a Fox film prior to shooting. ''While the movie is being green-lighted by my management, we vote with our financial projections,'' Dunn told me in his office one afternoon in late September. ''So before they say 'Go,' we tally up a number. As a result, they know which movies are risky and which movies, if they have trouble at the box office, we can rescue.''
 In the process, this alternate DVD marketplace seems to be establishing a parallel world -- of movie stars as well as plot lines -- based on what sells best at the big retailers. ''You know, if I could make every movie, I'd put Denzel Washington in every one,'' Dunn said, speaking of what pulls consumers into the stores and to the cash registers. ''Will Ferrell is another star like that -- just huge on DVD. And Gene Hackman. Gene Hackman is like the Good Housekeeping seal on a DVD.'' The executives in Fox's television division, having discovered the tremendous revenue that a season on DVD can bring in, are actually starting to ask for Dunn's input on scripts, he said. But not the movie people. ''If they asked for my input, we'd never make a drama,'' he said. ''Nobody would ever die at the end of a movie. Nobody would ever get sick.''
 Dunn grew thoughtful. ''And the dog would always live,'' he added. Then he grinned at me. ''In fact, he'd be a hero.''

II. The Meaning of 'Fight Club'
Fox's home-video headquarters, high up in a glass tower in Century City, Calif., fronts the grand expanse of the 20th Century Fox studio lot on the Avenue of the Stars. You can measure the difference between the two locations in distance -- a few hundred yards -- or in time. The lot is a dreamy Art Deco showpiece, covering about 80 acres and several gated city blocks, that houses a cluster of vintage screening rooms, a perfectly rendered Lower East Side stage set and a collection of low-slung beige bungalows from the 1930's and 40's where the stars of the day could take a breather from the world (or worlds) of Darryl Zanuck's manufacture. The home-video domain, on the other hand, with panoramic views of L.A. sprawl, comprises a maze of offices and cubicles overflowing with the paraphernalia of advertising campaigns. Here, in many ways, it's a packaged-goods company where past and present are scrambled together into product. Everywhere you find familiar images -- on desks, on walls, on floors -- not just of this year's DVD's but also of a century of film and celebrities.
 At some point in the next three or four years, the VHS cassette will begin to disappear, made obsolete by the DVD; by that time, the number of homes in the United States with a DVD player, now 68 million, will have grown to 100 million. For the consumer, this seems to be a positive example of technology's natural progression: the DVD offers far better picture quality, far more capacity for extra features and greater portability than a videocassette. For the studios, though, the switch from VHS cassettes to DVD's represents something substantially more important: a shift from a rental-model business to the far more lucrative sell-through model. (At the moment, pay-per-view and video on demand are together only a minute part of the home-entertainment audience, probably less than 3 percent.) Meanwhile, the studios have discovered that Americans are increasingly willing to buy movies on disc instead of borrowing them on tape, a commercial evolution that has boosted the potential value of every film. A blockbuster can now generate far more revenue over the course of its 30- or 50-year lifetime, and in certain instances, a box-office laggard can, too.
 The oldies have already proven as much. DVD sales in the United States, which will amount to about $15 billion this year, have been a huge source of cash for those studios with an extensive vault -- particularly Warner Brothers and Disney but also Fox. Last year, the success of issuing movies on disc prompted Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, to declare that the revenue from DVD's had led her investment bank to rethink the financial prospects of the movie business. Out was the studio as spendthrift; in was the studio as cash cow. Such a view has since become a kind of conventional wisdom. This summer's bidding war for MGM, for instance, tentatively won by Sony, eventually reached the $5 billion mark -- even though MGM hardly makes movies anymore. But MGM has a library, estimated at about 4,100 films, that a new owner will be able to mine for DVD's.
 Classic films don't typically sell many millions of copies, as Sony's ''Spider-Man'' DVD did. But they can sell hundreds of thousands of units and bestow windfall millions on a studio. More lucrative still are various blockbusters from the 1970's or 80's. Two months ago, Fox issued the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy on DVD for the first time. ''It brought in $115 million, worldwide, on the first day,'' Steve Feldstein, the senior vice president for publicity at Fox's home-video division, told me. Chewbacca -- played by the original actor, the 7-foot-3-inch Peter Mayhew -- had roamed the home-video floors at Fox Plaza in between promotional events. He'd even worn his Wookiee costume.
 Feldstein and Peter Staddon often used a word I would hear a lot around Los Angeles: ''eventize.'' As in, ''We really need to eventize the hell out of this release.'' For the ''Star Wars'' debut on DVD, that meant parties, paparazzi, robots and a red-carpet treatment that mimicked in miniature the fanfare accompanying a big-screen theatrical opening. A boffo event, in short. Such lavish expenditures also apply to the DVD package itself. The forthcoming ''Spider-Man 2'' DVD, to be released at the end of this month and sure to eventize everything in its path, will contain 10 hours of new content on its two discs, including a 12-part documentary on the making of the film, a featurette on the filming of a single action sequence, bloopers, multiple commentaries and other assorted footage. As a result, the DVD will run about six times as long as the theatrical release. When I asked Ben Feingold, the president of Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, who will actually purchase ''Spider-Man 2,'' he said, ''Some are collectors; some are watchers.'' If past releases are any indication, though, 30 percent will have already seen the movie in the theater and another 30 percent will have seen it on cable; only 40 percent will not have seen it yet. The majority of buyers -- perhaps 80 percent of them -- are likely to watch only the film and leave most of the extras unseen.
 You would think, then, that this typical pattern of DVD consumption -- watching the movie, and maybe some bloopers and deleted scenes -- would prompt industry types like Staddon and Dunn to scale back. It hasn't. ''It's interesting to watch someone buy a DVD,'' Staddon said. In observing customers at Best Buy on those Tuesday road trips, he has noted that the first thing they do is check the back of a new release to see what extras they will get. ''So they're very important in point of purchase,'' Staddon explained, even if they turn out to be irrelevant once they are brought home. What's just as important is that directors have come to see discs, and those extra features, as yet another canvas. That idea of improving a film's value, in other words, applies to its content as well as its finances. ''They're like, 'This is my movie, and I'm going to premiere it on 3,000 screens, but it's going to live forever on DVD,''' Staddon said of the directors he works with. ''They're very conscious of the fact that there are now two different roles that the movie has to fulfill. One is the opening and the theatrical performance, and the other is the archival record of what can be, in some instances, a couple of years' worth of their life's work.'' If there was a milestone that marks this realization, Staddon and Mike Dunn would pick ''Fight Club,'' from 1999, a box-office disappointment that was packaged afterward with audio commentaries from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter and David Fincher (the director), explaining the hyperviolent film from each of their points of view.
 ''Entertainment Weekly gave the 'Fight Club' movie a D and then ranked it No.1 on its list of Top 50 DVD's you need to own,'' Dunn recalled. Such a rating was good for buzz and sales, but this wasn't exactly Dunn's point. At the time, he explained, the financial possibilities of a DVD sell-through market were already becoming obvious. What the magazine's rating really showed was the aesthetic possibilities. When DVD's first went to market, Dunn told me, directors had little interest in shaping the final product. This disc changed things: a DVD could be a new creative form, an opportunity not just for economic redemption (''Fight Club,'' incidentally, is now in the black), but for artistic redemption as well. Not long after, Dunn said, even Warren Beatty started returning his calls.

III. How to Make (and Profit From) a DVD
By early autumn, when I visited Fox, the DVD group had already spent six months strategizing for Ridley Scott's next film, an as-yet-untitled epic that was still shooting and probably wouldn't come out on DVD until a year from now. So far, the choices had been considerable: Should it be a one-disc or two-disc package? Should the DVD group send a crew to the set to get its own ''making of'' footage? What were Scott's own preferences for the DVD? Would the product sell better to the Best Buy demographic (traditionally male, tech-savvy early adopters) or the Target demographic (mostly moms who came late to DVD's)? Ultimately, the questions will be whittled down to the same one that Fox's theatrical division wrestles with: What's the best street date? In a cluttered marketplace, with several dozen new DVD's hitting the shelves every week, a good release date can define a disc's sales and profits.
 A studio like Fox usually works on dozens of DVD's at a time -- from minor television shows to $100 million-plus ''tent poles'' meant to draw everyone in and that entail a marketing blitz mapped out long beforehand. Fox scheduled the release of the ''I, Robot'' DVD for Dec. 14, for example, in part to avoid the November retail juggernauts of ''Shrek 2'' and ''Spider-Man 2.'' Work on this disc began nearly two years ago, when Mike Dunn shared his financial expectations for the film with his bosses, the studio heads Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos, who were in the process of green-lighting it. His was a positive assessment; like Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, Will Smith is an enormous DVD star, giving the film a crossover appeal that reaches beyond age, race and genre. Once the film was approved, the DVD team began working with an independent producer, Mark Rance, who was sent to the set for the shoot in Vancouver to gather footage. In-house producers at Fox oversaw Rance's work. Not long after, the DVD team at Fox decided they would issue the film, at least initially, as a single disc.
 ''I, Robot,'' which cost about $115 million to make and perhaps more than $30 million to market, opened in mid-July and eventually took in about $145million at the domestic box office. During opening week in the theaters, Julie Markell, the senior vice president for domestic home entertainment at Fox, began working on the disc's exterior packaging. When I met with Markell in her office, she told me she has only three seconds to get a shopper's attention with the cover art. ''Here's what we have right now,'' she said, pulling out a pile of images of Will Smith. She had narrowed the choices down to two. And to ensure that shoppers would look, she had designed a corrugated cardboard display for the DVD -- a robot with flashing red lights -- that Fox will send to retail stores.
 Meanwhile, Rance, the producer, had handed in a disc around Labor Day. ''With 'I, Robot,' we had 250 hours of footage,'' he told me. ''That was a nightmare.'' It took him the better part of four or five months, he said, to catalog the extra footage and another few months to edit it down and create menus. His final work was being combined in-house with the main feature, and would soon be sent to a factory in Alabama where the disc would be replicated several million times. Markell's cover art would be printed in Chicago and shipped to Alabama as well. A few weeks later, the package would be assembled there; finally, in early December, the discs will be trucked to retailers around the country.
 Like the other studios, Fox won't talk about its financial expectations for forthcoming DVD's. Tom Adams, the home-entertainment analyst, estimated that the studio was likely to sell between 10 million and 11 million copies of ''I, Robot,'' bringing in perhaps $160 million for Fox -- as compared with the more than $70 million Fox received from the film's $145 million take at the box office in the United States and Canada (box-office gross is split with the theater owners). ''This is one of those titles that will produce twice the revenue on DVD than in the box office,'' Adams said.
 What is less apparent, yet arguably more important, is what that revenue will do for the studio in general. To see how the DVD has done wondrous things for Hollywood's bottom line, it takes only a sheet of paper and a basic knowledge of arithmetic. Bob Alexander, who runs a New York media-consulting firm that tracks trends in the video industry, took me through the home-video accounting. In the early days of VHS, Alexander explained, many home-video divisions were lodged in the music departments of the large entertainment companies. Eventually, home video grew larger and gained independence; later still it moved into DVD's. Yet the manner in which home-entertainment revenues are contracted and accounted for -- who gets profits and royalties, and how much they get -- harks back to the old record deals that mean large profits for the corporation (which was taking the risk) instead of the artist. In the case of the DVD, this arrangement has made the writers' and directors' guilds unhappy. The studios, on the other hand, have found it pleasingly generous.
 ''Let's assume the wholesale price of a DVD is $14.95,'' Alexander began, choosing that number because $14.95 is a typical amount that the studios charge a retail store for a new DVD. Of that $14.95, Alexander explained, about $1.50 covers manufacturing costs and perhaps another $2.50 goes to marketing. ''So, roughly, there's $4 of direct costs per DVD sold.''
 That leaves the studios with about $11 from each DVD. The home-video division then has overhead and a royalty that might add up to $2.50. 
 ''What's left over, nearly $9 per disc, is cash flow,'' Alexander said. ''You can't find it in the statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can't find it anywhere. It's included with theatrical budgets. But this is what pays for all the movies that the studios make.
 ''Whatever the number, whether it's slightly more or less than the $9, nobody has any question about where it's going,'' Alexander added. ''It's the home-video divisions that are paying the budget of the theatrical side.''

IV. The Retailers' Special Effect
To Michael Lynton, the chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the best way to understand what DVD's have done to the marketplace is to go back in time and look at the publishing industry. Until the 40's, Lynton told me, the book business in this country consisted almost entirely of hardcover sales. A big seller sold 100,000 copies. ''Along came mass-market paperbacks,'' Lynton said, ''and all at once Americans could buy books in every town in the country. And the numbers reflected that. A big seller in paperback was selling 5 or 10 million, and it wasn't just new releases, it was also back catalog.'' In his view, the DVD has had a similar populist influence, bringing movies new and old into the farthest corners of the world, all at a modest price.
 There are differences, of course, between paperbacks and DVD's. For one thing, as the studios evolve from purveyors of big-screen experiences to manufacturers of tangible products, they have been forced into relationships with the largest retail stores that are arguably more intense than those between publishers and bookstores. They must negotiate directly, and often fiercely, over everything from prices to advertising support to shelf space. And to a surprising degree, home-video executives keep retailers in the loop on pending releases, hoping to stir up enthusiasm and sales. Gary Arnold, a senior vice president at Best Buy, told me he starts talking to the studios about a film as early as 18 months before its DVD release. ''With a case like 'Shrek 2,''' Arnold said, ''we were looking at bits of the film that DreamWorks had already shot and created 12 months prior, as they were laying out marketing plans and dates. In our meetings with the studios, we also hear about projects that haven't even begun shooting.'' In turn, the chains share information with the studios -- everything from demographic statistics on buyers of new releases to who, in their opinion, is an up-and-coming star. When Fox's Peter Staddon ventures out on Tuesday, Dec. 14, to see who's purchasing ''I, Robot'' in Best Buy, his ritual will be more a quest for anecdotal understanding than hard information. The actual sales data filter in automatically during the day. ''We know what sells on an hourly basis,'' Staddon said. ''Our computers talk to the computers at all the major retailers so that we will get a read as to how these things are selling. So it's not as if they have to tell us. We can just look at our printouts and see what's happening.''
 Over the past few years, a handful of big chains have assumed a near-cartel on retail DVD sales; last year, Best Buy, Target, Costco, Sam's Club, Circuit City and Blockbuster together sold about 42 percent of the discs in the United States. And then there's Wal-Mart. One axiom of the DVD business seems to be that no one discusses Wal-Mart's influence or its negotiating tactics. One Hollywood studio agreed to talk with me as long as we wouldn't broach the subject of Wal-Mart; two other studios stopped speaking with me altogether once the subject of retail relations came up. Wal-Mart itself, which has recently touted its willingness to talk to the press in an effort to repair its image, avoided phone contact and communicated through a series of e-mail messages, its spokesmen claiming that they would like to talk, but that my deadline prevented them from doing so. I offered to extend my deadline. My public-relations contact soon wrote to make it clear that cooperating with me about DVD's would be impossible.
 Wal-Mart's huge market share and desire for privacy almost certainly go together. At the moment, according to Tom Adams, the Arkansas-based chain alone controls about 22 percent of the overall DVD market in the United States and up to 40 percent on any one hit title. ''They have enormous power,'' Adams said. ''They've got the locations, the traffic, the customers. Therefore, how a title does depends on them.'' Mike Dunn at Fox agreed in large part with this assessment. I asked him whether a film could succeed if it didn't hit big at Wal-Mart. ''Not a big film, no,'' he said. Yet he does believe that a smaller title, for instance one done by Fox's Searchlight division (its most recent release was ''I Huckabees''), could succeed through Amazon.
 Wal-Mart and Best Buy make for a curious contrast. While the demographics of Wal-Mart shoppers probably reflect the demographics of America's moviegoing audience, that's probably not the case with Best Buy, the Minnesota-based electronics chain that currently has about 11 percent of the DVD market but is known for selling extraordinary quantities of effects-heavy DVD's to men in their late teens and 20's. Tom Adams, for example, strongly believed that Warner Brothers' quick green light of ''Matrix'' sequels was influenced by the original film's huge DVD sales at places like Best Buy. Several people high up at Fox acknowledged that ''Alien vs. Predator'' was the kind of film for which the financial upside from a DVD at Best Buy made it a far more appealing studio project. Thus, if the Wal-Mart effect tends to accentuate the retail value of generic blockbuster films that have been propelled through theaters a few months before by a $30 million or $40 million marketing hurricane, the Best Buy effect specifically accentuates the retail value of action-effects films, even if they're not blockbusters at all. ''Hellboy,'' a special-effects-laden adaptation of a comic book, ''did only around $60 million in box office,'' Best Buy's Gary Arnold told me. Then Columbia TriStar released the DVD. ''We've had huge response with the consumer,'' Arnold said. ''Now we're releasing 'Hellboy: Director's Cut.' Then we're releasing a 'Hellboy' box set.''
 Meanwhile, the question of what sells seems to lead to the question of what doesn't sell. Or in some cases, what never even gets distributed to retailers. Bob Chapek, the president of Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment, said that the limited shelf space at the major stores has made it increasingly unappealing for studios to acquire smaller projects for distribution. ''You can have a very big appetite for acquiring titles -- independent films, foreign films -- when people are buying everything and can't get enough,'' Chapek told me early one morning in his Disney office in Burbank. ''Now, with the normal output of all the studios together, plus rereleasing old movies on catalog, plus TV shows on DVD, you may acquire a film. But are you really going to find a market for it?''
 Less and less, it would seem. Which is not to say that the marketplace isn't voting in other, very specific ways. Fox recently came to the conclusion that there was an enormous untapped opportunity for Christian DVD's. Mike Dunn said that Fox had begun developing Christian-fiction content at the direct-to-video level, which means it will not go through theaters but will instead be distributed nationally to Christian book stores and Wal-Mart. The first project, ''Hangman's Curse,'' based on a Frank Peretti Christian mystery, came out last year. It sold well, and there's more to come. ''The only thing that's holding us back now,'' Dunn said, ''is the amount of product we can produce.''

V. Coming Attractions
One day in Los Angeles I paid a visit to Warren Lieberfarb, the former president of home video at Warner Brothers who was dismissed two years ago after an acrimonious dispute over compensation. Lieberfarb, who now works as an industry consultant, remains a polarizing figure in the home-video world, both widely liked and disliked; his new job is described by some in the industry as a sad fall from grace, which in Hollywood apparently means that a $10 million severance agreement, a tony office in Brentwood and lucrative advisory relationships with Microsoft, Toshiba, Best Buy and Miramax are the stuff of tragedy.
 Lieberfarb's ambivalence about the direction the industry has taken since the DVD arrived on the scene is striking. ''I think in Hollywood's search for tent poles -- product that has mass-audience appeal, not only to moviegoers, but perhaps to retail shoppers -- the inspiration to appeal to other audience segments is being neglected,'' he told me. ''Everyone's trying to hit home runs.'' Lieberfarb has in fact begun to wonder if those smaller films -- what he calls the singles and doubles that appeal to people of different age groups, different educational levels, different geographical areas -- are mostly being left out of the selection process. ''What seems to me ironic,'' he continued, ''is that as the baby-boomer generation ages and becomes the empty nesters, that group may find itself without the fare that helped them bring about the renaissance in moviemaking that characterized the late 1960's and 1970's. Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, Woody Allen -- it's not only those directors, it is by definition the subjects and actors they're interested in. They tend to be story-driven and character-driven rather than special-effects driven.''
 What's surprising here is that the DVD as a medium almost certainly would not have succeeded were it not for Lieberfarb. In the early 90's, Lieberfarb was the main advocate for a format change, believing that the VHS and the movie-rental business, while lucrative for the studios, was also something of a dead end. Thus came the idea of the DVD, with a technology similar in many ways to that of the CD. You can't look at a DVD and CD under a lamp and see a difference. Both have a microscopic, spiral track -- lined with millions of tiny bumps -- that begins at the center of the disc and curls around and around until it reaches the disc's edge. An infrared laser reads those bumps and converts the readings into bits of data, which in turn get converted to a visual signal that is transmitted to your television. But compared with the CD, the DVD can store tremendous amounts of information (it has a thinner track and more bumps) which made its acceptance in Hollywood possible. (A full-length movie, never mind hours of added features, could never fit on a CD.) By the mid-90's there were two similar DVD technologies vying to be first to market: a consortium led by Sony and Philips championed one, a Lieberfarb-led consortium that included Warner and Toshiba backed another. Lieberfarb brokered an agreement between the two sides, so that by the time DVD players and DVD's arrived in stores in the spring of 1997, there was only one format. That was good for the consumer; it was also good for Warner Brothers, which owns nearly a dozen patents on the disc technology. A few pennies on every DVD sold, in other words, still make their way to TimeWarner, a royalty that has probably earned the company tens of millions of dollars over the past few years.
 That may not continue. At the moment the studios are divided over the next format, one for high-definition television, that they hope to bring to market by 2005. Sony and Philips have led a group that has created something called Blu-ray discs; Lieberfarb, meanwhile, is consulting with Toshiba on a high-definition disc -- the term usually tossed around is HD-DVD -- that improves upon the present DVD technology. Both sides are trying furiously to recruit as many studios to their side as possible. Michael Lynton, at Sony, aligns with the Blu-ray developed by his parent company. Mike Dunn told me Fox has not officially committed to either side. Universal, Paramount and Warner Brothers have not chosen. The same is true for Bob Chapek at Disney. When I asked Lieberfarb whether he was optimistic for his side, he shrugged and threw up his hands. All of a sudden, he said, the studios seemed unable to choose between the two formats.
 Several home-video executives think a war is possible, meaning that both formats could go on the market at the same time, with the result of confusing consumers and, quite possibly, sinking the new technology before it ever catches on. Yet assuming that one version wins out (both have advantages), you have to wonder whether it will further redefine the industry as the DVD did or merely pester Americans with another added expense. ''There are two camps of people,'' said Chapek, who in addition to running Buena Vista's home entertainment business is also president of the Digital Entertainment Group, the trade association that promotes digital technology. There are those who think the next-generation format will be the second coming of the DVD, he said, and there's another camp that thinks it will be a niche business. ''The conversations we're having now,'' Chapek added, ''are exactly the kind of conversations we were having six or seven years ago with the DVD. We're living through it again.''
 Chapek, like most of the other video executives I spoke with, has high expectations for what either format could do for the content. The sound and picture would be better, but the new discs would also have far more capacity and be more interactive. The games on current-technology DVD's, for instance, especially those for kids, are rudimentary. That could change. Even more important, a new-technology disc would offer a far better encryption than what currently exists on DVD's. This might not quash piracy completely, but it would be an improvement over the current situation. ''We could put the genie back in the bottle,'' said Fox's Dunn.
 I asked Lieberfarb what another new format would mean for the industry's future -- whether he thought it would further change the way Hollywood does business. He waved the question away. In his view, the game board isn't confined to the studios and the films they make, or even to the retailers they wrangle with. A product like the DVD has rippled through the entire computer, consumer-electronics and entertainment industries, he said. Any widely accepted new format hops from one venue to another and defines the way we use those products; in ways subtle and not so subtle, it also defines the way we live.
 Lieberfarb allowed that high-definition discs may affect content in some as yet unforeseeable way. ''But at the guts of this battle is patent portfolios,'' he said. ''Consumer electronics and personal computers typically find themselves commoditized. But patent portfolios give the patent owner the ability to collect a toll that isn't subject to the marketplace.'' Or to put it another way, it's not who makes more cars that matters, it's who owns the road. ''This is a big-time industrial battlefield,'' Lieberfarb continued. ''It's Silicon Valley, and Seoul, and Tokyo, and Hollywood.'' And the companies that win the format war, he concluded, will win big. The movies, whatever form they take, will still be the movies.

VI. The Big Picture
It's striking that many of the people who work directly on DVD's -- the home-entertainment producers, directors and marketers -- seem to feel they are involved with something revolutionary and hugely disruptive. On the other hand, the higher up the pecking order you go inside the studios, the more likely you are to hear that the DVD, while making a big difference to consumers and being far more profitable than the VHS cassette, has not fundamentally changed the way the industry functions. Consider the view from the top: the office, in Building 88 on the studio lot, of Tom Rothman, the Fox co-chairman. Rothman has an intense energy and a big resonant voice that gives you the impression that everything he says -- and he says a lot -- could be written in capital letters. He wasted no time in communicating his belief that at the end of the day, it's not the flood of revenue from DVD's, it's not the patent portfolios and it's not Gene Hackman. It's the story that matters. ''I'm a traditionalist,'' he told me, echoing a point I'd heard elsewhere -- that if Rothman discovers a truly exciting script, he and his partner, Jim Gianopulos, will make it. ''Here, the culture is still driven by one thing: make hit movies. Make movies that people want to see. Gee, that sounds easy. Well, it's not so easy.''
 It's not that Rothman feels the DVD hasn't changed some parts of the business; he agreed that the format had emphatically altered consumer behavior and the way we experience movies at home. He also acknowledged that DVD sales are a factor in the green-lighting process and can help boost the prospects of an action-effects drama. But the sales of almost all DVD's, he pointed out, correspond with how well a film performs in the theaters. And how well a film performs in the theaters is still a measure of how much it captivates moviegoers. As Rothman put it: ''You still need to make good movies -- to make movies that excite the audience. And in many ways, unlike what you're going to hear in a lot of places, I believe that home video puts even more demand to make sure that we're making good movies. Because now you're asking consumers to buy the movies.'' 
 Rothman makes a persuasive case (he happens to be a former entertainment lawyer), yet it contrasts significantly with what people lower in the studio ecosystem told me, both at Fox and elsewhere. When I talked with Mark Rance, for instance -- the ''I, Robot'' DVD producer who has also produced DVD's for a slew of other big movies, like ''Cast Away'' and ''Magnolia'' -- I asked if he thought DVD's had begun to shape the content of films. ''I think something interesting has happened,'' he replied. ''I think theatrical died about a year ago. And where you see it is where you always see changes -- in the lesser films, in the films the studio won't back with huge marketing campaigns.'' With increasing frequency, he said, those smaller movies get a two-week run, then disappear. ''What we're used to is the 19th-century theatrical experience: you go to a theater with a large group of people, you see a movie and enjoy it with a crowd,'' Rance continued. ''That's being replaced now by, like, 20 people in your living room, like a book club, watching a film they might not have heard of.''
 Some positive results may yet come out of this, he added. A film like Fox's ''Dreamers'' -- a Bernardo Bertolucci project, briefly in theaters last winter, for which Rance produced the DVD -- could easily be rediscovered in this environment. Rance said he also hoped that DVD-based ''microcinemas,'' small independent theaters already present in some cities, could catch on around the country, offering a forum for independent filmmakers to give their films their premiere and get word of mouth going so they can also sell them on DVD. ''We're probably at that stage now where the romantic version of the social experience of film is disappearing,'' Rance said. ''I don't think it's permanent, but I think it's going to shift to something that the older generations don't have in their head yet, something they can't imagine.''
 This shift might be along the lines of what Chris Blackwell -- the founder of Island Records who started Palm Pictures in Manhattan a few years ago -- is already pursuing. Palm acquires independently made features and documentaries for distribution in theaters and on DVD, but the company also finances inexpensive projects by writer-producers who frequently work with digital cameras. The idea here is that digital auteurs can make personal or visionary films, often with a music element or theme. ''I want Palm to be in the forefront of marketing and releasing films that are actually made on digital video,'' Blackwell told me. ''What digital video does is sort of democratize the visual business. The costs are so much less.'' Moreover, the parallels between signing up filmmakers at Palm and signing up bands at Island Records (Blackwell signed U2, for example) are not coincidental. He thinks DVD will soon be a factor pushing handmade digital documentaries and feature films into clubs, as well as theaters, around the country. ''The studios wouldn't be interested because it's way below their radar screen,'' he noted. ''It's too small. If something breaks out and has the potential to be successful, it will go to the major theaters. Otherwise it will go to clubs, which have a good sound system.''
 It seems entirely possible that Rothman, Rance and Blackwell could be right about the future without any of them being wrong. The big-screen-to-DVD apparatus that Rothman commands could well remain intact, shaped by the tension between art and commerce that has always been present in the film industry. And the DVD-small-venue market that Rance and Blackwell foresee -- driven, presumably, by a high-definition disc like Lieberfarb's that would come close to the resolution of 35-millimeter film -- would result from the very same tension that now pushes films without nuclear explosions or intergalactic travel toward the cultural margins. It may also be the case, as Rance argued, that the precursors of such a small-film society are here already. The difference in quality between big home screens and small art-house screens is becoming less and less discernible. Consumers are gathering in private groups to watch the Christian DVD dramas Mike Dunn's team is starting to market. Organizations like MoveOn have distributed political films like ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' for house parties. A more defined marketplace, and a more developed grapevine, for small-venue discs, might not be far behind. 
 You have to wonder if this would be such an unfortunate turn of events. Large or small, films would still be judged on the same merits that Rothman anguishes over: good scripts, good acting, good execution and excitement. And in the demi-underground of digital film, the world need not freeze over with special effects, as in ''The Day After Tomorrow.'' The dog need not be a hero. And would that, after all, make for such an unhappy ending?

BALLAD OF THE WHISKEY ROBBER
A True Story of Bank Heists, Ice Hockey, Transylvanian Pelt Smuggling, Moonlighting Detectives, and Broken Hearts.
By Julian Rubinstein.
Illustrated. 319 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $23.95.
 IN the real-life saga of Attila Ambrus -- the Hungarian national folk hero, gentleman bank robber, former gravedigger, Zamboni pilot, fur smuggler and hockey goalie -- Julian Rubinstein has found a story of the sort that would make even the most dry-mouthed journalist slobber. Sometimes sad, often hilarious and always absurd, Ambrus's tale microcosmically condenses the politico-historic oddities of his place and era into one entertaining and fairly tidy narrative. ''Ballad of the Whiskey Robber'' is set amid the flash and contradiction of Budapest in the 1990's, when Russian mobsters and American entrepreneurs were moving in on the ruins of the state-controlled economy with equal voraciousness.
 Ambrus, an ethnic Hungarian fleeing Ceausescu's Romania, arrived in Budapest penniless in 1988. A year later, of course, the wall came tumbling down, and the Iron Curtain along with it. Almost overnight, Budapest leapt from cold war drear to Vegas neon shimmer. The factories closed, making room for shiny new boutiques, bordellos and casinos, though with inflation and unemployment rampant, only gangsters, tourists and crooked politicians could afford to frequent them.
 At the time, Ambrus was living in a horse paddock -- ''a former horse paddock,'' his friend and landlord insisted -- working as a janitor for a struggling hockey team, and selling fountain pens door to door. When even his promotion to unpaid second-string goalie failed to impress his girlfriend's parents, he began smuggling pelts out of Transylvania. That venture was short-lived. Ambrus, who had routinely blown his profits at the casino, was forced to find a new career. So one night he got drunk, threw on a wig and shook down a post office.
 Soon he had graduated to banks, preferring the state-owned variety. His logic: ''We're robbing the state, but the state is robbing us. The difference is we're not causing damage to anybody.'' Always well mannered despite his consistent drunkenness, over the next seven years Ambrus committed 29 robberies, outwitting the corrupt and incompetent police force at every turn. In a country where public adulation of lawbreakers would have been unthinkable just years before, the so-called Whiskey Robber attained the celebrity status of a Dillinger. If capitalism had turned Hungary into a nation run by crooks, Ambrus's depredations came off as honest.
 With a keen eye for the ridiculous, fearlessly high-speed prose and an extraordinary wealth of reported detail, Rubinstein conducts the affair like an unusually thoughtful carnival barker. His biggest shortcoming is his resolute sunniness, which at times collides with the prevailing Mitteleuropean gloom. This leads to occasional flights of glibness -- ''Times had certainly changed in the decade since the fall of Communism. Didn't Karoly just love it.'' -- but more often betrays a squirming discomfort at any real unpleasantness. Central Europeans have long known how to wring laughter from their suffering. Rubinstein, blessed with the humor of a more fortunate native land, does not seem to know what to do with the misery that fuels his protagonist. When Ambrus curls up on the floor with his dog and weeps all night, Rubinstein appears embarrassed and quickly shuts the door on the scene. But it's hard to blame Rubinstein for wanting to keep the story fun, especially when he succeeds so well.

HEADLINE: Box Factory Will Close in Milford

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
A PLANT in Milford that manufactures corrugated boxes could wind up needing its own product during the next several weeks.
 The Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation of Chicago recently announced it will be stopping production at its Milford plant by Dec. 15 and closing it by the end of the year. Lisa A. Esneault, spokeswoman for the company, said 74 hourly workers and 23 salaried employees would be affected. 
 Ms. Esneault said the closing would make the company more efficient.
 ''Part of the company's strategy is to effectively service their market and capture synergy with the container division,'' she said. ''They're trying to find out what the best mix of business is, and what locations should remain in operation.''
 Ms. Esneault said Smurfit-Stone had 150 such factories in the country, including another one in Connecticut, in Portland. She said the company was trying to place some of the Milford employees ''within our system.''
 Carl A. Turner, the international vice president of the Paper, Allied-Industrial Chemical and Energy Workers International Union in Nashville, which represents workers at the plant, blamed the closing on foreign competition.
 ''We're losing so many jobs overseas,'' he said of the union. ''It's having a devastating effect on the plants here in America.''
 Mr. Turner said the union was trying to get federal money to retrain workers losing their jobs.
 ''They'll have to find employment elsewhere,'' he said. ''But it's going to be difficult to find jobs that pay the rate they are accustomed to.''
 Bob Gregory, the director of economic development in Milford, said the city would also help find jobs for displaced workers.
 ''We're not happy about the closing,'' he said. ''But it's the effect of the globalization of business.''
 Mr. Gregory said the city was confident another business would move into the building at 74 Cascade Boulevard. He would not elaborate.

HEADLINE: For New York Evangelicals, a Political Conversion

BYLINE: By ANDREA ELLIOTT; Marjorie Connelly and Jennifer Medina contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The signs are all around. Storefront churches dot the commercial landscapes of the Bronx and Queens. Twice as many churchgoers -- about 15,000 -- pray weekly at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, compared with five years ago. Some 200,000 New Yorkers tune in daily to Radio Vision Cristiana, an AM radio station. And last March, thousands of evangelicals gathered on the steps of the State Supreme Court in the Bronx to protest the idea of same-sex marriage.
 Evangelism is flourishing not just in the red states of the nation's heartland, but in the urban, liberal stronghold of New York City, where thousands of evangelical churches are anchored in working-class neighborhoods. Whether it will evolve into a local political force, as it has nationally, remains an open question. But a range of interviews with pastors, congregants and religious experts suggests that a new debate -- and perhaps a political conversion -- is taking place in parts of the city's minority neighborhoods, swaths that Democrats have long claimed as their own.
 It is a conversion that prompted Jeanmarie Salazar, a Puerto Rican mother of four in the Bronx, to vote for President Bush even though his economic policies troubled her. And a conversion that caused Harold Thompson, an African-American from Flatbush who lived through the civil rights movement, to part with a lifetime of voting Democratic, citing the ''immorality that is destroying our country.'' 
 Both Ms. Salazar and Mr. Thompson belong to evangelical churches whose leaders have spread a single but potent message: Faith trumps everything else, even traditional party alignments.
 ''They're beginning to think about the social transformation of New York City,'' said Tony Carnes, a sociologist of religion at Columbia University.
 Precisely determining the number of people who consider themselves members of evangelical churches or movements is difficult. Mr. Carnes said that he conducted a census of the city's evangelical churches and estimated that 1.5 million New Yorkers attend them. A separate study, conducted in 2000 by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, put the number of evangelical New Yorkers closer to 1 million, said Vivian Klaff, a professor of sociology at the University of Delaware who analyzed the study's data.
 If a fully accurate count of evangelicals in the city is difficult to achieve, it is even harder, at the moment, to define the voting patterns of evangelicals. But the number of Protestant New Yorkers who cast ballots for a Republican president more than doubled in the last four years, to nearly a quarter of those surveyed at polling sites by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. And a recent study by Mr. Carnes suggested that a majority of evangelical church leaders in the city were breaking with tradition and voting Republican: of 1,006 ordained ministers surveyed last year, Mr. Carnes found, 55 percent said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush.
 About 30 percent of the ministers were black and 30 percent Hispanic, reflecting the demographic breakdown of the religious group, Mr. Carnes said.
 ''It's a significant development,'' said Randall Barnes, a professor of American religious history at Barnard College. But, he added, the Republican Party in New York City is ''still a decade or two away from making significant inroads into that community.''
 Any measuring of the political clout of evangelicals in the city, now or in the future, is complicated by the fact that a sizable portion of them are from other countries, and some are not eligible to vote, said Mr. Carnes, who conducted his study with a team of pollsters at the International Research Institute on Values Changes, an independent research group in New York City. The study was financed by the Christian Cultural Center, a charismatic evangelical church.
 But the results indicated a shift to the right among voting evangelicals. In a separate study he did in 1997, Mr. Carnes said, only 22 percent of the city's evangelical church leaders surveyed identified themselves as ''politically conservative.'' 
 In the aftermath of the election, an increasingly complex image has emerged of the Christian electorate -- one that is not entirely captured under the religious right rubric. In New York City, there are the evangelicals who consider themselves liberal and voted for Kerry but find that they are missing from the mainstream image of their faith.
 But then there are those, like Mr. Thompson, who broke with tradition for the first time to vote Republican.
 And while many New Yorkers have loudly voiced their sense of alienation from the faith-based vote of the red states, the city's evangelicals, in numerous interviews, said they felt a similar invisibility in the Democratic stronghold they call home.
 ''You feel like you're alone,'' said Abraham Lopez, 19, as he stood on a recent Saturday outside the Assemblies of United Christian Churches on Third Avenue in the South Bronx. 
 Perhaps no single event better captures the group's presence than a same-sex marriage protest on March 14 in the South Bronx.
 Led by State Senator Ruben Diaz, 150 Bronx churches closed for the day. They sent their congregants to the steps of the State Supreme Court on the Grand Concourse where thousands of people -- estimated at 8,000 by Mr. Carnes, who used two methods to count the crowd -- filled the streets. A large banner hung between two pillars, reading, ''No to Homosexual Marriage.''
 ''We said, 'Sunday nobody goes to church; we'll go to the street,''' said Mr. Diaz, one of the most noted of the city's Hispanic evangelicals. Mr. Diaz, whose South Bronx district includes about 250,000 people, is both an evangelical pastor and a registered Democrat. 
 ''I am a conservative Democrat,'' Mr. Diaz, 61, said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. ''When it comes to education, when it comes to health, when it comes to jobs, I'm a Democrat. When it comes to moral issues -- marriage, abortion -- I'm not a Democrat.''
 Mr. Diaz has a history of stirring controversy with his conservative stands on same-sex marriage and abortion. In 1994, after he organized a voter drive for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , Mr. Diaz, then a city councilman, vocally criticized the Gay and Lesbian Olympic Games. Mr. Giuliani then issued a statement distancing himself from Mr. Diaz's views. In 2003, Mr. Diaz filed a lawsuit, which is still pending, against the city over the opening of a small public school for gay students. He defends his positions unflinchingly, saying things like he ''cannot wait'' for the reversal of Roe v. Wade and eagerly admitting that gay rights activists have picketed his church.
 Several political strategists who have worked with Republicans and Democrats said that no one with Mr. Diaz's conservative views would be able to win a citywide or statewide office. But in local city politics, like races for the State Assembly and the City Council, the faith-driven agenda might have greater impact.
 ''In a Democratic primary where you take the party affiliation question out of play, then I think it could become a more powerful influence,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political strategist whose clients have included Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Pedro Espada Jr., who lost to Mr. Diaz in the primary this year, said he had no doubt that the evangelical movement could sway local politics. Mr. Espada, who was ousted from his Senate seat by Mr. Diaz in 2002, tried to reach out to evangelical voters by visiting Bronx churches.
 ''They would say, 'Espada, we would vote for you but you are not a Christian,''' Mr. Espada said. But other politicians were more skeptical that the group's members would be driven by religion when they entered the voting booth.
 Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president who is running for mayor, said, ''Issues of faith and family matter, but so do issues of how we support our families, equal access and opportunity, housing, education, health care, jobs.'' 
 While Hispanics and African Americans in New York City have traditionally voted Democratic, those who attend evangelical churches may feel a different pull. 
 Jose Casanova, a professor of sociology who specializes in religion and politics at New School University and has studied evangelicals around the world, said that even if they are poor, they tend to vote for conservative candidates.
 ''They do not so much identify with their economic position right now, but with the one they ought to have with the help of God,'' he said. ''They are very conservative and pro-market and do not expect the government to help them.''
 It is not clear how pervasive this view has been in New York City's evangelical community. But the Rev. A.R. Bernard has made a point of preaching economic independence and social conservatism at the Christian Cultural Center, where more than 90 percent of congregants are African Americans or black immigrants.
 ''We are teaching them self-reliance,'' Mr. Bernard said. ''We have a whole new generation of people of color who have grown up without legal and racial barriers. They have experienced unprecedented wealth, unprecedented education, a position in the marketplace. So once you have something to conserve, you become more conservative.''
 Mr. Bernard, who said he voted for President Bush, does not publicly endorse candidates. However, he did tell his congregants that they should question the tendency to vote along traditional party lines.
 Two of his church's members, Raina and Robert Bundy, said they decided to vote for Mr. Bush by following the news, watching the debates and, ultimately, praying over their choice. Like many African Americans, they said they were brought up to vote Democratic, but now compared the tradition to their mothers' old recipes for collard greens.
 ''We don't use fatback, it's all about olive oil now,'' Mrs. Bundy said. ''You don't keep cooking something even though you know it's not good for you.''

HEADLINE: Montana Democrats Reflect on Success

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont., Nov. 11 

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, a Democrat with true power in the statehouse of Montana has been about as rare as a palm tree on the high plains. But this week, while Democrats elsewhere are moping through the last days of a prolonged wake, the Big Sky party stalwarts cannot stop pinching themselves.
 On election night, as President Bush was winning all but a half-dozen of Montana's 56 counties, the Democrats took every statewide office but one. They gained control of the governor's office and the State Senate and came within a single legislative victory of sharing control of the State House. They did it with the kind of candidates who may offer some hint as to how the party can find its way in the vast inland sea of Republican red.
 The Democratic governor-elect, Brian Schweitzer, is a rancher who knows fertilizer from fungus, and can spit and talk health care at the same time. Between hugs, high-fives and hastily called news conferences from his makeshift office under the Capitol rotunda here Wednesday, he was as worried about his cattle as his cabinet. 
 ''I've got to get my cattle off the high ground and get them castrated before the winter,'' said Mr. Schweitzer, a whirl of energy in a pair of blue jeans.
 In the campaign, he never shied away from talking about faith, or his family's attachment to the land. ''I'm the grandson of homesteaders who lived in a sod house,'' he said in an interview. ''We were raised Democrats and we are family people. Voters needed to know that.''
 He also ran with a Republican as lieutenant governor -- by his choice, ruffling the feathers of some members of his own party. But John Bohlinger, his running mate, is a ''John McCain kind of progressive Republican,'' Mr. Schweitzer added.
 His success is not unparalleled. There are now four Democratic governors in the interior West, in Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado elected a new Democratic senator, Ken Salazar. And the Democrats had some history to draw on here, a state that has one Democratic senator, Max Baucus, and voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 before it moved sharply to the Republicans. 
 Still, even Republicans here are tipping their hats to the Democrats for neutralizing difficult cultural issues like same-sex marriage, which was also on the ballot here, and being willing to blur party lines. ''It's very unusual, in fact, I don't think it's ever happened for their gubernatorial candidate to run with a Republican, but it worked,'' said Chuck Denowh, the executive director of the Montana Republican Party. ''And on gay marriage, all the statewide Democrats were against it.''
 Democrats themselves said their success came from their choice of close-to the-ground candidates, their efforts to make sure people knew they stood with the state's majority on social matters like same-sex marriages or guns, and their decision to turn to economic issues. 
 ''We defined ourselves before the other party could,'' said Brad Martin, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party. ''And then we ran on things like the fact that we lead the nation in percentage of households where people have to work two jobs, and we're at the bottom for average wages.''
 When the subject of gay marriage came up, Democrats looked the other way, or in most cases took the same side as 67 percent of voters did in favoring a state initiative that banned same-sex marriage.
 To dispatch the gun issue, always trouble for open-space Democrats, the party organized sportsmen to show up at gun shows armed and pro-Second Amendment. There, they talked about hunting access and how wildlife habitat was threatened by Republican policies.
 And their candidates were hardly outsiders. Not only was Mr. Schweitzer a rancher in a state where cattle outnumber people by more than two to one, the leader of the newly Democratic State Senate, Jon Tester, is an organic grain farmer who lives on his family's prairie homestead. In the campaign, he hit the road in his pickup, traveling to dying little towns on the windswept eastern plains to talk about how poor Montana has become under Republican leadership.
 ''I'm just a dirt farmer, but I know rural Montana is hurting big-time, and the Republicans weren't doing anything to help it,'' Mr. Tester said. He grows barley, peas and lentils on the family farm near the little town of Big Sandy (population: 710).
 ''I bought a new pickup on Sept. 1, and between then and Election Day I put 8,500 miles on it talking about the same thing: how to help small businesses and farmers,'' he said. ''Not one person asked me about gay marriage.''
 Republicans say they were hurt by the extreme unpopularity of their outgoing governor, Judy Martz, who decided not to run for a second term after three out of four Montanans told pollsters they disapproved of her job performance. She had entered office saying she wanted to become ''a lapdog for industry.''
 There were embarrassments and scandals on Governor Martz's watch. After a nasty primary that split Republicans, the party settled on Secretary of State Bob Brown, who was defeated by Mr. Schweitzer by nearly five percentage points.
 Democrats say their success came from concentrating on kitchen-table economic issues in a state with a history of scrappy class warfare.
 They hammered away at utility deregulation, which has led to higher power bills in a state that once had some of the nation's cheapest electrical costs. They criticized tax breaks given to large corporations, even as good jobs continued to disappear.
 ''Montana is known as the Last Best Place,'' said Dave Wanzenried, the House Democratic leader. ''But after a long period of Republican rule, we became the best place to be last.''
 Opposing gay marriage and adding a Republican to the top of the ticket upset some of the Democratic faithful, leaders said. But the Democrats have been out of power for so long -- it has been 20 years since they last elected a Democratic governor -- that it forced a unified message, with tight discipline.
 Mr. Schweitzer, 49, constantly talked up plans to lift Montana from the bottom of all 50 states in wages. He says he wants to slow the collapse of rural Montana by finding new use for crops like mint (it can be added to low-grade diesel fuel, he said) and plans to pool small businesses to give them more leverage in purchasing health care.
 In this state, which has a population of just under a million, family values were all about trying to keep young people from moving away because of the poor wage foundation, Democrats said.
 ''We have what I call a salmon economy -- all our young leave the state and then they come home to die,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. ''That's what I want to change. Because this state has a mystique like no other.''
 Republicans say this may be the Democrats' high-water mark. They note that Montana's lone representative in Congress, Denny Rehberg, a Republican, won by a larger margin than Mr. Bush, who took 59 percent of the vote on Election Day.
 ''It's going to be a short-lived majority in the State Senate,'' said Mr. Denowh, the state Republican Party head. ''Especially if they try to push for something like civil unions for gays.''
 Political experts said the election proved, at least on the local level, that the big red states are not lost causes for the right kind of Democrat. And for all those Democrats now poring over Thomas Frank's book ''What's the Matter with Kansas?'' on why Democrats get crushed on the prairie, Mr. Martin, the state party head, suggests another query.
 ''Maybe some of the answers for Democrats are in looking at what's right in Montana,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Putin Uses Soft Power to Restore the Russian Empire

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN is not subtle. 
 As the presidential campaign climaxed late last month in Ukraine, a country once dominated by Russia's czars and commissars but now free to choose its own way, Mr. Putin went to Kiev for three days of politicking on behalf of the candidate who promised to strengthen bonds with Moscow.
 That candidate came in a close second to one advocating closer ties to Europe -- another way of calling for greater independence from its big neighbor. On Friday, barely a week ahead of the runoff, Mr. Putin was in Ukraine again. 
 In the language of international diplomacy this is known as interfering in another country's internal affairs. For Mr. Putin, however, it is an increasingly typical feature of what might be called Russia's soft imperialism.
 From the edges of a new Europe to the Caucasus to Central Asia, Mr. Putin is wielding Russia's considerable resources -- and his personal clout -- to keep those countries in what Russians call the ''near abroad'' under the sway, if not outright domination, of the Kremlin.
 He has used Russia's economic levers -- above all, its oil and gas, often sold at discounts -- to bind its neighbors into an ever tighter dependency. He has countered the American military buildup in Central Asia that followed the Sept. 11 attacks with a buildup of Russian forces in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
 In Moldova and Georgia, Russia has openly abetted separatist regions by refusing to keep its commitments to withdraw its troops. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, it has also granted Russian citizenship to thousands who, technically, are citizens of other countries, an act that makes them candidates for the special attention of Kremlin diplomacy.
 Mr. Putin is not rebuilding the Soviet Union. But he is trying to forge an economic, social and military facsimile, with Moscow again at the core, in all but three of its former republics. The notable exceptions are the Baltic nations, which irrevocably severed the old chains and now belong to NATO and the European Union. Elsewhere, despite new national identities that took root after the Soviet collapse, he appears to be succeeding.
 ''Russia is on its way to recover the degree of soft power the U.S.S.R. once enjoyed in its immediate sphere of influence,'' Fiona Hill, an expert with the Brookings Institution, wrote in a recent study for the Foreign Policy Center in London, referring to the economic power and cultural influence that once accompanied the far harder power of the troops and security apparatus that controlled the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
 It is no surprise that Mr. Putin, like any leader, would consider it his right to protect what he sees as the country's interests in its extensive backyard, especially now that the United States, the European Union, China and others are actively pursuing their own business and strategic interests there. But some of his policies and pronouncements have revived fears of Russia's long shadow.
 In Poland, a former Soviet satellite, a scandal has erupted over allegations of bribery and espionage involving a Russian agent and the country's largest oil company. ''We are facing a restoration of the Russian empire through economic means,'' Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, the former chief of intelligence, told a parliamentary inquiry last month.
 Indeed, the rebound of Russia's economy after the financial crisis of 1998 has given Mr. Putin new leverage with which to counter the economic and political incentives the West is offering Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the countries of Central Asia to lure them out of Moscow's embrace.
 Russia has the advantage of proximity and old ties, as well as linguistic bonds, because Russian remains the language of commerce and diplomacy throughout the region. Even more important, it has oil and gas. With demand spiking, even the United States is scrambling with China and Japan for access to Russia's wells.
 As Stephen O'Sullivan, the head of research at the United Financial Group in Moscow, put it, ''Oil and gas is what makes Russia important to a lot of the world.''
 Mr. Putin, who not long ago called the Soviet collapse a ''national tragedy,'' is clearly eager to reclaim for Russia some of its status as a superpower. And there is more to it than economics. The perceived losses of the Baltics and, more recently, of Georgia have been treated in Russia as a blow to national prestige. 
 That is what has made the outcome of Ukraine's election so evidently vital to Mr. Putin. Despite gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine retains deep ties to Russia because it spent centuries under Moscow's rule. Many Ukrainians are ethnic Russians. Kiev, Ukraine's capital, was the birthplace of the Russian state and Russian Orthodox Church.
 NOW, President Leonid D. Kuchma's decision to step down after 10 years has opened up a fiercely contested fight over the country's future. Mr. Kuchma himself zigzagged between Russia and the West, but he has thrown his support to Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, who has made it clear he feels the country's interests lie to the east. And that makes Mr. Yanukovich the candidate favored by Mr. Putin over Viktor A. Yushchenko, who wants to balance trade with Russia with expanded ties to Ukraine's European neighbors.
 ''This election is not about Yushchenko or Yanukovich or even Ukraine,'' Hryhoriy M. Nemyria, director of the European Center for International Studies in Kiev, said in an interview after the first round of voting. ''It's about Russia.''
 He said a victory for Mr. Yushchenko in the runoff would amount to a public humiliation of Mr. Putin, at home and abroad. ''The perception would be that Ukraine escaped, like Georgia,'' he said. ''It would be like the escape of a little sister from the family.''
 And that is almost certainly why Mr. Putin arrived again on Friday on what the Kremlin called a routine visit, promoting closer relations and announcing new ferry and rail links.

HEADLINE: Whose Moral Values? The Debate Goes On

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As a blue state Democrat, I've recently learned that my moral values are very different from those promulgated in the red states. A few examples of things I consider highly immoral: 
 $(6$)Invading a sovereign country, causing the needless deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis.
 $(6$)Torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and in Afghanistan in direct violation of international accords. 
 $(6$)Spreading fear and prejudice for political advantage. 
 $(6$)Shamelessly misrepresenting facts to mislead others into believing falsehoods, then refusing to set them straight. 
 $(6$)Ignoring the millions of Americans recently driven out of work and into poverty by a weak economy, while bestowing millionaires with tax breaks they don't need. 
 $(6$)Paying superficial lip service to inclusiveness, while inciting cultural conflict to win elections. 
 Somehow, the manufactured perception of President Bush's moral clarity trumped the reality of his policies. It was the Democratic Party's ultimate failure to communicate clearly that he should take responsibility for the crass immorality of these acts that cost it the election. 
 I cannot begin to comprehend how so many good churchgoing, God-fearing people could be driven by their fear and faith to overlook the cynicism and corruption of these acts. It is they and not we who need to re-examine their beliefs.

HEADLINE: Turning a Traditional Time to Get Into a Lesson in Giving

BYLINE: By KAREN ALEXANDER

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
IT is Monday morning at the Gideon Hausner Jewish Day School, and a room full of seventh graders is hard at work analyzing the mission statements of charities. 
 Philanthropy is not just a value at this school; it's a class, like English, math and history. This one is called Avodah La'Olam, which is Hebrew for ''the work of the world.'' 
 Rather than simply encouraging students to give of their time or money, some schools are teaching them how to do so more effectively. ''It's about walking the walk,'' said Laura Heller Lauder, a parent at the school and a member of the family that controls the Estee Lauder cosmetics empire. ''We talk the talk about how we should help make the world a better place. It's important for them to walk the walk, and learn how to actually do it.'' 
 Over the school year, seventh graders at Hausner narrow their choices to one organization they want to research, and present their findings to their classmates.
 Instead of giving each other gifts for their bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies, the students pool the money into a common fund. Then, based on each other's presentations, they decide how to allocate the money among the various causes their classmates have chosen.
 ''I want them to realize this is a way of life, not just a project,'' said Jason Epstein, their teacher.
 Michelle Bromberg, 12, says she will raise money to fight breast cancer, the disease that killed her grandmother. Avi Arfin, also 12, will focus on groups that fight terrorism in Israel, and his classmate Jesse Lehrman, 13, will research depression. 
 Frank Schiff says he is determined to do something about African hunger. Frank, who is 13, celebrated his bar mitzvah in August, which meant that a month later he fasted for the first time on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. 
 ''When I did that,'' Frank said, ''I thought about how it must feel to do this for a week straight, or two weeks straight, or to always be starving, and I hated that feeling. I wanted to do something about it.'' 
 There are approximately two dozen colleges and universities that offer master's degrees on the nonprofit sector, and a small but growing number of schools that provide formal instruction in philanthropy to students in kindergarten through the 12th grade, said Kathryn A. Agard, executive director of the Michigan organization Learning to Give. 
 A project of the Council of Michigan Foundations, Learning to Give seeks to encourage the teaching of philanthropy in schools, and offers teachers more than 800 lesson plans through its Web site at no cost.
 At Hausner, it is still early in the school year, and the seventh graders' work is just beginning. First, the students were required to develop a personal mission statement to guide them through the process. Later, they will write essays about their chosen cause, and use math and economic skills to scrutinize their organizations' effectiveness and financial performance.
 After that, they will perform volunteer work in the field they are studying, and interview the heads of nonprofit groups to determine if the organizations' values are in line with their own.
 ''The hardest part was choosing which organization to represent,'' said 13-year-old Michal David, who is in eighth grade. 
 Michal eventually settled on an organization that helps abused and neglected children in Israel; it was the same group that her sister had worked for a couple of years earlier, when she was in seventh grade. Michal's family visited the agency when they were in Israel, and both girls maintain a relationship with it. 
 Michal said she was deeply touched by the project, not only because of what she learned about her organization but also by the presentations of her classmates.
 ''I wouldn't say that I was naive before, but we go to school in such a sheltered environment, and I never really saw what goes on in society,'' Michal said. In light of her experience, she has recently become the social action coordinator at her synagogue.
 Beyond the choices, there's the money, which exceeded $21,000 last year. 
 The family of each student is asked to contribute $18 in honor of the bar or bat mitzvah ceremony of each student in the class. (There are 33 seventh graders this year, which comes to nearly $600 a family.) In addition, the students will hold car washes, write relatives, donate baby-sitting money and write proposals to foundations to raise even more.
 Whatever additional money they can generate beyond the pool of bar mitzvah gifts will be matched by grants from Ms. Lauder and Kathy Levinson, a Silicon Valley social advocate and philanthropist who is the former president of the E-Trade Financial Corporation. Ms. Levinson is also a parent at the school. 
 Come springtime, these seventh graders will face the heady task of deciding how to allocate the money they've raised among the organizations they have come to know, and in many cases, love, over the year.
 They make their gifts at a ceremony attended by representatives from many of the organizations. ''The final presentation is like a big proverbial sigh,'' said Mr. Epstein, the teacher.

HEADLINE: Since 9/11, Muslims Look Closer To Home

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
THE crackdown on Islamic charities since Sept. 11 has led to a shift in giving by Muslims in America: far more of their donations are going close to home, instead of overseas.
 Groups that have become vocal advocates for Muslim civil liberties have seen big increases, but the change has been felt by smaller groups as well. 
 For instance, when the first free medical clinic for the Muslim community opened its doors to the poor in a neighborhood in South-Central Los Angeles in 1996, few of its donors were Muslims. Most of the financial support for the center, the University Muslim Medical Association Community Clinic, came from foundations and the government, said Yasser Aman, the clinic's chief executive and president. 
 Last year the clinic's holiday mailing brought in twice the amount of donations that came in 2001, although the increase was on a modest scale, to $37,000 from $16,000. But Muslims around the country have also recently opened about six more free clinics modeled on the Los Angeles example, Mr. Aman said. 
 ''It's a religious obligation to give, but people do not necessarily feel comfortable sending money overseas,'' Mr. Aman said. ''They are moving toward giving to local communities.''
 Since Sept. 11, the government has designated 27 Islamic charities as financiers or supporters of terrorism. Most are international relief agencies that for years canvassed the mosques and raised millions. 
 Perhaps in response to the crackdown, donations have increased substantially to some national Muslim groups that have become civil liberties advocates. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group based in Washington, has nearly doubled its annual budget since 2001, to about $3 million -- and that is just for the Washington office, said Nihad Awad, the council's executive director. The group's branch offices have also increased, to 29 in 2004 from nine in 2001, and each office raises money for its own budget, he said. 
 Only three years ago, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, based in Los Angeles, had an annual budget of $300,000. In the last two years the group raised $700,000 to $800,000 annually, and contributions could top $1 million this year, said Salam Al-Marayati, the council's executive director. 
 For American Muslims, the crackdown on charities has complicated a core religious practice. Giving to charity, called zakat, is an obligation -- one of the five pillars of Islam. A central principle of the faith is that everything belongs to God, and Muslims are merely trustees of God's wealth. Muslims are expected to give 2.5 percent of their assets each year, and many donate during the holy season of Ramadan, which just ended. 
 Islamic law says that zakat is supposed to be given to those who need it most -- orphans, the homeless and dispossessed. For years, Islamic relief agencies won the loyalty of American Muslim donors by appealing on behalf of fellow Muslims suffering in war-torn areas like Chechnya, Sudan, Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 Of the 27 Islamic charities that the Treasury Department has designated as supporters of terrorism, five of them had offices in the United States. One of those five, a global network known as the Islamic American Relief Agency, in Columbia, Mo., was shut down as recently as October. In all these cases, Treasury Department officials say they froze the charities' assets without a trial, saying they are confident of the terrorist ties. To many Muslim leaders, the evidence is flimsy.
 Last week, a federal judge in Chicago ruled that two frozen Islamic charities must pay damages to a family whose son was killed in a terrorist attack in the West Bank. Lawyers for the charities argue that the groups had nothing to do with the killing.
 A handful of international Islamic relief groups in the United States remain in business. One is KinderUSA, in Dallas, which provides emergency supplies, malnutrition programs and trauma counseling primarily to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 Some of the groups shut down by the government are accused of funneling money to the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Dr. Laila Al-Marayati, the chairwoman of KinderUSA (and the wife of Salam Al-Marayati), said her charity tried to prevent donations from falling into the wrong hands by giving vouchers instead of cash or food. ''We pay the vendor,'' she said. ''That stimulates the local economy and takes cash out of the picture, so someone can't give the money to a relative who uses it for nefarious purposes.''
 Nevertheless, many mosques now refuse to allow international aid groups to raise money on their premises, said Nazih Hassan of the Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor, Mich., which has a mosque and a school. His mosque is an exception, but he said many Muslims there were afraid to contribute for fear they would be investigated by the government. The mosque raised $36,000 last year for one relief group, but this year raised only about $4,000, he said.
 Mr. Hassan said that for many Muslims, giving money to American Muslim mosques, schools and advocacy groups was a ''remote second choice'' to donating to poor and suffering Muslims overseas. ''The religious obligation is to help the people most in need,'' he said.
 In an attempt to reassure donors, Muslim leaders have asked the Treasury Department to create a ''white list'' of acceptable Islamic charities. But after two years of discussions, this proposal is going nowhere. 
 ''You can't have the U.S. government picking favorites in a multibillion-dollar industry,'' said Juan Zarate, chief of the finance unit at the department. ''Not only are there market concerns, but there are potentially First Amendment concerns.'' 
 Mr. Zarate encourages Muslim leaders to form self-monitoring organizations, using as models groups like the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability or the Better Business Bureau. 
 But Dr. Laila Al-Marayati said a Muslim-only monitoring group would scarcely reassure donors. ''People care a lot about the suffering of their brothers and sisters throughout the world, and they want to give money legally,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Goal Is Met. What's Next?

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
American military commanders say the weeklong assault that has wrested most of Falluja from insurgent control has achieved nearly all their objectives well ahead of schedule and with fewer pitfalls than anticipated. 
 But where do the United States and the government of the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, go from here? 
 In the coming weeks, the two allies must still combat a resilient and dangerous insurgency operating in most of Iraq, accelerate a huge economic reconstruction effort and lay the groundwork for elections to be held in January.
 One goal of the offensive in Falluja was to eliminate a major safe haven for insurgents in Iraq, a hub for assassinations, car bombings and ambushes from Ramadi to Baghdad and beyond. Another was to allow the city's 250,000 residents to take part in elections. 
 Registration is under way elsewhere in Iraq, so commanders will face pressure to secure areas to permit Iraqi electoral commission employees to work. Commanders and American diplomats in Iraq are hoping that once rid of insurgents, cities in the Sunni heartland north and west of Baghdad will join the political process, despite calls by some Sunni groups last week to boycott elections. 
 But enormous obstacles remain to meeting these military, economic and political targets. ''The Falluja operation will be a military success, but whether it's the key to political success will remain to be seen,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee who visited Iraq on Friday and Saturday, in a telephone interview. ''The insurgents are working hard to derail this, and commanders are expecting widespread violence leading up to the elections in January.'' 
 Military commanders point to several accomplishments in Falluja. A bastion of resistance has been eliminated, with lower than expected American military and Iraqi civilian casualties. Senior military officials say up to 1,600 insurgents have been killed and hundreds more captured, altogether more than half the number they estimated were in the city when the campaign began. 
 The offensive also shut down what officers said was a propaganda weapon for the militants: Falluja General Hospital, with its stream of reports of civilian casualties. 
 But American and Iraqi officials still face daunting tasks in the aftermath of retaking the city.
 ''Falluja clearly will require a lot of effort even after the final pocket of insurgents is eliminated in the city,'' one senior American general in Iraq said in an e-mail message on Sunday. ''Lots of challenges -- infrastructure, basic needs for returnees, security forces, and governance, not to mention elections. Assume the insurgents will continue to try to make life tough there as well.'' 
 Outside Falluja, the insurgency rages on, amid intelligence reports that the battle has become a big recruiting draw for young Arab men in mosques from Syria to Saudi Arabia. American commanders acknowledge that hundreds of fighters and their commanders, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant whose network has carried out many of the kidnappings, beheadings and bombings, slipped away before the offensive. 
 American commanders say they expected that the fight for Falluja, coinciding with the end of the holy month of Ramadan, would set off a surge in violence across the country. But the scope and size of the attacks in Mosul last Thursday stunned American officers who were scrambling Sunday to regain the initiative. 
 ''Our experience is that, after battles in which they lose many fighters, the insurgents require some days to gather, treat their wounded and try to figure out what to do next,'' Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, charged with controlling northern Iraq, said Sunday in an e-mail message. ''Our job is to work to not let them rest and to not allow them time to reset.''
 In Baghdad, where attacks were increasing even before the Falluja offensive, Army soldiers said insurgents in at least one part of the capital had shifted their tactics this week, massing in limited numbers in their attacks on Americans, instead of shooting from the shadows and rooftops, or carrying out ambushes with roadside bombs. 
 ''Overall, yes, the anti-Iraqi forces have been more aggressive or stupid, depending on one's perspective,'' Sgt. Rowe Stayton, an infantry fire-team leader in northern Baghdad, said Sunday in an e-mail message. He said his troops killed 15 insurgents and wounded 6 others, without suffering a single casualty. 
 But commanders say they are baffled over how to combat an effective intimidation campaign that insurgents are waging against Iraqis, from political leaders and police chiefs to the women who do the laundry for troops at American bases. 
 ''People are affected every day by criminality,'' said Senator Reed, a former 82nd Airborne Division officer. ''The situation has not -- is not -- turning around.'' 
 American officials boast that about 100,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped, and many are fighting side by side with Americans, including 2,500 Iraqis in Falluja. But many of those forces have only the most basic training and still lack critical equipment like body armor, radios and vehicles.
 ''The good news is that significant numbers of Iraqi security forces are standing their ground and fighting all over north-central Iraq,'' Maj. Gen. John Batiste, commander of the First Infantry Division based in Tikrit, said Saturday in an e-mail message. ''Our hard work is paying off.''
 But not everywhere. Last week, scores of police officers in Mosul fled their stations under attacks, allowing militants to loot half a dozen stations and steal police vehicles, uniforms and hundreds of weapons.
 With most international aid organizations having withdrawn from Iraq because of the conditions, and many contractors skittish about sending workers into areas still vulnerable to insurgent attacks, more United States troops will be called on to provide security to allow reconstruction to move ahead. 
 The Pentagon has extended the tours of about 6,500 troops to help with security, and senior commanders say that for now, the more than 140,000 American forces in Iraq should be enough. But enough for what, exactly? The experience of Falluja in the next few weeks may be instructive. 
 ''The operational lesson is that 'taking' cities is comparatively easy, but that 'holding' them is harder and ultimately decisive,'' said one Army officer who just returned for a year's duty near Falluja. ''And that fight is largely one for Iraqis, not Americans, to win.''

HEADLINE: Decades Later, Rosenberg Case Again Ignites Passions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The Rosenberg clan -- the circle of defenders and sympathizers that has come together for half a century on behalf of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg -- gathered once again yesterday, but this time the emphasis was as much on family as it was on politics. 
 A documentary film about the case and its consequences for the Rosenberg family made by a granddaughter of the couple, Ivy Meeropol, was shown at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, in Lower Manhattan. The Rosenbergs were convicted of passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union and were executed in 1953.
 Many of the 200 people in the audience carried placards a half-century ago pleading for clemency for the Rosenbergs. They and others were in tears at seeing the film, titled ''Heir to an Execution: A Granddaughter's Story,'' stung not just by what they consider a miscarriage of justice but also by how it has continued to haunt the family. 
 The Rosenbergs' sons, Michael and Robert, were 10 and 6, respectively, when their parents were executed. They were adopted by two left-wing intellectuals, Abel and Anne Meeropol, soon afterward. The sons have wrestled with cables disclosed by the C.I.A. a decade ago that indicated Julius Rosenberg was a spy with the code name ''Liberal'' during World War II. 
 Since then, ''my brother and I have had to live with the possibility that unlike the lies told about them before, this could be true,'' Michael Meeropol, now 61 and a professor of economics at Western New England College in Springfield, Mass., said in an interview before the film was shown. ''And we've asked ourselves, what does it mean if it is true? We can live with that and we can live with the ambiguity of never being sure.''
 His daughter, Ivy, 36, is shown in the film wiping away tears as she looks at photographs and archival film of the Rosenbergs as a seemingly unremarkable Lower East Side couple idling on the grass in Central Park and hoisting their children on their shoulders at the beach. Then there are the jarring contrasts after their arrests -- of the Rosenbergs kissing desperately in a van carrying them to jail or their sons ambling among the tall walls of Sing Sing prison to visit them in the weeks before they died in the electric chair.
 Ivy is shown deeply upset as she tries to contact relatives who still do not want to have anything to do with the family and at letters sent by Ethel telling her sons that she loved them but that she and Julius ''could not wrong our conscience.''
 One audience member, Ruth Alscher-Green of Manhattan, was a teacher who was questioned by a grand jury in the case but was never charged. Because she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, she said, she could not find a teaching job for six years. As a mother of three children, she still has trouble understanding why Ethel Rosenberg did not do more to save herself.
 ''From Ethel's point of view, she might have had to make up something to accuse Julius and exonerate herself, and maybe that's not something she wanted to do,'' Ms. Alscher-Green said. ''It's hard for me as a mother. I would have done anything to keep alive for my children. But I have a greedy soul.''
 The Rosenberg story is like the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Alger Hiss spy case and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- one of those events with enough loose threads and charged feelings to inspire passions that have lingered for decades. It also is an emblem of an era when tens of thousands of young people, despairing at the Depression and the persistence of poverty, joined the Communist Party, with some willing to betray their own country. In the film, Miriam Moskowitz, who befriended Ethel in jail, said, ''You had to be dead from the neck up not to feel radical.''
 The Rosenbergs, along with their friend Morton Sobell, were charged with passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during World War II, when the Soviet Union was an ally.
 Julius Rosenberg, who came from a Yiddish-speaking immigrant home and studied electrical engineering at City College, was accused of recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, a machinist in Los Alamos, N.M., where the first atom bombs were being designed, as a spy. Mr. Greenglass, testifying for the prosecution, said that he had obtained crude sketches of a cross-section of the bomb and a crucial device known as a high-explosive lens mold and passed them to Julius. To spare his wife, Ruth, prosecution, he testified that Ethel had typed many of Julius's messages, a charge he recanted many years after the trial.
 Despite various disclosures during the years about Julius Rosenberg, defenders have argued that the information he passed was inconsequential and was already known by the Soviets. The defenders have drawn the most sympathy in arguing that Ethel's role was at best secretarial. In answer to a question, Mr. Meeropol said that a judge, Irving Kaufman, and two prosecutors, Irving Saypol and Roy Cohn, tried to show how tough they could be on fellow Jews to avoid setting off criticism from anti-Semites. 
 Josephine Abrams, 79, a retired teacher from Manhattan, said she came to the museum to remember ''a horrifying time, a hysterical time.''
 ''Anyone who signed a petition or carried a placard could be thrown into jail, and maybe executed,'' she said. ''We're living in such a scary time now that maybe the same thing could happen again.''
 From the stage, Mr. Meeropol made a similar comment. He said the fact that the Soviet Union had built an atomic bomb did not justify shredding Constitutional rights, and that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, did not justify trampling on the rights of Arab or Muslim immigrants. 
 ''It remains a cautionary tale,'' he said of the Rosenberg case. ''It's the most extreme example of when you let government have their way with political prosecutions and just to be safe you're willing to give up some freedoms.''

HEADLINE: Are Charities Stuck On Address Labels?

BYLINE: By JIM SCHACHTER

 BODY:
DIRECT-MAIL fund-raisers by nature are copycats. If a gimmick works for one, others adopt it. Macy's tells Gimbel's: Even competing charities meet often to exchange ideas, not to mention to barter lists of prospective donors. 
 But the world of raising big dollars in small increments is divided over the future of one of its most important tools: the return address label.
 Scores of charities mail hundreds of millions of the personalized stickers to would-be donors each year. And while many groups say that labels remain one of the most cost-effective ways to raise money, a few worry that the copycatting is resulting in diminishing returns.
 The Paralyzed Veterans of America, a charity that has used address labels in its fund-raising for 25 years, decided 18 months ago to begin weaning itself from the labels because costs were rising and donor response rates were dropping sharply. More than anything, said Mark Dowis, the Washington-based group's associate executive director, the problem is that the supply of labels has outstripped the demand.
 ''As with any good idea, competitors jump into the marketplace,'' Mr. Dowis said. ''What you get in direct mail is mailbox fatigue.''
 The veterans' group raised 90 percent of its $80 million in contributions last year from direct mailings, including 75 million pieces of mail that contained a free gift -- a calendar or greeting cards or, most commonly, address labels. These are such a big part of its fund-raising that for 20 years the Paralyzed Veterans owned a direct-mail company, PEP Direct, in Wilton, N.H., that made stickers for itself and other charities. 
 But changing economics prompted the group to decide 18 months ago to shift fund-raising away from direct mail, and in August the Paralyzed Veterans sold PEP to a Manhattan company, Quadriga Art. 
 Five to seven years ago, the group received donations from 15 to 20 percent of people who got its mailings for the first time. ''Those numbers are now probably 50 percent of that,'' Mr. Dowis said. Older donors respond strongly to label mailings, he said, while younger people -- whom charities want for future growth -- ''tend to be very cynical, and we tend to be much more discerning.''
 Still, many organizations remain fully committed to labels. ParadyszMatera, a research group in Manhattan, said that 26 percent of health, nature and relief charities used address labels in solicitations in the first three months of 2004, up from 23 percent a year earlier. ''They work better than anything else,'' said Carol Portale, vice president for direct-response fund-raising at the March of Dimes, the White Plains-based group whose programs counter premature births and birth defects. ''Address labels are perceived as having value,'' she said. ''They're perceived as something you can use.'' 
 Nonprofit lore credits the Disabled American Veterans with originating the use of address labels as a fund-raising tool. Susan Loth, director of fund-raising for the organization, said that in the early 1970's, the D.A.V. began using labels to replace key chain-size replica license plates in its mailings. From its headquarters in Cold Spring, Ky., where most of the employees are veterans and their family members, the group sends out more than 41 million letters a year containing labels. 
 ''A lot of people kind of joke and say, 'I've got enough that I could wallpaper with them,' '' Ms. Loth said. ''But we don't have any diminishing returns.''

HEADLINE: TEAMSTERS FIND PENSIONS AT RISK

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
In the 1960's and 1970's, the Teamsters' huge Central States pension fund was a wellspring of union corruption. Tens of millions of dollars were loaned to racketeers who used the money to gain control of Las Vegas casinos. Administrative jobs were awarded to favored insiders who paid themselves big fees. A former Teamster president and pension trustee was convicted of trying to bribe a United States senator.
 Yet for nearly half a million union members who are expecting the fund to pay for their retirement, those may have been the good old days.
 Since 1982, under a consent decree with the federal government, the fund has been run by prominent Wall Street firms and monitored by a federal court and the Labor Department. There have been no more shadowy investments, no more loans to crime bosses. Yet in these expert hands, the aging fund has fallen into greater financial peril than when James R. Hoffa, who built the Teamsters into a national power, used it as a slush fund. 
 The unfolding situation holds a hard lesson for others with responsibility for retirement money. What may appear as a sensible, conventional approach to investing -- seeking a diversified mix of growth and income investments for the long term -- can wreak havoc when applied to a pension fund, especially one in a dying industry with older members who are about to make demands of it. 
 But the kinds of investments that make sense for such a fund -- like long-term bonds that will mature as members enter retirement -- are not attractive to most money managers, because they generate few fees. Consequently, very few pension funds use such strategies today.
 At the end of 2002, the pension fund had 60 cents for every dollar owed to present and future retirees -- a dangerous level. In a rough comparison, the pension fund for US Airways' pilots had 74 cents for every dollar it owed in December 2002, just before it defaulted. During the bear market after the technology bubble burst, Central States' assets lost value as its obligations to retirees ballooned, causing a mismatch so severe that the fund had to reduce benefits last winter for the first time in its 49-year history.
 ''There never were benefit cuts in the 1970's,'' said Wayne Seale, 52, a long-haul driver from Houston and one of about 460,000 Teamsters participating in the fund. ''We were happy. We were being taken care of.''
 If the pension fund fails, it will be taken over by a government insurance program. In that case, some Teamsters would lose benefits.
 Hoffa and his successors had put an extraordinary 80 percent of Central States' money into real estate. Instead of hotels, casinos and resorts, its new managers -- first Morgan Stanley and later Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan -- invested the money mostly in stocks, and to a lesser extent, in bonds. At the end of 2002, about 54 percent of the fund's assets were in stocks, somewhat less than the average corporate pension fund, which had about 74 percent of assets in stocks that year, according to Greenwich Associates, a research and consulting firm. 
 Federal law calls for fiduciaries to invest pension assets the way a ''prudent man'' would, and the strategy used for Central States would certainly be familiar to wealthy individuals, philanthropic trusts, university endowments and other pension funds. The fund's investment results in recent years closely track median annual returns for corporate pension funds, according to Mercer Investment Consulting. 
 The assets lost 4.5 percent of their value in 2001 and 10.9 percent in 2002, but gained 25.5 percent in 2003, according to the fund's executive director and general counsel, Thomas C. Nyhan.
 Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Goldman Sachs defended its record, pointing out that it had exceeded its benchmarks in a very tough market. 
 But the Central States situation shows that using stocks or other volatile assets to secure the obligations of a mature pension fund greatly increases the risk of getting caught short-handed in a down market. If that happens it can be nearly impossible to bring the ailing pension fund back. This is what has happened recently to pension funds at United Airlines and US Airways.
 ''Stocks are not a hedge against long-term fixed liabilities,'' said Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University who has long challenged conventional pension investment strategies. ''For many, many years, right down to the present day, the dominant belief among pension investment people is fundamentally wrong. Now that's a big problem.''
 The record of a second big Teamsters' pension fund, covering members in the West, bolsters Mr. Bodie's arguments. The Western Conference of Teamsters fund has long shunned stocks and uses a totally different investment approach, a portfolio of 20- and 30-year Treasury bonds and other high-grade fixed-income securities that are scheduled to make payments when its retirees will be claiming their money. The Western Conference pension fund was not perceptibly hurt by the bear market. 
 If the Central States were a younger pension fund, it could wait for the stock market to improve and bolster its value. But it already has more than 200,000 retirees collecting benefits of more than $2 billion a year. 
 The companies that employ its members currently put in about $1 billion a year. Its trustees, made up of union officials and company representatives in equal numbers, have contemplated raising employer contributions, but the unionized trucking sector has financial problems, and for many companies a higher contribution would be a hardship. The biggest and wealthiest participating company, United Parcel Service, has been trying to leave the pension fund altogether.
 The unionized trucking industry was more stable before deregulation in 1979, and so was the Central States pension fund. In the 1970's, the fund's assets grew by as much as 10 percent a year, according to some media reports from that period. Luck played a big part in that success, because the decade was a bad one for stocks and bonds. Thus, the fund made better returns on its unorthodox real estate portfolio than it would have on a conventional mix of investments. The unionized trucking sector was younger, too. And it was growing, so there was more money available from employees and fewer pensions coming due.
 Starting in the early 1960's, the fund loaned tens of millions of dollars for investments in Las Vegas casinos, including the Desert Inn, Caesars Palace, Stardust, Circus Circus, the Landmark Hotel and the Aladdin Hotel, according to a history by Edwin H. Stier, a former federal prosecutor hired by the union as part of its efforts to clean house.
 The loans in those days typically involved a front man who signed the papers and a crime family raking off cash behind the scenes. The loan approval process involved kickbacks, threats and, in at least one case, a kidnapping. By the time Hoffa disappeared in 1975, the Central States pension fund had loaned an estimated $600 million to people connected with organized crime, according to Mr. Stier, who resigned his union appointment in April after questioning the union's ongoing commitment to rooting out corruption.
 But many of the loans did serve their intended purpose, making money to pay for Teamsters' retirement benefits. The hotels, casinos and other real estate projects, not all of which were connected to organized crime, were generally profitable, according to Mr. Stier, and before his disappearance Hoffa saw to it that his loans were repaid.
 By 1977, after years of indictments, prosecutions, Congressional hearings and murders, federal regulators pressured the Central States trustees to resign and turn over the fund's assets to an independent money manager. The 1982 consent decree reduced the trustees' powers permanently, requiring the pension fund to choose an outside fiduciary from America's largest 20 banks, insurance companies and investment advisory firms.
 The first to be named fiduciary was Morgan Stanley. Its duties were to pick money managers, to allocate the assets among them and to advise the new board of trustees on investment objectives and strategies.
 As it happened, Morgan Stanley got the Central States mandate at a time of explosive growth in the money-management business. A landmark pension reform law had been passed in 1974, requiring all companies to set aside enough money to make good on their pension promises. With assets piling up in trust funds as a result, money managers were competing fiercely for a piece of the business.
 Money managers promised pension funds big returns, and to get the big returns they began to add riskier assets to pension portfolios than pension funds had used before. Sleepy bond portfolios were livened up with stocks. Venture capital, junk bonds, securities of companies in developing countries and other exotica began to appear in pension funds. 
 These investments could be risky, but the industry argued that losses, even big losses, in one year did not matter because a pension fund was a long-term proposition; over time, the losses would be recouped by even bigger gains. Buoyant markets reinforced this thinking in the 1990's, even though by then unionized trucking was in deep decline, and the Central States' ratio of active workers to pensioners was shifting perilously.
 Records for the Central States pension fund are not complete, but they indicate that Morgan Stanley kept pace with industry trends, shifting the fund into stocks, particularly international stocks.
 By 1997, more than one-third of the pension fund's assets were invested abroad, records show, far more than the norm for such funds. Greenwich Associates surveyed union pension funds in 2003 and found that international equities made up less than 3 percent of their total assets.
 A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the Central States investments, citing a policy of not discussing relationships with past clients. He pointed out, however, that international stocks did relatively well in the late 1990's.
 Morgan Stanley was replaced as fiduciary by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan in 1999 and 2000. (Bankers Trust served as fiduciary very briefly.) A spokesman for Goldman Sachs noted that his company inherited many of Morgan Stanley's investments and added, ''Over the five years we have managed the fund, our performance has exceeded the relevant benchmarks.'' A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan cited a policy of not discussing clients' business.
 When the stock market crashed in 2000, the Central States pension fund had big bets on technology and telecommunication stocks, energy trading companies and foreign stocks. Some of these stocks became nearly worthless. But the resulting carnage was not apparent to many rank-and-file Teamsters until last winter, when plan officials announced that benefits would have to be curtailed.
 Meanwhile, drivers were making their retirement plans.
 Tommy Burke, a U.P.S. driver in Fayetteville, N.C., had been planning to retire in 2005, when he would turn 60, and go into the restaurant business. But when the pension fund reduced benefit accruals, it also began enforcing a rule that pensioners could not re-enter the work force, under penalty of having their pensions stopped. Mr. Burke, frustrated, began to research the pension fund on his own, trying to learn just what had happened. In an annual report for the plan, he was shocked to see a reference to a $77 million uncollectible loan.
 ''How in the world can you have an unsecured loan in the amount of $77 million?'' he asked.
 When an official of the pension fund visited his union local hall this year, Mr. Burke put that question to him, but the answer only upset Mr. Burke more.
 ''He said it wasn't a loan at all,'' Mr. Burke recalled. ''It was shares of stock in a bank in Russia, and it went belly up.'' Mr. Burke said he didn't understand why pension money had been used to buy something so risky, if the Labor Department and federal court officials were monitoring the pension fund.
 The Labor Department does not generally regulate investment strategy, however. It was watching for signs of self-dealing, racketeering or other flagrant abuse. From that perspective, the fund was progressing well. 
 Some Teamsters say more complete answers lie in the official progress reports for the pension fund, maintained for the federal courts as required by the consent decree. But those are secret. The New York Times and the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a reform group within the union, have filed motions with the federal district court in Chicago to make the documents public.
 The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is legally separate from the pension fund, commissioned independent investment and actuarial analyses of the pension fund in November 2002.
 But the study's findings have not been released to the membership.
 Many rank-and-file Teamsters complain that their questions about the pension fund have been met with bromides about unforeseeable market forces, and about an unusual convergence of stock market losses and low interest rates that is always described as ''the perfect storm.'' They are unconvinced.
 ''If this was all about the stock market and this 'perfect storm,' why weren't all these funds affected the same way?'' asked Pete Landon, a truck driver from Detroit who participates in the pension fund.
 The best clues may lie in the Western Conference of Teamsters pension fund. In the 1980's, when the Central States plan was shifting from real estate into stocks, the Western Conference trustees, acting on actuarial projections of future pension benefits, put together its conservative portfolio of high-quality bonds and other fixed-income securities. The bonds were held until they matured. 
 Such an investment portfolio requires little stock research or trading and consequently generates little fee revenue for money managers, but it has served the Western Conference of Teamsters well. From 2000 to the end of 2002, when the Central States fund lost $2.8 billion, the Western Conference fund gained $834 million.
 ''I think the most prudent, most basic pension funding theory would be: You put aside assets today to most precisely meet your obligations in the future,'' said Edward A.H. Siedle, a Florida lawyer who specializes in pension fund audits. ''You do not try to beat the market. You do not try to maximize returns. But in this country, the plan sponsor doesn't want to do that. The corporation wants to put the minimum aside today, and invest it with maximum efficiency. That's the trouble.''

HEADLINE: Those Bake Sales Add Up, to $9 Billion or So

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
CAMPING trips in the desert. Excursions to the famed Scripps Institute on the California coast. A summer at space camp. Not to mention the other standards of a solid education: art classes, chess, sports and individual tutors.
 No, it is not the roster at an exclusive private school. It's the menu of extracurricular activities offered at the public Nadaburg Elementary School in Wittmann, Ariz., where about 70 percent of the children are low income, if not more. 
 So where does the money come from? Not from education budgets or some benevolent foundation. The answer lies miles away, in immaculate retirement communities with names like Sun City West and Sun City Grand. The residents there may not have any grandchildren who attend the school, near Phoenix, but they have become among its staunchest patrons.
 The school offers an unusual glimpse of the degree to which private fund-raising has reshaped the nation's schools. In Arizona, for example, residents are allowed to take up to $250 of their state taxes and apply it directly to any school, regardless of whether they have children who attend. Nadaburg's teachers and administrators use the rule to great advantage. 
 They ride buses to retirement communities nearby to sign up benefactors. They invite the people there to luncheons. They lead the children in Christmas caroling for those who have transformed their school. 
 ''I consider it to be a legitimate, viable factor in the success of our kids academically,'' said Steven Yokobosky, Nadaburg's superintendent. ''I mean, the kids aren't excelling, but if you look at the demographics of our school they shouldn't be doing as well as they are.''
 Private support of public schools has become a wide phenomenon. Big city districts look to foundations and businesses to help meet students' needs. Parents around the nation are raising money for vital school functions as state spending on education slows down. 
 But is all this private money enough to really change the character of schools? And does it help close the gap between wealthy and poor schools or widen it? 
 Public elementary and secondary schools claimed nearly $373 billion in federal, state and local revenues during the 1999-2000 school year, federal statistics show. Nearly $9 billion of that came from nongovernmental sources.
 Foundations, the institutional donors with a focus on helping communities in need, gave about $1.2 billion to public and private K-12 education in 2002, according to the Foundation Center, a group in New York that works to strengthen the nonprofit sector. That is a small fraction of the amount coming from other private sources -- most notably, parents. 
 In an informal survey of about 100 of its member organizations by the National PTA, conducted at the request of the reporter, the group concluded that parents and their communities contribute as much as if not more than $10 billion in cash and services to the nation's schools. 
 The gifts and services that PTA's furnish range from libraries, computer labs and playgrounds to a laundry list of smaller essentials that many districts may not be able to afford. 
 Parental giving and fund-raising varies widely by income level. The PTA's for the poorest 25 percent of schools surveyed typically contributed $13 to $68 a student, while the wealthiest 25 percent of schools surveyed typically donated $192 to $279.
 Some experts say there is not enough evidence to prove that private money ends up favoring wealthier schools, partly because their poorer counterparts get more money from corporations and foundations. But given the lopsided amounts that parents raise, some contend that private money ultimately worsens the disparity. 
 ''I think it clearly makes it worse,'' said Tom Vander Ark, the education director for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has pledged more than $1 billion to start schools serving low-income students. ''But it's tricky, because we don't want to condemn individual contributions to local schools. They're certainly supporting important things for young people. It's a benign way that our society exacerbates the inequity between the rich and the poor.'' 
 There are exceptions. Nadaburg's campaign in retirement communities raised almost $244,000, or more than $488 a pupil, under the rule in 2002, researchers have found, though the area has a much higher poverty rate than the state average. 
 But statewide in Arizona, between 1998 and 2002, the poorest quarter of schools received a total of about $8 million in contributions under the law, according to Glen Y. Wilson, an assistant professor of education policy at the University of Connecticut, while the wealthiest quarter received more than $29 million. 
 Other state policies have had a similar effect, sometimes by accident. In the late 90's, Vermont legislators tried to make sure all schools had enough money, so they required districts with higher property taxes to share some of the wealth. To get around the law, about two dozen communities deliberately kept property taxes down and started local foundations that were exempt from the rules on sharing. Local residents put more than $11 million into these private funds last year, the state said. 
 Vermont has since changed the law, effectively dismantling these local funds, but not because they ran contrary to the spirit of sharing, state officials said. Instead, animosity developed in some towns because not everyone contributed, said Bill Talbott, chief financial officer for Vermont's education department. 
 When state spending on education shot up nationwide in the late 90's, buoyed by the hearty tax receipts of a forceful economy, the financial gap between rich and poor districts began to narrow, according to a report released last month by the Education Trust, a research group that aims to close the achievement gap between students. But growth in education spending has slowed considerably. Wealthier districts have made up for much of the slowdown by raising property taxes, so the financial gap between rich and poor has expanded again, the report found.
 ''What foundations shouldn't try to do is fund gaps in the system, or fill holes that the public ought to be filling,'' said William Porter, executive director of Grantmakers for Education, a network of 200 foundations. ''The resources that we can put toward a problem pale in comparison to the problem itself.''
 As public spending on education slows, even PTA's in some of the better-off districts say they have little choice but to prop up their local schools. For example, beyond the thousands of dollars parents have raised to outfit the playground at Emerson Elementary School, a magnet school with few poor students in Westerville, Ohio, the school's PTA says it spends thousands more on essentials like library books.
 ''It's no longer about arranging the parties and cleaning up the playgrounds,'' said Trina Shanks, past president of Emerson's PTA. ''It's a whole lot more.''

HEADLINE: Beer brewers shuffle their accounts in an effort to capture bigger shares of the Hispanic market.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE accounts of five Mexican beers, with combined spending estimated in the tens of millions of dollars, are being reassigned after reviews to four agencies, a shift that underscores the growing importance to brewers of the Hispanic market and of brands with roots in Spanish-speaking countries.
 The reassignments, to be announced today, are the results of a three-year agreement, reached in June, between the Femsa Cerveza unit of the Mexican brewer Fomento Economico Mexicano, or Femsa, and the American unit of the Dutch brewer Heineken. Effective on Jan. 1, Heineken USA will take over the sales, distribution and marketing of the brands -- Bohemia, Carta Blanca, Dos Equis, Sol and Tecate -- from InBev, formerly Interbrew.
 The deal comes as the beer industry intensifies its focus on Latino consumers, as illustrated by an advertising contract signed last month by the Miller Brewing Company division of SABMiller with Univision Communications, the biggest Spanish-language broadcaster in the United States. The agreement, Univision's largest with a single advertiser, was valued at more than $100 million over three years. 
 Hispanics, the fastest-growing American demographic group, are becoming more prized by marketers. The group is also younger than the general population, an important feature to brewers because drinkers aged 21 to 34 consume more beer than older drinkers and tend to be less brand loyal. 
 The Femsa-Heineken deal is intended to help both brewers achieve a common goal: to compete more effectively against Grupo Modelo of Mexico, which makes Corona Extra beer. Corona outsells the Femsa brands in the United States and has overtaken the Heineken brand to become the best-selling imported beer among American drinkers.
 ''The Hispanic, specifically the Mexican, component of the beer market is huge, and going to get huger,'' said Steve Davis, senior vice president for marketing at Heineken USA in White Plains, N.Y.
 Mr. Davis said that Heineken USA would initially concentrate its efforts on the two largest of the five Femsa brands: Tecate, which he estimated sells about 13.5 million cases a year, and Dos Equis, at more than 5 million. Corona, by comparison, has two United States distributors, Constellation Brands and the Gambrinus Company, and sells about 100 million cases a year.
 ''Tecate and Dos Equis are like two thoroughbreds at the gate,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Year-to-date, these brands are up 10 percent, but they should be growing 20 percent.
 ''It's up to us now,'' he added, referring to his company and Femsa. ''If we do things right, we can have some real success here.''
 Of the other Femsa brands, Mr. Davis said, Sol is the largest, at about a million cases a year, followed by Carta Blanca, at about 800,000, and Bohemia, at about 500,000.
 Under the previous agreement with InBev, advertising for Tecate, aimed mostly at Hispanics, had been created by Lapiz in Chicago, an agency specializing in marketing to Latinos that is part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide division of the Publicis Groupe. 
 Heineken USA had decided, Mr. Davis said, to shift that assignment to Grupo Gallegos in Long Beach, Calif., a Hispanic specialty agency that was opened in 2001. Other clients of Grupo Gallegos include Comcast, Energizer, Fruit of the Loom, McCormick, Mission Foods and Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack. 
 ''Tecate's strength right now is the Mexican market,'' said John Gallegos, principal and owner of Grupo Gallegos, ''but Heineken USA was looking for an agency that could also help it grow with other Hispanics.
 ''That can be a major challenge, especially in categories like beer where brand imagery is so important,'' he added, ''but Tecate has an opportunity to play not only in the Mexican beer segment but also against the Budweisers and Bud Lights and Miller Lites of the world.''
 Under InBev, advertising for Dos Equis, aimed at the general market as well as Hispanics, had been created by McCann Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann Erickson Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Mr. Davis said that Heineken USA was moving that assignment to Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas, which has worked with Femsa Cerveza for almost two years on a strategy for improving sales in the United States.
 ''We want to build on the Mexican heritage of Dos Equis, which we believe has the best chance to take the business that Corona sort of owns in the United States,'' said Ron Berger, chief executive and chief creative officer of the New York and San Francisco operations of Euro RSCG.
 ''What Corona has done is a lifestyle sell,'' he added, referring to campaigns that carry the theme ''Miles away from ordinary'' and feature drinkers relaxing on sunny beaches. ''That leaves an opportunity for differentiation for another beer that comes from Mexico.''
 For the time being, Mr. Davis said, the Bohemia, Carta Blanca and Sol brands will be marketed with promotional campaigns in places like bars, restaurants and supermarkets rather than with advertising. That assignment is being shifted to the Alcone Marketing Group in Darien, Conn., part of the Omnicom Group, from DVC Worldwide in Morristown, N.J., which had been the promotional agency under InBev.
 The media planning and buying for Dos Equis and Tecate will be handled, Mr. Davis said, by a new unit of MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of Publicis, which currently handles those duties in the United States for Heineken as well as another Heineken USA brand, Amstel Light.
 Advertising for Heineken aimed at Hispanics continues to be handled by the Vidal Partnership in New York, Mr. Davis said. The general-market Heineken account is at Publicis Worldwide in New York, a division of Publicis.
 As for the advertising for Dos Equis and Tecate under Heineken USA, Mr. Davis said, spending is still being determined, but he promised that it be rise substantially.
 ''We've had a history of not being shy to spend where an opportunity is,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that ''for our current brands, especially Heineken, about 25 percent of our volume is Hispanic, skewed toward'' Hispanics from places like the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Heineken USA also has a division, Star Brand Imports, that distributes other brands like Moretti, from Italy, and Murphy's Stout, from Ireland.
 According to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR in New York, which tracks ad spending, InBev spent $6.3 million to advertise Dos Equis in major media last year, compared with $1.1 million in 2002. For the first eight months of 2004, the total was $6.2 million, compared with $5.3 million in the same period a year ago.
 For Tecate, InBev spent $10.5 million on advertising in major media last year, TNS reported, compared with $9.8 million in 2002. For the first eight months of 2004, the total was $6.5 million, compared with $8.4 million in the same period a year ago.

HEADLINE: Promises, Promises, but Where's the Check?

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SHELBY WHITE

 BODY:
WHEN the stock market was at its peak in 2000, many newly rich entrepreneurs and executives made lavish pledges to their favorite charities. But now, with some of those prospective donors either victims of a bursting stock bubble or targets of government investigations into corporate corruption, charitable institutions worry about collecting their pledges.
 In some cases, the donors have been slow to deliver. Conrad M. Black, the embattled former chief executive of Hollinger International, took months to pay his $100,000 pledge after he was honored in November 2003 at the New York Public Library's fund-raiser, the Literary Lions dinner. ''Lord Black informed the chairman of the library that there might be a delay in the contribution,'' his spokesman said in January. By last month, the pledge was honored. 
 A $25 million pledge by Michael S. Ovitz, the former president of the Walt Disney Company, to the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center, has drawn attention because of his testimony about it in an unrelated shareholder suit against Disney. The timing of the payment of the gift remains unclear, but U.C.L.A. says it and Mr. Ovitz expect the pledge to be met.
 When Mr. Ovitz pledged the money in 1997, terms were not disclosed. In testimony during the recent court case that is challenging his $140 million settlement from Disney, Mr. Ovitz alluded to his philanthropy to assure the judge that he did not need Disney's money. ''I gave away a lot of my money to charity,'' he said. ''For 15 years as a chairman of the U.C.L.A. hospital, I raised a lot of money for that hospital that's being built.''
 Albert Carnesale, chancellor of U.C.L.A., said: ''Payments are over time, but it is certainly true that Mr. Ovitz continues to be a strong supporter of the university, and he and I fully expect that the pledge will be met. It was always understood that there was some flexibility on the schedule.''
 Mr. Ovitz's lawyer, James Ellis, added, ''There is no obligation that has been breached.''
 Even though institutions can legally sue to collect gifts, they seldom do. Public disputes make other donors nervous, and institutions are loath to antagonize a donor who may one day come through with the money. But, according to William Zabel, partner of Schulte, Roth & Zabel, a New York law firm, some institutions will try to put pressure on delinquent donors, even going so far as to actually prepare a complaint.
 In 2000, Dallas Price, a trustee of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, promised the museum $10 million over 10 years. But Mrs. Price's gift looked doubtful when shares of Golf American, the business she and her husband founded, collapsed. The museum even took the step of increasing its reserves for uncollectible debts by nearly $7 million. Since then, the company was sold, Mrs. Price divorced and remarried, and she has kept her pledge. Had the museum sued, it might have alienated her and never collected.
 In New York, a generous arts donor, Alberto Vilar, found his name taken off the grand tier at the Metropolitan Opera when he failed to complete a pledge. In a telephone interview, Mr. Vilar said that when he made the pledge, his technology-related investments had been lucrative. When the market collapsed, he found himself still wealthy on paper but unable to come up with the necessary cash.
 Today, Mr. Vilar says his bets on technology have again paid off, and he is ready to begin meeting some of his pledges. Asked if that included the opera, Mr. Vilar said that his relations with the opera, where he remains a board member, were distant. ''I never had a direct conversation with anyone at the Metropolitan Opera,'' he said. ''I didn't know that my name had been removed from the grand tier until I was asked to comment by a reporter.''
 Perhaps no group of cultural institutions were hit harder by the falling stock market than those in Houston, where Enron and its officers were generous donors. On its 2000 tax return, the Kenneth and Linda Lay Foundation listed Enron stock valued at $48,186,482 and pledges outstanding of more than $9 million. But by 2002, the stock collapsed and pledges exceeded assets. 
 A spokeswoman for the Lay family, Kelly Kimberly, said, ''It is the Lays' intention to honor all outstanding foundation commitments, but it has been necessary for nonprofits to extend the time frame for meeting the foundation's obligations.''

HEADLINE: Google Investors Await the Dropping Of 39 Million Shoes

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Google investors may find out this week whether there really can be too much of a good thing.
 To the surprise of some investors and industry analysts, Google's stock price has more than doubled in the three months since its public offering, closing at $182 on Friday. One possible reason for the surge is that relatively few shares of Google have been available to trade. 
 Typically, a company sells 15 percent to 20 percent of its shares to the public in a new stock offering, while the company's founders, early investors and employees own much of the rest. 
 Google, however, sold only about 7 percent of its stock, or 19.6 million shares, in its Aug. 19 debut. 
 The number of shares outstanding could change on Tuesday, when Google insiders will be permitted to sell as many as 39 million more shares. Until this week, they were forbidden to sell under the lockup period dictated by securities law.
 ''Many have posited that the stock has scooted up the way it has because there's just not enough supply,'' said John J. Kelley III, who, as the director for the corporate finance practice group at the law firm King & Spalding, has worked closely with companies in the process of going public. ''So as more supply comes on, the speculation is that the price is going to get beaten down.''
 Generally, companies do not allow insiders to cash in any shares until six months after the public offering. 
 But Google, ever the iconoclast, allowed its employees and investors to sell large portions of their holdings well before six months had passed. 
 It established five deadlines, including one on Sept. 2, when 4.7 million shares were freed up for sale. At that time employees were allowed to sell 5 percent of their vested stock. The share price held steady then for about a week, then began to rise. They will be permitted to sell an additional 10 percent of their holdings at the 90-day mark, on Tuesday. 
 On Dec. 16, 120 days after the public offering, 25 million more shares will become eligible for public sale, and another 25 million shares may be sold on Jan. 15. On Feb. 14, all legal restrictions on the remaining 177 million shares will be lifted. 
 ''We have never seen selling of this magnitude so soon after an I.P.O.,'' said Linda Killian, who analyzes new stock offerings at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Conn.
 What impact this potential flood of shares into the market will have on the stock price is anyone's guess -- in no small part because Google's staggered plan for allowing insider sales is so unconventional. 
 ''Historically, we typically see a couple of percent drop in the stock price in the week the lockup expires,'' said Jay R. Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who has done consulting work for Google. ''But in this case it's different, given this rolling lockup situation.'' Presumably, Professor Ritter said, the staggered sale of stock ''will minimize whatever price impact might otherwise be there.''
 Barry Randall, who runs the First American Technology fund, a mutual fund that owns 4,700 shares of Google, is inclined to agree, noting that the trading volume on Google has averaged 12 million shares a day in recent weeks. ''In that kind of dynamic, having more shares is a good thing rather than a negative thing,'' Mr. Randall said. ''Obviously, you don't want a lot of shares dumped on any single day, but the volume of trading indicates that demand continues to outstrip supply.'' 
 Yet to John Tinker, an analyst who covers Google for ThinkEquity Partners, an investment bank in San Francisco, the answer depends on how many shares hit the market this week. ''The stock has more than doubled from when it came public,'' Mr. Tinker said. ''I'm sure there'll be a big temptation to sell.'' Google's stock sold originally at $85 a share, and closed Friday at $182, a 114 percent rise in three months.
 Wall Street is sure to be watching Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, for signs of confidence. 
 The two men each own about 38 million shares. So far each has sold a little over $40 million in stock. But if either starts to sell a significant portion of their holdings, worth a total of $14 billion at Friday's closing price, the markets would take note. 
 ''If they start selling, that starts to affect people's perceptions,'' said Tim Loughran, a professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame who studies initial public offerings. ''You can spin this as a positive thing,'' because an increase in supply can give more investors the opportunity to buy Google stock. ''But on the flip side,'' he said, ''if insiders start selling, that can be perceived as a really bad sign.''
 Two venture capital firms, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, will have a total of about 4.5 million shares released from restrictions and are likely to sell. ''Once they can, the venture capitalists start liquidating,'' Ms. Killian said. ''That's what always happens, and here we're talking about one of the very few successful deals venture capitalists have had in years.''
 Whether rank-and-file employees will sell is less certain. People tended to sell the entire 5 percent when the September lockup period expired, one Google insider said, speculating that soaring home prices in the Bay Area may motivate many to cash out another 10 percent to raise a down payment. 
 ''It may be that people won't sell because they feel part of this family, and selling would be this breach of trust,'' said Mr. Kelley of King & Spalding. ''It's possible they see themselves as Googlers who are not going to sell because Larry and Sergey are holding on, and together they're going to see the stock go to $1,000. 
 ''A lot of people got really burned when the bubble burst four or five years ago, because they had all of their net worth tied up in one stock,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''I've heard a lot people say that's just not going to happen again, that when they have the chance they're going to diversify.''

HEADLINE: Turning the Tax Tables to Help the Poor

BYLINE: By Dalton Conley. 
Dalton Conley, director of the Center for Advanced Social Science Research at New York University, is the author, most recently, of ''The Pecking Order: Which Siblings Succeed and Why?''

 BODY:
Now that the Republicans have solidified their control over the presidency and both houses of Congress, progressives might assume that the idea of helping the poor is off the table. But it doesn't have to be this way. If Democrats are crafty enough, they can sneak some progressive policy into the Republican agenda by focusing on specific tax relief, military benefits and President Bush's ''ownership society'' initiative.
 The poor have been off the public agenda for the last two election cycles. This is in part because the left essentially ceded the debate on poverty in 1996, when welfare reform was enacted. Workfare presented Democrats with the chance to say that these ''working families'' deserved more. But aside from a call to raise the minimum wage, there has been little effort to renew the discussion about helping the bottom one-third of American households. 
 This is understandable in some ways. After all, how exactly does one prevent the outsourcing of good jobs for low-skilled workers? And how does one put more money into the hands of the poor when welfare is dead?
 To add to the challenge, any progressive agenda today would have to be revenue-neutral, in our age of budget deficits. And more important, it would have to be sneaked through a government controlled by a party whose base is the top 20 percent of American households, not the bottom one-fifth.
 Harold Wilensky, the political scientist, once lamented that the American left had not learned the lesson of Europe: allow taxation to be more regressive to collect enough money to finance the programs that liberals hold dear. European governments collect an enormous amount of revenue through the value-added tax (sales tax); their effective tax rates on lower-income workers are much higher than America's; and they do not rely very much on property taxes (which are the most progressive of all). In return for a more regressive tax structure, Europeans receive a litany of social services that are politically unthinkable in this country. 
 Another lesson, however, is that there is nothing particularly American about the paradox of progressive taxation -- that folks resist progressive tax structures. The Republicans seem to have learned this. In fact, some pundits have even argued that the Republicans manage to stoke the populist anti-tax fire to reduce top marginal tax rates by raising them on lower income Americans. (Ronald Reagan's payroll tax increase provides the classic example.)
 In facing this reality, Democrats can essentially choose from two responses. The first is the European option, for lack of a better name: agree to a flat tax in return for more spending on health care, child care and other services. 
 The other option would be to hijack the Republicans' fervor for tax cuts, the military and the ownership of private property. Let's start with tax cuts. From an accounting standpoint, there is no difference between a direct transfer to the poor and a refundable tax credit. In political terms, one is called welfare (a sure loser) and the other tax relief (an almost certain winner). 
 For example, the Democrats should advocate making the child tax credit refundable. While it has been expanded under Mr. Bush to $1,000 a child from $600, the credit does not fully benefit poor families who owe fewer taxes than the full credit amount. Making it refundable changes it into a program that is no different than a negative income tax -- what McGovernites were proposing back in 1972, while calling it tax relief. Or, if we do end up with a flat tax, why not play a game of political chicken with Republicans by pushing the ''no-tax'' income exemption as high as possible?
 The same goes with the payroll tax. Why not cut the payroll tax? The Social Security payroll tax is the biggest tax burden faced by poor Americans; cutting it would put more money in their pockets. Such a move would also stimulate hiring, since employers shoulder half the burden of the tax. This plan could be kept revenue-neutral by merely raising the amount of wages subject to the tax -- now capped at $87,900.
 The worship of all things military can also be co-opted for progressive ends. The military is now the de facto welfare state. The armed forces and the Department of Veterans Affairs are the two largest health care providers in the United States. The military is also a major bankroller of higher education through the G.I. Bill. And because of America's all-volunteer force, it is the nation's poor that disproportionately serve. By proposing major increases in benefits for the families of active personnel, reservists and veterans, Democrats can use that holiest of holy grails on the right -- ''our troops'' -- to help increase opportunities in American society.
 Finally, Democrats can turn the right's worship of wealth to better ends by promoting asset ownership. While Mr. Bush is poised to campaign for an ''ownership society,'' several proposals have been stymied in Congress to provide universal savings accounts. These bills would provide every American, as a matter of birthright, with a trust fund of a few thousand dollars. Meanwhile, individual development accounts -- a little-known experiment that is part of welfare reform -- have been providing matching funds for poor people's savings in selected areas of the country. Both these programs put wealth into the hands of the poor. 
 The United States is a country where -- depending on how the question is worded -- 90 percent of the population defines itself as middle class (and the top 20 percent of earners think they are among the top 2 percent). So if the left wants to achieve economically progressive ends, it must pursue a strategy William Julius Wilson has called ''targeting through universalism'' -- namely, generating political support for programs by making them widespread (think Social Security). Put another way, don't begrudge the middle class family (or even the upper class one) a tax break; grin and bear it so that the poor can have their cake too.

HEADLINE: Why the Democrats Need to Stop Thinking About Elephants

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
If George Lakoff had his way, the Kerry campaign would have run a commercial attacking the ''baby tax.'' Dr. Lakoff, a Berkeley linguistics professor and Kerry campaign adviser, wanted to divide the interest on the national debt by the number of Americans born each year. The result, $85,000 per newborn, say, would have been handed to a baby in the form of a bill, and the baby would have started to cry. That, Dr. Lakoff says, ''frames'' the issue ''in a way people can understand.''
 ''Framing'' is a hot topic among political junkies and in the blogo-sphere right now, thanks to Dr. Lakoff. In ''Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,'' his surprise best seller, Dr. Lakoff argues that Republicans have been winning elections because they have been better than Democrats at framing issues -- from taxes, to abortion, to national security -- in ways that resonate with core American values. 
 Dr. Lakoff has been stepping out of the classroom lately to lecture everyone from the Senate Democratic caucus to ''living wage'' advocates on how to use linguistics to craft a more effective message. ''Framing'' alone won't give the Democrats the White House, or the Senate and House. But Dr. Lakoff's theories offer the Democrats a road map for going forward. 
 The title ''Don't Think of an Elephant!'' comes from a classic experiment Dr. Lakoff conducts in Cognitive Science 101. He tells his students not to think of an elephant, and he has yet to find one who has managed it. Thinking about elephants is the frame, and negating it simply reinforces it. This was the problem, he says, with President Richard Nixon's famous declaration, ''I am not a crook.''
 Trying not to think of elephants, Dr. Lakoff suggests, sums up the Democrats' plight. Since Republicans have framed the key issues, Democrats cannot avoid being on the losing side. Take taxes. Republicans have succeeded in framing the issue as ''tax relief,'' a metaphor that presents an affliction, and that predetermines who are the heroes -- tax opponents -- and villains. Taxes are, of course, necessary even for programs Republicans back, like the military, and simple economics dictates that we cannot keep cutting taxes and maintaining spending forever. But the Democrats are hard-pressed to make these points once the frame is ''tax relief.''
 It is not by accident that ''tax relief'' presents taxes in moral terms, as a calamity in search of a cure. Values, Dr. Lakoff argues, are the key to framing campaign issues. Democrats have an unfortunate tendency, he says, to see campaigns as product launches, believing that if they roll out a candidate with the best features, or positions on issues, voters will support him. Republicans understand that people vote their identity, not their self-interest -- that they seek out candidates whose values appear to match their own.
 After the election, pundits made much of the influence of a few ''moral'' issues, like gay marriage and abortion, on the outcome. But Dr. Lakoff argues that values play an important role in almost every campaign issue. The Republicans' success has been driven in large part, he argues, by their ability to frame less morally charged subjects in terms of core values. He is impressed by a line from President Bush's last State of the Union address: that we do not need a ''permission slip'' to defend America. It reframed multilateralism, once a widely accepted foreign policy principle, as weakness and national infantilization.
 As Dr. Lakoff sees it, Democrats need to start framing issues in terms of their own values, which, he insists, are no less popular with the American people than the Republicans' values. This project will, however, take more than spin and sloganeering. On many subjects, he argues, the Democrats suffer from what he calls ''hypocognition'' -- more simply, a lack of ideas. Republicans have been working for the past 40 years, since the defeat of Barry Goldwater, in well-financed think tanks, on developing conservative ideas that voters will rally around. The Democrats, he says, need to start catching up.
 One frame Dr. Lakoff likes, which he believes could become a progressive wedge issue, is ''poison-free communities.'' The Republicans' war on government regulation has left industry increasingly free to spew toxins into the air and water, despite the harm it is doing to the public. Keeping people healthy is a core progressive value, but it is one that many swing voters and Republicans share. Few people want their children poisoned by mercury in the name of a theory about the appropriate size of government.
 Framing can also deflect the other side's charges. Dr. Lakoff argues that the Democrats should fight the Republican campaign for ''tort reform'' by recasting it. Rather than debate over frivolous lawsuits, he says, they should talk about protecting people from law-breaking corporations and negligent doctors. When Republicans talk about greedy trial lawyers, he says, Democrats should talk about -- and he really needs a better phrase here-- ''public protection attorneys.''
 For all of his good insights, Dr. Lakoff can get a little too caught up in his own frame. His intense focus on language leaves too little room for other attributes of a successful campaign, like a charismatic candidate or a strong field operation. Just as professional campaign managers have given too little thought to his frames and hypocognition, he has a tendency to undervalue what they do. The least compelling part of his book is a commercial he suggests Democrats use on taxes. His script begins, ''Taxation is paying your dues, paying your membership fee in America.'' That quickly reframes the issue to: ''Where did I put the remote?''

HEADLINE: As Technology Stocks Climb, It Starts to Feel Like the 90's All Over Again

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
For the Internet analyst, happy days are here again. As the stock prices of companies like Google and eBay soared this year, two of the biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street, who four years ago were derided as false prophets too eager to put the commercial interests of their firms ahead of investors, are basking in a renewed glow.
 Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley -- who was celebrated and then disparaged as the ''queen of the Net'' -- is once more out on the stump, extolling the commercial opportunities of the Internet, churning out comprehensive reports and using her still considerable sway to help land Wall Street's biggest investment banking deals -- like Google's public offering -- for her firm.
 Over at Goldman Sachs, Anthony J. Noto, who during the Internet boom became known for his aggressively optimistic research in support of now-bankrupt clients like eToys, Webvan and Planet Rx, was recently awarded perhaps the most coveted prize on Wall Street: a Goldman Sachs partnership. While it is too early to get a precise reading on what bonuses Ms. Meeker and Mr. Noto might receive for 2004, some of their fellow analysts estimate that each will be paid $3 million to $5 million. 
 That Ms. Meeker and Mr. Noto have again seen their careers prosper underlines how much Wall Street loves a second act, especially one that promises rich returns. Both analysts survived investigations by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York into research abuses because they held stubbornly true to their beliefs, even as their stocks plunged in value.
 That resilience is now paying off: the Internet stocks they follow are on the upswing, and the prospects for new investment banking deals have caused Mr. Noto's and Ms. Meeker's own stock to rise. 
 Their resurgence also demonstrates how Wall Street still values the influence of equity analysts, even after a $1.4 billion settlement growing out of federal and state investigations sought to seal them off from the banking business. Will Ms. Meeker and Mr. Noto be pitching deals to clients in Silicon Valley? Certainly not. Under the settlement's guidelines, research analysts are barred from soliciting investment banking deals or even from discussing transactions with their banking colleagues. 
 But there is no law that prevents analysts from developing relationships within companies, even those that their firms do business with. And in today's toned-down deal-making environment, investment bankers and analysts say, an analyst's influence can be implicitly leveraged by bankers without relying on the kind of crass quid pro quos that prevailed during the Internet bubble.
 ''These people are still bankers in analysts' clothing,'' said Andy Kessler, an author of books on Wall Street and a former hedge fund manager who once worked with Ms. Meeker at Morgan Stanley. ''This quid pro quo is now just a wink and a nod. If these guys were truly independent, you would see hold ratings after big deals. But with Google, all we have seen are across-the-board buys.''
 Ms. Meeker, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has a friendly relationship with the founders of Google. And although she had no active role in bringing Google's business to Morgan Stanley, her positive rating a few weeks after the offering is likely to have helped an already rising stock price. 
 Mr. Noto has cultivated ties with perhaps the most influential investor in Internet and media stocks, Gordon Crawford of Capital Research and Management, who calls him ''the most effective large-cap Internet analyst on Wall Street.'' And Mr. Noto has also become more discerning in his coverage, writing skeptical reports about companies like DoubleClick that have banking relationships with Goldman Sachs.
 Asked about Mr. Noto's past support for companies like eToys and Webvan, Mr. Crawford said, ''That's ancient history.'' Mr. Crawford, who gives Mr. Noto credit for his recommendations of Yahoo and eBay, added, ''We all did stupid things in 2000.''
 Still, despite the better times of late, some legal and regulatory headaches linger for the firms of the two analysts.
 Last month, Morgan Stanley disclosed in a regulatory filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission was still investigating its failure to adequately supervise its research analysts and investment bankers before the settlement, which was announced in April 2003. If an action is forthcoming, outside lawyers say, it would most likely be directed at current and former executives of Morgan Stanley who had supervisory roles over analysts like Ms. Meeker, rather than for Ms. Meeker herself. 
 As for Mr. Noto, his Pollyanna-like research reports in support of eToys, an online toy retailer that went bankrupt in 2001, two years after Goldman Sachs took it public, could again be on display this spring. EToys' creditors have sued Goldman Sachs, accusing the firm of having violated its fiduciary duty by underpricing the public offering. Goldman has vigorously disputed this, though in May it lost on a motion to dismiss the case and has appealed. 
 But Mr. Noto and Ms. Meeker can be comforted by the knowledge that they are genuine survivors. Henry Blodget, the former Merrill Lynch Internet analyst, is now reinventing himself as a journalist for Slate.com, and Holly Becker, once of Lehman Brothers, was recently cleared by the S.E.C. after an insider trading investigation and is now a full-time mother.
 For the surviving analysts, life remains very much the same. Ms. Meeker still works at a flat-out pace, delivering her rousing big-picture speeches, often about her faith in Internet stocks. 
 ''The enthusiasm was well placed; it just got ahead of itself in many respects,'' Ms. Meeker said at a conference earlier this month.
 Mr. Noto, who was a star linebacker for West Point in 1990 and an Army Ranger, has worked relentlessly to restore his tattered reputation and this year was awarded a coveted No. 1 ranking in Institutional Investor magazine's yearly investor poll, beating Ms. Meeker by a significant margin. Both analysts' stock-picking skills have improved. 
 In the last three years, the stocks Mr. Noto recommended -- which now include media and entertainment companies -- have outpaced the indexes, going up 23 percent, according to Investars, a stock-performance tracking service. For the same period, Ms. Meeker's picks, which were not weighed down by laggards like Time Warner, are up 72 percent. 
 In the late 90's boom, Ms. Meeker's prowess as an analyst with a fervor to involve herself deeply in the work of Morgan Stanley bankers was well documented. But Mr. Noto's eagerness to tout the prospects of some of Goldman Sachs's more dubious investment banking clients is not as well known. To be sure, Mr. Noto did take his lumps for his unflagging support of Internet bombs like Homestore, Asford.com and eToys.
 On CNBC, he was jokingly referred to as Anthony Don't-Know, a nickname that circulated within the ranks of Goldman's research department as well. In the charged environment of the Internet crash, such public ribbing is less than surprising. 
 While acknowledging that he has made some bad investment calls, Mr. Noto says that those mistakes were the result of faulty analysis and not pressure from investment bankers.
 ''My ratings and views on stock were based on my fundamental analysis and valuation conclusions,'' he said in an interview. ''I recognize that I have made mistakes. I regret that and I have learned from them.''
 Some of those mistakes were noticed by Goldman Sachs's own technology bankers, who made tough-minded critiques of Mr. Noto in an evaluation of his work from August 1999 to July 2000, a period that included the early months of the Nasdaq collapse. In the evaluation, a managing director in Goldman's corporate finance division said that ''Anthony undermines his credibility by appearing as more of an advocate/defender (or at worst a company spokesman) for his companies' success rather than as an unbiased analyst.'' Mr. Noto declined to comment on the evaluation.
 The managing director said that Mr. Noto ''has an upbeat spin no matter what the news'' and added that ''while supporting our issuer clients is obviously helpful, in these types of markets it tends to undermine GS' credibility.'' 
 In a recommendation for ''actionable areas of development,'' another investment banker who had worked with Mr. Noto said that he ''must sometimes push back on banking if he feels that some of his companies are not GS caliber.''
 Despite these stinging remarks, Mr. Noto's banking peers lauded his hard work, his ''thought leadership'' and his management skills. ''He is always willing to share information with bankers,'' one banker said, before bestowing on Mr. Noto the ultimate Goldman accolade that foreshadowed his partnership stake: ''strong culture carrier in this respect.''
 Partnerships at Goldman are given out every two years and are generally awarded to the firm's top income producers, who tend to be investment bankers or traders. Indeed, of the 99 partners named this year, only 3, including Mr. Noto, are working research analysts, and the two others have at least 10 years' experience at the firm. Mr. Noto joined Goldman in 1999, making his ascent to partner an unusually rapid one. 
 All the same, even his fans acknowledge that they have only recently been converted.
 ''Look, Anthony Noto was created by investment bankers,'' a prominent hedge fund manager who has closely followed Mr. Noto's career said, adding: ''But give him credit. At some point, the light bulb went off, he got rid of all the dogs and now he has been doing the best analysis on the Street.''

HEADLINE: To the Point of No Returns

BYLINE: By Michael J. Graetz. 
Michael J. Graetz, a professor of law at Yale, is the co-author of the forthcoming ''Death by a Thousand Cuts: The Fight Over Taxing Inherited Wealth.''

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Since his re-election, President Bush has made it clear that he intends to fulfill his campaign promise to ''lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.'' But many in Washington are already betting that major changes won't happen, and tax lobbyists -- including some with close connections to the administration and Republicans in Congress -- are already working to make sure that they don't.
 Two decades ago, many of those same forces were just as sure that Ronald Reagan's efforts at tax reform had little chance of passage. President Bush should take a page from Mr. Reagan's playbook: he must invest as much of his own time, energy and political capital in tax reform as he did in securing the tax cuts of his first term. And he must, as Mr. Reagan did, try to forge a bipartisan consensus. True bipartisan support is essential to obtain a genuine tax reform that has any hope of lasting. 
 Republicans and Democrats will have great trouble agreeing on any tax restructuring this time around. The consensus that produced the 1986 reform has unraveled. By now, everyone knows that, over time, the 1986 changes have failed to deliver on the promise of a broad-based, low-rate, fairer and simpler income tax.
 Both the president and Congress now use the income tax the way my mother once employed chicken soup: as a magic elixir to solve all the nation's economic and social difficulties. The result is extraordinary complexity. In 1940 the instructions to the Form 1040 were about four pages. Today they are more than 100 pages, and the form itself contains more than 10 schedules and more than 20 worksheets. The complete tax code totals about 2.8 million words -- about four times longer than ''War and Peace'' (and considerably harder to parse).
 The public simply cannot cope -- and neither can the I.R.S. If tax reformers are truly serious about getting the I.R.S. out of the lives of the American people, they must place tax simplification at the top of the agenda.
 But in Congress, simplification is not necessarily a priority. Democrats are primarily concerned with maintaining a progressive tax system, while Republican tax cutters want to eliminate all taxes on wealth and capital income -- they say to spur economic growth. Many Republicans are still disappointed that Mr. Reagan tried to fix the income tax rather than replace it. 
 The president has said that ''simplification would be the goal'' of any changes to the tax code. But the specifics of his plan are unknown. Will it be a flat rate tax on what people consume or on wages only, exempting all savings or investment income? Or will Mr. Bush propose one of the favorite plans of Congressional Republicans-- replacement of the income tax with a national sales tax?
 Neither will work alone. The so-called flat tax will stay neither pure nor flat for very long. And a sales tax would require much higher rates than proponents would accept to avoid indefensible increases in federal deficits. Both proposals would also produce a significant tax reduction for the wealthiest Americans, those who need it least -- and a tax increase for middle-income folks.
 The tax system can and should be fixed without such a shift in the nation's tax burdens. America should return the income tax to its pre-World War II status -- a relatively low-rate simple tax on a thin slice of the wealthiest Americans. Rather than repealing the alternative minimum tax, as many have urged, Congress should repeal the regular income tax. Enacting a value-added tax -- a tax on sales of goods and services collected at all stages of production -- at a rate of 14 percent would finance an income-tax exemption of up to $100,000.
 Imagine a world of no tax returns for families that earn less than $100,000. Wealthier families, meanwhile, would face a vastly simpler income tax at a 25 percent rate on income of more than $100,000 after deductions for charitable contributions, home mortgages, medical expenses, and state and local taxes. Low and middle-income families would be protected from any tax increase by refunds of their payroll taxes. 
 This tax reform would eliminate more than 100 million of the approximately 130 million income tax returns filed each year. Unlike the flat tax or the sales tax, it would also keep income tax incentives for employers to provide health insurance and pensions to their employees. At the same time, the corporate income tax rate could be whittled down to 25 percent and, to eliminate corporate tax shelters, changes could be made to more closely link tax and book income.
 This plan would fulfill President Bush's goals: promoting greater economic growth and more jobs for American workers. It would make the United States one of the most attractive nations for corporate investments in the world. This system would be fair. And it would be much simpler. For the 150 million people from whom no income tax would be required, April 15 would be just another day.

HEADLINE: A Pioneer Global Safety Rule Will Seek Safer Auto Doors

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
As part of an effort to address a growing global health threat, the first international auto safety regulation will be announced this week at a news conference in Geneva. 
 The regulation, aimed at improving locks so that car doors are less likely to fly open during accidents, is somewhat mundane. More significant is that it represents the first step in a six-year-long effort to standardize auto regulation among 22 nations, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, Australia and members of the European Union. 
 ''We have 1.2 million people killed every year in the world,'' said Stephen R. Kratzke, associate administrator for rule making at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the top American regulatory agency, in a telephone interview from Geneva. ''We think this is a significant step in moving to address that with a comprehensive vision.''
 Auto safety has become a growing global concern because of booming car sales in developing countries including China and India, which have far higher fatality rates than the leading industrial nations, as speeding cars proliferate on rural roads. 
 The World Health Organization projected in a report released this year that traffic accidents would become the third-leading cause of death and disability by 2020, up from ninth now. The victims are often young adults.
 The effort to standardize regulations across the major auto markets is being coordinated by a committee set up under United Nations auspices after a 1998 agreement to address traffic safety.
 Top safety experts from the participating nations met about half a dozen times in the last year to formulate minimum standards for door strength. 
 ''None of us had major upgrades to this since the 1970's,'' Mr. Kratzke said, ''so it seemed like a good opportunity to work together collectively.'' 
 Keeping doors closed during accidents reduces the chance that occupants will be thrown from a vehicle and seriously hurt or killed. The new standards will particularly bolster the testing of sliding doors in minivans, requiring them to stay closed even when subjected to a testing force of about 3,800 pounds from the inside.
 Regulators see the effort as allowing them to share skills and development costs. ''We're leveraging our resources, both experts and testing, because we're working with people doing the same thing,'' Mr. Kratzke said.
 While the United States had planned its own door regulation, safety agencies in Canada and France played crucial roles in developing the new global rule. 
 ''If we had had to do it ourselves,'' Mr. Kratzke said, ''it would have cost more and taken longer.''
 Next on the international agenda are matters like making vehicles less harmful to pedestrians in accidents and devising new rules for motorcycle brakes and head restraints. 
 The auto industry strongly backs this effort because it will be substantially cheaper to design cars to meet one set of regulations. 
 ''We are very optimistic about it,'' said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes most of the major automakers. ''We hope this global safety regulation will be the first of many.''
 Still, Mr. Kratzke said it was unlikely that there would be completely global auto standards in the foreseeable future. 
 ''We think there will always be some hard situations where countries have differences in their fleets,'' he said, ''so we wouldn't want to suggest that every standard will be the same. But we do think many of the standards will be harmonized and will be global.''

HEADLINE: REBELS ATTACK IN CENTRAL IRAQ AND THE NORTH

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and JAMES GLANZ; Dexter Filkins contributed reporting from Falluja for this article, Eric Schmitt from Washington and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Mosul.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
A rebel counteroffensive swept through central and northern Iraq on Monday as American troops struggled to flush the remaining insurgents from the rubble-strewn streets of Falluja.
 Guerrillas in Baquba, Mosul, Kirkuk and Suwaira stormed police stations, set oil wells ablaze and struck at American military convoys with suicide car bombs, routing Iraqi security forces in several coordinated assaults and severely damaging parts of the country's petroleum-based economic lifeline.
 A five-hour gun battle broke out in the southernmost reaches of Falluja on Monday morning, a day after tanks and other armored vehicles fought their way through the area and had seemingly quashed all remaining resistance to the weeklong offensive. But some rebels had stayed hidden in the bombed-out landscape of the district and came out fighting around dawn, killing at least two marines.
 ''They're clearly fighting until the last man,'' said Lt. Col. Gareth Brandl, commander of the First Battalion, Eighth Regiment, First Marine Expeditionary Force. 
 The wave of attacks across the Sunni Muslim heartland suggested that guerrillas were ready to carry on the war despite the loss of their safe haven in Falluja. The most intense fighting took place in the morning in Baquba, northeast of the capital. Insurgents there ambushed American troops near a downtown police station and laid siege to another station in a southern suburb.
 As the Americans battled near the first station, more insurgents began firing down on them from a nearby mosque, said Capt. Bill Coppernoll, a spokesman for the Army's First Infantry Division. The fighting became so intense that American jets dropped two 500-pound bombs on the insurgents, and up to 20 fighters were killed, he said.
 Overnight, insurgents attacked an oil storage tank in the north and set fire to four oil wells. In Mosul, torn by a daring revolt that began last week, guerrillas tried ramming an American patrol and a checkpoint with suicide car bombs, wounding at least five soldiers. The Iraqi interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, said he expected the rebels to mount more ambitious strikes.
 ''Today, it's quieter in Mosul, but we expect a surge in attacks in the coming two days,'' he said at a news conference in Baghdad.
 On Sunday, he said, insurgents snatched a wounded policeman from his hospital bed, killed and mutilated the man and hung his body in a public area.
 Since the American-led invasion of Iraq 19 months ago, the insurgents have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability in the face of vastly superior American firepower. American commanders acknowledge that rebel leaders fled Falluja in the days before the invasion and are probably behind the current counteroffensive.
 On Monday evening, an Internet audio recording attributed to the country's most wanted militant leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, exhorted fighters in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle to keep up the war against the Americans.
 ''Once they have finished in Falluja, they will head toward you,'' Mr. Zarqawi said. ''You must not let them succeed in their plan.''
 ''The war is very long, and always think of this as the beginning,'' he said. ''And always make the enemy think that yesterday was better than today.''
 In a written statement on Monday, Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said the leader of a militant group called the Army of Muhammad had been arrested. He identified the man as Moayed Ahmed Yassin.
 The Army of Muhammad is believed to be responsible for the beheadings of several Iraqi and foreign hostages and is the armed wing of a group created by Saddam Hussein to fight for the return of his Baath Party, Dr. Allawi said.
 The prime minister's office confirmed Monday that two of Dr. Allawi's relatives had been released by kidnappers. Last Tuesday, insurgents seized Dr. Allawi's 75-year-old cousin, Ghazi Majeed Allawi, the cousin's wife and their daughter-in-law. The next day, a group called Ansar al Jihad posted an Internet message saying the three would be beheaded unless Dr. Allawi called off the siege of Falluja and released all prisoners in Iraq.
 The two women have been freed, but the fate of the cousin, Ghazi Allawi, is unknown.
 Gunmen carried out near-simultaneous attacks on a police station and an Iraqi National Guard station in the town of Suwaira, 25 miles south of the capital, The Associated Press reported. Five guardsmen and two policemen were killed, including Maj. Hadi Refeidi, the director of the Suwaira police station.
 In a telephone interview with reporters at the Pentagon on Monday, Col. Michael Regner, the operations officer for the First Marine Expeditionary Force, said American forces had secured all of Falluja, but were still fighting with bands of die-hard insurgents in bombed out buildings and winding alleys.
 ''A hundred percent of the city is secure,'' Colonel Regner said, adding that American and Iraqi forces ''can go anywhere at anytime throughout that city.''
 But even after the battle on Monday in Shuhada, the southern neighborhood that was the insurgents' last stronghold in Falluja, sniper fire kept troops sporadically pinned down and gunfire could be heard.
 Colonel Regner declined to provide estimates of the number of insurgents killed, saying, ''It's not a true reflection of the success that we've had in this battle.''
 Commanders in Iraq are required to report estimates of the numbers of fighters their troops have killed, but this is often an inexact science. Some numbers are derived from actual counts of bodies, but others come from gauging how many fighters were in a building before it was pulverized by a bomb or before their remains were taken away for the quick burial required by Islamic tradition.
 But Colonel Regner said that as of Monday afternoon, 1,052 insurgents had been captured, all but one or two dozen of whom were Iraqis. The others were foreign fighters from countries he did not identify.
 He said 38 American soldiers had been killed in the Falluja operation and 320 wounded. Of the wounded, 134 had returned to duty. He said there had been 6 Iraqi soldiers killed in action and 28 wounded, two of whom had returned to duty.
 The danger for troops now, he said, was from small bands of fighters, up to a dozen in a group, popping out of ''spider holes'' and shooting American troops in the back or legs. ''They are fighting to the death,'' he said.
 Colonel Regner asserted that relief aid was beginning to flow into Falluja, and that engineers were now in the city, examining how to restore electricity. Military programs for disbursing aid and restoring infrastructure have bogged down in other cities, like Najaf, where American-led assaults caused huge damage.
 Even as fighting in Falluja was dying down, violence was increasing in nearby Ramadi, the colonel said. He said that ''for about a week now, it's been tougher in Ramadi'' than it was before the Falluja offensive began. 
 He said a second Marine battalion had been sent to Ramadi to bolster the battalion that had been in place there, and that American forces were killing or capturing an undetermined number of insurgents, some of whom had fled Falluja, and seizing weapons throughout the city.
 The battle in Baquba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, began about 7 a.m., when insurgents with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked American troops near a downtown traffic circle and police station. Guerrillas also fired at the Americans from a mosque, Captain Coppernoll said.
 Once American and Iraqi forces killed or chased off the insurgents, he said, they searched the area around the mosque and found three rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 29 rocket-propelled grenade rounds, 2 mortar devices, 10 mortar rounds and hundreds of bullets.
 At the same time, insurgents attacked the police station in the southern suburb of Buhriz, long a trouble spot, and burned four police cars.
 At 7:50 p.m., in Old Baquba, at least 15 insurgents piled off a bus and took up positions along a rooftop, Captain Coppernoll said. They blocked off roads heading west by planting bombs. As the firefight surged, the Americans called in a fighter jet that dropped two 500-pound bombs on insurgents massed in an open area, the captain said.
 As many as 20 insurgents were killed, and four Americans soldiers were wounded, he said. A doctor at Baquba Hospital told Reuters that the hospital had received eight dead from the fighting. 
 Farther north, guerrillas set fire to four oil wells near the Kirkuk fields. They also bombed a pipeline leading west to the oil refinery in Bayji, the largest in Iraq. Other fighters attacked an oil storage tank by the export pipeline leading from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
 The bombing of the storage tank took place southwest of Mosul, where American and Iraqi forces are struggling to recover from a revolt that began Thursday, when insurgents overran a half dozen police stations and made off with weapons, body armor and squad cars. Hundreds of policemen fled. At least seven policemen and 30 fighters have been killed in recent clashes, said Mr. Naqib, the interior minister.
 Insurgents driving two car bombs attacked an American patrol on the road to Tal Afar, a guerrilla stronghold west of Mosul, said Lt. Col. Paul Hastings, a spokesman for Task Force Olympia, the units charged with controlling northern Iraq. The first car bomb missed a light-armored Stryker vehicle and detonated, wounding five soldiers. The second was destroyed by gunfire.
 Guerrillas have begun using tandem suicide car bombs recently, Colonel Hastings said. The number of car bombs in Mosul has at least doubled during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, which ends on Tuesday, Colonel Hastings said.
 Other clashes erupted around Mosul. A bomb exploded beneath a police car at the Zahoor police station, one of the stations looted and burned by rebels on Thursday.
 But the violence had calmed since then, and children could be seen playing in some parks.
 At one playground, Amin Muhammad, 10, and his friends raced around with plastic guns. ''We divide ourselves into two teams,'' he said, ''the mujahedeen versus the American forces.''
 And in their battles, he said, the mujahedeen always win.

HEADLINE: Capone May Have Slept Here, Too, Canadian Town Says

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: MOOSE JAW, Saskatchewan, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
This Bible Belt prairie town won a small measure of fame in the 1981 film ''Atlantic City'' when Susan Sarandon told Burt Lancaster, ''You'd marry anyone to get out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.''
 But that was before Al Capone made a comeback as the symbol of the town's resurgence.
 On the surface, Moose Jaw may not be the most exciting place in the world. The 33,500 inhabitants of ''the Friendly City'' attend church regularly and obsess about the performance of the Warriors of the Western Hockey League (very ugly this year, by the way). The winters here are breath-catchingly frigid on the best of days. The avenues are treeless and bordered by dour brick warehouses and seedy hotels. 
 But there was another side of Moose Jaw, it turns out, an underside that reveals a darker aspect of Canadian history, one rarely highlighted in a country that fancies itself an angel in an imperfect world.
 The peccadilloes were largely hushed up until 1985, when a truck fell through a downtown street, revealing a tunnel that led into a vast underground network. Anthropologists and local historians concluded that the tunnels connected several hotels that were long rumored to have served as brothels and saloons during Prohibition.
 An Alberta magazine began poking around, followed by a mayor's task force, and piece by piece an unsavory past emerged that the townspeople had a hard time squaring with their wholesome self-image. 
 While the good people of Moose Jaw were going to church a century ago, for example, some of the townspeople were exploiting and brutalizing illegal Chinese immigrants, forcing them -- according to some reports -- to hide in the tunnels, which were built to service underground steam boilers that heated the town.
 During the Prohibition era, from 1919 to 1933, the police force fell into the well-greased palms of organized crime -- reputedly controlled by Capone, who was said to run gambling dens and houses of prostitution up and down River Street, all connected by the tunnels. 
 Prohibition, of course, was an American idea, one that made little impression north of the border. Some of Canada's provinces experimented with controlling alcohol in the early 20th century, but liquor was legal throughout Canada during most of Prohibition. Yet, as a major railroad center that connected western Canada to Minneapolis and Chicago, Moose Jaw emerged as a trafficking hub for bootleg liquor and drugs.
 ''It was a revelation,'' said Maurice Richard Libby, a local musician and writer who is the co-author of a history of Moose Jaw. 
 ''The Canadian self-image is that we have a bland history that is exemplified by the perception that the American West was violent and colorful, while in Canada it was peaceful and bland,'' he said. ''Once the tunnel thing exploded, people went 'Wow!' and instead of calling Moose Jaw 'the Friendly City,' it became 'Little Chicago.''' Within a few years, the tunnels became the centerpiece of a marketing program aimed at reversing years of economic decline.
 Now, rather than a skeleton in the closet, ''Uncle Al'' is more like a founding father. Stores sell Capone coffee mugs, fedoras and toy tommy guns. The coffee shop by the bus depot calls itself Big Al's Cafe, and one of the seediest motels in town renamed itself Capone's Hideaway. A mural above the slot machines at a new casino depicts Capone smoking a cigar while a waiter pours some whiskey into his coffee cup.
 ''Uncle Al is a big draw,'' said Mike Darling, the manager of Capone's Hideaway. ''People are jumping on the bandwagon.'' 
 Actually, that is not entirely true. Descendants of the old establishment and some churchgoers found the phenomenon embarrassing. In local elections a few years ago, politicians debated how and whether to subsidize tourist businesses that use Capone as a marketing tool. The pro-Capone forces won the day. 
 The celebration of Moose Jaw's seedier side is highlighted by a rough reproduction of Capone's hideaway in part of the tunnel complex, managed by a private company. Tour guides show off a supposed replica of Capone's bedroom and an office with a pair of binoculars that were used to spy on the ladies who worked on the third floor of a nearby hotel. The spats, silk pajamas and custom-made bed were all bought at local antique and knickknack shops, and supervisors openly say their exhibit is simply ''research tourism'' that is not to be taken literally.
 Capone's presence in Saskatchewan smuggling is documented by court documents in nearby Regina that show that the gangster Dutch Schultz sued him over a shipment of 60 cases of bad liquor. The suit was withdrawn after Capone refunded the money.
 But evidence that Capone ever actually walked the streets of Moose Jaw is sketchy. The only documentary evidence was found in a dentist's appointment book that includes the name Al Brown, a known Capone alias -- chosen, of course, because it is such a popular name.
 Whoever Al Brown was, there are also persistent stories of Capone patronizing a local barber shop. A local paper once quoted a retired doctor who no longer lives in Moose Jaw as saying that he treated Capone for tonsillitis.
 Many in Moose Jaw just smile and wink; others cringe over a possible misuse of history.
 ''I call tourism the snake oil of the new millennium,'' said Brian Swanson, a Moose Jaw city councilman who is skeptical that Capone ever actually set foot here. But Mr. Swanson refused to say what he really thought of the town's capitalizing on its bootlegging past.
 ''The last thing I need is to be the guy who kicks this thing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Preparing Spicy Meals, He Keeps Depression at Bay

BYLINE: By CATE DOTY

 BODY:
It is time for dinner at Metro Club in Brooklyn, and a spicy scent wafts through its airy rooms. Caesar Quinones has made his special chicken curry, and his diners are drifting toward the kitchen, ready for the meal.
 For Mr. Quinones, 52, cooking is more than a necessary pleasure or even a stress reliever. It is a diversion from his severe depression, which has plagued him since he was a teenager. 
 It is a relief from the memories of a life of homelessness and working the streets. It is a reminder that despite his problems, he can live a normal life.
 ''I'm not a chef, but I like my people to eat, and I want them to enjoy it,'' he said.
 Mr. Quinones, a fidgety, slight man with a sassy wit, grew up in the projects of Brooklyn, raised by a friend of an absent mother and a father he met only once. He said that he realized he was gay before his 10th birthday, and that he never attempted to hide his sexuality. He was abused and raped because of it, he said. 
 After a secret relationship with an older man, Mr. Quinones dropped out of middle school and never returned. He left home when he was 17 and headed for the streets, where he became a prostitute and a drag queen. He was known on the streets as Elizabeth.
 Mr. Quinones lived on and off the streets of New York for 15 years, collecting public assistance checks and earning a scant living through prostitution and odd jobs. He never held any sort of steady employment. 
 It was this destitution combined with his depression that pushed Mr. Quinones to find mental and economic help. After floating through several treatment programs and hospitalization for his depression, Mr. Quinones started attending a day program at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The bureau, in turn, put him in touch with Metro Club. 
 Mr. Quinones soon became the club's unofficial cook and now prepares meals there four days a week. He first learned to cook as a child, and his lessons in Puerto Rican cooking still influence his cuisine now. He adds just a kick of spice to everything he makes and kisses his fingers when talking of his pork roast, which he says is ''to die for.''
 ''I don't like to cook plain,'' he said. ''What do you expect? My people are from the Caribbean.''
 Metro Club, which is run by the Brooklyn Bureau, provides a community center and a support group for the mentally ill people who go there every day. A one-floor suite in an office building in downtown Brooklyn, the room -- called the clubhouse by its participants -- houses computers, a large-screen TV, couches, a library and an 8-by-8-foot birdhouse that the members built for $12. They were worried that their birds were depressed because their smaller cage did not give them enough room to fly.
 The club is run on a $400,000 annual budget, and its participants pay nothing for the services there. Instead, they are expected to contribute their time and skills to keep the club running. Some, like Mr. Quinones, develop skills that their case workers hope will help them secure a real job -- something that excites and daunts Mr. Quinones, who worries that he will lose his public assistance. He receives $632 a month and pays $195 for rent.
 Mr. Quinones credits the support of the club's members for helping him climb out of his depression.
 ''We may not have the same problems, but we understand each other,'' he said. 
 As his chicken curry steamed and hissed in two large iron pots on the stove, Mr. Quinones checked his cafeteria apron and adjusted his hair net. He scrubbed his hands as soon as he walked into the kitchen. He abides by the rules he learned in the Department of Health's food preparation program last summer. The Neediest Cases helped him participate.
 Several Metro Club members have received help from the fund through the Brooklyn Bureau. Through Metro Club, Mr. Quinones received $100 from the fund to pay for the program. He learned the right temperatures for meat preparation, along with proper cleaning and sterilization techniques. His certificate now hangs on the clubhouse wall, and he hopes that the skills he learned there will help him find work.
 Now, Mr. Quinones lives by himself in a small apartment filled with plants in Crown Heights, and he attends a day treatment program for the mentally ill four days a week. His housing is provided through a supported living program for the mentally ill, and residents are required to pay about 30 percent of their income toward the rent. For Mr. Quinones, that means $195 pays for his peace and solitude after a lifetime of drifting.

HEADLINE: In City's Ruins, Military Faces New Mission: Building Trust

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; This article was reported by Dexter Filkins in Falluja and written by James Glanz in Baghdad.

DATELINE: FALLUJA, Iraq, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
When the owners of one house near the farthest southern boundary of this city return, they will find a crater 40 feet across and 8 feet deep, with one wall still standing and recognizable pieces of a ceiling strewn beside it. A broken kebab stand, its canopy collapsed, its two wheels exposed, leans over crazily into one lip of the crater.
 The entire street in this district looks about the same. On Monday morning, after they had seemingly been crushed the day before, insurgents began firing from windows, bunkers and piles of rubble, setting off a five-hour gun battle. The street, once flat, has been hit with so many 500-pound bombs that it looks like the zone of collision between oceanic ice sheets, with huge dips and shelves of pavement and soil. 
 Now the American military faces the urgent but almost paradoxical imperative of rebuilding the city it just destroyed in order to defeat the rebels who had held it for so long. The devastation that the battle has wrought will not be easy to repair. The human and political effects of that devastation could rapidly spread far beyond Falluja.
 Military engineers are already starting to deploy throughout the city with tens of millions of dollars at their disposal to fix some of the damage. If the engineers do not succeed, then the outrage that is likely to be generated among returning residents at the sight of obliterated mosques, cratered houses and ground-up streets will spread.
 Either way, the results will deeply mark the American-backed government's ability to gain the trust of the people here and carry out elections, scheduled for late January.
 The radio code name for the artillery crews who bring in many of the big shells is ''steel rain.'' That is what came down when the battle started at 7 a.m. on Monday. The day before, tanks and fighting vehicles had come roaring through here shooting at anything that moved, but dozens of the insurgents apparently lay low.
 They hid in the ugly concrete houses of this neighborhood, where the city of Falluja stops quite abruptly along a street running east to west. They also waited in a row of makeshift earthen bunkers in a field of slag heaps and trash about 100 yards south of the rubble-strewn street.
 As always in this battle, at the center of the fight was one of the mosques the insurgents have surrounded with ramparts and firing positions, and where they have placed weapons caches. At one point the fighting swirled on all sides of the mosque, and Marine companies became confused about exactly where friendly troops were.
 ''We've got a back-alley gunfight going on,'' said Capt. Read Omohundro, commander of Company B of the First Battalion, Eighth Marines. ''So watch where you fire into the mosque!''
 A tank fired a round at an insurgent sniper in the minaret and punched a hole straight through the middle of it -- and scored a direct hit on the insurgent. ''We turned a guy into rubble,'' a marine said.
 But the minaret, smoking like a chimney, stood there with the daylight showing through it, and later a marine in Company B was killed while climbing stairs inside, shot by an insurgent who had somehow remained above. After two other marines retrieved his body, a pair of 500-pound bombs were called in and the mosque was no more.
 The incompatible images that have marked the battle for Falluja, like a fairy tale etched on a tombstone, turned up again in a trench dug around the mosque. An exercise book for learning to write in English lay open on the dirt, the last blank on the page neatly filled in with these words: ''She isn't playing today. Neither is the other girl.''
 The steel rain fell, and fell. Telephone poles came down, their wires threading in and out of rubble piles. Fires burned out of control. Tanks rolled over cars. Hungry dogs roamed the streets.
 The insurgents killed at least one other marine today -- he looked into a room where half a dozen were waiting, and they shot him before dragging off his body and his gun. Marines recovered his body.
 But however deadly the rebels were able to make this filthy dead-end in the desert, there was also something terribly pathetic about their stand. After the makeshift bunkers had been mercilessly bombed, a man in a white dishdasha emerged and tried to get away by crawling across the slag heaps. He was machine-gunned, he plopped to the ground, and he died where he fell.
 Despite what appeared to be the collapse of the insurgency here, Lt. Col. Gareth Brandl cautioned: ''This is not won yet. Now we have to rebuild the city.''

HEADLINE: Shares Up Modestly in Lackluster Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed in quiet trading yesterday, with blue-chip and technology shares rising only modestly despite lower oil prices and news of several mergers and acquisitions.
 The drop in energy prices and pickup in merger activity were encouraging to analysts, who were not distressed by the day's lackluster trading. They said that after three solid weeks of gains, and in the absence of any new economic data, it was natural for investors to take a step back.
 ''People are trying to figure out what's next for the market,'' said Dean Junkans, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Client Services. ''I think people are looking for that year-end rally, and wondering whether we've already gotten a bunch of it or if we've got more to run. I think we've got more to run.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 11.23 points, or 0.1 percent, at 10,550.24 yesterday.
 The broader gauges were narrowly mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.36 points at 1,183.81, and the Nasdaq composite added 8.75 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,094.09.
 Oil prices dropped, continuing a three-week trend that has taken crude futures down from their record level of $55 a barrel. Light, sweet crude for December delivery shed 45 cents to $46.87 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Analysts noted that the market was entering a seasonally strong period, which might help keep stocks aloft through the end of the year.
 ''Three weeks ago we were at the lower end of the move over the past year, and now we're at the upper end,'' said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn. ''So we've completed the lows to the highs in a matter of three weeks. But historically it's a lot easier to get a market going this time of year.''
 Shares of General Electric fell to $36.10, a 15-cent drop, after it announced plans to buy Edwards Systems Technology, a maker of fire safety and security systems, from SPX for nearly $1.4 billion in an all-cash deal. SPX rose $1.22, or 2.8 percent, to $44.21 a share. 
 Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, the candy and gum maker, added 72 cents, to $68.08 a share, after it announced an agreement to buy several brands, including Life Savers and Altoids, from Kraft for $1.48 billion. Kraft declined 20 cents, to $34.68 a share.
 Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, added 10 cents, rising to $45.10 a share, after announcing plans to buy MarketWatch, operator of a financial news Web site, for about $519 million in a deal that would end a bidding war for the company. MarketWatch closed up $1.33, or 7.9 percent, at $18.12.
 Lowe's, the home improvement chain, was down $1, or 1.7 percent, at $59.25, after reporting a 15.5 percent rise in third-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street expectations by 6 cents a share. The company also reiterated its forecast, which may have disappointed investors who were expecting an increase.
 Microsoft was up 42 cents at $27.39 as Wall Street adjusted its price to reflect the company's special $3 dividend, payable Dec. 3. 
 While the stock has gone up since the dividend was announced in July, the company still faces questions about profit growth and a dearth of large software introductions in the coming year.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note lost 2/32, to a price of 10016/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.19 percent from 4.18 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Misses Quarterly Report Filing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The mortgage giant Fannie Mae missed a regulatory deadline on Monday for filing its third-quarter financial results after its independent auditor, KPMG, refused to sign off on the report.
 Fannie Mae, which was recently cited by regulators in the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight for serious accounting problems and accused of earnings manipulation, notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would not file the report on time. 
 Regulators had ordered Fannie Mae to make major recalculations, and the delay led to speculation as to whether the company, which backs one of every five home loans in the United States, would restate earnings.
 The S.E.C. is investigating Fannie Mae's accounting.
 The company said that if the S.E.C. finds that it has improperly accounted for derivatives, the financial instruments it uses to hedge against interest-rate swings, it would show a net loss of $9 billion for the quarter.
 Fannie Mae also acknowledged that some of its accounting policies did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, apparently contradicting recent public statements by top executives who have defended the company's accounting.
 Fannie Mae shares ended the regular trading session Monday at $70.20, down 21 cents. After hours, they fell $2.04, to $68.16.

HEADLINE: Deficit Soars At Agency That Insures Pension Plans

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The federal agency that insures pension plans said yesterday that its deficit, already at the highest in its history, had doubled in its last fiscal year, to $23.3 billion.
 Over a 12-month period, the agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, incurred losses of $12.1 billion, according to the agency's audited annual report for fiscal 2004. Much of the loss was a result of pension fund failures in the airline industry.
 The agency, created in 1974 to be the federal safety net when pensions fail, has now lost an average of $10 billion a year for the last three years, according to one estimate. The mounting losses come at a time when the agency is responsible for paying the pensions for more than one million people covered by pension plans that failed. 
 The agency's executive director, Bradley D. Belt, called on Congress yesterday to address the situation quickly, ''so the problem doesn't spiral out of control.'' He said that the Bush administration was preparing a plan for a comprehensive overhaul of the pension system, which it would propose early next year.
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is paid premiums by companies that offer traditional pension plans. But it does not have the legal authority to raise those premiums or take other fundamental steps to bring its finances back into balance. Such measures would have to be enacted by Congress. 
 Congress, however, has not addressed the problems of America's pension system in a comprehensive way since the late 1980's, when a number of large steel companies with traditional pension plans defaulted. Since then, lawmakers have made some lesser amendments to the system, but even those have been made with great difficulty. The issues involved are complicated, and any true pension reform will be costly to someone -- either companies, workers or the federal government.
 Experts warn that waiting will not make the troubles go away. The system of regulating and insuring traditional pensions called defined-benefit pensions is increasingly resembling the system that did the same for the savings and loan industry two decades ago. 
 Congress had difficulty correcting that system's structural problems as well. As a result, there were delays and missteps, and the problems had years to grow and deepen. In the end, the entire system collapsed in 1989 and Congress had to authorize a federal bailout that cost about $200 billion.
 ''The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is living on borrowed time,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who has followed the troubles in the pension system closely. He issued a statement yesterday saying the possibility of ''an S.&L.-style taxpayer bailout of the agency to the tune of billions of dollars has increased.''
 In announcing the pension agency's latest financial results, Mr. Belt, the executive director, said that it was not running out of cash. With reserves of $39 billion, he said, it should be able to keep sending retirees their pension checks ''for a number of years,'' even if Congress does nothing.
 The problem is that the pensions the agency must pay retirees are much larger than the reserves, Mr. Belt said. The pensions owed retirees measure $62.3 billion in today's dollars.
 Unless the agency finds a way to close the gap between the $39 billion that it has and the $62 billion that it owes, it will run out of money at some point. In that case, either retirees will be denied their benefits, or else Congress will have to appropriate money for a bailout.
 Mr. Belt also noted that the agency's problems were worsening at a time when the general economic environment has been improving. He said the agency now faced $96 billion worth of risk from companies that are ''reasonably possible'' to default on their pension promises. The comparable number a year ago was just $82 billion.
 The pension agency identifies such companies by looking at their corporate credit ratings, together with the weakness of their pension funds.
 The agency does not identify the companies whose pension plans it expects to take over. Still, it is clear that the airline industry was responsible for much of the agency's loss for the fiscal year.
 US Airways three pension funds are expected to cost the agency $2.1 billion. And United Airlines, a unit of UAL, recently announced that it would terminate all four of its pension plans as part of its efforts to emerge from bankruptcy. Taking over United's pensions alone will cost the agency an estimated $6.3 billion, by far the biggest pension insurance claim ever made by a single company. Accounting rules require the agency to book that loss in its fiscal 2004, even though it has not yet taken over United's plans.
 Even before yesterday's announcement, analysts were warning that the pension agency needed help. Douglas J. Elliott, president of the Center on Federal Financial Institutions, said that if Congress took corrective action quickly, the cost would be small relative to the cost of a bailout some time in the future. The center is a nonpartisan research institute that examines the federal government's various lending and insurance programs.
 Mr. Elliott said that the agency's new numbers brought its average losses to more than $10 billion a year for three years.
 ''This is a trend,'' he said. ''This isn't something where you can just say, 'Well, that was a bad year, thank goodness we're over it.'''
 In addition, the agency's fiscal 2004 was a year of general improvement in overall economic and financial conditions, Mr. Elliott said. Had interest rates not changed slightly in the agency's favor, its losses would have been even larger.
 Congress is not expected to address the pension agency's problems in the current lame duck session because it already has a full workload. But some members said yesterday that they were concerned about the strength of the nation's pension system and hoped to introduce legislation early in 2005.
 ''This issue has wide-ranging implications on retirees, employers, workers, taxpayers and the government,'' said Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. Boehner said in a statement that he planned to introduce a bill in 2005 that would address what he called ''systemic pension underfunding problems.''
 The Education and Workforce Committee has already held hearings on the problems of the pension system and possible remedies. Mr. Boehner said that in addition to making sure companies set aside enough money for their pensions, the bill would require companies to disclose clear information about their pension plans and pay adequate insurance premiums for their coverage.
 In addition to the premiums it collects from companies, the pension insurance program receives the assets from the failed pension funds it takes over and invests them. It does not currently receive money from income tax receipts.
 The insurance premiums have not been increased since 1994 and are thought to be inadequate relative to the amount of insurance coverage companies receive. United Airlines, for instance, has paid about $50 million in insurance premiums over the years, for coverage of its $6.3 billion claim.
 Pension specialists also point out that the premiums do not have anything to do with the amount of risk companies bring to the pension insurance program. Companies with pension plans that do not have adequate funds do pay higher premiums than companies with strong plans. But that way of operating does not account for one of the most important signs of whether the plan will collapse or not: the company's own health.
 A strong company with an unhealthy pension plan poses nowhere near the risk of a weak company with an unhealthy pension plan.
 Mr. Boehner has suggested finding a way to distinguish between weak and strong companies, and charge higher premiums to the companies that pose greater risk.

HEADLINE: A Legacy Defined by Mad Cow And Mixed Land-Use Reviews

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
As the first woman to serve as secretary of agriculture, Ann M. Veneman won praise from industry for her response when mad cow disease surfaced in Canada and Washington State last year and oversaw a period of record harvests and high profits for American farmers.
 But Ms. Veneman, a 55-year-old California lawyer, got mixed reviews from environmental groups on her stewardship of the department's extensive conservation and land management responsibilities. 
 Her departure took many in Washington by surprise, coming just a few days after she had indicated to reporters she wanted to stay on. In a resignation letter dated Friday, Ms. Veneman told President Bush, ''We have made great progress during the past four years and I feel now is an appropriate time for me to move on to new opportunities.'' 
 ''She has a great record,'' said Tracy Grondine, a spokeswoman for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents five million farmers and ranchers. She praised Ms. Veneman's handling of the appearance last year of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, saying the Agriculture Department's reaction ''made the impact less and the fear factor much less than it could have been.''
 Some consumer groups have complained that her department has not done enough to protect the food supply from mad cow, the rare but devastating neurological disease that can be caused by eating infected beef.
 Chris Wood, vice president of the conservation group Trout Unlimited, said that ''from a conservation standpoint, her record was lackluster.'' Mr. Wood said environmentalists were unhappy with her moves as overseer of the United States Forest Service to ease restrictions on the use of public lands.
 But she got higher marks for working through the Natural Resources Conservation Service with farmers and other landowners to encourage preservation of private land, said Mr. Wood, who worked in the Forest Service during the Clinton administration.
 A dozen people were mentioned on Monday by industry and Washington insiders as possible replacements, including Ambassador Allen F. Johnson, the chief agriculture negotiator for the office of the United States trade representative; William T. Hawks, under secretary of agriculture for marketing and regulatory programs; Chuck Conner, a top White House aide on agriculture; Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr., a Republican congressman from Washington who gave up his seat for an unsuccessful Senate campaign; and Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a 13-term Texas Democrat who lost his seat in the election.
 Whoever gets the post will face the job of persuading major customers for American beef like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to fully reopen their markets, which were closed after the mad cow case in December, said Jim Wiesemeyer, a farm policy analyst with Informa Economics, an agricultural consulting company, and a longtime agricultural writer.
 In addition, the next agriculture secretary will face a decision on a rule proposed by the Agriculture Department that could open some 60 million acres of federal forests to logging. The rule, which would exempt states from restrictions imposed by the Clinton administration, drew strong opposition from conservation groups during a public comment period that ended Monday.
 The daughter of a peach farmer, Ms. Veneman served in other posts in the Agriculture Department from 1986 to 1993 in the Reagan and first Bush administrations. 
 Ms. Veneman was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 but did not miss a day of work while completing a successful course of surgery and radiation treatment.

HEADLINE: Europeans Say Iran Agrees to Freeze Uranium Enrichment

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
France, Britain and Germany announced Monday that they had reached a formal agreement with Iran committing the country to freeze a critical part of its nuclear program in exchange for an array of possible rewards.
 Under the complex but limited agreement, intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear bombs, Tehran has agreed to suspend all of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities while it negotiates the benefits it is to receive.
 While both sides were relieved to reach an agreement, neither seemed particularly satisfied. Both sides had to make hard concessions, and the pact fell far short of the comprehensive deal the Europeans had hoped for, by which Iran would permanently stop enriching uranium. 
 Iran is the second largest oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the announcement of the deal appeared to have calmed fears in the commodities markets, propelling crude oil prices to their lowest levels in almost two months.
 ''We believe that the conclusion of this agreement can both allow for confidence-building in respect of Iran's nuclear program and represent a significant development in relations between Europe and Iran,'' Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain said in a written statement. ''It is essential now for the agreement to be implemented in full.''
 In Brussels, Javier Solana, the European Union's senior foreign affairs official, said the deal could open the way for ''a solid, long-term agreement'' with Iran if there could be ''lasting confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.''
 Enriched uranium has become a contentious issue because it can be used to make nuclear weapons as well as fuel for nuclear power plants.
 The Bush administration reacted cautiously to the announcement, saying top officials wanted to study the agreement's details before endorsing it. But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that ''we have seen a little bit of progress, hopefully, over the last 24 hours.''
 Administration officials said conservative hard-liners, most notably John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, were highly skeptical that Iran would carry out the accord without cheating. Officials were also said to be concerned that by itself the deal might lead to complacency that the problem of Iran's suspected nuclear arms program was being addressed.
 The Europeans were deeply embarrassed after Iran violated a much vaguer agreement to suspend enrichment activities that was reached in Tehran 13 months ago. This time, the Europeans insisted that Iran accept the new agreement as negotiated and rejected Iran's attempts in the last several days to modify it.
 In a related development, the United Nations agency that monitors nuclear programs said Iran had informed the agency that it would suspend its uranium enrichment program starting a week from now. That step, which covers verification and monitoring, was a necessary part of the pact with the Europeans.
 But the agency, known as the International Atomic Energy Agency, did not totally reject the view of the United States and the three European countries that Iran was trying to develop nuclear weapons, saying it could not rule out covert activities.
 ''All the declared nuclear material in Iran has been accounted for, and therefore such material is not diverted to prohibited activities,'' the agency said in a report, referring to possible weapons activity. ''The agency is, however, not in a position to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.''
 Under the agreement with the Europeans, there must be ''objective guarantees'' that Iran's nuclear program ''is exclusively for peaceful purposes.'' In exchange, the Europeans must provide ''firm guarantees on nuclear, technological and economic cooperation and firm commitments on security issues.''
 Specifically, Iran agreed to suspend ''the manufacture and import of gas centrifuges and their components,'' all work on plutonium separation and the construction or operation of any plutonium separation installation, and ''all tests or production at any uranium conversion installation.''
 Last year's agreement said nothing about the production and assembly of centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, and when inspectors from the United Nations agency caught Iran building them, the Europeans felts duped.
 The agreement also commits both sides to combating terrorist activities, including those of Al Qaeda and the Iranian opposition group known as the People's Mujahedeen.
 Once the suspension of enrichment is verified, the European Union will restart negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran. It will also ''actively support'' negotiations for Iran to enter the World Trade Organization, a move that the Bush administration has blocked and can continue to block.
 Iran's leadership has steadfastly held to the position that Iran is not engaged in a nuclear weapons program but has the sovereign right to enrich uranium. So as a face-saving gesture, the agreement says Iran's suspension of enrichment activities ''is a voluntary confidence-building measure and not a legal obligation.''
 Hassan Rowhani, Iran's chief negotiator on nuclear issues, reiterated that point in a news conference in Tehran on Monday, calling uranium enrichment ''Iran's right,'' and adding that ''Iran will never give up its right to enrich uranium.''
 He also said the suspension during negotiations for the incentives package ''will be a matter of months, not years,'' an assertion that the Europeans immediately rejected.
 ''Suspension must remain in force until the I.A.E.A. gives Iran a clean bill of health,'' said one European official. ''If the suspension is lifted the process is deemed to have broken and we, the Europeans, will withdraw and go to the Security Council.''
 Making concessions on its nuclear program has been widely unpopular inside Iran, and Mr. Rowhani was put on the defensive by conservative Iranian journalists.
 When a reporter for the official Islamic Republic News Agency remarked, ''The reason Iran has given so many concessions is because the Iranian team was weak,'' Mr. Rowhani replied that the country's best diplomats had conducted the negotiations and ''this is the outcome of our best diplomacy.''
 Another Iranian journalist cited an interview in an Iranian newspaper that accused Iran of giving ''a pearl in exchange for a lollipop.''
 ''That's not true,'' Mr. Rowhani shot back.

HEADLINE: Election Over, McCain Criticizes Bush on Climate Change

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Wasting no time distancing himself from President Bush on an issue that has long divided them, Senator John McCain yesterday called the White House stance on climate change ''terribly disappointing'' and said inaction in the face of mounting scientific data was unjustified.
 Two weeks after the end of a campaign in which he stumped for Mr. Bush's re-election, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, is convening a Senate hearing today on the human effect on climate and what to do about it. 
 Mr. Bush, citing the cost to the economy and what the administration describes as the uncertainty of the science, has opposed restrictions on carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases since early 2001, when he abandoned a pledge he made in his first presidential campaign to restrict carbon dioxide from power plants. 
 In contrast, for three years Mr. McCain has pushed for a bill he wrote with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, that would create the first, modest curbs on greenhouse gases. 
 ''This is a very time-sensitive issue,'' he said in an interview yesterday.
 Dana M. Perino, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Bush saw climate change as a serious issue but that he favored using voluntary means to slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, as ''a first step in an aggressive strategy to meet the challenge of long-term global climate change.''
 The focus of today's hearing, the last of Mr. McCain's six-year tenure as chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, will be rapid warming in the Arctic, the subject of a recent report by a panel of nearly 300 scientists. The report, commissioned by eight nations with Arctic territory, including the United States, found that rising temperatures had already eroded glaciers, sea ice and permafrost and could lead to vast changes in the region's environment and in global sea levels by the end of the 21st century. 
 The hearing is the latest of more than a dozen on human-caused global warming that Mr. McCain has convened during his chairmanship of the committee. The new chairman is expected to be Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who has voted against Mr. McCain's bill but has often said that the warming climate poses a severe challenge to his state and particularly to indigenous Arctic cultures. 
 The hearings have been organized in part to build a case for the McCain-Lieberman bill, called the Climate Stewardship Act. 
 Mr. McCain said that the bill, which he describes as modest, had probably lost some support in the Senate because of the election results, but that he looked at this as a temporary setback.
 ''We got 43 votes,'' he said of the last vote on the bill, a year ago. ''We may get less than that given the change in the Senate. But we need to get people on the record.''
 Environmental campaigners and industry lobbyists have tended to agree that whatever the bill's short-term prospects in the Senate, it is very unlikely to pass in the House any time soon.
 Mr. McCain said he had decided to agree to disagree with Mr. Bush on the issue during the campaign. But he strongly criticized frequent assertions by the White House, many Republican legislators and industry lobbyists that inaction was justified by uncertainty in the science.
 For their part, advocates associated with industry say Mr. McCain has custom-tailored his hearings to play up the direst climate projections. 
 After a McCain climate hearing in September, for example, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian group opposed to regulations as a solution to most environmental problems, described the gathering as ''another pep rally to build support for his energy rationing legislation'' and said it had ''focused on junk science.''
 But Mr. McCain said yesterday that the evidence, which he called alarming, was clearer than ever. 
 With several other senators, he visited the Arctic fringe in Norway and Iceland in late summer.
 ''It was remarkable,'' he said, ''going up on a small ship next to this glacier and seeing where it had been just 10 short years ago and how quickly it's receded.''
 Particularly disturbing, he went on, is the rapid pace of warming.
 ''The Inuit language for 10,000 years never had a word for robin,'' he said, ''and now there are robins all over their villages.''

HEADLINE: Schumer Says He Won't Run For Governor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Raymond Hernandez reported for this article from Washington and Michael Slackman from Albany.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Senator Charles E. Schumer on Monday ruled out running for governor of New York in 2006, saying that he would instead help lead the Democratic Party's efforts to retake the Senate.
 Mr. Schumer's decision reshapes the political landscape in New York State and leaves the field open to Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic state attorney general, who has been gearing up for the campaign. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican in his third term, has not said whether he will seek re-election. 
 Mr. Schumer, 53, who was just re-elected to a second term with a record 71 percent of the vote, made his decision to stay in Washington after seriously considering a jump to Albany, in part because of the diminished role of Democrats in the Senate.
 But top Democrats vigorously campaigned to keep him in Washington, promising him a spot on the powerful Finance Committee and persuading him to lead the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee through the midterm elections of 2006.
 With his decision to stay in Washington, New York Democrats will avoid a divisive 2006 primary between two of the most popular politicians in the state: Mr. Schumer is a proven vote getter and prodigious fund-raiser, and Mr. Spitzer, 45, has earned a national reputation by taking on the financial services and insurance industries.
 ''Schumer's decision is a great development for New York State Democrats for two reasons,'' said Mark Green, the former New York City public advocate. ''It means one of our own is clearly on the rise in Washington, and it means there won't be a $60 million bloodbath of a primary, making it harder to prevail in the fall of '06 for governor. It is a major and clarifying moment for state politics and Democratic electoral politics.''
 Mr. Schumer's new appointments in Washington raise his standing at a time when Northeastern liberals have become politically marginalized and New York's largely Democratic delegation in Washington finds itself sidelined in Congress.
 ''It elevates him to the top ranks,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic political strategist who has advised New York lawmakers on Capitol Hill. ''He is now simultaneously occupying two of the biggest seats at the Democratic table.''
 In an interview, Mr. Schumer said he was looking forward to the challenge now before him, particularly after the elections this month, when Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate with a net gain of four seats, giving them 55 of the Senate's 100 seats.
 ''We are at a crossroads both internationally and domestically, and to have an enhanced role in figuring out how we as a party and as a nation navigate these shoals is as exciting as it is vital,'' he said. ''And the importance to our party of electing more Democrats to the Senate in 2006 is obvious in light of the results of the recent election.''
 In addition to his seat on the Finance Committee, Mr. Schumer will keep his role on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he has become the Democrats' point person in opposing some of the Bush administration's judicial nominees and where Democrats are girding for a possible fight over Supreme Court appointments.
 As head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Mr. Schumer will have an instant national platform, with control over a huge campaign war chest and a direct hand in shaping the Democratic agenda on Capitol Hill.
 In many crucial respects, he was a logical choice for the job, political strategists say. Not only did Mr. Schumer win re-election by a historic margin, but he did so with roughly one-third of the Republican vote in New York, underscoring what many strategists say is his keen eye for issues with bipartisan appeal.
 More than that, though, Mr. Schumer was able to amass more money than any other Senate candidate -- roughly $26 million for a race in which he faced no serious opposition.
 Mr. Schumer has been particularly adept at tapping a network of donors on Wall Street as well as other players in New York's securities and banking industry. Democrats are clearly hoping he can do the same for the party.
 ''Senator Schumer is tough, focused and a formidable fund-raiser,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who will be elected minority leader this month. ''We need him on our leadership team.''
 As for New York, Mr. Schumer's decision to stay in Washington rapidly transformed the local political terrain, with Democrats being generally relieved about avoiding a bruising and costly gubernatorial primary and Republicans feeling disappointed. 
 ''A primary would have been great,'' said State Senator Michael A.L. Balboni, a Republican from Long Island who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for governor in 2006 should Mr. Pataki not run.
 Mr. Schumer's decision seems to be the final piece the state Democrats were looking for as they try to rebuild their hold on power, 10 years after Mario Cuomo lost his bid for a fourth term.
 Should Mr. Spitzer run for governor in 2006, he still faces the possibility of a primary from the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, who has promoted a fix-Albany campaign with mixed results, but Mr. Suozzi's bid would be a long shot, political analysts said.
 Mr. Schumer's decision also opens the field for a possible political comeback for Andrew Cuomo, a former cabinet secretary who abandoned his run for governor a week before the primary in 2002, and Mr. Green, who lost in his bid for mayor in 2001. Both have said they are considering a run for attorney general should Mr. Spitzer run for governor. 
 The potential field of attorney general candidates also includes Richard L. Brodsky, an assemblyman from Westchester, and Michael N. Gianaris, an assemblyman from Queens.
 The pressure on Mr. Schumer to stay in Washington was great. It was, in fact, Mr. Reid who phoned Mr. Schumer on Nov. 8 and urged him to take the helm of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee through the midterm elections, according to Congressional officials. 
 In that conversation, Mr. Reid also offered Mr. Schumer a seat on the powerful Finance Committee.
 Mr. Schumer has made no secret of his desire to join that committee, mindful that the last New Yorker to serve on it, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, was able to use the position to funnel billions of dollars to the state, particularly to its economically beleaguered hospitals.
 ''I have dreamed of getting on the Finance Committee since I got to the Senate,'' Mr. Schumer said on Monday.
 Now, with Mr. Schumer's moving up in Washington, with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about as a potential presidential candidate, and with Mr. Spitzer freed from a costly primary, New York Democrats may well find themselves at the forefront of the party's efforts to rebuild and redefine itself, political observers said.
 ''Now that America has gone red, New York has special strength because we are both blue and talented,'' said Mr. Green.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Senator Charles E. Schumers decision against running for governor of New York gave an incorrect attribution in some copies for the comment that it was ''a great development for New York State Democrats.'' It was made by Mark Green, former New York City public advocate, not Sheldon Silver, speaker of the State Assembly. In some copies the article also misstated the year in which Andrew Cuomo dropped out of the Democratic primary for governor. It was 2002, not 2000. 
An article on Tuesday about the political future of Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney general, misstated the year he first ran for that post. It was 1994, when he lost the Democratic primary, not 1998, the year he was elected.

HEADLINE: West Virginia Heads Down A Political Road Less Taken

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., Nov. 12 

 BODY:
On the eve of the presidential election, Democrats here could practically taste victory for Senator John Kerry.
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, the party's revered elder statesman, headlined boisterous rallies that seemed to augur a huge Democratic turnout. Coal miners and steel workers pounded on doors urging loyalists to vote. All that remained was for Democrats, who outnumber Republicans in this state by two to one, to do what they have done so many times before: vote the party line. 
 But they did not. President Bush trounced Mr. Kerry by 13 percentage points, doubling his margin of victory in West Virginia from 2000 and becoming the first Republican since William McKinley to win this once reliably Democratic state twice. 
 The Democrats' bad news did not end there. Kenneth Hechler, a 90-year-old former congressman, was soundly defeated for secretary of state by a little-known Republican, Betty Ireland, despite outspending her by more than two to one. Justice Warren McGraw of State Supreme Court, a fiery populist, was thrashed in his bid for re-election by a novice Republican candidate backed by business groups and coal operators. And three Democratic state senators were unseated by Republican insurgents. 
 ''I'd love to say I saw it all coming,'' said Gov. Bob Wise, a Democrat who is stepping down at the end of the year. ''But I thought we were going to win.''
 Drawn by a powerful conservatism on issues like abortion, gun control and same-sex marriage, and fed up with the state's shrinking population and perpetually high poverty rates, voters are leaving the Democratic Party in substantial numbers, party leaders say. 
 The defections have so alarmed the state chairman, G. Nicholas Casey Jr., that he sent a memorandum to county leaders this week demanding that they pledge loyalty to the party or resign their positions. 
 ''We need to step back and look hard at our party,'' Mr. Casey wrote. ''The Republican Party has become a force and it is a unified force.''
 The Republicans have indeed made significant strides, gaining 15 seats in the Legislature since 2002 and out-registering Democrats this year by nearly two to one. Their work paid off on Election Day, as the party's diverse strands came together with a fervor few thought possible, uniting evangelical Protestants with Roman Catholics, union members with Chamber of Commerce businessmen.
 Many Democrats now agree with political analysts who say the state will go the way of Kentucky and Tennessee, with Democrats continuing to control local governments but struggling to hold onto the Legislature and facing uphill battles in presidential races.
 ''This election will make it respectable to be a Republican,'' said Andy Gallagher, Justice McGraw's campaign manager.
 To be sure, the Republicans did not score a clean sweep. The Democratic candidate for governor, Secretary of State Joe Manchin, won with more than 60 percent of the vote.
 But in many ways, Mr. Manchin was the exception that proved the rule: He is one of the most conservative Democrats to win the job in decades, staunchly opposing abortion, gun control and gay marriage, and advocating a low-tax, pro-business economic platform.
 ''This state is not going to revert back to people voting blindly for Democrats,'' Mr. Manchin said in an interview. ''We're going to have to earn their votes. And if we don't, we'll continue to get picked off one by one.''
 Democratic leaders argued that Mr. Hechler lost because he was too old and that Justice McGraw was vastly outspent by a phalanx of business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce and Don L. Blankenship, chief executive of Massey Energy, who poured $3.5 million of his money into an advertising campaign harshly attacking Justice McGraw. 
 But they were deeply dismayed by Mr. Kerry's showing. Four years ago, Vice President Al Gore all but ignored the state, and his loss could be written off to neglect. This year, Democrats were out in force for months registering voters, recruiting volunteers and defending Mr. Kerry's positions on gun control, coal mining and steel tariffs. Yet the margin of defeat grew. 
 ''The Democrats did everything right by the playbook and still got blasted,'' said Robert Rupp, a professor of political science and history at West Virginia Wesleyan College. 
 The difference this year, Democrats and analysts said, was the fervent activity of conservative churches. For months, Bush campaign workers recruited support from pastors, registered church members and distributed literature after Sunday services. It was the kind of work unions have long done for Democrats, only this time the church vote outpaced the labor vote, Democrats said. 
 ''Some say the religious right is more powerful than labor ever was, and I think there's a lot of truth to that,'' said State Delegate Mike Caputo, a Democrat who works for the United Mine Workers of America.
 Mr. Casey and other leaders of the state party said the Democrats had already begun an outreach program to churches, arguing that most Democrats are as much against abortion, gay marriage and gun control as are Republicans. 
 But the erosion of Democratic support is as much due to demographic shifts as to the religious right, analysts said. The eastern panhandle abutting Maryland, long a Republican stronghold, is the fastest-growing part of the state, becoming an affluent bedroom community to Washington. Mr. Bush won handily there. 
 At the same time, the coal fields of the south, a Democratic redoubt for decades, have steadily lost population as mining jobs have dried up and young people have moved away. 
 Raleigh County, the home of Mr. Byrd and Representative Nick J. Rahall II, also a Democrat, exemplifies the shifting tides. Though Democrats still outnumber Republicans there, Mr. Bush took 60 percent of the vote and a Republican won a magistrate's seat for the first time in nearly eight decades. 
 Cultural issues were important there, but so was the economy. Joe Long, the chairman of the Raleigh County Republican Committee, said that Republicans hammered at state Democrats all year for presiding over decades of job losses, low income and high poverty rates. 
 ''We've been preaching that single-party rule has hurt West Virginia,'' Mr. Long said. ''People are listening, finally.''
 The Republicans are already suffering growing pains, evidenced in an internal struggle that led to the firing of the party's executive director after the election. But they are confidently looking to challenge Mr. Byrd in 2006 and take control of the Legislature in 2008, goals that no longer seem impossible. 
 Kris Warner, chairman of the state Republican Party, said Mr. Byrd was hurt by his harsh attacks against Mr. Bush, both in a book and on the stump. The senator's age may also be an issue; Mr. Byrd will be 88 when he is up for re-election. 
 ''He has lost his edge,'' Mr. Warner said of Mr. Byrd, who has been in the Senate since 1959. 
 Aides to Mr. Byrd said he planned to run again in 2006. In an e-mail message, Mr. Byrd pulled no punches on Mr. Bush, calling his administration dangerous. But he also warned that many Democrats had begun to question where the party stood on core issues.
 ''I have always known where the values of West Virginia lie -- patriotism, faith, family, opportunity, a clear sense of right and wrong, and justice,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''The Democratic Party needs to get back to reflecting those core principles.''

HEADLINE: France attempts to place itself first in the minds of U.S. investors looking to do business in Europe.

BYLINE: By Nat Ives

 BODY:
THE French government is starting an ad campaign this week to encourage American investors to do more business in France.
 The challenges might seem daunting, particularly given the tensions between the French and American governments over the war in Iraq. But the substance and purpose of the campaign turn out to have less to do with the United States and more to do with Europe.
 To be sure, the creators of the campaign worried about the chill between President Bush and President Jacques Chirac of France, which has played out in popular culture for several years now. 
 After all, the British owners of French's mustard issued a press release last year to say, ''The only thing French about French's mustard is the name!'' Last month, President Bush told a crowd at a campaign rally that he would never allow national security to be vetoed ''by countries like France.'' 
 And ''The Incredibles,'' the No. 1 movie in the United States this weekend, features a mocking French villain with the nom de guerre -- wait for it -- Bomb Voyage. 
 Those events and others were not unnoticed by the creative team. ''We were very nervous about that, as you can imagine,'' said Natalie Rastoin, director at the Paris office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, which created the campaign. ''Such difficult relationships were not good for the business.''
 When the agency began to research attitudes among business executives, however, it turned up signs of hope. ''Business people are very pragmatic,'' Ms. Rastoin said. ''They know when Mr. Chirac talks, it is not all the French speaking.
 ''That was a very good surprise,'' Ms. Rastoin added.
 On the other hand, the research turned up a set of beliefs about the French economy, workplace and worker that any campaign would have to address, said Keith Yazmir, vice president for North American marketing and communications at Invest in France, the government body behind the campaign.
 ''Through countless surveys and a tremendous amount of anecdotal evidence, it's become fairly clear that there is a misperception in the marketplace regarding the French business environment,'' Mr. Yazmir said.
 So the agency created a campaign focused on what mattered most: positioning France as the savvy investor's place to do business.
 Even though Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has famously located France in ''old Europe,'' the campaign uses the theme, ''The new France. Where the smart money goes.''
 Ads appearing in publications like The Wall Street Journal, Harvard Business Review and Time Global Business focus on business executives like Pasquale Pistorio, the president and chief executive at STMicroelectronics, a semiconductor company based in Geneva with significant investments in France. 
 The ads use a question-and-answer format to draw out the executives on France's best qualities with questions like, ''What do you think of the French worker? Be honest.''
 They also point readers to www.thenewfrance.com. (In addition to a host of figures on areas like infrastructure and productivity, the site also offers a ''new France'' screen saver.)
 One ad stars Sir Francis Mackay, chairman at the Compass Group, a food and food service provider based in Britain. The ad begins, ''Sir Francis Mackay of Compass Group came to France and discovered one of Europe's best-kept secrets: the French actually like to work.''
 That tidbit may indeed surprise some, especially in the wake of ''Bonjour Paresse,'' a best-selling book in France this summer, which encourages loafing and whose title means ''Hello Laziness.''
 But the conclusion of the ad goes even further, with this passage quoting Mr. Mackay: ''The French are the most productive people in Europe. They're committed and competitive. France is probably the most 'can do' country in Europe.''
 Mr. Yazmir of Invest in France said the campaign was partly in response to the European Union's expansion last May to 25 countries from 15 and partly to spread the word about an overhaul of the French business environment.
 ''Europe is becoming increasingly attractive as a market and as a target for business,'' Mr. Yazmir said. ''It makes sense for France to say, 'When you're looking at Europe, look here, because we can be more competitive than our neighbors.'''
 The campaign is part of a three-year global effort also focusing on Britain, China, Germany and Japan.

HEADLINE: The Dollar Is Down: Is It a Cause for Concern?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
It sounds eerily like the worst economic nightmare for President Bush's second term.
 Bogged down in a costly war that shows no sign of ending, the United States faces a gaping budget deficit and ballooning foreign indebtedness. The dollar plunges against other major currencies, while turmoil in the Middle East sends oil prices soaring. The rest of the decade is plagued by rising inflation, increased joblessness and sky-high interest rates.
 But the president under fire was Richard M. Nixon -- not George W. Bush. The war was in Vietnam, not Iraq. And the dollar crash was in 1973 rather than 2005. 
 Could it happen again? With the dollar down more than 40 percent against the euro since 2002, and hitting new lows since Mr. Bush's re-election, economists are debating whether America's foreign indebtedness could lead to a collapse in the dollar and a global financial crisis.
 The United States is spending nearly $600 billion more a year than it produces, almost 6 percent of its annual gross domestic product. Much of that spending has been financed by Asian governments, which bought more than $1 trillion in Treasury securities and other dollar assets in the last two years to help keep the dollar strong against Asian currencies. 
 Many analysts expect the financing gap to widen and the dollar to decline further. But there are at least three schools of thought on whether a dollar collapse is likely and, if it happens, what it would mean.
 One group, which includes the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, contends that global financial markets are awash in so much money that the United States can borrow much more than seemed possible 20 years ago.
 The dollar may well decline in value, according to this view, but the decline would be gradual and would help reduce American trade imbalances by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
 The Bush administration goes one step further, arguing that America's huge foreign debt simply reflects the eagerness of others to invest here.
 ''Productivity has been remarkably high in the last few years,'' John Taylor, deputy secretary of the Treasury, said at a recent conference. ''Foreigners want to invest in the United States. That's what that gap illustrates.''
 A second school of thought holds that foreign governments like China and Japan will continue to finance American borrowing and keep the dollar strong because they are determined to sustain their exports and create jobs.
 But a third school, which includes officials at the International Monetary Fund, worries about a collapse in the dollar that would send shock waves through the global economy.
 That group argues that the dollar needs to depreciate another 20 percent against the other major currencies but warns about a run on the dollar that could reduce its value by 40 percent.
 A collapse of that size would severely affect Europe and Asia, which have relied heavily on exports to the United States for their growth.
 A steep drop in the dollar could lead to higher interest rates for the federal government and American private borrowers, as foreign investors demanded higher returns to compensate for higher risk. And it could expose hidden weaknesses among financial institutions and hedge funds caught unprepared.
 ''There is a school of thought that the U.S. can keep borrowing forever,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University and a former chief economist at the I.M.F. ''But if you add up all the excess saving being thrown out by the surplus countries, from China to Germany, the United States is soaking up three-quarters of it right now.''
 For Mr. Rogoff and several other economists, the question is not whether the dollar declines -- but how fast and how far the fall turns out to be.
 The United States current account deficit, which encompasses annual trade as well as the balance of financial flows, has gone from zero in 1990 to nearly $600 billion this year. The United States' accumulated debt to foreign investors is $2.6 trillion, or 23 percent of the annual output of the economy.
 But where foreign investors in the 1990's poured trillions of dollars into American stocks and corporate acquisitions, investment from abroad now comes mostly from foreign central banks and goes heavily to buying Treasury securities that finance the federal deficit.
 Catherine Mann, a senior economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said today's financing gap could be expected to widen. Part of the problem lies with Europe and Japan, which grow more slowly than the United States and import less than they export.
 Higher costs of imported oil will aggravate the trade deficit even more, Ms. Mann said, and the federal government will be paying foreigners higher interest rates on its rapidly growing debt.
 ''You have a dynamic that links government deficits to current accounts deficits more than has been the case before,'' Ms. Mann said. ''We are going to have a lot of government securities out there, and a very high share of those Treasuries are owned by foreign investors.''
 But where Mr. Rogoff predicts that the dollar will slide sharply over the next two years, Ms. Mann predicts that Asian countries will continue to subsidize American imbalances to keep their economies growing. A decline in the dollar may be likely, but not a panicky flight by foreign investors.
 The American dollar has been through several ups and downs in recent decades. In 1973, it fell sharply against Japanese and European currencies -- the major industrialized countries had already abandoned the system of fixed exchange rates adopted at Bretton Woods after World War II.
 The dollar rebounded strongly in the early and mid-1980's in response to higher American interest rates, but then plunged 40 percent after leaders from the United States, Japan and Europe reached the so-called Plaza Accord in 1986 to nudge the dollar back down. The plunge after the Plaza Accord caused few disruptions for Americans, and foreign investors did not demand higher interest rates on securities.
 ''One theory is that investors were simply irrational,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Others said it was the result of what Charles DeGaulle called the 'exorbitant privilege' of being able to repay your debts in your own currency.''
 Some economists contend that the United States can postpone its day of reckoning for years. Richard N. Cooper, a professor of economics at Harvard, said the global pool of savings was about 10 times the United States' appetite for foreign capital last year and growing fast enough to easily finance $500 billion a year.
 The wild card is that most of the money is coming not from private investors but from foreign governments, led by Japan and China. Rather than profits, their goal has been to stabilize exchange rates and keep their exports from becoming more expensive.
 Many economists contend that the Asian central banks have created an informal version of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that lasted from shortly after World War II until the early 1970's.
 The system collapsed after the imbalances between Europe and the United States became impossible to reconcile. Rapid growth is putting similar pressure on China, which has kept its currency, the yuan, pegged at a fixed rate to the dollar.
 The growing imbalances, in both China and the United States, is one reason Mr. Rogoff is bracing for a jolt to the dollar and the American economy similar to the one that occurred in the early 1970's.
 Then, as now, the United States was running large budget and trade deficits. Then, as now, the United States was bogged down in a war costing billions of dollars a year. And in 1974, a few months after the dollar plunged against the German mark and Japanese yen, oil prices soared.
 ''It's striking how many parallels there are between today and the early 1970's,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''The loss of the anchor of the dollar and fixed exchange rates contributed to the inflation we saw in the 70's. It was the worst period in growth we have had since World War II.''

HEADLINE: Panel Pegs Illicit Iraq Earnings at $21.3 Billion

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
A Senate committee investigating the United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq estimates that during 13 years of international sanctions, Saddam Hussein's government made at least $21.3 billion illicitly -- more than double previous government estimates.
 Senator Norm Coleman, the Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said at a subcommittee hearing on Monday that he doubted that fraud and abuse on this scale could have gone undetected by senior United Nations officials or their American counterparts. Because it was unknown where the illicit money ended up, he said, he was worried that it may be helping to finance the insurgency in Iraq. 
 The United Nations aid program for Iraq ran from 1996 to 2003, easing some of the effects of the sanctions by allowing the country to make monitored sales of oil and use the money to purchase aid like food and medicine. Since then, there has been growing evidence that Mr. Hussein's government exploited the program with a campaign of illicit oil sales, illegal surcharges and kickbacks, as well as bribes aimed at lifting sanctions. 
 Senator Coleman said the huge scale of fraud and theft while United Nations penalties were in effect had created a ''dark stain'' over the world organization that raised questions about whether it could put in place and monitor any sanctions. 
 Questions about how much money was siphoned away from the oil-for-food program, and the money's ultimate use, were particularly troubling, he added, because of allegations that Benon V. Sevan, who was in charge of the United Nations program, had benefited from special allocations of oil from Mr. Hussein. 
 Mr. Sevan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
 However, Charles A. Duelfer, the top American weapons investigator in Iraq, who was the Senate panel's first witness, told the committee on Monday that based on Iraqi documents and what Iraqi officials had told him, he believed that Mr. Sevan had been given 13 million barrels of oil in special oil allocations. 
 The subcommittee's new higher estimates of Iraq's illicit gains are based on evaluations of earlier studies by the Government Accountability Office, the Pentagon, the Congressional Budget Office and Mr. Duelfer's Iraq Survey Group, along with new information and a million pages of documents secured by the Senate panel over its seven-month investigation. 
 Specifically, the panel estimated that Iraq made $3.9 billion from oil smuggling before the oil-for-food program was created in 1996; $4.4 billion in kickbacks on aid contracts; $241 million in illegal surcharges on the sale of Iraqi oil; $2.1 billion from the sales of substandard goods under the program; $9.7 billion from oil smuggling under the program; $405 million from abuses in aid contracts in the northern, mostly Kurdish, part of Iraq that Mr. Hussein did not directly control; and $403 million from the investment of its illicit income overseas.
 The documents, some of which were released Monday, also show how Iraqi officials, foreign companies, politicians and journalists benefited from Mr. Hussein's efforts to undermine support for sanctions and secretly gain money to build palaces and buy weapons.
 Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the panel's ranking minority member, said three-quarters of Iraq's illicit income came from trade protocols with Jordan and Turkey that the Clinton and Bush administrations had known about and ''winked at'' because support from those countries was vital.
 But Mr. Duelfer, in testimony before the Senate panel, insisted that although the protocols provided Iraq with illicit income, Mr. Hussein was successfully using illegal proceeds specifically from the oil-for-food program to undermine support for the sanctions that the United Nations imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
 Mark L. Greenblatt, a counsel for the Senate panel, said that beginning in 1998, Mr. Hussein had tried to ''manipulate the typical oil allocation process in order to gain influence throughout the world.'' Rather than let traditional oil companies buy oil, he said, Mr. Hussein ''gave oil allocations to officials, journalists and even terrorists, who then sold their allocations to the traditional oil companies in return for a sizable commission.''
 A document released Monday showed such payments to a Syrian journalist, Hamidah Nana, who said in an interview in 2003 that she was working hard to get sanctions against Iraq lifted. When Ms. Nana made the statement, Mr. Greenblatt said, she had already received oil allocations totaling 10 million to 12 million barrels of oil, and had made a profit, according to Iraq's Oil Ministry, of $1.4 million from transfer of the vouchers to a Panama-based company.
 Steven Groves, another of the subcommittee's counsels, said documents showed that Mr. Hussein had demanded kickbacks from companies who were supplying Iraq with food and medical aid. His presentation focused on payments by French and United Arab Emirates-based subsidiaries of the Weir Group, of Glasgow, which produces industrial valves for the oil industry.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Offer New Cargo Plane

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, responding to what it sees as improving world economic conditions, will offer a cargo version of its long-range, twin-engine 777 airplane beginning in late 2008. 
 The company, based in Chicago, said yesterday that it already had interest from several customers for the freighter version of the 777, but it declined to name those customers. 
Boeing executives said yesterday that the company sees a growing strength in the world economy and demand for cargo transport. Tom Crabtree, Boeing's regional cargo marketing director, said he expected that demand to be particularly strong in Asia.
 The announcement comes 14 years after the passenger version of the 777. The freighter version will be based on the 777-200LR, a longer-range version of the 777 that is being developed at the company's airplane manufacturing operations in Everett, Wash., north of Seattle. A passenger version of the 777-200LR is scheduled to go into service with Pakistan International Airlines in early 2006.
 Boeing said the 777 freighter version would have a range of up to 6,400 miles and the ability to carry 222,000 pounds of cargo.
 Mary Anne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Boeing's rival, Airbus, said the cargo version of its A380 jumbo jet, also due out in 2008, would be able to carry 341,000 pounds of cargo and would have the same range.

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Believe the Party Should Get Religion

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Bested by a Republican campaign emphasizing Christian faith, some Democrats are scrambling to shake off their secular image, stepping up efforts to organize the ''religious left'' and debating changes to how they approach the cultural flashpoints of same-sex marriage and abortion.
 Some call the election a warning. ''You can't have everybody who goes to church vote Republican; you just can't,'' Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council, said last week at a forum on the election.
 Religious traditionalists including Dr. Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention, and Jim Wallis of the liberal evangelical group Sojourners say Democratic officials are calling them for advice on reaching conservative Christians. And they and some other theologically orthodox supporters of Mr. Bush say it may not take much for Democrats to make inroads among their constituency, if the party demonstrates a greater friendliness to religious beliefs and even modestly softens its support for abortion rights. 
 ''It would not be hard,'' said the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the journal First Things and a conservative Catholic who has advised Mr. Bush on how to handle the issue of abortion.
 But Democrats disagree about how to establish the party's spiritual credentials. Some play down the need for changes, saying poorly framed surveys of voters leaving polls are overstating the impact of conservative Christian voters. Others argue that Democrats need to rephrase their positions in more moral and religious language. And an emboldened group of Democratic partisans and sympathetic religious leaders warn that Mr. Bush has beaten Democrats to the middle on social issues like abortion that resonate with religious traditionalists, arguing that the party should publicly welcome opponents of abortion into its ranks and perhaps even bend in its opposition to certain abortion restrictions.
 In an interview, Mr. From pointed out that Republicans invited officials who disagreed with the party's position on abortion rights, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, to speak at their national convention. Democrats should do likewise, he argued. 
 ''I want to win some people who are pro-life, because they probably agree with us on a lot of other things,'' Mr. From said.
 Even that, however, would shock some Democrats. No prominent opponent of abortion has come anywhere near the podium of a Democratic convention since 1992, when abortion rights groups blocked a speech on the subject by Robert P. Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania and an observant Catholic. 
 ''Our platform and the grass-roots strength of the party is pro-choice,'' said Elizabeth Cavendish, interim president of Naral Pro-Choice America. The party needs more religious language, Ms. Cavendish said, but not new positions.
 Many Democrats agree. Citing statistics showing that the incidence of abortion fell under President Bill Clinton and rose under President Bush, they argue that the party can reach religious voters without flinching from its current stance on abortion rights by shifting the debate from the legality to the frequency of the procedure -- a reprise of Mr. Clinton's formulation that abortion should be ''safe, legal and rare.'' 
 ''We would like to see fewer abortions and we want our children to learn good values,'' said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, a Catholic who has led her party's efforts to reach religious voters and was chairwoman of its 2004 platform committee. 
 Democrats need to make the case that health care, jobs and sex education can reduce the number of abortion procedures, even without making them illegal, Ms. DeLauro said. At the same time, she said, they need to emphasize the religious imperatives behind ''pushing for real health care reform, reluctance before war and alternatives to abortion, such as adoption,'' as she put it in a letter to Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington signed by dozens of Catholics in Congress in the spring.
 ''An overwhelming number of Democrats are people of faith,'' Ms. DeLauro said. ''We need to be more explicit and more public about our convictions and our beliefs.''
 Democratic partisans are also stepping up efforts begun in the last months of the campaign to rally the churches and religious groups already inclined to take their side. Weekly campaign-season conference calls of progressive Christian leaders have become a forum to plot strategy and coordinate actions, just as they say conservatives have done. 
 When Mr. Bush named the White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, as his choice for attorney general, for example, liberal members of the Christian clergy immediately convened to plan a statement criticizing Mr. Gonzales for writing memorandums that appeared to support the use of torture, said Tom Perriello of Res Publica, a group that helps organize the calls. 
 Mr. Perriello said many of the religious leaders involved were also pushing the Democrats to be more assertive in fighting poverty and promoting ''social justice'' but also to soften their stance on abortion. ''There is an interest in finding a middle way,'' he said. ''It predates the election year, but there is a little more willingness to listen to it now.''
 In the election's aftermath, some Democrats also say their party needs to do more than talk about religion to win more churchgoer votes. They argue that Mr. Bush outflanked Senator John Kerry with carefully drawn positions on abortion and same-sex marriage. Even as Mr. Bush supported an amendment to the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, he also emphasized tolerance, breaking with his most conservative Christian supporters to repeatedly say he favored allowing states to recognize same-sex couples in other ways, like civil unions.
 Mr. Kerry's official position differed only on the need for amending the Constitution, but he seldom brought up the subject. Although few Democrats are ready to give in on the proposed federal amendment, many Democrats and liberal Christians say privately that they may need to distance themselves more forcefully from the idea of same-sex marriage, standing instead near Mr. Bush in support of civil unions.
 ''Let's not call it marriage,'' said Mr. Wallis of Sojourners, who addressed religious outreach lunch at the Democratic convention this year. ''The culture is not ready for that. The principle is legal protection for same-sex couples. It would take the issue away and that issue wouldn't win or lose elections anymore.'' 
 But it is Mr. Bush's careful stance on abortion that has generated the most soul searching. Although he ended federal financing for international groups that provide abortions, he has never explicitly committed to opposing the main abortion rights court precedents. Instead, he refers to the less explicit notion of a ''culture of life.'' And he counts as a major achievement the ban on the type of procedure its opponents call partial-birth abortion, which passed with bipartisan support. 
 ''He lets himself take credit for a hard-line stance on abortion that he has never really endorsed,'' Mr. Wallis said, arguing that Democrats could ''change the whole landscape'' by moderating their own position.
 Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, argued that in the pivotal Midwest the appearance of inflexibility on abortion rights was a heavy burden on Democratic candidates. Like most Democrats, Mr. Ryan said he supported the court precedents establishing abortion rights, but he argued that the party should relax its opposition to the partial-birth abortion ban, parental notification laws and the bill making it a second crime to harm a fetus when harming a pregnant woman. 
 ''In middle America, how do you argue that killing a pregnant woman is not a double homicide?'' he said. 
 It might take only a few alterations for Democrats to start gaining traction with orthodox Christians, Father Neuhaus of First Things said.
 ''To be perfectly cynical about it,'' Father Neuhaus said, ''what would a leading Democrat, even a Hillary Clinton, have to do? She could come out against partial-birth abortion, she could come out for parental notification. She could begin to represent herself as moderately pro-choice, maybe even with some linguistic sleight of hand, moderately pro-life.''
 Pollsters say Democrats might well find fertile ground among theological conservatives, if the party could get around those divisive social issues and its secular reputation.
 Many conservative Christians who vote Republican because of their views on abortion and same-sex marriage are working class or middle class, and they often hold liberal views on economics, social welfare and the environment, said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who conducts polls on religion and politics. But to reach religious voters, Mr. Green said, the Democrats ''have their work cut out for them.''
 Some Democrats worry that the party might bend too far to please religious voters. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, a Democrat and a Jew, argued that there was no evidence that more people voted ''based on faith'' this year than four years ago. If Mr. Bush renews his popular calls for federal financing of social services that hired on the basis of religion, Mr. Nadler contended, Democrats still need to oppose it. ''If you use federal funding, you can't discriminate,'' he said. ''We can't compromise on that.''

HEADLINE: Skating to Europe

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE; Michal Sedlacek contributed reporting from Prague for this article.

 BODY:
Money talks, in any currency, in any language, in any business, including a locked-out National Hockey League.
 Monetary incentives are evident in the increasing exodus of N.H.L. players to professional teams in Europe. The warring sides are not discussing their bitter financial fight, and there have been no negotiations since Sept. 9. The lockout began Sept. 15; the regular season was to open Oct. 13. 
 According to the International Ice Hockey Federation, 276 N.H.L. players have signed with European teams. That number would stock almost half the prestigious North American circuit, where 30 teams dress 20 players for every game.
 The migration to Europe could be a factor in the negotiations toward a new collective bargaining agreement and it illustrates the changing economic dynamics of an increasingly global sport.
 But the long-term ramifications are unclear, particularly in Russia, where talented players are working for surprisingly high salaries in a nation where capitalism is new and evolving. Could hockey be headed for a new world order?
 ''The Russian league has a lot of money, either oil, locomotive or car money,'' said Kevin Prendergast, vice president for hockey operations of the Edmonton Oilers, who scouted in Russia for three weeks last season. Agents who are signing their players to teams in Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and other nations will meet in Chicago today for a lockout update from Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players' Association.
 One agent, Jay Grossman, who is based in New York, has placed about 20 of his 35 clients with European teams. He said the N.H.L. should not be surprised because the level of play has improved in the Russian league.
 While discussing the impact of the players' leaving for Europe on the collective bargaining process in the N.H.L., Grossman said that in the past, when there was ''Armageddon talk'' about a season being canceled, there was always speculation that a new league in North America might challenge the N.H.L.
 ''But they don't have to have it because we're into a global economy right now,'' Grossman said.
 Although top salaries in Europe are said to be about $300,000 a month, much less than N.H.L. stars earn, the job market there eases pressure on the union to capitulate to the league's demand for cost certainty. That is something that would reduce N.H.L. wages from their current average of $1.8 million a season to $1.3 million.
 The union interprets cost certainty as a demand for a salary cap. ''There's dollars out there being paid to players, this has raised the bar,'' said Grossman, whose clients Ilya Kovalchuk (Atlanta), Nikolai Khabibulin (Tampa Bay) and Aleksey Morozov (Pittsburgh) have signed with Russia's AK Bars Kazan. ''When a team like Kazan comes knocking at the door, the players have no problem with it.''
 Kazan has also signed Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards of the Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning. Jaromir Jagr of the Rangers has moved from Kladno of the Czech league to Avangard Omsk of the Russian league.
 According to the international federation, the Russian league leads in N.H.L. players with 61, Sweden is next with 58 and the Czech Republic has 51. 
 ''It's all supply and demand,'' said Pat Brisson of the International Management Group, which represents Jagr. ''It's a competitive environment.'' Most players have exit clauses in their contracts that would allow them to return to their N.H.L. teams if the lockout is settled, although Peter Forsberg of Colorado has committed to a full season with MoDo in his native Sweden.
 The N.H.L. has not set a deadline for canceling the season, but the previous lockout, in 1994-95, was settled in mid-January. 
 The N.H.L. said it was not greatly concerned that European teams were providing alternatives. Bill Daly, the executive vice president and chief legal officer for the league, said ''the league and all the clubs understood it was likely to happen'' and ''I don't think it has any dynamic'' in the struggle over a new collective bargaining agreement. 
 ''The players are playing for far less,'' Daly said. ''The N.H.L. is and will remain the premier league.'' 
 Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello said the jobs in Europe had no impact on the lockout despite the players' apparent leverage.
 ''It all depends on what you call leverage,'' Lamoriello said. ''There is only one N.H.L. There's lots of players still not working.''
 But Zigmund Palffy of Los Angeles, playing for SK Slavia Prague of the Czech league, said that he appreciated the opportunity provided by the European clubs and that N.H.L. owners were making unacceptable demands.
 ''We can continue to do what we like best and we will not sit home and wait until the owners decide to start the league again,'' Palffy said. ''We are not dependent on them. We have to show to the owners that we are not going to sit and do nothing. The N.H.L. is not the only league in the world.'' 
 Martin St. Louis of Tampa Bay, who signed with Lausanne of Switzerland, said N.H.L. players were seeking other options because Commissioner Gary Bettman was ''trying to be a dictator'' by insisting on cost certainty.
 So where is the European money coming from to pay the players, especially in Russia?
 AK Bars Kazan, with 11 N.H.L. players on its roster, is supported by the local government and industries in Kazan, which is about 500 miles southeast of Moscow, and the republic of Tatarstan.
 Avangard Omsk, which recently signed Jagr, is owned by Roman Abramovich, who also owns the Chelsea soccer club in England. He is in the oil business, among other endeavors.
 The various European league games are not the only scheduled appearances there for N.H.L. players. I.M.G. is arranging a 10-game tour to begin Dec. 9, with games in Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Poland.
 In the Czech league, players like Patrik Elias of the Devils have been warmly received by their home nation, and he shares the enthusiasm. ''The feeling is electrifying, sometimes even better than in the N.H.L.,'' Elias said. ''The quality of play is very high. I think I underestimated it a little bit in the beginning.''

HEADLINE: Lower Rents, and You Can't Beat the View

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Although some financial services companies have made highly publicized moves in recent years from the Wall Street area to Midtown, others have headed in the other direction, lured by lower rents, financial incentives and, sometimes, the views.
 According to the Alliance for Downtown New York, which keeps track of movements from Midtown to downtown, close to 50 companies and organizations have made the southward trek in the last two years, leasing a combined 1.3 million square feet of office space -- a substantial total, though considerably less than the migration in the other direction.
 For one such company, HIP Health Plan, the decision to move from two sites in Midtown to 550,000 square feet at 55 Water Street was driven strictly by economics, said William Lewis, vice president for facilities management. Rents in Midtown are hovering around an average of $50 a square foot, compared with an average of $35 a square foot in Lower Manhattan, brokers say, and incentives for taking space downtown can save an additional $7 a square foot. 
 ''We were out of space, so we needed to do something, and we also wanted to consolidate under one roof,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Financially, with the rents and the incentives, it made sense to come downtown.''
 HIP found a spot in the 55 Water Street complex that seemed to work perfectly. The company took space in the smaller of the two buildings at the complex and was able to establish its own identity there. ''Essentially, it is our own building,'' he said.
 Because nearly 2,000 employees were being shifted, there was some concern that the move might cause alarm. But, Mr. Lewis said, there were few complaints. ''We have a lot of new benefits for people -- including a fitness center -- and for most employees the commute was not longer,'' he said.
 Some brokers argue that a move from Midtown to downtown cuts commuting times for people living in New Jersey, because PATH train service has been restored and ferry service is available from some cities. Commuters from Long Island can also reduce trip times by using links between the railroad and downtown subways. It is true that the new commute can be longer for people coming from Westchester and Fairfield Counties.
 The attractiveness of downtown for HIP was hardly surprising, brokers say. Anytime an effective rental gap approaching $30 a square foot opens up between Midtown and downtown, tenants start considering a move, said Frank A. Cento, a managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, a brokerage company. His company is marketing nearly a million square feet of space at 199 Water Street and One New York Plaza, near Battery Park.
 ''We are getting inquiries from nontraditional downtown tenants,'' Mr. Cento said. ''We are getting inquiries from legal firms, publishing companies and media companies. These are services operations who need to save money, and they can do it by moving downtown.''
 And while some automatic incentives expire at the end of the year, companies moving people into the downtown area can still negotiate individual incentives with city agencies, he said.
 Not all companies can easily pull out of Midtown and find comparable space downtown, said Gregg Lorberbaum, a managing principal of the Staubach Company, which represents tenants, not landlords. ''The buildings are different in Midtown and downtown in terms of the size of floor plates and the number of columns,'' he said. ''And you can match the rents in downtown if you are willing to move to a fringe area in Chelsea or near Starrett-Lehigh,'' he added, referring to the block-square building on the far West Side between 26th and 27th Streets. 
 In addition to changing employees' commutes, companies moving downtown have to be concerned about how tightened security in the area and in downtown buildings could affect their business, Mr. Lorberbaum said. ''It's nice to have security, but it is a double-edged sword,'' he said. ''You don't want to have your guests hassled; you don't want it to take 15 minutes to get into a meeting.'' 
 Another factor is that the work being done to replace the buildings lost in the World Trade Center attack and to route West Street underground are likely to keep parts of the downtown area a construction zone for years to come.
 Although the buildings downtown tend to be older than those in the prime office areas of Midtown, some are well appointed and close to government agencies, and some have waterfront views. The law firm of Jones Hirsch Connors & Bull moved from the east side of Midtown to space at 1 Battery Park Plaza that had been built for another firm, Pillsbury Winthrop, which moved uptown. 
 ''We have beautiful space on the 28th floor overlooking the harbor,'' said Winfield P. Jones, the firm's managing partner. ''And we are considerably closer to the courts we deal with.'' This is important, he said, for a firm that specializes in litigation.
 Because the space had already been occupied by a law firm, much of it was could be occupied immediately.
 Morgan & Finnegan, a firm specializing in patent and intellectual property law, moved 225 people from the heart of Midtown at 345 Park Avenue to 103,000 square feet at 3 World Financial Center. John Sweeney, a partner, said that the offices at the old location were 30 years old and needed renewal, and that the space in the downtown office was sunnier and more spread out.
 Mr. Sweeney said he particularly valued the view of New York Harbor. ''I keep a telescope in my office to look at what is going on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Backers of Canadian Studies Push for Larger Campus Role

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Christopher Kirkey is trying to sell students on studying a foreign country, one whose social and economic policies profoundly influence the United States.
 The country is Canada, and the problem, Professor Kirkey said, is that many students do not recognize the value of studying America's northern neighbor. Many simply regard it as the cold expanse up north that exports hockey, doughnuts and Labatt beer.
 Canadian studies is a small and aging discipline at American colleges and universities, and many professors and program heads are retiring and few are in line to take their places. To combat this, Professor Kirkey -- who heads the Center for Canadian Studies at the State University of New York here, about 20 miles south of the border -- is working with the Canadian government to create Canadian studies programs at institutions throughout the United States. 
 Kevin Ferguson, 22, a senior at Plattsburgh State, is the kind of student Professor Kirkey is seeking. 
 A dual major in French and Canadian studies, he entered the field because he wanted to broaden his interest in French. He spent last year studying at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and hopes to promote Canadian tourism abroad, either in the United States or Europe. He believes his major will give him an edge in the job market. 
 ''It sets itself apart from the rest,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''You might have an outside knowledge of Canada, but say I was going to work for a Canadian Embassy, a Canadian company abroad, I might have to know that information later on in life.'' 
 But selling his major to employers might be easier than selling it to American classmates. 
 ''You always have to make a joke of it. I say I'm not just studying hockey playing and beer manufacturing,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''It's an obscure subject, but it's interesting. If you don't know about your neighbor, you kind of go through life questioning a lot of things, and you keep saying, 'Who's that guy next door?''' 
 Lindsey Jakiel, a 21-year-old senior at Plattsburgh State who is double-majoring in Canadian studies and speech communication, chose Canadian studies because she always felt a strong connection to Canada, having grown up in Buffalo and spent summers in Ontario. She is interested in working for the United States Consulate in Canada or doing cross-border public relations. 
 ''It definitely throws people off in a way,'' she said of telling friends that she's a Canadian studies major. ''But there needs to be more people on both sides who are really interested in each other. Not just how Canada benefits the U.S. or how the U.S. benefits Canada, but people who are interested in longstanding relationship.''
 Professor Kirkey and Andre Senecal, a professor of Canadian studies at the University of Vermont, have created Connect, a program that identifies, recruits and tracks potential students at American colleges and universities.
 The program, financed in part by the Canadian government, surveys graduate students and new faculty members who have done work on Canada or applied for a grant to study Canada.
 Connect then creates a detailed profile of each student, which is kept in a database and is sent to academic and governmental agencies, including the Canadian Embassy and the nearest Canadian Consulate. 
 The program places each student on a mentor track, keeping in touch through personalized notices informing them of job and study opportunities and supplying them with names to contact in both countries. The program held a weeklong seminar in Ottawa in July for selected students, introducing them to contemporary Canadian issues. About 400 people have been identified since the program began last year.
 Bernard Etzinger, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy, said the government spent about $1.3 million annually on Canadian studies initiatives in the United States. In the past, most Canadian studies programs focused simply on studying Canada and its history. 
 This renewed push toward Canadian studies is meant to be more comparative, and the Connect program and others are interested in recruiting economists, artists and other social and cultural experts.
 ''The objects are twofold: to have these persons active in terms of professional life, writing books and teaching courses on Canada, which is where the next generation comes from,'' Professor Senecal said.
 He hopes the program will help make Canadian studies more prominent throughout the country, helping better convey the culture of Canada. He believes topics like the parliamentary government system, gay marriage and economic factors like American reliance on Canadian energy, should be studied south of the border.
 ''There's a big challenge involved in teaching Canadian studies because a lot of Americans have very little understanding of Canadian issues or Canada, period,'' said David Archibald, the executive director of the Association for Canadian Studies in the United States, an organization of educators financed by the Canadian government. ''There's a big challenge in getting people to support the discipline. It's very regional. It doesn't have the appeal or sexiness of Latin American or Asian studies because it's Canada, and its uniqueness isn't understood well.''
 There are about 50 Canadian studies programs in the United States, although many do not offer advanced degrees, Mr. Archibald said. The association is trying to reach out to professors who teach comparative literature and history courses to see if they are interested in incorporating a Canadian angle in their courses. 
 It is also working with the Canadian Consulates in cities including Denver, Phoenix and San Diego to bring Canadian courses to colleges and universities in their regions.
 The plan is in the earliest stages, and Mr. Archibald said he did not yet know which institutions would be approached. It is imperative to spread the new programs out, he said. While centers exist around the country, including one at Duke University in North Carolina, most Canadian studies programs are clustered near the border.
 The association is also planning a weeklong seminar for M.B.A. students to introduce them to the culture and practice of Canadian business, as well as the country's political, social and economic situation, and just received grant money for an arts program. 
 The Canadian Embassy in Washington is also offering a variety of course development grants to interested professors.
 ''There's a shift in terms of demographics, in the type of professors who are teaching the subject,'' he said. ''You have a lot of professors retiring, and the type of subject matter they're teaching is a little more conservative. We're now trying to bring in younger scholars to bring a fresh view of U.S.-Canadian relations.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Deal With Iranians Has Angered Hard-Liners

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
Iran's hard-line Parliament reacted angrily on Tuesday to a complex deal reached with Germany, France and Britain over the nation's nuclear activities. 
 The chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, said Sunday that Iran had agreed to stop enriching uranium while it negotiated with the Europeans for the benefits it would receive in return for suspending enrichment. By agreeing to the pact, Tehran also removed the threat of United Nations economic penalties. 
 But none of that mollified the hard-liners, most of whom were elected in February after moderate candidates were barred from running. 
 ''We agreed to make 13 precise commitments while the Europeans only made four vague ones,'' Ahmad Tavakoli, one of the hard-liners, fumed during a noisy Parliament session on Monday.
 From the Europeans' perspective, the deal fell short of the comprehensive arrangement they had sought to permanently stop Iran from enriching uranium, a crucial step in the production of nuclear weapons. 
 The Bush administration, which has contended that Iran is likely to cheat on any agreement, had reacted coolly to news of the pact, saying that it needed to study the fine print. 
 Rafat Bayat, another hard-liner, said the accord ran counter to Iran's national interests. ''I say to the United States and the Europeans -- and, in particular France, who insists a lot on the suspension of enrichment -- that our Parliament will not accept anything that goes against our national interests,'' she said.
 Mr. Rowhani, speaking with journalists after his appearance in a closed-door session with Parliament, dismissed the criticism. ''Members of Parliament have made their personal comments, and that is natural,'' he was quoted as saying by ISNA, the student news agency.
 ''This agreement has been studied by different bodies,'' the news agency quoted him as saying. ''It has not been the work of an individual or an institute, and the decision was not made solely by the Foreign Ministry or the supreme national security council.'' 
 Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on state matters and who appointed Mr. Rowhani to lead the negotiations, is widely thought to have approved the agreement. Mr. Rowhani said he assured Parliament during his meeting that the deal was a preliminary agreement.
 ''The suspension of enrichment will continue while the negotiations are moving in a positive direction,'' he was quoted as saying. ''But if they hit a dead end, we will be under no obligation and the suspension will end.''

HEADLINE: Powell at the Exit: A Debate Over His Legacy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Cabinet Shuffle'' (editorial, Nov. 16): Colin L. Powell and the other cabinet officers in retreat from their imperfectly executed missions may have convinced themselves and their president that their tenure was performed with conviction and moral purpose for the betterment of the country. But we who expected intelligent leadership and integrity were disillusioned by four years of mindless lockstep performance. 
 There will be no heroes' parade for this recession of the failed.

HEADLINE: Big-City Lawyers on the Road Scrape for Office Space

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Del., Nov. 16 

 BODY:
Before Michael D. Eisner, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, entered a courtroom here this week to testify in a trial over a shareholder lawsuit, he cooled his heels in lawyers' offices.
 Instead of a glass office tower, Mr. Eisner sat in an old blue-and-red Delmarva Peninsula house with a shingled colonial-style facade that sagged like an old mattress. The interior, hastily furnished for the trial, was described by one lawyer as spartan. 
 ''That's a charitable statement,'' remarked James A. Fuqua Jr., a lawyer here and a co-owner of the house, who rented it to the defense team. ''We gave them four rooms and bare walls. I said, 'You're welcome to use it, but what you see is what you get.''' 
 While Mr. Fuqua did not specify the monthly rent, he said it was in the high four-figure range, plus improvements. .
 Such is often the office environment for litigants in out-of-the-way courthouse towns where the hall of justice is one of the nicest buildings around. While Georgetown, population 4,700, is the seat of government for Sussex County, the buildings in its commercial district do not come close to scraping the sky. There are no office buildings that compete in stature with the new $4.1 million Georgian-style Court of Chancery, where the trial is being held.
 As a result, law firms for both the plaintiffs and the defendants in the Disney shareholder suit had to scramble to create temporary law offices out of historic houses and hotel conference rooms. In one case, it meant paying to have a hotel in Rehoboth Beach nearby upgrade its electrical capacity to allow high-speed, high-volume photocopiers.
 Such brick-and-mortar challenges are faced by many firms that litigate patent cases, product liability matters and shareholder lawsuits in areas that are off the main track.
 In the Disney case, shareholders brought suit in Delaware because the company is incorporated in the state, along with more than half the other companies in the Fortune 500. State laws govern the internal workings of those companies, including the duties of directors and managers. 
 The investors contend that Michael S. Ovitz, the Hollywood superagent who briefly served as Disney's president; Mr. Eisner; and certain directors wasted Disney's money in providing Mr. Ovitz with $140 million in severance benefits after what both sides agree was an unsuccessful corporate presidency.
 The trial is being held in Georgetown because William B. Chandler III, the chief judge of the Chancery Court, which deals in commercial and corporate law, has his office and support staff here. 
 Lawyers said that the need for adequate physical space is no laughing matter or minor inconvenience. ''I think it really has a direct impact on how you do at trial,'' said Jan M. Conlin, a partner in Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi in Minneapolis, which specializes in intellectual property cases.
 Melvyn I. Weiss, senior partner with Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman in New York, which is representing the Disney shareholders, said rented offices must be ''user friendly.''
 Lawyers enjoy telling war stories about litigating cases in rural Jefferson County, Miss., an area termed a ''judicial hellhole'' by the American Tort Reform Association because of its supposed bias toward plaintiffs. 
 ''It gets so hot in places like Jefferson County that if you're stuck somewhere without air-conditioning, it can affect the time people put in,'' said Walker W. Jones III, a principal in the Jackson, Miss., office of Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz. ''People work better in nicer offices. But it's just hard to find good-quality offices unless the population is 50,000 and up.''
 During a recent trial held in Fayette, Miss., Mr. Jones's firm took space in the basement of a Roman Catholic church; the rent was a donation of a few thousand dollars for about a week's occupancy.
 ''The basement flooded the week before trial,'' Mr. Jones recalled. What is more, the only liquor store in town burned down on the second day of the trial. ''Everybody was very miserable,'' he said.
 Several years ago, when Mr. Jones defended a tobacco company in a secondhand-smoke case in Ellisville, in southeastern Mississippi, the firm took over a vacant grocery store in nearby Laurel.
 Some law firms have made a science of creating war rooms out of unlikely spaces.
 Ms. Conlin said her firm preferred to convert hotel rooms into working quarters. This includes the installation of fax and telephone lines and enough shelves to hold the paperwork for a patent-infringement case, which might require 500,000 documents to more than a million.
 Generally, Ms. Conlin's firm needs enough space to accommodate six to eight lawyers, two to three legal assistants and two secretaries. Typically, lawyers with Robins, Kaplan would like their offices to be ''four feet away from where we sleep,'' she said. 
 But lawyers with Munger, Tolles & Olson of Los Angeles prefer to rent office space, rather than a hotel, because the infrastructure is already in place. ''It gives you more privacy than a hotel, and usually it's set up better,'' said Catherine Dewey, practice development manager with the firm.
 Martin D. Beirne of Beirne, Maynard & Parsons in Houston, a litigation firm, said his practice had developed a ''trial in-box'' that can be set up almost anywhere. It keeps three shipping crates ready to go, holding five computers, two high-speed printers, two fax machines, routers and hubs for wireless connections, BlackBerries, office supplies and tables and chairs.
 Because occupancy is temporary and landlords have to be flexible on when tenants vacate the space, law firms may pay two to three times the going rate per square foot of a three- to five-year lease, said Craig H. Lussi, senior managing director at the northern Virginia office of Studley, a commercial real estate services firm.
 Still, lawyers said that landlords tended to be fair. Because the buildings are often vacant, they noted, owners are pleased to get the extra revenue. ''Quite candidly, I've not seen anybody trying to gouge us,'' Mr. Beirne said.
 Mr. Fuqua said that while the defense lawyers in the Disney case paid a premium on space in his historic house, it was ''still peanuts'' compared with rates in leading Northeastern cities. Top-of-the-line office space in Georgetown rents for $9.50 to $10.50 a square foot, according to Ed Lester, owner of Lester Realty in Georgetown.
 Mr. Fuqua concurred, saying that ''our prices are third world compared to New York or Washington.'' He said that because the Disney case was the biggest so far in the new courthouse in Georgetown, he and other owners did not have a good sense at first of how much the market might bear. 
 Leasing deals are sometimes concluded on a handshake, with some done month to month, although most companies like to have signed contracts. ''You need to have a lease for liability purposes,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''And we can't get bounced out in the middle of a trial.''
 Because the occupant generally pays for improvements, which often include the installation of telecommunications and high-speed data lines, the owners can reap other benefits from the deal.
 Mr. Beirne said that while his firm preferred hotels, it once dressed up a vacant auto-supply store that it had rented. ''We painted it -- it was so dreary,'' he said.
 The bill for the temporary office accommodations, which is passed on to the client, can run to more than $1 million in long trials where lawyers have set up war rooms in hotels. In hotels, of course, a large part of the bill is often food, which in other settings is paid for separately, Ms. Conlin said.
 In the Disney case, lawyers began looking for space months before the trial started. Gail Leibowitz, chief administrative officer for Milberg Weiss, said Georgetown was a challenging place to find good office space. ''The more rural it is, the harder it is,'' she added.
 Ms. Leibowitz said that when the firm begins scouting for space in a remote town, it calls local lawyers to get the names of real estate brokers.
 Milberg Weiss ended up renting a 4,200-square-foot Victorian house that is just a short distance from the courthouse through Mr. Lester for the projected length of the trial.
 Since this is the most prominent corporate case to be heard in Georgetown, it and Rehoboth Beach are expected to reap some economic benefit.
 ''Litigation can be pretty much a cottage industry,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It gives quite a boost to the local economy.''

HEADLINE: Markets Fall on Fears About Inflation and Rate Increases

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks retreated yesterday, as a jump in producer prices raised concerns about inflation and aggressive interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve, while a sales report from Wal-Mart Stores prompted investors to sell shares of retailers. 
 Wal-Mart's stock fell 1.4 percent after the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index component reported that its quarterly sales showed the slowest growth rate in more than 18 months. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,487.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.38 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,175.43. 
 The Nasdaq composite index slipped 15.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,078.62. 
 The pullback marks a pause for breath after the stock market's strong rally following the presidential election. 
 After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard posted a quarterly profit that exceeded its own diminished expectations as the computer and printer maker said that it had record revenue in every business and every region. Trading in the stock was halted after hours. During the regular session, Hewlett-Packard shares rose 26 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $19.68. 
 A 1.7 percent surge in the Producer Price Index in October cooled investors' exuberance, stoking fears of more aggressive interest-rate increases than were previously thought probable, and prompting investors to sell shares of banks and retailers. 
 ''Today's strong P.P.I. report might increase the odds that the Fed will go ahead and raise rates in December, which could be a reason behind the modest pullback in the market today,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at the brokerage firm Spencer Clarke. 
 Fed fund futures contracts, which often signal the direction and magnitude of changes in interest rates, are now factoring in a 90 percent chance of a rate increase in December, which is higher than the 84 percent chance predicted on Monday. 
 ''I think there is an angst out there that this may solidify a December increase and extend the tightening process in 2005,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. 
 Financial stocks were hurt, as higher interest rates can lead to lower loan volumes. J.P. Morgan Chase fell 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.47. Citigroup shed 62 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $46.05. 
 Retailers are seen as particularly sensitive to higher borrowing costs, which reduce the amount of money their customers have to spend. The Standard & Poor's retailing index was down 1.65 percent. 
 Wal-Mart fell 81 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $56.89. 
 Home Depot slid 79 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $43. After reporting a rise in third-quarter profit that topped analysts' forecasts, Home Depot, the No. 1 home improvement retailer, raised its full-year profit growth estimates. 
 Investors unloaded some technology shares. A Goldman Sachs survey said technology spending should remain ''anemic'' this year. 
 I.B.M. fell $1.03, or 1.1 percent, to $94.89, while Microsoft fell 27 cents, or 1 percent, to $27.12. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note declined 4/32, to a price of 100 12/32. 
 The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 4.20 percent from 4.19 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Surge Fuels Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Producer prices surged 1.7 percent in October, their sharpest monthly increase in nearly 15 years, the government reported yesterday, pushing stocks and bonds lower as investors worried that inflation might pick up more broadly across the economy.
 ''Things are not out of control,'' said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation, a banking company based in Cleveland, ''but the complacency about having benign inflation has been exaggerated.''
 Food and energy accounted for most of the price increases. Energy prices jumped 6.8 percent for the month, the fastest pace since February of last year, as a consequence of the run-up in oil and gas prices in the early fall. The hurricanes that destroyed crops across Florida in August and September contributed to a 1.6 percent increase in food prices. 
 Yet even excluding the volatile energy and food components, the second consecutive monthly increase of 0.3 percent in the so-called Core Producer Price Index fueled worries that inflation may be creeping back into the economy. 
 ''There are a lot of non-oil price increases in the pipeline,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. 
 Indeed, strong demand in the United States and other countries, notably China, has pushed commodity prices up more broadly. Crude materials, excluding food and energy, increased by 5.4 percent. Additionally, the price of iron and steel scrap rose by more than 15 percent in the month. 
 ''Nothing has been worse than steel,'' said Anthony F. Raimondo, chairman and chief executive of the Behlen Manufacturing Group, a maker of prefabricated buildings in Columbus, Neb. He said some prices are up 80 percent. ''We've had to pass some of that to our customers,'' he added.
 The jump in producer prices surprised most Wall Street economists, who were expecting a 0.6 percent rise. Many increased their forecast for October's Consumer Price Index, which is to be released today by the Labor Department. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined by 0.7 percent yesterday to close at 1,175.43. The price of Treasury bonds declined slightly. The yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.20 percent. 
 The market reaction suggested that investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve might accelerate its pace of tightening monetary policy.
 ''We are operating now at the high end of the Fed's comfort range,'' Mr. DeKaser said.
 It is unclear, though, how much rising prices will feed into inflation at the consumer level. To date, intense international competition has made it nearly impossible for most producers to pass on cost increases. 
 And some analysts observed that the recent decline in oil prices might take pressure off producer prices in coming months.
 But that source of restraint might be faltering, as the weaker dollar, by contributing to higher import prices, has reduced some of this competitive pressure on American industries. 
 ''We will be seeing some pass-through into the Consumer Price Index,'' predicted Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at Global Insight, a research and analysis firm in Waltham, Mass. 
 The Fed started gradually ratcheting up interest rates in early summer. The central bank's benchmark federal funds rate, which determines overnight borrowing rates among banks, is now at 2 percent, up from a low of 1 percent as recently as June. 
 Throughout the process, the Fed has said it will continue to raise rates in small steps until it reaches a neutral stance -- which market analysts say is somewhere between 3 and 5 percent. 
 So far, the Fed has remained optimistic about inflation, treating the jump in oil prices as a transitory factor that is not expected to rekindle inflationary forces in other sectors of the economy. 
 What worries Mr. Paulsen and others, though, is that the combination of a weaker dollar and slowing productivity gains might squeeze businesses hard enough that they will start raising prices on a wider variety of products. 
 ''The Fed is feeling good about its rearview mirror,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''But the things that are keeping the Fed calm are eroding as we speak.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and 13 Other States Agree On Push to Gather Methane Gas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
The United States and 13 other countries signed an agreement on Tuesday to work together to capture emissions of methane, a gas that contributes to global warming and, as the main component of natural gas, is a relatively clean-burning fuel.
 It makes up 16 percent of the heat-trapping emissions that nearly all climate scientists have linked to global warming, a distant second only to carbon dioxide at 74 percent. 
 The United States is underwriting some of the costs of the nonbinding methane agreement, $53 million over five years. It calls on the participating industrialized countries to help poorer countries capture and market methane leaking from countries to use American expertise to develop methods of capturing the gas from landfills, coal mines and oil and gas operations. 
 The gas would then be sold for energy.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said the agreement was an important step that would lead to ''an environmental and economic harvest'' for participating countries. The goal is to capture nine million tons of methane a year by 2015. 
 The agreement won support from both industry and environmental groups. But it also provoked comments about the fact that the Bush administration declined to sign the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty that will take effect early in 2005. That pact requires adherents to reduce heat-trapping gases; the Bush administration by contrast has pursued only voluntary measures for stemming the increase of such emissions. 
 ''It's useful,'' David D. Doniger, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the new pact on methane. ''But compared to the problem that's being ignored, it's small potatoes.''
 Similar criticism came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who used a Senate hearing on Tuesday to criticize the administration's policy on climate change, calling it ''disgraceful.''
 James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, insisted that the administration had supported a number of programs to harness the rise of carbon dioxide emissions, including efforts to expand land conservation and to develop advanced hybrid vehicles. 
 Frank Maisano, an energy industry lobbyist, praised the administration effort because developing countries like India and China were included. ''One of the big arguments about climate change is that developing nations never want to participate,'' Mr. Maisano said. ''The fact that they are signing on is significant.''
 The other countries participating are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, Britain and Ukraine.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Aims to Refresh Its Image

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley is back, and it's wearing makeup.
 Or at least its executive luminaries were wearing it on Monday, as the Valley's stars assembled for a series of ''Charlie Rose'' TV interviews whose theme seemed to be that the region is once again buzzworthy -- whether in the guise of old-line silicon mainstays like Intel, newer Web powers like Google or biotech leaders like Genentech. 
 Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, who had been observing a self-imposed moratorium on media appearances since his company's stock offering in August, seemed ebullient to be once again out in public, praising technology and crowing about the continued potential of Silicon Valley.
 ''We stopped doing this after the burst of the bubble,'' Mr. Schmidt said after the Rose segment, with stage makeup still coating his face. ''It feels good to be up here again, talking about the Valley. We don't do as much of this as we should do.'' 
 Other heavy-hitters included the chief executives of Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo, who turned out for a series of group sessions with Mr. Rose in a makeshift sound studio created on Google's campus here. 
 Some seemed more media-trained than others.
 ''Makeup?'' asked an incredulous Paul S. Otellini, Intel's president, who will become its chief executive in May. ''Men don't wear makeup.'' 
 Several minutes later, though, there sat Mr. Otellini, in front of a backstage mirror as a stylist daubed peach-colored foundation on his face. And a bit later he was before the camera on a panel with Mr. Schmidt, John T. Chambers of Cisco and Terry S. Semel of Yahoo. 
 Taking in the corporate wattage arrayed before him, Mr. Rose said, jokingly, before the taping, ''We can rule the world.''
 Another power broker who was evidently happy to be back in the key light was the venture capitalist L. John Doerr. Through the second half of the 1990's, Mr. Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, cut a high profile in Silicon Valley, saying yes to virtually every media request. Then, after the Internet bubble burst in early 2000, a video lens seldom saw him. 
 With the ''Charlie Rose'' taping, Mr. Doerr found it safe to come in from the cold. ''I think it's time to say again how important research and innovation and Silicon Valley is to the competitiveness of the American economy,'' Mr. Doerr said.
 Other good omens in the Valley include the rebound of the technology-laden Nasdaq stock index, which is near a four-year high, and the fact that California voters have just approved a ballot measure that will pump $3 billion into stem-cell research. The panel on biotech included Brook H. Byers, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the president of product development at Genentech.
 Monday's event proved an odd mix of high-brow television and advocacy. Mr. Rose, whose late-night PBS talk show is based in New York, traveled west in search of good television, taping an hour or so with each group of guests he described as ''visionaries'' for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of technology. Each of the four sessions will be pared down into snappier segments that will appear over the next week, according to the show's executive producer, Yvette Vega. 
 Yet Mr. Otellini and the dozen other luminaries who agreed to appear on Mr. Rose's show were there at the behest of TechNet, an industry advocacy group with a strong lobbying presence in Washington. The group's chief executive, Rick White, said that each fall the group held a policy discussion in Silicon Valley so that technology leaders could lay out their legislative priorities for the upcoming year. In past years, reporters had shown up to cover the event -- but never two trucks packed with broadcast equipment, accompanied by a sizable production crew that included four cameramen. 
 Asked if she was worried that the broadcasts would end up little more than a series of infomercials for the tech lobby, Ms. Vega said, ''That's why I can't say right now what will be airing and what won't be.''
 For TechNet, however, Mr. Rose's assent to play host presented a golden opportunity to advance its goal of persuading Washington to grant Silicon Valley's wish list on the ground that a robust technology sector is essential to America's status as an economic powerhouse. That list includes a more aggressive national policy on the deployment of broadband access and increased funding for applied research. 
 ''We wanted to get across our policy agenda for the next year to as broad an audience as possible,'' Mr. White, said in an interview before Monday's taping. ''We thought Charlie Rose would give us more of a public profile.'' 
 Mr. White noted that his organization still faced an uphill battle to beat back a federal accounting proposal to count stock options as a normal business expense -- a plan whose defeat TechNet has declared its top legislative priority because it would make it more expensive to offer stock options, one of the main ways that technology companies, especially start-ups, compensate employees. 
 ''Maybe we haven't done as good a job as we should have talking about the importance of innovation and technology to our country's future,'' Mr. White said. 
 Stock options proved a leitmotif for the day. Among those raising the topic was Mr. Chambers, who noted that there was no move afoot to require the expensing of options in countries that had been fonts of innovation in recent years, including China and India. Expensing stock options, Mr. Chambers said, ''would put us at a competitive disadvantage.''

HEADLINE: Agencies Press Effort To Speed Adoptions

BYLINE: By KRISTEN A. LEE

 BODY:
In 1998, Judge Michael Nash, the presiding judge of the juvenile court in Los Angeles, had a disturbing realization: Foster children were languishing too long in the system before their adoptions were completed. 
 So with the support of a team of lawyers working pro bono, Judge Nash opened his court on a Saturday and completed 130 adoptions in one morning. Buoyed by that success, Los Angeles courts have had about 20 more Saturday sessions, handling the adoptions of 7,000 children. 
 Under the leadership of the Alliance for Children's Research, the program initiated by Judge Nash's court has expanded into a national drive. On Saturday, the fifth annual National Adoption Day, child welfare groups and family courts across the country plan nearly 200 events and hope to complete more than 3,000 adoptions.
 Nationwide, 129,000 foster children are waiting for permanent homes, according to a study released yesterday by the National Adoption Day Coalition, a group of child welfare organizations and private companies. Inadequate communication between state child welfare agencies and the courts, crowded court dockets and heavy caseloads were the most significant obstacles cited to placing children in permanent homes. And states continue to report that finding adoptive parents is a challenge -- especially for older children and those with special needs, like behavioral problems or disabilities. 
 But the study also found that state child welfare agencies and juvenile courts were taking innovative steps, as Judge Nash did, to better serve children and families.
 The number of adoptions in the United States has increased significantly in recent years. In 1998, 37,000 children were adopted. In 2002, the number rose to 53,000.
 The analysis was conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research organization. The data was culled from federally mandated reports.
 According to the study, the adoption process is complicated by the constant coordination required between child welfare agencies and family courts. Scheduling difficulties can slow the process, as can differences in outlook between agencies and the courts. The overwhelming majority of state agencies reported such differences led to delays in terminating the rights of birth parents. 
 ''The courts may have one perspective and the agencies may have another,'' said Rob Geen, director of the Child Welfare Research Program at the Urban Institute. These disagreements, he added, ''lead to breakdowns and delay the adoption of children.''
 Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, described the system as ''somewhat broken.'' Federal financing for foster care should be funneled to the states in a more focused way, she said, adding, ''The passion is there, the people's support is there, but the system itself needs a tremendous amount of shoring up.'' 
 Many states are already taking steps to address delays in the adoption process by reorganizing staff, scheduling more training and working better with the courts. 
 Judge Nash credits the special Saturday sessions for cutting the number of children under his court's jurisdiction to 28,000, from 54,000 in 1998. ''We have to move faster in taking care of those kids,'' he said.
 But Mr. Geen said that there can be good reasons for delay. ''The system is set up to address the birth parents' rights,'' Mr. Geen said. ''It's not just finding a car,'' he said of adoption. ''There are reasons why the process should take a considerable amount of time.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Move to Eclipse U.S. Appeal in South Asia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: CHIANG RAI, Thailand 

 BODY:
In pagoda-style buildings donated by the Chinese government to the university here, Long Seaxiong, 19, stays up nights to master the intricacies of Mandarin.
 The sacrifice is worth it, he says, and the choice of studying Chinese was an easy one over perfecting his faltering English. China, not America, is the future, he insists, speaking for many of his generation in Asia.
 ''For a few years ahead, it will still be the United States as No.1, but soon it will be China,'' Mr. Long, the son of a Thai businessman, confidently predicted as he showed off the stone, tiles and willow trees imported from China to decorate the courtyard at the Sirindhorn Chinese Language and Culture Center, which opened a year ago. 
 The center is part of China's expanding presence across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, where Beijing is making a big push to market itself and its language, similar to the way the United States promoted its culture and values during the cold war. It is not a hard sell, particularly to young Asians eager to cement cultural bonds as China deepens its economic and political interests in the region.
 Put off from visiting the United States by the difficulty of gaining visas after 9/11, more and more Southeast Asians are traveling to China as students and tourists. Likewise, Chinese tourists, less fearful than Americans of the threat of being targets of terrorism, are becoming the dominant tourist group in the region, outnumbering Americans in places like Thailand and fast catching up to the ubiquitous Japanese.
 As the new Chinese tourists from the rapidly expanding middle class travel, they carry with them an image of a vastly different and more inviting China than even just a few years ago, richer, more confident and more influential. ''Among some countries, China fever seems to be replacing China fear,'' said Wang Gungwu, the director of the East Asian Institute at National University in Singapore.
 Over all, China's stepped up endeavors in cultural suasion remain modest compared with those of the United States, and American popular culture, from Hollywood movies to MTV, is still vastly more exportable and accessible, all agree. The United States also holds the balance of raw military power in the region. 
 But the trend is clear, educators and diplomats here say: the Americans are losing influence. 
 As China ramps up its cultural and language presence, Washington is ratcheting down, ceding territory that was virtually all its own when China was trapped in its hard Communist shell.
 ''The Chinese are actively expanding their public diplomacy while we are cutting back or just holding our own,'' said Paul Blackburn, a former public affairs officer of the United States Information Service who served at four American embassies in Asia in the 1980's and 90's.
 China Radio International, with light fare and upbeat news and features, now broadcasts in English 24 hours a day, while Voice of America broadcasts 19 hours and will soon be cut back to 14 hours, he said.
 CCTV-9, China's flagship English-language television channel, which features suave news anchors and cultural and entertainment shows, is broadcast worldwide. America may have CNN International, but in the realm of public policy, the United States has ''nothing comparable,'' Mr. Blackburn says.
 Across Southeast Asia, American centers run by the State Department's United States Information Service, which once offered English-language training and library services, were closed and staff was slashed as part of the worldwide cutbacks in the 1990's.
 The impact is still being felt. In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, the three United States information centers were shut. A new program, ''American Corners,'' provides books, computers and databases for a handful of Indonesian university libraries, but it has less impact, American diplomats said.
 As Washington cuts back, China is providing concrete alternatives. The Chinese president and Communist Party chief, Hu Jintao, made clear the importance of China's cultural offensive to Beijing when he addressed the Australian Parliament last year.
 ''The Chinese culture belongs not only to the Chinese but also to the whole world,'' he grandly offered. ''We stand ready to step up cultural exchanges with the rest of the world in a joint promotion of cultural prosperity.''
 The invitation is being accepted by growing numbers of Asian students who are taking advantage of proliferating opportunities for higher education in China. No longer are status-conscious Asian families mortified if their children fail to qualify for elite American universities, parents say. A berth in a Chinese university is seen as a pragmatic solution, even if the quality of the instruction falls short of the top American schools.
 In Malaysia, students of non-Chinese background are flocking to primary schools where Chinese is taught, a reversal of a more than three-decade trend, said N.C. Siew, the editor of the country's major Chinese-language newspaper, Sin Chew Daily.
 In Indonesia, the elite long favored American universities. The founding generation of government technocrats was called the ''Berkeley mafia'' because so many were graduates from the Berkeley campus of the University of California.
 Today, the numbers tell a startling story, especially in Indonesia, an American ally where relations with China have been historically difficult.
 Last year, 2,563 Indonesian students received visas to go to China for study, according to the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta, a 51 percent increase over the previous year.
 By comparison, only 1,333 Indonesian students received visas for study in the United States in 2003, the United States consul general in Jakarta says. That was a precipitous drop from the 6,250 student visas the office said it issued in 2000 and part of a worldwide decline after 9/11.
 Although many educators in Southeast Asia welcome the new openness to China, even longtime friends of the United States say China's influence appears to be growing at America's expense.
 ''You are losing ground, that's a fact of life,'' said Prof. Tanun Anumanrajadhon, the vice president of international affairs at Chiang Mai University. ''People here are talking of China and economics. People don't care about democracy now.''
 The difference in ambition is noticeable, others say.
 ''China wants to be more influential here to replace America,'' Vanchai Sirichana, the president of Mae Fah Luang University, where the Sirindhorn Chinese culture center was opened early this year under the patronage of the Thai royal family. ''China is very aggressive in terms of contributions.''
 Mr. Vanchai said he had proposed a balancing act to the American ambassador to Thailand, Darryl Johnson.
 ''I said, what about collaboration between the American government and universities in this area, because our door is open,'' Mr. Vanchai said, describing a conversation when Mr. Johnson visited the campus this year.
 ''He just laughed; there was no answer,'' Mr. Vanchai said, indicating that the ambassador's reaction was one of sorrow.
 A diplomat on Mr. Johnson's staff confirmed the incident. He said the ambassador's hands were tied; there was no money coming from Washington.

Flowing With the Tide
 Outgoing and articulate, Ngoh Eng Hong, 28, is as good a weather vane as any to read the shifting cultural winds in the region.
 She is one of the stars of the Economic Development Board in Singapore, a powerful government body that encourages foreign investment in the island. Its staff is handpicked from among the tiny nation's smartest brains.
 After she returned to Singapore in 1999 with two degrees in engineering from the United States, one from Stanford University, her bosses still felt she needed to top up with a degree from China. They sent her to Fudan University in Shanghai for a master's in business administration, from a program jointly run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 ''It is what you learn about them as people that is so important,'' Ms. Ngoh said of her experiences there. ''People say the Chinese are very intelligent. When you are there, you see what that means: they are very streetwise.''
 Ms. Ngoh says she has no question where China is headed. ''The world revolved around the United States for a very long time,'' she said in an interview. ''I think people are beginning to understand that one day China can become another superpower.''
 That view is more and more common in this part of the world. It is a measure of what many see as a leveling playing field between the United States and China.
 Today, while the Singapore government still sends a handful of students on scholarships to the top universities in the United States and Britain, it has introduced a parallel program to send equal numbers of its best students to China and India.
 ''People looked down on China,'' said Jessie Yak, who recently returned from Beijing, where she studied the Chinese language. ''Now there is a 180-degree change. In the past, experience in the United States was important; now experience in China is just as good.''
 The cultural exchange flows both ways. Middle-class Chinese students whose parents cannot afford the steep fees in the United States are coming to campuses in Southeast Asia.
 At Assumption University in Bangkok, Chinese enrollment was only 50 students five years ago. This year, 800 Chinese students are studying there. Most of the Chinese students pay $2,000 to $3,000 in annual fees, said Kamol Kitsawad, the registrar.
 Singapore, considered an educational center for the region, is attracting Chinese students at all levels, from primary school through high school and beyond.
 Chew Soon-Beng, the director of the Master of Science in Managerial Economics program at Nanyang Technological University, teaches mayors and provincial deputy governors from China. On a recent day, his students pondered questions like how to transform a country's free education system into a fee-paying system. They also discussed conflict of interest issues in government, a problem dealt with in different ways in Singapore and China. This summer, 51 Chinese officials graduated with a degree.
 What's in it for Singapore?
 ''Singapore is always pragmatic,'' Professor Chew said. ''In the past, the main engine of growth was Europe, Japan and the United States. We're trying to hitch on to the new engine.''

Discovering One Another
 Thirty years ago, as their nation's economy began to boom, Japanese tourists discovered the world, starting with Asia. Today, after more than a decade of galloping economic expansion, the Chinese are following suit.
 In the last several years, Chinese tourists have started to catch up to Japanese tourists in the region. In Thailand, a favorite country for tourists of all kinds, more than 800,000 Chinese travelers visited in 2002, compared with just over a million Japanese, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association. Last year, Chinese tourists to Thailand outnumbered American, the association said.
 The new Chinese travelers range from low-income workers on package trips arranged by their factories to individual high rollers.
 They are taking in the transvestite shows in the seedy resort town of Pattaya, south of Bangkok. They are tasting Hindu culture in Bali. They are buying emerald-encrusted cellphones in Singapore.
 Similarly, Asian tourists are going to China, just a short plane ride away, and knitting the region together. Fashion conscious, business-driven young Asians view warp-speed Shanghai as a new version of Manhattan.
 Two billboards at the entrance to the Jakarta airport in Indonesia illustrate the juxtaposition: Manhattan in the form of the Empire State Building is featured on an advertisement for Singapore Airlines; Shanghai with its soaring skyline is the image for the express delivery service DHL. Until very recently, such equality in symbolism was unheard of.
 Strikingly, it is not only China's mega-cities that are appealing to Asian tourists.
 SilkAir, the Singapore Airlines regional carrier, runs advertisements aimed at young executives in Singapore, suggesting that they take a break in rural China.
 One panel of the ad shows a frazzled 20-something man toiling behind his computer late at night. ''Need to unwind?'' asks the caption. The other side shows the man, dressed in chinos, snoozing on the banks of the Min River, in Fujian Province, fishing rod beside him.
 ''The advantage of China is its proximity and the cultural experience,'' said Edmund Chua, regional director for the Singapore Tourism Board in Shanghai.
 Nearly 600,000 Chinese tourists had arrived in Singapore by August this year. A decade ago, the number was just 165,000 Chinese.
 Singapore sells itself to the Chinese in the way that Fort Lauderdale appeals to some Americans: not too far away, relatively safe, familiar food. But sometimes, the most popular attractions for Chinese tourists are what they cannot find at home.
 On a warm evening recently, busloads of Chinese tourists made the pilgrimage to Pattaya, the Thai beach resort. 
 They stayed at a favorite hotel for Chinese tourists, the clean yet inexpensive Golden Beach Hotel ($14 a room), and piled into Tiffany, a transvestite cabaret show. The Tiffany dancers are costumed in extravagant gowns that they never remove: the show conveys a hint of the risque but not more.
 Afterward, some of the Chinese tourists posed for snapshots with the transvestites, $1 a shot.
 Alice Wang, 32, an office manager in Guangdong, was on one of the buses. ''I didn't come just for the sex show like the other tourists,'' she said.
 Her main aim, she said, was some high-end shopping, including a crocodile handbag from a Bangkok store, a pastime once limited to monied Hong Kong businessmen. But not anymore.
 ''Its fun,'' she said. ''I've already been to the U.S. and India.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Buying of Treasuries Slumps, but Rates Seem Unmoved

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bond traders have been worrying this year about how much interest rates would rise if overseas investors -- especially foreign central banks -- slowed their purchases of billions of dollars of Treasury securities.
 That slowdown in buying has now arrived. But it does not appear so far to have had a great impact on interest rates.
 The decline in foreign buying of Treasuries has become starkly apparent. Japan, the biggest buyer of American Treasury securities, was a net seller of Treasury bills, notes and bonds in September for the first time since October of 2002, according to Treasury data released on Tuesday. The slump came in Treasury bills -- with a net sale of $1.9 billion -- while Japan bought a net $434 million in Treasury notes and bonds, according to the Treasury data. 
 Still, yields on three-month and six-month Treasury bills, while up, have largely tracked the Federal Reserve's four quarter-point increases in its benchmark short-term interest rate. And the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has even fallen.
 In late trading yesterday, the yield on the 10-year note was 4.13 percent, down from its June high of 4.87 and below the 4.25 percent at the end of last year.
 ''The point is that it appears that it is not the foreign buying of Treasuries that is keeping interest rates low,'' said William Prophet, an interest rate strategist with UBS. ''The flows just aren't there.''
 That fact that yields have apparently not been pushed higher means that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was on the mark when he said he did not think a decline in foreign buying of Treasury securities would have a significant impact on the market. And it means other factors -- including worries about slowing economic growth and surprisingly little concern about a rise in inflation -- seem to account for the unexpectedly low level of interest rates.
 Still, the theme that foreign inflows into the Treasury market are an important market mover plays well among traders.
 One explanation given for the rally in the Treasury market yesterday was that traders expected rates to fall further because Japan was expected to try to slow the rise of the yen against the dollar by intervening in the foreign exchange market. The dollars accumulated by selling yen would then be used to buy Treasury securities.
 That explanation for the Treasury rally was batted about as the dollar fell 2.3 percent, to 104.06 yen, its lowest level since spring. At that time, Japan was spending $14.8 trillion yen -- or about $142 billion at the current exchange rate -- to keep the yen from falling further.
 It was just such buying of Treasuries by central banks in Japan and China that drove foreign purchases to a net $60.8 billion, the highest monthly total in regular data back to 1977. 
 Since that high, the monthly net buying of Treasury notes and bonds has dropped as low as $14.6 billion in August, before rising to $19.2 billion in September. Still, that $19.2 billion is well below the average for the last 12 months of $31.8 billion.
 A look behind the headline numbers that traders see -- the net inflow of $19.2 billion in September -- shows that this inflow may be supporting Treasuries over time less than it might appear.
 Of that total, $9 billion came from a category the Treasury calls Caribbean Banking Centers: the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles and Panama.
 Many traders argue that much of this money is actually from hedge funds rather than from central banks or private investors, whose intentions would be to leave their money in the market for some time. Rather, hedge fund money can move in and out of the Treasury market very quickly.
 Last, there was a net selling of about $3.5 billion of Treasury bills between the end of August and the end of September, according to Treasury data.
 Mr. Prophet of UBS said the current low level of interest rates was hard to explain, although fears of slower growth and confidence that inflation is not a threat must be having an impact.
 But, he added, ''it is somewhat of a mystery, which is why so many people bought into this idea of foreign inflows.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Rejects Idea Of Trying to Stem Dollar's Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a record against the euro and dropped against the yen yesterday as Treasury Secretary John W. Snow signaled that he would not back any agreement to stem the currency's slide. 
 ''The history of efforts to impose nonmarket valuations on currencies is at best unrewarding and checkered,'' Mr. Snow said in response to a question on whether he would support an agreement with Europeans to manage the pace of the dollar's decline. He made the comments after a speech in London. 
 Against the euro, the dollar extended its decline this year, with the rate in New York moving to $1.304 from $1.296. The dollar fell to 104.06 yen, from 105.38.
 ''It's become obvious the U.S. administration isn't going to stand in the way of dollar weakness,'' said Jeremy Fand, senior proprietary trader in New York at WestLB. ''The U.S. administration is playing hardball with the Europeans. If the Europeans aren't going to stimulate their economy, they have to understand there's a consequence.''
 A rising euro may weaken economic growth by making European exports more expensive. Sales abroad account for a fifth of the euro region's economy, which grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace in more than a year. 
 For the United States, a weaker dollar may help narrow the record current account deficit, a figure that measures the country's balance of trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. Mr. Fand predicted that the dollar's decline would take it to $1.35 a euro in the next few months. He said that the European Central Bank would not ''hit the panic button'' and consider selling the euro to weaken it until it reached about $1.40. 
 ''We don't welcome'' the euro's record high, said Joachin Almunia, the European Union's monetary affairs commissioner, in Strasbourg, France. ''We are all interested in avoiding disorderly movements of the currencies.'' 
 At least six officials from the European Central Bank, including its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, have within the last 10 days expressed concern over the euro's strength. 
 Peter Bofinger, a member of the council of economic advisers to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, said the European Central Bank should sell euros because the currency's strength threatens to quash Germany's economic rebound. 
 The dollar's drop against the yen yesterday, the biggest decline since Oct. 8, accelerated when it reached 105, a level at which some traders had placed preset orders to sell the dollar, according to Neil Jones, head of currency sales at BNP Paribas in London. Traders sometimes place such orders to limit losses in case their bets go the wrong way.

HEADLINE: Reports Suggest Economy Is Warming Up

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Industrial production and new home construction rose sharply last month, suggesting that the economy is overcoming high energy prices and rebounding from the summer slump. But a spike in consumer prices is also stoking worries that inflation might spread more broadly as the economy heats up. 
 The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that industrial production rose 0.7 percent in October, the fastest pace since July. In addition, the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts had recovered from a September dip to rise 6.4 percent last month. 
 Investors in financial markets seemed encouraged by the emerging panorama of economic strength, as prices of stocks and bonds rose sharply on the news.
 ''The manufacturing recovery continues to build broad momentum, evidenced by the fact that 16 out of 19 manufacturing sectors increased production last month,'' said John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 Bruce Karatz, chairman and chief executive of the builder KB Home in Los Angeles, said: ''We have seen continued strength in the housing market all year and it continues to this day. In spite of all the warnings.''
 Industrial production rose across all major market groups -- from consumer products to business equipment and nonindustrial supplies. Capacity utilization by industry rose to 77.7 percent, its highest level since May 2001.
 Yet the recovering economy, coupled with higher oil prices and a weakening dollar, is pushing inflation higher. The Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped 0.6 percent in October, rising at their fastest pace since May. 
 Coming on top of a surge in producer prices, which last month advanced at their quickest rate since 1990, the new evidence of economic vigor has some economists worrying that inflation, which has so far been mostly limited to energy and some other commodities, is trickling through the rest of the economy. 
 ''With the economy doing reasonably well, firms are experimenting with price increases,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist of Daiwa Securities America. ''Some are having success.''
 This is not the first time this year that economists have worried about resurgent inflation. Last spring, financial markets were briefly unnerved by a surge in oil prices, but quickly recovered when inflation did not extend to other areas. Instead, oil prices mainly depressed consumption, eating into consumers' purchasing power. 
 Most of October's price increase was a result of higher energy prices, which rebounded from three consecutive months of decline to rise 4.2 percent last month. Hurricanes that devastated crops in Florida in August and September also contributed to a spike in food prices. Excluding energy and food prices, the so-called core rate of inflation advanced 0.2 percent. 
 A weak labor market is still acting as a drag on broader price increases, eroding the purchasing power of workers. Average hourly earnings fell 0.7 percent in October in real terms, and are still 0.5 percent lower than in October last year. 
 ''The economy still has enough slack to avoid an upturn in inflation,'' said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 Oil prices have been receding recently. If they continue to decline, they will take some of the pricing pressure out of the mix.
 There is mounting evidence, however, that inflation is extending beyond energy, as increases in the prices of oil and other commodities are making their way to consumers. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices have increased 2.4 percent at an annual rate during the first 10 months of the year. This is more than double the 1.1 percent increase in core prices last year. 
 ''That's a fairly significant move up,'' said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital.
 And inflation is picking up gradually across many products and services, from the price of household furnishings, which rose 1 percent in October, to rent, which moved up 0.2 percent. Prices of medical care services rose 0.4 percent, their steepest increase since July.
 As the economy regains momentum, these price pressures should spread. 
 A look at the home decorating business provides an illustration. Nicholas Cichielo, chief executive of the Paint and Decorating Retailers Association in St. Louis, says business has been strong, with sales of paint up 4 percent from last year as a robust housing market fueled a redecoration bonanza. 
 But prices are up, too. ''In the last six months many suppliers, whether in paint or wall coverings, have experienced heavy price increases,'' Mr. Cichielo said. ''They are absorbing some of the increase but they are mostly passing it on.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Outnumbered In Academia, Studies Find

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
At the birthplace of the free speech movement, campus radicals have a new target: the faculty that came of age in the 60's. They say their professors have been preaching multiculturalism and diversity while creating a political monoculture on campus.
 Conservatism is becoming more visible at the University of California here, where students put out a feisty magazine called The California Patriot and have made the Berkeley Republicans one of the largest groups on campus. But here, as at schools nationwide, the professors seem to be moving in the other direction, as evidenced by their campaign contributions and two studies being published on Nov. 18.
 One of the studies, a national survey of more than 1,000 academics, shows that Democratic professors outnumber Republicans by at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences. That ratio is more than twice as lopsided as it was three decades ago, and it seems quite likely to keep increasing, because the younger faculty members are more consistently Democratic than the ones nearing retirement, said Daniel Klein, an associate professor of economics at Santa Clara University and a co-author of the study. 
 In a separate study of voter registration records, Professor Klein found a nine-to-one ratio of Democrats to Republicans on the faculties of Berkeley and Stanford. That study, which included professors from the hard sciences, engineering and professional schools as well as the humanities and social sciences, also found the ratio especially lopsided among the younger professors of assistant or associate rank: 183 Democrats versus 6 Republicans.
 The political imbalance on faculties has inspired a campaign to have state legislatures and Congress approve an ''academic bill of rights'' protecting students and faculty members from discrimination for their political beliefs. The campaign is being led by Students for Academic Freedom, a group with chapters at Berkeley and more than 135 other campuses. It was founded last year by the leftist-turned-conservative David Horowitz, who helped start the 1960's antiwar movement while a graduate student at Berkeley.
 ''Our goal is not to have the government dictate who's hired but to take politics out of the hiring process and the classroom,'' said Mr. Horowitz, who called the new studies the most compelling evidence yet of hiring bias. ''Right now, conservative students are discouraged from pursuing scholarly careers, because they see very clearly that their professors consider Republicans to be the enemy.''
 Academic leaders have resisted his group's legislative proposal, saying that discrimination is rare and already forbidden, and they dispute the accusations of faculty bias. Robert J. Birgeneau, the chancellor of Berkeley, said that he was not sure if the new study of his faculty accurately reflected the professors' political leanings, and that these leanings were irrelevant anyway.
 ''The essence of a great university is developing and sharing new knowledge as well as questioning old dogma,'' Dr. Birgeneau said. ''We do this in an environment which prizes academic freedom and freedom of expression. These principles are respected by all of our faculty at U.C. Berkeley, no matter what their personal politics are.''
 Professors at Berkeley and other universities provided unprecedented financial support for the Democratic Party this election. For the first time, universities were at the top of the list of organizations ranked by their employees' contributions to a presidential candidate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group. 
 In first and second place, ahead of Time Warner, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, were the University of California system and Harvard, whose employees contributed $602,000 and $340,000, respectively, to Senator John Kerry. At both universities, employees gave about $19 to the Kerry campaign for every dollar for the Bush campaign. 
 One theory for the scarcity of Republican professors is that conservatives are simply not that interested in academic careers. A Democrat on the Berkeley faculty, George P. Lakoff, who teaches linguistics and is the author of ''Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,'' said that liberals choose academic fields that fit their world views. ''Unlike conservatives,'' he said, ''they believe in working for the public good and social justice, as well as knowledge and art for their own sake, which are what the humanities and social sciences are about.''
 Some non-Democrats prefer to attribute the imbalance to the structure of academia, which allows hiring decisions and research agendas to be determined by small, independent groups of scholars. These fiefs, the critics say, suffer from a problem described in The Federalist Papers: an autonomous ''small republic'' is prone to be dominated by a cohesive faction that uses majority voting to ''outnumber and oppress the rest,'' in Madison's words. 
 ''Our colleges have become less marketplaces of ideas than churches in which you have to be a true believer to get a seat in the pews,'' said Stephen H. Balch, a Republican and the president of the National Association of Scholars. ''We've drifted to a secular version of 19th-century denominational colleges, in which the university's mission is to crusade against sin and make the country a morally better place.''
 Dr. Balch's organization of what he calls traditional scholars is publishing the two new faculty studies in its journal, Academic Questions (online at www.nas.org). In one study, Professor Klein and Charlotta Stern, a sociologist at the Institute for Social Research in Sweden, asked the members of scholars' professional associations which party's candidates they had mostly voted for over the previous decade. 
 The ratio of Democratic to Republican professors ranged from 3 to 1 among economists to 30 to 1 among anthropologists. The researchers found a much higher share of Republicans among the nonacademic members of the scholars' associations, which Professor Klein said belied the notion that nonleftists were uninterested in scholarly careers. 
 ''Screened out, expelled or self-sorted, they tend to land outside of academia because the crucial decisions -- awarding tenure and promotions, choosing which papers get published -- are made by colleagues hostile to their political views,'' said Professor Klein, who classifies himself as a libertarian. 
 Martin Trow, an emeritus professor of public policy at Berkeley who was chairman of the faculty senate and director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education, said that professors tried not to discriminate in hiring based on politics, but that their perspective could be warped because so many colleagues shared their ideology.
 ''Their view comes to be seen not as a political preference but what decent, intelligent human beings believe,'' said Dr. Trow, who calls himself a conservative. ''Debate is stifled, and conservatives either go in the closet or get to be seen as slightly kooky. So if a committee is trying to decide between three well-qualified candidates, it may exclude the conservative because he seems like someone who has poor judgment.''
 The students' magazine, The California Patriot, has frequently criticized Berkeley for the paucity of conservative views and for cases of what it has called discrimination against conservative students.
 ''I'm glad to get the liberal perspective, but it would be nice to get the other side, too,'' said Kelly Coyne, the editor of the magazine and a senior majoring in political science. ''I'm really having a hard time finding courses my last year. I don't want to spend another semester listening to lectures about victims of American oppression.''

HEADLINE: Striking Details In Final Report On 9/11 Fund

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The federal Victim Compensation Fund, the ambitious endeavor that delivered $7 billion to the families of those killed or injured on Sept. 11, issued its final report yesterday. It is an avalanche of data that captures, in detailed and sometimes new ways, the fund's largest awards and its many inequities, the demographics of the dead, and the time it took to get the grief-stricken their checks.
 Among the disclosures, the report shows that the fund, established to compensate for the lost earning potential of the dead, paid awards for 17 victims -- children and homemakers among them -- who listed no income at the time of the attacks. For the 25 wealthiest victims -- people who were earning $2 million a year or more -- awards averaged $6.3 million. And for those who applied but were ultimately deemed ineligible, it took an average of nearly six months to learn that no check would come. 
 The report, too, offers striking facts not captured in the catalog of awards. The fund's special master, Kenneth R. Feinberg, said the families of 13 victims, shattered by lingering grief, had chosen to neither apply to the government fund nor sue the airlines or government agencies over any liability in the attacks. 
 The fund gave more money to families of 11 pregnant women who were killed and two women whose pregnancies ended because of the trauma of the attacks.
 And Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer who worked free of charge, held personal hearings with 931 families making their case for awards.
 There was no news conference, no ceremony accompanying the release of the report yesterday. There was only word from Mr. Feinberg, in an interview, that the 114-page report, with more than 300 pages in supporting documents, had been transmitted to the Department of Justice.
 But in the report, Mr. Feinberg was frank about the challenges navigating the legal and emotional minefields. And while he described the fund as an ''unqualified success,'' he also concluded that it might have been better ''to provide the same amount for all eligible claimants'' so as to avoid divisiveness among the relatives, and that a permanent fund for terror victims should not be adopted.
 ''It is unlikely -- and probably unwise -- to establish a similar program for future implementation absent the profound conditions which existed immediately after the September 11th attacks,'' he wrote.
 The report is the latest accounting of the recovery effort after Sept. 11, 2001. Last week, the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., reported that victims and businesses in New York had received $38.1 billion in assistance, most of which came from insurance companies and government efforts like Mr. Feinberg's fund.
 Officially called the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the program was created by Congress as part of an airline bailout package. Intended to be a rapid and less painful alternative to litigation, it offered the families of dead victims a guaranteed minimum of $250,000 and a projected payment of roughly $1.5 million, tax free, after deductions for life insurance and other benefits.
 With a deadline of December 2003, the fund ended up attracting 2,880 out of 2,973 possible death claims, and 2,680 more injury claims.
 One victim had nearly $10 million in deductions for insurance and benefits, while the biggest award, $8.6 million, went to an injured victim.
 The final report said that most victims were working-class or middle-class. Sixty-one percent of the dead had annual incomes of less than $100,000. Forty-five percent of the injured made less than $25,000.
 Seventy-six percent of those who died were men, while 37 percent were in their 30's -- two figures that do not seem surprising, given the high proportion of financial professionals at the World Trade Center. But 19 people were over 70; they were awarded an average of $632,000.
 Among injured victims, the average payment was $400,000. About half were firefighters who reported respiratory problems. Burn victims received the most money, with 40 people awarded an average of $2.1 million -- the same award as for the average death claim.
 In terms of process, the report noted that families of the dead waited, on average, 259 days, or more than eight months, between an application's receipt and payment. It took 169 days, on the other hand, for 45 claimaints to be informed they were rejected because they could not prove that the deaths had happened or that they were related to the attacks. Among those denied was Mariane Pearl, the widow of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was beheaded in Pakistan.
 Still, the report noted that the fund had tried to offer the most favorable terms for taxes, earnings potential and other factors. The fund made 75 exceptions to the standard award of $250,000 for pain and suffering, offering larger payments in those cases. One case involved a mistaken burial, in which a relative was given the remains of the wrong victim, Mr. Feinberg said.
 ''I tried to exercise my discretion,'' he said. ''I raised the bottom, and lowered the top.''
 The report also revealed how much manpower went into the fund. While Mr. Feinberg and his law firm worked free of charge for almost three years, the fund's administrative costs totaled $86 million, with the bulk going to PriceWaterhouse Coopers, which employed as many as 474 people to process claims.
 In a separate report this week, Trial Lawyers Care, a national consortium of nearly 1,100 pro bono lawyers that helped more than 1,700 families with their applications to the fund, said the average case had required 100 hours of each lawyer's time. One case required 1,000 hours.
 Federal officials, meanwhile, conducted almost 4,000 hearings with family representatives, as much to hear their cathartic need to tell a stranger about why a loved one was special as to listen to the merits of an individual case.
 Mr. Feinberg met with most of the 13 families who did not file either an application or a lawsuit. Most were from the New York area. Their backgrounds were different. But for them, three years was simply not enough time to climb out of an abyss of grief.
 ''One lady said, 'Just leave it on the kitchen table. I can't do it,''' Mr. Feinberg recalled.
 Since the fund completed its work in June, Mr. Feinberg said that he had not heard from any families. Nor does he expect to, because ''they got some psychological closure, and they're moving on,'' he said.
 Mr. Feinberg has moved on, too, and returned to private practice. But he hopes to write a memoir and donate the proceeds to charity.

HEADLINE: Bridging the Gadget Gift Gap

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
WHEN I saw that little television, I despaired.
 It was a wonderful gift from my folks to my middle child, Sam: small enough to wear on a cord around the neck, it was the kind of thing that I knew had evoked a kind of gadget lust in my father. 
 It would have thrilled me as a kid, I knew. And I knew just as surely that Sam, then 10, would not have much interest in it. He does not watch much television; he prefers the computer screen. Besides, a piece of delicate electronic equipment does not quite fit Sam's lifestyle: when he is out and about, he is generally crashing into his friends at high speed in pickup football games. So it sits, appreciated but never used. 
 There have been so many rifts dividing Americans of late: Bush states versus Kerry states, Yankees versus Red Sox, Windows versus Mac. By comparison, the generation gap seems almost quaint. Intergenerational differences? So 60's.
 One thing dividing many families is technology. Youngsters live in a high-tech bubble, moving from screen to screen throughout their day and typing and clicking and virtually breathing bits. Their parents (my crowd, if you will), having seen computers become personal in their lifetimes, tend to have a working relationship with technology that doesn't necessarily involve the same all-encompassing embrace. 
 And then there is the still-older generation. Although gadgetry can become an obsession at any age, and many a grandparent is handy with a digital camera or a wireless laptop, there are many more who find most technology a mystery. After all, many of them were young when radio was considered pretty spiffy. 
 This generational divide becomes apparent every fall as families start to think about Christmas and other gift-giving holidays. The appeal of giving technology is high, but so are the risks. Would Grandpa actually use a TiVo? Is there a computer game that little Billy does not already own, and will it run on his PC? 
 Seventy-six percent of Americans plan to give a tech gift this season, slightly more than last year, according to a poll conducted for the Consumer Electronics Association. Whether it is something economical like a new DVD player or a flat-screen television that costs thousands of dollars, ''the hard part is figuring out what you want to give,'' said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the association.
 The association surveys consumers every year at about this time, and creates a list of what people plan to buy and what people hope to get. ''We're giving digital cameras, but we want a flat-screen TV,'' Mr. Barry said.
 The disconnects can be most pronounced across generational lines, the association's figures show. Teenagers are most interested in getting video games, computers and portable music players, said Sean M. Wargo, director of industry analysis for the association. Adults, on the other hand, want plasma TV's, digital cameras and big-screen televisions. For those 60 and older, the interest in consumer electronics drops off pretty sharply, Mr. Wargo said, but their wish list is a lot like that of middle-age adults, with big-screen and plasma televisions and notebook PC's toward the top.
 The risk of a mismatch is high, Mr. Barry says. ''You say, 'Let's buy grandma an MP3 player!' and Grandma says, 'What the heck is that?'''
 For Chris Harshman, a law student living in Los Angeles, the hard lesson came with an expensive Sony Clie digital organizer that he bought for his mother, Kathi, who lives in St. Louis. ''It's literally been collecting dust for three years now,'' Mr. Harshman said. To him, it was an irresistible object of desire; to her it was an easily resistible source of complication in her life. ''Trying to get my Mom to use technology when it wasn't at her instigation was a losing battle,'' he said. 
 The key to successful gift buying is research -- and finding good help, said Michael Trebony, district manager of a Best Buy store in West Paterson, N.J. He said that he asked customers looking for grandchild presents to describe the child, and sought out clues from the conversation: does the kid like music? Does he burn his own CD's? Does he already have a music player like Apple's iPod? For those seeking tech presents for older adults, he probes just as deeply: do they like photography? Would they be willing to try a digital camera?
 Some older gift recipients, Mr. Trebony said, would welcome the ease of use and quick gratification of digital cameras, but do not want to mess around with a computer to see their pictures. He directs buyers for the semi-phobic to printers that produce photos directly from digital cameras, now made by many companies, including Sony and HP. 
 At the Best Buy in Union, N.J., there is the disorienting roar of thousands of boxes turned on to show their stuff: computers, stereos, televisions and game consoles. In the din, a clerk shows off the iPod to a potential customer. Looking over his shoulder nervously at his manager and unwilling to give his name or talk for long because clerks are not allowed to give interviews without permission, he nonetheless wanted to share his pride in his ability to match a customer with the right product. 
 ''A lot of people, they know what they want,'' he said. ''They don't know what product they want.'' So he helps walk them through the features of cellphones or music players or other gizmos, he said, with a little hand-holding and a gentle nudge. ''You don't want to just sell a person something,'' he said. ''You've got to fit it into their lifestyle.''
 Research does not happen exclusively in the stores. My mother-in-law, Doris, is a born researcher and a fearless gift giver who canvasses her sisters when birthdays and holidays roll around. She asks them what gifts have worked the best for their grandchildren. Then she braves the electronics and music stores to double-check with salesmen. With only a couple of exceptions -- a Britney Spears CD? Uh, thanks, Grandma -- the kids have loved her gifts. Joseph, our 8-year-old, has spent many happy, violent hours playing Neverwinter Nights, a computer game of strategy and magic that Doris gave us a year or so ago on an excellent tip from a clerk.
 Many chats with Joe begin with his lengthy exegesis of his most recent plan to win a particular scenario and to endow his heroes with awesome powers. This is a step up from previous discussions of Dav Pilkey's gross ''Captain Underpants'' series, even though we can have long conversations in which the only words I understand are the indefinite articles and a few of the nouns. 
 On a recent shopping day along Highway 22, an artery of commerce in northern New Jersey, buyers were beginning to consider the season to come, and say that they, too have developed holiday strategies. Laura Webb, who had stopped at a CompUSA to find ink cartridges for her printer, said, ''I investigate before I buy.'' 
 Ms. Webb takes her daughter with her on technology shopping runs so that she chooses the right laptop or music player for the grandchildren. She fondly recalled last year's present for her 14-year-old granddaughter: a portable DVD player that goes along on trips and plugs into the car outlet. ''It keeps her occupied, and she's past the point of counting trees,'' she said with a smile. 
 As she drives off, Dan Auriemma makes his way to his car. Twenty years old, thin and serious, he wears a knit cap and his boxers showing four inches above his low-rise jeans -- that nonconformist look that so many are sporting these days. Mr. Auriemma says that he does buy gadgets for his grandmother, but only because he knows her likes and dislikes, and what she really needs. So, for example, he says he bought her a cable modem to move her beyond her pokey AOL dial-up connection.
 Down the highway a bit, at the electronics counter at Wal-Mart, Walter Burgwyn stops to say that he would rather not take the risk of spending money and making the wrong choice for his seven grandchildren. ''I just give the teenagers money,'' he said. ''You can't satisfy anybody, no way.'' 
 With cash, Mr. Burgwyn said, you reach the gift-giver's true goal: ''No returns.''
 That's certainly how Mr. Harshman, the California law student, sees it. Since the unfortunate incident with the Clie, he has learned a lesson: do not give Mom anything that he is not sure she wants. Whenever they get together, he makes sure she gets a good look at his latest toys for photography and music. If she is enthusiastic, he knows what to do.
 That's how they ended up surprising each other last year with the same digital camera for Christmas: a Canon PowerShot G2 that takes four-megapixel photos. It was her first; it was his upgrade. And everybody is happily snapping away. Now Mrs. Harshman has bought an Apple iBook to carry with her on scuba diving trips; she uses the laptop to hold pictures that she transfers off of her underwater digital camera, and maintains the music for her iPod Mini as well.
 ''I would have bought her the iPod,'' he said, ''but she beat me to it.''
 My own parents have learned a lot, too, since the incident of the little television. They call sometime in the fall and ask for very specific tips about gifts for the kids. It works.
 In a conversation on the way to school the other day, Sammy said he remembered the gift TV very well. We have drilled into him and his brother and sister that the only proper response to a gift is ''thank you,'' but in the privacy of the car (Oops! Hi, Mom!) he explained why the present did not appeal to him. ''We already had a TV,'' he said. ''It was an interesting idea, but in the end it was kind of useless.'' 
 He readily admitted, however, that he would have a difficult time buying presents back up the generational ladder. Without knowing exactly what someone likes, ''if you guess, you're going to guess wrong,'' he said. 
 And while grandparents can get a crash course by watching the commercials on kid-oriented TV, the advertisements pitched to adults are not much help, he said. ''I don't think I want to give Grandpa Viagra for Christmas,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Exiles Add to Claims on Iran Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Manaus, Brazil, for this article, and Ariane Bernard from Paris.

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
An Iranian opposition group leveled startling but unconfirmed charges on Wednesday that Iran had bought blueprints for a nuclear bomb and obtained weapons-grade uranium on the black market.
 The group also charged that Iran was still secretly enriching uranium at an undisclosed Defense Ministry site in Tehran, despite an agreement with the Europeans two days ago to suspend all enrichment activities.
 The claims, made in separate news conferences in Paris and Vienna by a group known as the National Council of Resistance, the political front for the People's Mujahedeen, could not be independently verified, and independent nuclear experts were divided about whether they could be true. 
 The group rattled the Iranian government and the arms control community in 2002 when it revealed the existence of two secret Iranian nuclear facilities, including an enrichment plant in the town of Natanz. 
 Wednesday's accusations follow by two days the announcement of Iran's agreement to suspend uranium enrichment while it negotiates with France, Germany and Britain for economic and political benefits. In that agreement, the People's Mujahedeen is placed in the same category as Al Qaeda -- as terrorist groups that Iran and the European Union will combat together.
 The United States and the European Union define the People's Mujahedeen as a terrorist group. 
 The charges also come eight days before the 35-country ruling board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, opens meetings in Vienna to decide whether Iran has curbed its nuclear activities or should be referred to the Security Council for censure.
 David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonpartisan arms control group in Washington, said, ''The timing of these revelations raises suspicions that the group is attempting to derail Iran's deal with the Europeans, particularly since there is no evidence to back up any of these claims.'' 
 He added that the allegation that Pakistan supplied Iran with highly enriched uranium in 2001 ''seems preposterous, given the fact that was a year when the United States was really cracking down on Pakistan's nuclear export activities.''
 But Paul Leventhal, of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, said the group ''has been accurate in the past.''
 ''Everything that came out initially about the Iranian clandestine program was from this organization,'' he said.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Wednesday that he had seen new evidence suggesting that Iran had been ''actively working'' on a system to deliver a nuclear bomb, but he said he had no information on what help it might have received. 
 He said the intelligence tended to support the validity of the new accusations. ''I have seen intelligence which would corroborate what this dissident group is saying, and it should be of concern to all parties,'' Mr. Powell said in Manaus, Brazil, while traveling to a meeting of Asian and Pacific nations in Chile. 
 A confidential report by the nuclear agency sent to its board on Monday for review next week provides a lengthy record of an Iranian pattern of secret nuclear activities, the provision of incomplete and misleading information and delay.
 ''We follow up every solid lead,'' said Mark Gwozdecky, a spokesman for the agency.
 The nuclear agency has long suspected that Iran, like Libya, received bomb blueprints from the secretive network set up by Abdul Qadeer Khan, known in Pakistan as the father of the country's nuclear bomb. Among the Mujahedeen's charges on Wednesday was that the Iranian blueprints came from the Khan network.
 In September, the agency revealed that as early as 1995, Pakistan was providing Tehran with the designs for advanced centrifuges capable of making bomb-grade nuclear fuel. The Iranians have never acknowledged that the source was Pakistan.
 I.A.E.A. inspectors were able to nail down the connection between Iran and Pakistan because of similar centrifuge packaging material they found in Libya and Iran.
 If it is proved that Iran received highly enriched uranium or blueprints for a bomb from Pakistan or any other country, it would set off widespread international condemnation and could derail the European agreement with Iran.
 That agreement envisions the start of talks next month on a package of economic, technological and political incentives in exchange for a freeze on Iran's production of enriched uranium, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes.
 It could also prompt the Bush administration to make good on its threats to haul Iran before the Security Council.
 ''The game is over if all this is true,'' said one Western diplomat with close ties to the nuclear agency. ''But the I.A.E.A. needs more than suspicions, and the Iranian resistance hasn't given it anything it can follow up on.''
 In both news conferences on Wednesday, the group specifically charged that Iran moved uranium enrichment equipment this year from a suspicious site before demolishing the buildings and carting off the rubble as I.A.E.A. inspectors were preparing to visit. The Iranian government said it was destroyed to make way for a park. As proof, the opposition group presented satellite photographs that were already in the public domain.
 The opposition group also claimed that the equipment was moved to a nearby Defense Ministry site, called the Center for the Development of Advanced Defense Technology, in Lavizan in the northernmost part of Tehran, and is being used to enriched uranium there.
 In reply to a question in Vienna, Farid Soleimani, an opposition group spokesman, said the Khan nuclear network in Pakistan ''gave Iran a quantity'' of highly enriched uranium in 2001 but added, ''I would doubt it was given enough for a weapon.''
 Mr. Soleimani said Mr. Khan also ''gave them the same weapons design he gave the Libyans, as well as more in terms of weapons design,'' sometime between 1994 and 1996.
 There was no immediate comment on the Mujahedeen's allegations in Tehran on Wednesday.
 Early in the day, Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, hailed Iran's agreement with the Europeans as a ''great victory,'' because the Europeans ''have recognized that Iran can exercise its rights'' in seeking peaceful nuclear technology. He added that the first test of the Europeans' ''good will'' would be next week's meeting of the atomic agency.
 ''If the I.A.E.A. board of governors adopts a correct decision, it will be a step in the direction that will give us more hope that our rights will be exercised,'' he said. However, he added, ''If we see that they don't keep their promise, it's natural that we won't fulfill our promise.''

HEADLINE: His First Difficult Steps To Reading and a Paycheck

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
He is the man who wipes off your table at McDonald's, the one you hardly notice in the swirl of trays and people. 
 Antonio Gonzales, 23, keeps out of the way of customers as he swiftly mops the floor and empties the garbage cans at a McDonald's in Queens. He is shy, with a gentle handshake and tattooed arms bearing the names of loved ones. These are some of the only words that Mr. Gonzales, who has mild mental retardation, can read. His job at McDonald's is his first, and keeping it is one of his greatest accomplishments. 
 For the past year Mr. Gonzales has participated in the Supported Employment Program, which is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 During the first three months of Mr. Gonzales's employment, Venus Burgess, his employment counselor, made weekly trips to the McDonald's to observe how Mr. Gonzales was performing and to consult with his manager. 
 Initially, performing multiple tasks and managing his time was difficult for Mr. Gonzales, so Ms. Burgess helped him to see assignments through to completion. 
 ''He seems to have it down pat now,'' Ms. Burgess said in a phone interview. ''He has everything together. He follows instructions and he pays attention.''
 Now she checks in on Mr. Gonzales only twice a month. 
 ''They said he's doing excellent,'' Ms. Burgess said.
 Mr. Gonzales concurred. ''I'm quick,'' he said, sitting in a patch of sunlight in his unfurnished den. ''If I were slow, I wouldn't be working.'' 
 As a child Mr. Gonzales attended public school in Brooklyn, but when he turned 15 he transferred to the Brooklyn Occupational Training Center, which provides job training for young adults with developmental disabilities.
 It is the same center from which his mother, Milagros Gonzales, 47, graduated when she was 21 years old. She too, had been found to be mildly retarded.
 Some things come easily for her; others do not. She can cook and take care of herself, but she does not remember the date of her birth. 
 ''I wish I could learn how to read and write and go back to school,'' Ms. Gonzales said, looking down at her hands. ''That's my dream.''
 But that dream had to be put on hold until she and her son moved out of their run-down apartment in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where there were leaks in the ceilings and the toilet often would not flush. 
 ''It wasn't livable,'' Melody Potter, Ms. Gonzales' Medicaid service coordinator, said. 
 In early September the Gonzaleses moved into a three-bedroom apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, which, while spacious, costs $1,100 a month. After paying the rent, they do not have money left for anything else, like basic furnishings and curtains. 
 The Neediest Cases changed that, however, by providing the Gonzaleses with $520 for three dressers and curtains and rods for the windows. 
 Ms. Gonzales, who is unemployed, spends a lot of time looking out of those windows. She says she is lonely. 
 ''I don't have friends,'' she said. ''I stay by myself. I watch TV.''
 She will not talk about her husband, except to say that he died ''a long time ago,'' and that he was not involved in Mr. Gonzales's upbringing. 
 Though he, too, has had to overcome a disability, Mr. Gonzales has made a life for himself, one that is not quite as lonely as his mother's. He works four days a week and plays handball in his spare time. On Tuesdays he studies phonics and vocabulary words, and he is beginning to write sentences, thanks to Godfrey Green, a volunteer at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service.
 ''He's learning,'' Mr. Green, 59, said in a phone interview. ''He just has to keep at it.''
 Mr. Gonzales has been working with Mr. Green since February and says that his reading skills are ''better than before.'' 
 ''When he started he knew only a few words, like 'a' and 'the,''' Mr. Green said. ''And now he has a much larger vocabulary, maybe 80 words.''
 Among the first sentences that Mr. Gonzales wrote is, ''I sweep the floor at my job.'' 
 He also mops, cleans the bathroom, and changes the trash bags. Some day, he hopes to be able to read this article.

HEADLINE: Public Library to Expand Hours and Services, and Restructure Branches

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The New York Public Library, forced to cut services after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks hobbled the city's economy, is preparing to expand its hours and services and to restructure itself to coordinate the neighborhood branches more closely with the library's central operations.
 As part of the changes, the library's landmark building, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, will adopt a six-day schedule next month, opening on Sundays for the first time since 1970, library officials said yesterday.
 In addition, the library will lengthen operating hours at nearly half its 85 neighborhood branches in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island beginning next month, adding one to four hours a week, mostly in the mornings, when demand is highest. Assuming the city does not cut financing unexpectedly, a sixth day of service will be restored at 14 additional branches early next year, the officials said. The changes do not affect libraries in Queens and Brooklyn, which operate independently. The money for the expanded hours comes from recent additions to the library's budget from New York City. 
 The library also announced yesterday that it received $25 million, its largest single-party donation, from Robert W. Wilson, the financier and philanthropist, who is a former chairman of the New York City Opera. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation gave another $5 million.
 Even at a time when books can be ordered online relatively cheaply and many bookstores function as libraries with cafes, the public library maintains an important role in the city's daily life. Nearly 2 million New Yorkers hold a library card, and the New York Public Library system had 15 million visitors last year. Roughly 98 percent of all computers with free public Internet access in New York City are in the public libraries. 
 The additional hours restore some but not all of the cuts in service caused by reductions in the city's budget after the terrorist attacks in 2001. They also represent an expansion of operations being planned by Paul LeClerc, president of the library, and Catherine C. Marron, who yesterday was appointed chairwoman of the library, succeeding Samuel C. Butler.
 ''We had a serious situation after 9/11,'' Mrs. Marron said in an interview. ''But we are changing to fit the needs of the public.'' Mrs. Marron, 48, a former investment banker who has served on the library's board since 1993, recently led an effort that raised $18 million in less than three years to buy books and materials for the branches.
 In recent weeks Dr. LeClerc has hired two senior librarians to oversee the expansion and integration of the library's two main divisions: its research centers -- four libraries that provide on-site access to collections but do not allow materials to be checked out -- and the neighborhood branches, which are traditional circulating libraries. These divisions have long maintained distinct operations, requiring separate library cards and with their own catalogs and administrative systems.
 David S. Ferriero, formerly the vice provost for library affairs at Duke University, is the new director and chief executive of the research libraries, and Susan Kent, a former city librarian for the Los Angeles Public Library, is the new director and chief executive of the branch libraries. In a joint interview, they said they would seek ways to better integrate their divisions. 
 ''It's confusing to have two different catalogs,'' Mr. Ferriero said. ''We're looking at everything in the system, focusing on what it looks like from a user's perspective.''
 Ms. Kent, who as a graduate student at Columbia University fielded questions on the research desk of the Grand Concourse branch library in the Bronx, said New York's is ''the most complex library structure in the world,'' and that the top priorities are making the systems ''easier to use and more approachable by customers.''
 Among the other initiatives being planned, Dr. LeClerc said, are two digital projects. The first, scheduled to begin in February, would draw on the archives and resources of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the research branch at 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street in Harlem. Paid for partly with $2.5 million in new federal financing, that project would document the migration and integration of African-Americans in the United States, tracking mass movements from the South to the North and back again. The online collection would include 16,000 pages of material and 8,500 images, Dr. LeClerc said, as well as teaching materials and a curriculum guide for schools.
 The second project would place 500,000 images from the library's collections, all in the public domain, on the library's Internet site for public use. 
 About $8 million of the $25 million from Mr. Wilson would support the cataloging of collections that have been unprocessed and inaccessible to researchers at the Library for the Performing Arts, the research branch at Lincoln Center. The other $17 million would pay for materials and technology and preserve existing collections at all the research libraries, including the Schomburg Center, the Science, Industry and Business Library in Midtown and the Humanities and Social Sciences Library, at the main building. The Mellon grant would also support acquisitions and the operating budget of the research libraries.
 Because of holidays and previous commitments, the new Sunday hours at the main building will be in effect Dec. 5 and Dec. 19, when the main branch will be open from 1 to 6 p.m., and every Sunday beginning on Jan. 9. Expanded weekday hours at 39 branch libraries will begin on Dec. 6. An updated schedule is at www.nypl.org/hours/.

HEADLINE: City Unveils Its Last and Best Bid To Gain 2012 Summer Olympics

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
New York City's Olympic boosters revealed their last and best plan yesterday before their final efforts to convince the International Olympic Committee that the city should hold the 2012 Summer Games.
 While Paris, considered the favorite, also unveiled a comprehensive proposal yesterday, leaders of the NYC2012 committee highlighted New York's advantages in multiculturalism, money and media power. 
 The other finalists are London, Madrid and Moscow. They also staged events to mark their final bids to the I.O.C., which will pick a winner July 6 in secret balloting in Singapore.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and founder of NYC2012, said that New York would deliver an unprecedented experience for Olympic athletes as well as aggressive marketing to make Europe's and Asia's favorite sports more popular in the United States. 
 He said that New York could not be surpassed for athletes' experience and sports legacies, two factors believed crucial to many of the 117 members of the I.O.C. who will vote. 
 Mr. Doctoroff also said that the plan addressed past criticisms of housing and transportation of the athletes, and he insisted that a proposed $1.4 billion stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan was essential to the bid and would receive final approval before the I.O.C. vote.
 While New York has never bid for the Olympics, Paris has won twice (for Games in 1900 and 1924) and has been a finalist twice in recent years.
 French officials said they believed their plan also responded to I.O.C. guidance by clustering sites for competition around the Stade de France and planning a village not far from the Champs-Elysees. Jean-Paul Huchon, vice president of the Paris Olympic bidding committee, said that the war in Iraq and general anti-American feelings in the world would also help its candidacy.
 London provided its first look at a planned 80,000-seat Olympic stadium in a 500-acre Olympic park to revitalize its east end. Sebastian Coe, the two-time track gold medalist and chairman of London's bid, said that it responded to I.O.C. criticism of the competition sites it proposed earlier as too dispersed and its transportation system as obsolete. London pulled more competition sites together and won government commitments to upgrade mass transit.
 Madrid announced $1 billion in Spanish federal support, but the 1992 Olympics were held in Barcelona and it may be too soon for Spain to hold them again. 
 Moscow, a long shot, shot fireworks over Luzhniki Olympic Stadium and set up an electronic device near Red Square for Russians to register their support for their city's bid.
 Mr. Doctoroff said New York made two major changes in its final plan to address I.O.C. concerns.
 Gone are the planned high-rises in an Olympic Village in Queens across the East River from the United Nations. Instead, the village would feature low- and midrise buildings with 4,400 of the largest apartments ever offered to Olympians.
 Also gone are the plans to transport athletes from the village to events by boat, subway and train, replaced by buses in specially designated Olympic lanes, with satellite vehicle tracking.
 Mr. Doctoroff said a New York Olympics would spark $7.6 billion in capital projects and cost $2.8 billion to run, without raising taxes. He said that NYC2012 had signed contracts with one-third of the hotel rooms in the city and nearly every surface that can display an advertising sign.
 ''We've managed to pull it together for this moment,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''I think this is our moment."
 He promised an ''electrifying celebration'' of global sport in ''the world's second home,'' plus ''the biggest environmental transformation in city history.''
 Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat who represents the West Side, said that she would be thrilled with a New York Olympics but that Mr. Doctoroff, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other boosters should have given the I.O.C. an alternative to the proposed Olympic Stadium.
 The stadium is planned along the Hudson River, with $800 million from the Jets, who would own it, and $600 million from public bonds backed by taxes on anticipated new office buildings.
 Mr. Doctoroff reiterated that the stadium, which would hold opening and closing ceremonies and track and field events, and the attached convention center were essential to the Olympic bid. He said there was no suitable alternative, especially one where a tenant, the Jets, would put up $800 million.
 ''They should have had a Plan B,'' Ms. Quinn said in an interview yesterday. ''It will be very ironic and really unfortunate if at the end of the day their tunnel vision prevented them from submitting a fully comprehensive bid, and if that does them in, they really will have only themselves to blame.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said he expected final approval of the stadium project by the Empire State Development Corporation in December and the Public Authorities Control Board by February. Ms. Quinn said those agencies were rubber stamps largely appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, who supports the Olympic bid.
 David F. D'Alessandro, the chairman of John Hancock, a global Olympic sponsor, said the stadium controversy was overblown. He said that all five finalists could build good facilities and that I.O.C. members looked at other factors.
 New York gains from its media power and diversity, Mr. D'Alessandro said, and loses from European anti-Americanism.
 In addition, Vancouver is bringing the 2010 Winter Games to North America, but arguments can be made several ways regarding geographic balance. Greece, the host to the Olympics this year, is a member of the European Union, so it may be North America's turn for the Summer Games after Beijing in 2008.
 ''The other real question that will weigh heavily on I.O.C. members is whether or not New York is really ready to dedicate those two weeks to the Olympic Games,'' Mr. D'Alessandro said in an interview. ''They don't want to be in a city where they're just absorbed like another event. They want to be the center of attention. If Bloomberg and Doctoroff have to prove anything to anybody, it's that you will be the center of attention for two weeks in New York.
 ''You know, if you have the World Series or Super Bowl here, it's almost like you're throwing potato chips into the fire. That's very, very important to them.''
 Under the NYC2012 plan, Olympic rings would be projected in the night sky, as if they were the Batman signal. The Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and other landmarks would be specially lighted. Each borough would have its own Olympic color. Skyscrapers, buses and subways would be draped in Olympic murals.
 The village is to be privately financed. The land for it is owned by the Queens West Development Corporation, a government agency. Governments have already spent $120 million on the site, the bid book says.
 If New York wins the bid, it has a year-by-year plan to keep the flame burning hot: 2005 to 2008, launching an Olympic Sports Marketing Council to help the international federations grow; 2008 to 2011, advertising and campaigns to recruit 60,000 volunteers; 2011 and 2012, ''install massive countdown clocks in Times Square and other locations throughout New York City.''
 New York's 562-page bid book promised unprecedented ticket capacity, a possible selling point following the sparsely attended Athens Games this summer. The committee said it would sell 9.4 million tickets that would generate $852 million at a sell-out rate of 81 percent. Most tickets would cost $50 or less, the committee said, although tickets to the opening and closing ceremonies would cost $450 to $1,500.
 For I.O.C. members, New York has set aside 1,793 rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria and Palace hotels, special seating and other amenities. 
 Cristyne L. Nicholas, head of the city's convention and visitors bureau, has guaranteed that the city will not have any other important national or international event during the Games or a week before or after.
 Under the plan, about a third of the 36,000-member police force would be devoted to Olympic security. Mr. Doctoroff said security would be financed by $110 million from Olympic revenues and federal assistance if needed. He said the athletes' village would be relatively easy to protect because it would be surrounded on three sides by water.
 Before the the I.O.C. votes on the bids next July in Singapore, an Olympic commission will scrutinize every city, starting with Madrid (Feb. 3-6) and then London (Feb 16-19), New York (Feb. 21-24), Paris (March 9-12) and Moscow (March 14-17).
 New York's strategy is to tout not only its financial might, but also its multiculturalism. Mr. Doctoroff said that New York was every nation's second home; 40 percent of New Yorkers were born outside the United States.
 New York wants to be at least the second or third choice of every I.O.C. member. The strategy is to divide and conquer the European capitals by surviving early rounds of voting and picking up the votes of cities that are eliminated but do not want Paris, for instance, to win, because that would kill their own chances in 2016.
 Iconic sites would make new stages for some Olympic events. The triathlon would fill Central Park -- swim the reservoir, bicycle four laps on the road, run a double lap on the outer footpaths. Olympians would play baseball at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, basketball at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, soccer at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, and tennis at the home of the United States Open in Queens.
 A new waterfront park on a 35-acre industrial site in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, would feature an aquatics center for swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo, and a beach volleyball arena across the river to the Empire State Building.
 Soccer matches would also be held in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, before the men's finals in the Olympic Stadium.
 After the Games, the committee said, New York would be left with new world-class sites for sporting events. These include rowing, canoe and kayak courses, on a man-made, 168-acre lake in an Olympic Park in Queens; a new park for equestrian events built over Fresh Kills, formerly the nation's largest landfill, on Staten Island; a velodrome in the Bronx; and an archery range at Flushing Meadows Park.
 The plan also detailed plans for a Paralympics, which traditionally follow the Summer Games, at a cost of $76 million.
 The New York Committee for the Olympic Games promised to set aside $75 million for a legacy foundation. It would help maintain the facilities, support youth programs, assist elite athletes and attract championship events to the city after the games.
 The boosters also promised to donate about $25 million in sports equipment to regional youth programs and developing nations.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 20, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about New York City's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics misstated the location proposed for a new equestrian facility. It would be at the Greenbelt on Staten Island, off Forest Hill Road, not at a new park over the former Fresh Kills landfill. Mountain biking and BMX (bicycle motocross), not equestrian events, would be held at the former Fresh Kills site.

HEADLINE: Front-Running Paris Plays the Resentment Card

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
The city considered the front-runner to win the 2012 Olympic Games unveiled its bid Wednesday, and French officials immediately suggested that global resentment toward the United States could help Paris defeat at least one rival, New York.
 Jean-Paul Huchon, the vice president of the Paris Olympic bidding committee, said the war in Iraq and general anti-American feelings would reinforce the French capital's bid to win the Summer Games. 
 ''The position of the French government on the international scene, especially after the re-election of George Bush, is going to allow us to have more unity around the French candidacy,'' he said. ''This is indisputable. 
 ''If these are supposed to be Games of brotherhood and solidarity,'' Huchon said in an interview, ''this will be more easily achieved in Paris.'' 
 Paris is considered the front-runner to win the Games based on its top ranking in an International Olympic Committee report in May that evaluated the bid cities on 11 technical criteria. Along with Paris and New York, London, Madrid and Moscow are also bidding. 
 Paris publicly released details of its bid, including information on sites, accommodations and ticket prices, after submitting it to the I.O.C. on Monday. 
 Mayor Bertrand Delanoe of Paris promised Parisians a refurbished city and the creation of 42,000 jobs. 
 ''Paris needs these Games,'' he said. ''It's a fantastic accelerator for urban renewal.'' 
 The Games would be financially accessible, with 10 percent of tickets to the events available for 10 euros, or about $13, he said. 
 Delanoe said the city had set aside more than 50,000 hotel rooms at a guaranteed rate. Children, he said, would learn to appreciate the Games because courses on the Olympics would be taught in school between 2008 and 2012. 
 The head of the Paris bidding committee, Philippe Baudillon, a former diplomat, announced financing guarantees of 4.1 billion euros (about $5.3 billion) from the public and private sectors. 
 Baudillon was more cautious than Huchon in weighing the importance of geopolitics on the final vote by I.O.C. members, which will be announced July 6 in Singapore. While those members will consider what he called emotional factors, the technical aspects of a city's bid -- the stadiums and infrastructure -- would be more important, Baudillon said. 
 In what seemed like a gesture that symbolized the confidence of the French bidding committee, waiters offered Champagne to visitors in the fresco-filled chambers of city hall. 
 Officials said they had forged political unity on the bid and won the backing of 79 percent of the French population, a number cited in a recent French newspaper poll. 
 More than a dozen of France's largest companies, including the aircraft manufacturer Airbus and the carmaker Renault, have agreed to help finance the bid. 
 And at least one French labor union has vowed not to strike during the Games after a request by Delanoe for a truce in the strike-prone country. 
 The mayor announced plans to use many existing sites for the Games. Tennis matches would be held at Roland Garros, the stadium on the western fringes of the city where the French Open is held. Track and field events would take place at the Stade de France, the stadium used during the 1998 World Cup and again for the world track and field championship last year. 
 All together, 65 percent of the sites for the Games already exist, organizers said. 
 Left to be constructed would be a covered gymnastics stadium with a capacity for 25,000 spectators in northern Paris, a swimming complex and a velodrome. 
 The Olympic Village, including housing for athletes, would be built on a railyard in northern Paris, about two miles from the Champs-Elysees. Athletes could reach 80 percent of the sites within 10 minutes, Baudillon said. 
 Baudillon vowed that the Games would produce ''zero white elephants,'' with boxing, wrestling, handball and basketball held in temporary buildings that would be torn down afterward. 
 The British oddsmakers Ladbrokes put Paris as a 1-2 favorite on Monday, according to The Associated Press. 
 London had a 3-1 chance, Ladbrokes predicted, with Madrid at 4-1, New York at 14-1 and Moscow at 33-1. 
 The next step for Paris comes in March when the evaluation committee from the I.O.C. visits. That committee will prepare a thorough review of each bid that it will present to I.O.C. voters in May.

HEADLINE: To Get Ahead, Own the Store

BYLINE: By REGAN MORRIS

 BODY:
Hispanic women are opening businesses at a rate far higher than the national average, a new study shows. To Tina Cordova, a Hispanic entrepreneur, the reason is obvious: economic desperation. While white women in the work force make about 77 cents to every dollar earned by white men, according to data from the 2000 census, Hispanic women are paid 53 cents.
 With numbers like that, Ms. Cordova, 45, the president, majority shareholder and chief executive of Queston Construction Inc. in Albuquerque, said it was no wonder that so many Hispanic and other minority women take the plunge into entrepreneurship. 
 When she started her company in 1990 with $5,000 in savings, Ms. Cordova figured she had nothing to lose. After all, she said, if she failed she could always go back to her previous jobs as a waitress and a restaurant manager. 
 Many other minority women have made similar decisions to start businesses. Between 1997 and 2004, the number of firms owned by Hispanic women increased by nearly 64 percent, to 553,600, and their combined revenue climbed by more than 62 percent, to $44.4 billion, according to a study by the Center for Women's Business Research that was released Tuesday. 
 The number of privately held firms that are 51 percent or more owned by minority women rose by 54.6 percent, compared with a 9 percent increase in the number of all privately held firms in the United States, the study said. The number of firms run by African-American women rose by 33 percent, to 414,472, the center said.
 Over all, an estimated 1.4 million companies are owned by minority women in the United States, generating nearly $147 billion in sales. Hispanics accounted for 39 percent of the companies, while African-Americans accounted for 29 percent. Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, who were grouped together, also accounted for 29 percent. Native Americans and Native Alaskans made up about 6 percent, the study said. (The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because some business owners were classified in more than one category.)
 Myra M. Hart, co-founder of Staples and a professor at Harvard Business School, attributed the surge in part to limits to professional advancement that many women still experience in the workplace.
 ''If you sit down and say: 'Well, what's the best alternative to starting this business?,' the alternatives don't look that attractive,'' said Ms. Hart, who is chairwoman of the Center for Women's Business Research. 
 Ms. Cordova started her business from her home and asked clients to pay half the cost of the projects up front, allowing her to buy materials and pay the two carpenters she had hired. In its first year, Queston's revenue was about $55,000. Last year, it was $2.5 million, down from a high of $3 million in 2002, though Ms. Cordova projects it will bounce back to $3 million next year because of the booming construction market in New Mexico. The company is profitable, but keeping it that way has been a struggle.
 Initially, the biggest challenge was getting financing. Now, it is coping with the soaring costs of materials, fuel, insurance and supplies. ''I think instead of having an estimator in our bid room, we really should have a psychic, because we really don't know what the cost of materials will be from one month to the next,'' Ms. Cordova said.
 To cope, she said that she and Russ Steward, who is her companion as well as her business partner, pinch pennies in their business and private lives and stay out of debt. She said they had put off building their planned retirement home.
 Ms. Cordova, who had once dreamed of becoming a doctor, discovered her business skills at a restaurant franchise. She earned a master's degree in biology from New Mexico Highlands University, but she needed a job fast when she divorced and dropped out of medical school at the University of New Mexico. Despite her education, she couldn't find work in her field and ended up waiting tables at a Sizzler restaurant in Albuquerque.
 She asked her boss to let her work as his administrative assistant and help with his expansion plans. She discovered that she had a flair for business, and when she left the company about two years later she was operations supervisor, overseeing three restaurants.
 Mr. Steward had owned a construction company, but it failed because it lacked a good administrator, Ms. Cordova said. With Ms. Cordova's administrative skills and Mr. Steward's project-management experience, the couple decided that they had the ingredients for a new company. Ms. Cordova quit her job and started the company, while Mr. Steward, who worked for another construction firm, helped at night and on weekends.
 To learn the ropes, Ms. Cordova worked as a laborer on construction sites with Mr. Steward and her two carpenters, at first lugging wood and tools but eventually becoming one of the first women in New Mexico to earn a contractor's license.
 Another major challenge was raising money. She did not know any bankers and was repeatedly turned down for loans. She could not even get a $5,000 loan for a used truck, and instead bought an older one with $1,200 from her savings.
 The decision to buy a small roofing company turned their venture around. Ms. Cordova started selling new roofs along with the remodeling jobs, and the added profit enabled her to employ Mr. Steward full time and to buy a property, an office trailer and work space.
 Even then, to her great frustration, the bankers would not loosen their purse strings. ''We were quite successful,'' she said. ''We certainly had the money in the bank to collateralize a loan, to say nothing of the fact that the property was worth much more than we were asking to borrow.''
 The rejections Ms. Cordova experienced did not surprise Sharon Hadary, executive director of the Center for Women's Business Research, who said that women and minority business owners operate at a distinct disadvantage in competing against white men, even today. ''They aren't connected into the boy's network,'' she said.
 Mr. Steward helped Ms. Cordova master the roofing business, and she worked on the hot tar roofs in the scorching New Mexico summers. Still, some people were not convinced a woman could be successful in construction. She said one potential client told her he would never buy a roof from a woman. When another customer asked why the company had not sent a man to make an estimate, Ms. Cordova told him that she owned the business, was the most educated person in the company and knew just as much about roofing as the men who worked for her. ''And it was really bizarre, because he bought the roof from me that day, which rarely happens,'' she said.
 Even without outside capital, the company flourished, and today employs 28 full-time workers, including Ms. Cordova's son and a nephew. (Her father also worked there until his recent retirement.)
 The company still does residential work, but now gets most of its business from government contracts, a result of direct, aggressive marketing by Ms. Cordova. She made contacts through the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and by attending workshops on how to do business with the government.
 Ms. Cordova, who missed just five days of work while battling thyroid cancer six years ago, said her talent lay in turning what appeared to be disadvantages into advantages.
 ''If I had listened to everybody who told me we wouldn't make it, of course we wouldn't be here today,'' she said.
 She said entrepreneurs need to be stubborn, but they should not stick rigidly to business plans. ''I wish I could say I had this business plan, we followed it, and everything just fell into place,'' she said. ''That is not true. Because it's more often than not being in the right place at the right time. I started a business at the right time.''

HEADLINE: Adding competition and incentives might be good places to start in efforts to control the rising cost of health care.

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
HEALTH care just keeps getting more expensive. According to the Stanford economist Victor R. Fuchs, health care expenditures by the elderly are growing 2 to 3 percent more rapidly than their spending on other goods. If this trend continues, by 2020 health spending by or on behalf of the elderly will exceed their spending on all other goods and services.
 As the economist Herbert Stein cogently put it, ''If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.'' What can be done to stop, or at least slow, the rapid growth in health care spending? 
 It has been argued, with considerable justification, that a significant part of the increase in health care expense is a result of improved quality. The real issue is not simply reducing spending on health care, but reducing it while still maintaining an appropriate quality.
 Economists have two magic potions to control prices and improve quality: competition and incentives. How can these elixirs be best administered to the health care industry?
 This question has preoccupied the Stanford economist Alain C. Enthoven for decades. In a recent book that he edited with Laura A. Tollen, ''Toward a 21st Century Health System'' (Jossey-Bass, 2004), he provides an outline of an answer.
 Start with competition. For better or worse, most Americans receive health care benefits through their employers. The problem is that employers do not have much incentive to offer their employees choice in health care plans.
 Offering three or four health care plans imposes administrative burdens on employers. A large employer might be able to handle these extra administrative costs, but small employers find it more economical to offer a single plan. In 1997, only 23 percent of insured employees were offered a choice of plans.
 But competition cannot be effective unless there is choice of competing providers. What policies could be used to offer more choice?
 What is needed is experimentation with, and competition among, different ways of delivering health care: prepaid group practices, health maintenance organizations, traditional preferred providers, and other ways not yet thought of. The key is to give consumers a choice among different delivery systems, not just minor variations on a single theme.
 Mr. Enthoven argues that the most promising solution is a health care ''exchange'' like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. Calpers arranges coverage for over 1.3 million public employees, retirees and dependents for 2,400 different employers in California.
 Such exchanges standardize business rules, facilitate comparisons among plans, and expedite enrollment decisions, billings and payments. BENU Washington is a new exchange aimed at companies with 100 to 1,000 employees, allowing these relatively small companies to offer a much wider range of plans.
 Such exchanges could help businesses control the administrative costs of offering a number of health care plans. But there is still the issue of providing appropriate incentives to the individuals who must choose the plan most suited to their needs.
 To provide the right incentives, individuals who choose the low-cost plans should be able to capture most of the benefits from such choices. Otherwise, they would have no incentive to economize.
 Current practices offer perverse incentives. Employers often cover some fixed fraction of the cost of each plan. As Mr. Enthoven points out, ''If the employer pays 80 percent of the premium, no matter the cost, the employee only keeps 20 percent of the possible savings from choosing an economical plan.''
 Mr. Enthoven argues that it would be better to have the employer cover the entire cost of the low-price plan, and let the employees who choose higher-priced plans cover the additional costs themselves.
 Now that it is possible for employees to pay health care costs using pretax dollars, there are no adverse tax consequences to such an arrangement.
 Plans of this sort are offered by Calpers, Stanford University and other employers. In many cases employees choose the less-costly options and capture the savings from doing so. But nationwide fewer than 5 percent of insured workers are offered both choice and the ability to retain savings from economical choices.
 More choice and better incentives should help control health care expenses. But offering more choice in plans is not entirely risk-free.
 One problem that providers face is what economists call ''adverse selection.'' This means that workers who need more-expensive health care because of existing conditions will want to choose more comprehensive plans. This leads to higher costs for such plans, making the premiums even more expensive.
 Mr. Enthoven advocates ''risk adjustment'' to control for adverse selection. This is a type of statistical procedure that estimates the likely cost of subscribers based on age, location, sex and so on, allowing insurers to predict the cost of those who sign up. Premiums can then be adjusted to reflect actual costs related to different health risks associated with different populations.
 Such a system is not perfect -- there are certainly incentives for insurers to exaggerate the likely costs. Presumably some oversight would be required to make such a system work. The current system certainly has its share of such problems as well, so this should not be a decisive factor.
 Mr. Enthoven is a big fan of prepaid group practices like Kaiser Permanente. Such organizations offer both health care services (doctors, clinicians, labs and hospitals) and insurance services (financing, benefit plans and customer services) in one package. Prepaid group practices are well established on the West Coast, and in certain other areas, but there are many regions of the country where they are simply not available.
 One attraction of providing more choice, and better incentives, is that it would reduce entry costs for new providers like prepaid practices.
 The start-up costs for such plans easily exceed $100 million. It can take years to develop a strong reputation among doctors and potential subscribers. Yet once such reputations have been developed in a region, prepaid group practices have created large and loyal followings. Indeed, many health economists view such plans as providing models for cost-effective health care.
 But regardless of how one feels about these plans, it seems clear that more choice, more competition and stronger incentives would be good medicine for the health care industry.

HEADLINE: Investors Reward Kmart, Sears and Their Suppliers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose as an $11 billion offer by Kmart for Sears, Roebuck lifted retailers and better-than-expected earnings from Hewlett-Packard ignited a rally in technology shares.
 Government reports on industrial production, housing and consumer prices that hinted at sustained economic growth also contributed to the advance.
 ''The news is bullish,'' said Warren Simpson, who helps manage $2.6 billion at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Ark. The Kmart takeover ''adds more flavor to the retailers; we feel good about the tech market.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped above its three-year closing high, set last week, before a gain in oil prices caused a pullback. The index closed up 6.51 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,181.94.
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 61.92 points,, or 0.6 percent, to 10,549.57.
 The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 36 percent of its value from computer-related shares, increased 21.06 points, or 1 percent, to 2,099.68, its highest since January.
 Sears jumped $7.79, or 17 percent, to $52.99. A Kmart purchase of Sears would create a retailer with $55 billion in annual revenue. The combined company expects to save $500 million within three years. Kmart surged $7.78, to $109.
 Shares of suppliers to Sears and Kmart also advanced. Danaher, the maker of Craftsman tools, added $1.38, to $58.41. Whirlpool gained $2.90, to $66.43. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which gets most of its merchandising revenue from Kmart, climbed $1.09, to $18.49.
 May Department Stores, the owner of Lord & Taylor and Hecht's, jumped $2.23, to $30.75. Dillard's added $1.60, to $26.65.
 Hewlett-Packard climbed 52 cents, to $20.20. The company said fiscal fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, was 41 cents a share, beating the 37-cent average estimate of analysts. That also topped the company's own forecast of as much as 39 cents a share.
 Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive, said she expected ''consistent and improving profit'' from the personal computer and server businesses, which has missed forecasts in the last year.
 A gauge of technology shares rose 1.4 percent, the biggest advance among 10 industry groups in the S.&P. 500. 
 Intel added 48 cents, to $24.32. Sun Microsystems, which makes servers that run corporate networks and Web sites, gained 39 cents, to $5.35. Network Appliance soared $4.55, or 18 percent, to $29.57. The company, which makes data-storage computers and software, said fiscal second-quarter profit excluding some items was 16 cents a share. On that basis, the company was expected to earn 14 cents.
 Altria climbed $3.03, to $57.42. It and other cigarette makers asked a federal appeals court to block the Justice Department from using a traditionally criminal statute to get $280 billion from the industry in a civil court lawsuit now on trial in Washington.
 Reynolds American gained $2.49, to $75.61. 
 Applied Materials added 58 cents, to $17.34. The company, which makes equipment for manufacturers of semiconductors, said after exchanges closed that fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose to its highest level in four years. The shares dropped in extended trading after the company said orders this quarter would fall 35 percent from the previous quarter.

HEADLINE: Lame Duck Confit

 BODY:
Having let the people's business stew for nearly a year, Congress is back in session this week, pledging to complete what the Republican leadership deemed too politically fraught to handle before the election. With time expiring, the lawmakers must raise the federal debt limit -- the Senate approved an $800 billion increase yesterday, and the House is expected to follow suit today. The move will allow the government to borrow up to $8.2 trillion. Congress must also pass nine overdue spending bills totaling $355 billion.
 What is happening in the halls of Congress right now is a travesty. Let us count the ways. 
 For nearly a year, everyone in Washington and in the financial markets worldwide has known about the need to raise the debt limit. Doing so basically requires a one-sentence-long piece of legislation. But debate on that bill was bound to draw attention -- and rightly so -- to the wildly expanding deficits created by the Bush administration's fiscal and economic policies. So, predictably, Congressional leaders delayed facing up to reality. 
 Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary John Snow has been forced to suspend the issuance of United States debt, to postpone indefinitely the announcement of the coming Treasury bill auction and to admit to Congress and the world that he is running out of legal ways to keep America afloat. In other words, with risk and uncertainty emanating from every corner of the global economy, the Congressional leaders' foot-dragging has made them look like fiscal buffoons, courting a loss of lenders' confidence in the government's ability to steward a deeply indebted nation. No one is worried about an American default. But Congress has been playing economic brinksmanship when leadership has been needed -- and that's foolish. 
 That's not the worst of it. The new fiscal year began Oct. 1, but Congress has failed to pass the spending bills needed to pay for about 20 percent of the federal government -- virtually everything except defense, homeland security, entitlements like Medicare and interest payments on the national debt. Neither the House nor the Senate was able to stay below the unrealistically low spending caps without resorting to gimmicks, ending up with competing out-of-whack bills that are some $8 billion apart. (The Senate wants more spending than the relatively more government-averse House.) 
 With no time or willingness to bridge their differences, and little appetite for confronting the mess they have created, the lawmakers now plan to lump all the spending into one huge bill: the dreaded omnibus. The great advantage for the faint of heart is that no one will actually see the actual bill before it's passed. The problem is that it will home in on the unrealistic spending targets with an indiscriminate, across-the-board reduction that ignores the real needs the government is supposed to be addressing. For instance, the Energy Department has predicted a 38 percent increase in the cost of home heating oil this winter, but heating assistance for low-income people will probably be cut to allow for an increase of only 5 percent. 
 To make really awful matters worse, members are freely larding the bill with nonessential pork even as they ignore essential needs. There are the usual last-minute anti-environmental riders undermining protections for forests and endangered species, but the worst by far is a proposed $2 billion expansion of the lock system on the upper Mississippi River, a project that the National Academy of Sciences has twice reviewed and twice declared a waste of money. 
 Finally, the cost-cutting aspects of this exercise are a fiscal charade. The spending that Congressional Republicans will go after -- known as nondefense, domestic, discretionary spending -- is not to blame for the federal budget deficit. Far from being out of control, the growth rate for such spending dropped to a mere 1 percent by 2004, after increasing noticeably in 2002, when surpluses from the Clinton years were thought to still be available. It is highly doubtful that domestic discretionary spending in 2005 will even keep pace with inflation. The real culprits in creating the deficit are the costs of the war and homeland security, and, in particular, the cost of the unnecessary tax cut legislation passed during the Bush presidency, which is 17 times as large as the increases in domestic discretionary spending.
 Clamping down on domestic spending won't tame the deficit, but it will harm exactly the kinds of government services Americans support and count on. A backlash will eventually come, either from dissatisfied citizens who care about responsive government or from financial markets that care about fiscal sanity. Or both.

Applied Materials, the largest producer of chip-making equipment, said yesterday that demand for advanced manufacturing tools pushed quarterly profit and sales higher, but warned that chip oversupply would lead to lower orders and sales in the current quarter. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said new orders would fall an estimated 35 percent in the current quarter from the recently concluded fourth quarter, with sales and profit both below analyst expectations.

HEADLINE: Trying to Get Big Enough To Battle a Common Foe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In the world of retailing, there is no such thing as ''too big to fail,'' as investors have often learned to their sorrow.
 It may be a measure of just how far Sears, Roebuck & Company has fallen from its perch as the nation's largest retailer that it has agreed to be acquired by Kmart, which itself was once No.2 to Sears. But that was before Kmart went broke, slashed its operations and then emerged from bankruptcy last year.
 The combined company will be No.3 in American retailing, the companies said in announcing the transaction. With $55 billion in revenue, it will trail Wal-Mart and Home Depot. 
 Sears gained its dominance with the slogan ''Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back'' in the years after World War II as it followed its customers to the suburbs while the old leader, Montgomery Ward, hunkered down and conserved its cash, awaiting a postwar economic slump that never arrived. That chain limped along for decades and has now vanished.
 But Sears eventually lost the No.1 position to Wal-Mart, which started in smaller towns and then expanded to the suburbs. Wal-Mart managed to reduce costs to bring inexpensive goods to Americans who might once have relied on Sears or the famous Sears catalog, which was eventually discontinued to save money. Two years ago, Sears bought Lands' End, a catalog retailer, to bring customers back to its clothing department and to re-enter the catalog business.
 In recent years, Sears has strived to revive its fortunes, with some success, but it has not shown an ability to grow. Its revenues last year were little changed from those of 2000, although profits were much higher. In the first three quarters of the year, its revenues were down 14 percent, largely because it sold its credit card operations.
 In 2003, Wal-Mart sales were $256 billion, six times those of Sears. They would have been more than four times those of a combined Sears and Kmart.
 As Sears has struggled, the stock has attracted players known for real estate plays rather than an interest in selling clothing to customers. In talking to investors on Wednesday, Edward S. Lampert, a hedge fund manager who controls Kmart and had a 15 percent stake in Sears, said he was determined to make the combined company worth more than its real estate.
 Less than two weeks ago, Sears stock leaped on the news that Vornado Realty Trust had acquired a 4.3 percent stake in the company, partly through buying stock and partly through an options transaction that would bring it shares in 2006. In the past, Vornado had acquired Alexander's, once a proud name in New York retailing but now gone, and it has been trying to buy Toys ''R'' Us, another once-dominant retailer that has had difficulty competing with Wal-Mart.
 ''It is pretty obvious that scale is important to compete effectively,'' Mr. Lampert, a former Goldman Sachs trader, told investors at a meeting in New York. He pointed to the experience of the financial services industry, which he said had cut costs in the 1990's through aggressive consolidation. He vowed to have ''a very low cost structure to compete effectively'' but said he would maintain ''the reputation and quality of service that Sears has always provided.''
 The plan, the companies said yesterday, is to rename some Kmart stores as Sears stores, combine operations to save money and allow brands sold at one chain to be sold at the other. But the fact that neither chain managed to do well against Wal-Mart for a sustained time may leave some people wondering just how well they will compete as parts of the same company.
 Still, Kmart has done surprisingly well under Mr. Lampert. Its shares, which were issued to creditors of the old Kmart, sold for $15 when they began trading in May 2003, and soon fell to a low of $12. But they have since soared. Shares of Kmart rose $7.78 yesterday, to $109.
 Kmart has amassed a large cash hoard -- in part from selling 50 stores to Sears for $576 million, although not all that money has yet been paid -- and the transaction calls for it to buy 45 percent of the Sears shares for cash at $50 a share. The remaining 55 percent of shares are to be exchanged for half a Kmart share each.
 Mr. Lampert said he would seek to convert all his shares to Kmart shares, although he might be forced to accept some cash if other holders also demand the cash. 
 Shares of Sears rose $7.79, to $52.99. They are now up 51 percent since the end of October -- thanks in part to speculation after Vornado announced its investment -- and about 200 percent from the low of $18.13 reached in March of last year, when Sears' prospects seemed least promising and some doubted Mr. Lampert's wisdom in acquiring a large position in the company.
 A low point for Sears came five years ago, when it was booted out of the Dow Jones industrial average -- it had been a member since the index was expanded to 30 stocks in 1928 -- and replaced by Home Depot. Investors who held on had the last laugh. Since then, Sears is up 96 percent, while Home Depot is down 10 percent and the Dow is up just 2 percent.
 Shares of Sears are still well below their record high of $65.25, reached in 1997. But that performance is much better than that of the old Kmart. Its shares, which sold for as high as $28.13 in 1992, became worthless as a result of the bankruptcy.
 The ability of Kmart to do the deal is a testament to just how much Wall Street has become enamored of Mr. Lampert.
 At the end of last year, a Kmart share sold for almost exactly half the price of a Sears share. Now the ratio is reversed, and it is that ratio that provides the terms of the merger.
 If one measures retailers by revenue, Kmart shareholders are also getting a much better deal. Their company provided 35 percent of the combined sales of the two companies over the most recently reported 12 months, but they will get 46 percent of the stock.
 It is clear that Mr. Lampert has persuaded investors that shares in his company are worth a large premium over what he paid for them. If only the combined company can persuade consumers that its merchandise is similarly valuable.

HEADLINE: Far, Far From Neverland, A Spare and Quiet Place

BYLINE: By JAMIE DIAMOND

DATELINE: VENICE, Calif. 

 BODY:
IF you examine the furnishings in J. M. Barrie's office in the movie ''Finding Neverland,'' you might notice that it is a little too austere for the Victorian era. This small liberty occurred partly because the office is meant to reflect the man who works in it: a wealthy Scottish author in a chilly, childless marriage, who keeps himself apart from most relationships. But it also reflects the taste of the Swiss director Marc Forster, who did extensive research on period decoration.
 ''Of course, there's a difference between when I create a set for someone in a film and when I create my home, but in both I like to have very clean lines,'' he said one afternoon at his loft here. The film, which stars Johnny Depp as Barrie and Kate Winslet as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, is about the Llewelyn Davies family -- a mother and four boys -- who inspired ''Peter Pan.'' 
 Mr. Forster acknowledged that when creating the children's home in the film, he had to cleave to realism. ''Because kids lived there and because Sylvia didn't have any help, the house had to look lived in and cluttered,'' he said. 
 Clutter is not a word one would associate with Mr. Forster, 35, tall and thin, with a shaved head. ''He has a European aesthetic,'' said his longtime friend, Radha Mitchell, who plays Barrie's wife in the movie. ''It's the opposite of bling bling. The way he styles himself and the way his house is put together is minimalist and tasteful.''
 In Hollywood minimalism and taste are normally what producers of bombs-exploding would-be-blockbusters race away from. But Mr. Forster's reserved sensibilities have paid off. His second movie, the starkly shot ''Monster's Ball,'' not only put him on the map but also won him the chance to direct ''Finding Neverland.''
 ''The primary reason to ask him to direct was his restraint,'' said Richard Gladstein, a producer of ''Finding Neverland.'' ''We had dogs and kids and fantasy and death, all of which could veer into cheesiness or overt sentimentality, but we knew that Marc wouldn't smack you in the face with them.''
 Just as he displays restraint on the film, he shows understatement in his home. Mr. Forster's 1,900-square-foot one-bedroom split-level loft was designed in 2001 by the California architect Steven Ehrlich, who designed studios for the artists Ed Moses and John Okulick and the headquarters for DreamWorks and Sony Music. The loft has a glass-paneled garage door that opens onto a terrace, a fireplace faced with rusted steel that would make Richard Serra proud, a roof deck with an ocean view and three patios. 
 Mr. Forster, who grew up in Davos-Klosters, a Swiss village that is the site of the annual World Economic Forum, chose seaside Venice, an architectural haven (Frank Gehry lives here) near Santa Monica, ''because you can walk around and don't need a car.''
 No more than 50 yards from his loft is the boardwalk, and on this afternoon it was abuzz with tourists, in-line skaters and peddlers selling tube socks and cheap sunglasses. Inside the Forster home, where windows in the upper level and bedroom allow light to splash onto cement floors, even a quiet conversation leaves a faint echo. ''I loved the light and openness, and being close to the beach,'' he said.
 Before buying this loft, which was listed at $895,000, Mr. Forster rented a small apartment in Santa Monica or lived in other people's homes, house-sitting. ''I didn't have the money to buy anything,'' he said. But two Oscar nominations and a best-actress award for Halle Berry in ''Monster's Ball'' paved the way to this new home in Venice.
 To give the space a signature of his own, Mr. Forster bought a sleek blue Minotti couch he saw in a magazine and ordered a polished tree-stump table made by Daniel Pollack. For other discreet personal touches, Mr. Forster turned to Andre Kohler, a Swiss furniture designer who built by hand almost all the furniture, including a table, bookshelves, a corner seating unit, a platform bed, a desk and elegant cabinets. ''Marc wanted a clean and simple look, which is a Swiss thing,'' Mr. Kohler said. ''So the cabinets I built are concealing. But that's probably not the right word, because concealing implies hiding a mess, and I don't think he has a mess.'' 
 Mr. Forster gave a tour of the upstairs, removing his wooden clogs before stepping onto the jute carpet. ''It doesn't come clean,'' he said. ''I didn't know that before I put it in.'' His bedroom has a Zen feel, with its platform bed and built-in cabinets faced with a subtle arrangement of wood, metal and glass. ''I wanted something that didn't bore me,'' he said, ''and the varied surfaces engage my eye.''
 But the monastic effect was disturbed by a brown fake-fur bedspread -- a gift from his girlfriend, Renee Chabria, a filmmaker -- which Mr. Forster removed for a photographer. ''I like it, but it's not really me,'' he said. ''It's too champagne and bubble bath.''
 Neither the Zen image nor the champagne-and-bubble bath image was inspired by his childhood home. Mr. Forster, the youngest of three boys, grew up in a glass house overlooking a valley in the Alps. ''We had a canoe in our living room that my mother brought back from the Amazon,'' he said. ''She was all natural and homeopathic and organic, and she spent time in a Tibetan monastery with Buddhist monks. Krishnamurti and Deepak Chopra were my childhood literature.''
 At boarding school in Zurich, where he was influenced by the works of Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig and Thomas Mann, Mr. Forster wrote short stories, which he describes as ''melancholic.'' In Switzerland, he said, high school boys do not have the same culture of drinking beer and going out with girls as in the United States. ''People are not so obsessed with sports, although they do like their soccer,'' he said. But anything happy is infused with a sense of melancholy, he said, noting that Switzerland has one of the world's highest suicide rates. 
 After his interest shifted from written to visual storytelling, he learned about New York University's film program. He gained admission without speaking English, then wrote letters to acquaintances until he found one who would subsidize his schooling.
 Starting with his first film, ''Everything Put Together,'' an emotionally harrowing no-budget digital effort about a couple whose newborn baby dies, Mr. Forster went on to ''Monster's Ball,'' a grim tale about racial bigotry and the death penalty in which the sons of both of the main characters die. Then came ''Finding Neverland,'' which concerns four fatherless boys, whose mother subsequently dies. While waiting for ''Neverland'' to be released, he completed ''Stay,'' about a psychiatrist who tries to prevent a student from committing suicide.
 What's up with all this death? 
 ''All of my films deal with mortality and characters with repressed emotions who don't connect,'' Mr. Forster said. ''I believe that when tragedy strikes, that allows us to deal with the truth and not hide.''
 Mr. Forster's father, a gynecologist, stopped practicing medicine to open a pharmaceutical laboratory, which he later sold to Pfizer. Later still he lost all the proceeds. Within six months after the family sold its hillside home and moved into an apartment, Mr. Forster's father was told he had terminal cancer and given three months to live (he lived 11 years more), and his brother was told he had schizophrenia (he later committed suicide). 
 ''Once we lost all our money and my father and brother became sick, we became close for the first time,'' Mr. Forster said. ''There were no distractions, no trips. We were caring for each other much more than we ever had before.'' It might seem that having two brothers, one of whom died, would have drawn Mr. Forster to ''Peter Pan.'' (Two of the Llewelyn Davies brothers committed suicide.) Offering an equally plausible explanation, he said, ''I was drawn to the idea of following your imagination and manifesting your dreams.'' 
 Mr. Forster pulled up the hood on his sweatshirt, saying he was cold. With his narrow shoulders and shaved head he could have passed for one of the monks his mother visited. ''I like to throw things out,'' he said. ''The less I have, the more free I feel.''
