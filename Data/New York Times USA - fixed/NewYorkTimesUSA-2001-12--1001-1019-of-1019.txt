HEADLINE: California Governor Taps Outside Donors 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis has raised $7.6 million for his re-election campaign from donors in other states who have political or economic stakes in California, The Los Angeles Times reported today. 
 Mr. Davis, a Democrat who is running unchallenged in the March primary, has set a fund-raising target of $50 million, the newspaper said. 
 "That's one of the differences between the governor of California and the governor of Wyoming," said Garry South, Mr. Davis's political adviser. "Nearly everyone is vested in California in some fashion or another."
CitiGroup, based in New York, has given Mr. Davis at least $250,000. The company's interests in California include insurance regulation and privacy rights. Verizon, also based in New York, has donated more than $200,000.
Former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, was considered one of the best fund-raisers of his day. In eight years, however, he collected only about $6.3 million from other states.
Three Republicans are seeking to challenge Mr. Davis in November: Bill Jones; the California secretary of state; Richard J. Riordan, a former mayor of Los Angeles; and William E. Simon Jr., a businessman.

HEADLINE: In a Town Built Almost Entirely on Tourism, Business Booms 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEAVENWORTH, Wash. 

 BODY:
Thousands of tourists gathered on this town's main street in early December, listening to polka music and patriotic ballads and waiting for dusk, when the switch would be thrown, illuminating the lights draping the trees and storefronts of the Bavarian Village.
 This, said Bill Taylor, executive director of the Leavenworth Chamber of Commerce, is the city's most popular event. He estimated the crowd at 30,000, in a town with a population of only 2,000. 
 "This is the biggest day of the year," Mr. Taylor said. Never mind that the same ceremony was held the week before and would be repeated the next weekend. 
Leavenworth's economy is built on events like the Village Lighting Festival. While most tourist destinations are content with one or two large festivals a year, Leavenworth, two hours east of Seattle, has 19 special-event weekends, like the Bavarian Ice Fest in January and a chamber music festival in July.
That may help explain why, with Washington State and the nation in recession and the tourism industry particularly hard hit, Leavenworth is booming.
"We didn't go down after Sept. 11, we went up," Mr. Taylor said. Sales tax revenue in September, when tourism traditionally slows here, was the highest since the state began keeping such statistics. It totaled $26,000, $1,000 more than in the same period last year and $10,000 more than in 1999.
Nationally, tourist locales a short drive from big cities are reporting the same trend: Americans are taking more day trips by car and fewer long vacations by plane in response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and to a weakening economy.
"Any time we see the economy turn down significantly," said Jerry Cheske, an AAA spokesman in Florida, "people tend to look towards traveling locally, and that lends itself to the automobile."
In Vermont, that has helped the Lake Champlain region weather the general drop in the tourism industry, said Tim Shea, a spokesman for the local Chamber of Commerce. He said people continued to visit, but were traveling by car from nearby metropolitan areas.
"Since Sept. 11, there has been a growing number of inquiries that are from people from drive destinations who had planned traveling by plane," Mr. Shea said, "What people are saying is that they want to stay closer to home and avoid air travel." 
In the crowded shops of Leavenworth, that trend has meant steady business.
On a recent Saturday, about 100 charter buses competed for parking spaces, and overnight visitors snatched up all the 1,100 motel rooms here and in nearby Wenatchee.
Mr. Taylor attributes Leavenworth's success to its re-creation of a southern German village in the 60's. The idea was born of economic necessity, because the railroad and lumber industries in Leavenworth, a mountain town in the Wenatchee National Forest, had faded away.
Consultants advised the city to develop a tourism theme, and even though few people had any German heritage to speak of, a Bavarian theme seemed to fit with the mountains and climate. It is the village's departure from reality, Mr. Taylor said, that draws people here in hard times.
"We certainly don't want to benefit from what happened back there," he said, referring to the attacks in New York and Washington. But, he added, "Leavenworth certainly is an escape: it's a different world."
"Tourists can come to this place and not see any evidence of their typical lives," Mr. Taylor said, "and they don't have to think about what happened on Sept. 11."
Liz Johnson-Lane, who owns Die Musik Box, said business was good, adding that the attraction of rural vacations was evident.
"Because we are out in the country, many people feel it is safe to come here on a visit," Ms. Johnson-Lane said.
Adam Ledford, who came with his family by bus from Marysville, just north of Seattle, said he had changed his holiday plans after buying plane tickets for his parents so they could visit from Illinois. They refused to use them. So the family decided on a close-by, low-cost alternative to visiting the grandparents.
"For us to go to Illinois, if we're not willing to fly, it's a three-day trip," Mr. Ledford said. "This is just a day trip."

HEADLINE: Cuts in Parks Bring Home Tennessee Budget Woes 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: NORRIS, Tenn., Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Connie Lawson spent the last week of November leafing through a thick stack of pink reservation forms at Norris Dam State Park so she could return $9,000 in deposits.
 Wedding receptions, family reunions and other gatherings -- all were canceled because the state was closing 14 parks, including Norris Dam, and cutting the hours of the remaining 37 parks to save money. 
 "I don't see how this is really going to help," Ms. Lawson, a clerk at the park, said. "Especially after the Sept. 11 attacks, people are going to want to come to places like this." 
But the options are growing fewer for Tennessee, where financial troubles began long before the terrorist attacks helped push the national economy into a recession.
A three-year stalemate in the General Assembly over tax policy and the proposed creation of a state income tax has led to a tightening budget crisis. Tennessee, which depends heavily on its 6 percent sales tax, is one of nine states without a personal income tax.
Forty-three states are reporting that revenues are not keeping pace with budget expectations, and 22 have begun cuts or hiring freezes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"Tennessee may serve as a model in that most other states are just now encountering a budget situation that Tennessee has sort of had a couple of years' experience with," said Arturo Perez, a policy specialist with the conference.
"Somebody from Tennessee," Mr. Perez said, "described the situation to me as: 'We cut the fat in the first year. We cut to the bone last year. And what we are going to do this year is kind of unanswered.' "
The state has drained reserve funds for various departments and used one-time revenues to pay for continuing obligations while watching its credit rating fall.
Over Gov. Don Sundquist's veto, the legislature enacted a budget this year balanced with $560 million of tobacco settlement money and about $100 million in cuts to education and prisons.
Still, Finance Commissioner Warren Neel estimated that the state's $19.6 billion budget could end up more than $300 million in the red this year, and short as much as $800 million next year.
Some are talking about tapping the state's $178 million rainy day fund or raiding the state highway fund. 
Road builders are up in arms. So are college students, whose tuition jumped 15 percent this fall.
But the park closings are stirring the most anger.
Amy Byrge, 30, said she could not imagine being unable to take her four children to Norris Dam to fish, walk the trails or use the playground.
"It has been here forever, as long as I can remember, and I have lived here all my life," Ms. Byrge said. Closing it, she said, "is crazy."
The Department of Environment and Conservation says it understands. "State parks aren't just a government service, they are an emotional experience," a spokeswoman, Kim Olson, said.
About 15,000 people signed a petition to keep Norris Dam open. It was not immediately successful, but Governor Sundquist is talking about asking the legislature early next year to find the money to reopen parks.
The chairman of the House Finance Committee, Matt Kisber, Democrat of Jackson, said he could not predict how a divided legislature would act when its session resumed on Jan. 8.
But, he said, there was no question that the closing of the state parks has helped to crystallize the budget problem.
"It demonstrates that we don't have the resources to do the discretionary things that we would like to do," Mr. Kisber said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: REPORTER'S DIARY; 
Two Worlds Paired by War: Life or Death, as Luck Will Have It

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The sniper sat behind sandbags on the roof of the American Embassy as the sun dropped behind the Paghman Mountains and the sky began to fade. A camp stove at his knee exhaled the stink of diesel and a steady hiss.
 His name was Sgt. Shane B. Schmidt. He was a marine. This was his bunker. To his left was a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight. To his right were five candy canes hanging on a cord. Sergeant Schmidt had been vacationing in Wisconsin when the hijacked jetliners knocked the World Trade Center down. Watching it happen live on television, he said, "was like being a boxer who couldn't hit back." 
 Now the capital of Afghanistan was spread out before him, freed of the Taliban and as quiet as midnight in Central Park. He was momentarily content. "The coalition forces?" he said. "Let's just say they've done a pretty good job of clearing out the rats." 
It was among the last in a series of memories that will endure for life. The sky darkened. The stars came out. It was Christmas Eve and peaceful enough to nap. The trip hadn't started out like this.
On the first night, three and a half months earlier and 7,000 miles away, Police Officer Eric Josey wandered the wreckage near Liberty and West Streets, a broad-shouldered silhouette illuminated by fire. The space where the towers had been was a mountain of burning rubble and a column of black sky.
Officer Josey was dazed. His face was plastered with ash and sweat. He paced, sat, got up to pace again. Three members of his emergency services truck were lost somewhere in the pile. Around him were shattered fire engines. Their lights still flashed and radios called out but most of their crews were dead. A cop nearby, in stained civilian clothes, spoke his missing brother's name. Officer Josey looked away.
"We've been in there all day and we can't get to anybody," he said, steam rising from his neck and back. "Everybody's gone."
New York and Afghanistan, paired worlds of rubble, work and grief. To travel from one to the other -- 12 days at ground zero; three months in Central Asia and Afghanistan -- was to wander a succession of stages populated by distinct and overburdened tribes.
From afar, the escalating events, filtered through radio, television and newspapers, achieved a sort of context, with analysis and interpretation from many points of view. Up close, context usually fell away. The devastation in New York and Afghanistan, and the war that joined them, became a blur of people and impressions. No single scene can capture it, at least not according to the notebooks, or the memories tumbling out.
New York. A tremendous platinum-and-gold flash where the jet disappeared into the tower, and then the explosion's roar and screams from a crowd breaking into a run. Mothers on a stairwell in the smoky Trinity Church day care center, cradling children and getting ready to step outside, unaware that the remaining tower was about to go. An old woman in a wheelchair being pushed down Greenwich Street, visible one moment and lost the next as another stampede began and the second wave of stinging dust swooshed through. A fire chief limping as he escorted out the bagged remains of one of his battalion's dead. A National Guard captain walking by flashlight through the lightless World Trade Center basement, his beam briefly illuminating the face of the Bugs Bunny doll at the ruined Warner Brothers store.
A word on an iron worker's helmet. "War."
Afghanistan. A teenager tossing a grenade into a brown river -- ga-loomph, a geyser of spray -- and then wading in to look for stunned fish. A haze of dust at sunset as the Northern Alliance infantry moved from Bangi to Khanabad, the restless soldiers hoping to claim the city in time to break the Ramadan fast. Two Taliban soldiers on their backs in the Kunduz bazaar, the dime-sized bullet holes in their foreheads showing the manner of execution hours before. A 10-year-old boy whose home was destroyed by American bombs describing pain in two limbs he no longer had. An alliance general, handsome enough for the cover of a fashion magazine, flossing his teeth after dinner, admitting he was confused.
"All of my life, a fight," said the general, Atiqullah Baryalai, his brown eyes fixed on nothing, his right forearm traced with scars. "Now we have to govern. To do this we must think very hard."
Sometimes the notes and memories contained a distillation of a theme. Some matched the sound bites on the shortwave radio when the shortwave radio worked. Some were separated by minutes; others by a week. They tell of fear, fatigue, pain, fury, courage, carnage, betrayal, sorrow, hunger, despair, disease, bewilderment, loneliness and regret. They tell of boredom, of wondering what would happen next.
They tell of joy. A few days before Afghanistan's new government was sworn in, a line of Afghan porters, crossing the Salang Pass high in the Hindu Kush, trekked through rock and snow as an American warplane passed overhead. They were poor men with filthy clothes and hacking winter coughs. The Taliban had been defeated. They were about to get their nation back.
The plane dropped pods of glowing flares, four at a time for miles, leaving a descending trail of smoke and light in a bowl of mountain air.
"It's like when the Russians left," one porter said, his breath full at 11,000 feet. "It means victory! Victory!" 
Maybe he was right.
Unless you asked the sniper ("It's not over," Sergeant Schmidt said. "Wherever there is terrorism, that's where we want to go.") Unless you asked the cop. (Officer Josey's unit had given its blue shoulder patches to the military to glue to aircraft bombs. He said, "They've got a lot more bombs to drop.")
They were dual worlds, Manhattan and Afghanistan, full of contrasts and common themes. They doled out two lessons, over and again: that your truth depends upon your tribe, and the power of luck is almost absolute.
What happened? Depends upon who was asked, and there were more tribes with a stake in what was going on than could quickly be counted: politicians, cops, Pashtuns, refugees, clerics and Green Berets; firefighters, Uzbeks, widows, orphans, amputees and marines. Each one had a different version, even when talking about the same thing. 
A Taliban soldier in a hospital bed lifted a sheet to show where two bullets had passed through his groin. He said he had been ordered to drop his weapon by an alliance soldier, and when he did the soldier shot him there. It was just another interview, until the pro-alliance translator realized it was being written down.
"This man is lying," he said. "Do not listen to him. All of his words are lies."
The Talib pleaded for antibiotics and pain killers. The translator walked away.
Every tribe had its talkers, from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to a one-legged Tajik car thief. Some were crazy. Others lied. Many were honest and got it right. There were few rules for dealing with each. But a former British infantryman, who knew the country and gamely shared his hidden Scotch, had one: whenever an Afghan soldier gives you a number, he said, always take away one of the zeros.
Many times it just about worked: an alliance commander said he had 100 men, but only 11 could be found. Sometimes it was not enough: tips about a Taliban massacre near Kunduz -- "200 people slaughtered, maybe more," the Afghan soldiers said -- led to a search that turned up one shepherd who knew of six dead.
Or maybe we missed things. Given the lack of sleep and language barriers, it was just as likely the case. We got lost almost every day. We were always headed somewhere else.
The different interpretations went on and on. Some revealed only ignorance, as when the mayor's administration said ground zero needed no more volunteers, and the volunteers around the rubble desperately needed help. Others revealed the distance between cultures locked in war.
The construction worker arrived at West Street, maybe on Day 4, wearing canvas overalls and a sweatshirt with a collar tight on his muscular neck. He had the personality of a boss. He organized a crew of sweepers and for 12 hours worked them harder than anyone else in sight. His name was Anthony. He wanted every Muslim in America to be put in camps.
"Look at what they did here, man," he said, sitting to eat with firefighters in the broken glass and trash. "This was our neighborhood." 
Places changed, perspectives changed, there was always another take.
Six weeks later, a Muslim woman sat primly on a bench in the Ferghana Valley, Uzbekistan, where in 70 years of occupation the Russians had gotten things just about perfectly wrong. Communists had tried banning Islam while ruining the economy and denying citizens civil rights. The repression spawned basmachis, Islamic guerrillas and some of the precursors to the mujahedeen.
After Uzbekistan became independent in 1991, President Islam Karimov attacked faith with fresh zeal. He locked up men for praying in public or circulating religious books. In the woman's city of Namangan, more than 1,000 men who tried to rebuild a mosque had been sent to jail. In the past week two had come home dead.
Here, Anthony seemed to have his way: Muslims were in camps. What came of it? As Mr. Karimov pressed harder, children begged in alleys and the resistance grew anew.
Some men fought in the Ferghana, others slipped into Afghanistan, where veteran guerrillas trained them and Al Qaeda gave them guns. They started out as fighters against oppression. They ended up bunking with angry men from across the Muslim world -- Pakistanis, Chechens, Tajiks, Arabs, a Westerner or two -- foot soldiers in the global jihad.
The woman's husband had been found working at the mosque and was imprisoned after a secret trial. She had no heat, meat or plumbing, and was too poor to send her children to school. She said she had no sympathy for the terrorists but understood what drew men to the fight.
It had a familiar ring. "We are educated, and we know that America made a revolution to get its freedom," she said. "When you had this revolution, were your conditions as bad as ours?" 
It was almost always someone else's fault, no matter where you went.
Six weeks later still, at a Kunduz high school the Taliban had commandeered, former Taliban soldiers were still around. They had changed their hats from Taliban black turbans to the alliance's tan pakool, and a dozen turncoats followed two visitors down the hall. A sign over one door said: "Arabs." Over another: "Do not enter without permission." A third: "Uzbeks."
This was a barracks for foreign members of the Taliban. It spoke of bravado turned to despair.
Perhaps once these jihad warriors were fearsome, but in the end they were too scared to go outside. In the final days of the bombardment, before switching sides or surrendering, they used their quarters as a toilet and ate the pigeons that flew in through the open roof. They left behind land mines and cocky graffiti: "The rising of Osama bin Laden" or "Our way is the jihad." They gave up Kunduz with hardly a fight.
Even their former comrades spoke of them with contempt. "The foreign Taliban were bad people," said one of the turncoats, Jawid Gaurd, 15 and peach-fuzzed, with an AK-47 on his back.
His father, Abdullah Gaurd, had been an Afghan Taliban commander, and the next day the father waited at the top of a staircase in his home while his bodyguards escorted visitors in. He spoke convincingly, touching points in the new party line -- about peace, rights and democracy; about Afghanistan's allies in the West.
Only once did he slip, when recounting how many people he had killed. He was somewhere in the hundreds when he caught himself and stopped. "But never any civilians," he said, pointing his finger for emphasis. "Never. Not even one. You can ask all of the people in our city. They will tell you: Abdullah Gaurd is a great friend to Afghanistan's people." 
Out in the city, people scowled when they heard his name.
Out in the countryside, signs of the dead were all around. In places the roads were lined with fresh graves with white and green flags, the mark of martyrs, snapping in the wind. In others, with the rusted hulks of Soviet tanks or bomb craters ringed with sparkling bits of glass.
Here and there the bombs had missed, and the Afghans were digging through their homes for civilian dead. It was just like the police and firefighters downtown, except they had no welders, cranes or budget for it, and no one handing out Gatorade and turkey rollups or cheering when they broke for sleep.
There were places where the bombs did not explode, and they sat in families' yards. Muhammad Baz waved from his door in Charykari and the crowd walked right into his living room and saw the huge bomb's protruding fin. It happened kind of fast. When a visitor stepped backward, Mr. Baz scoffed and flicked his wrist.
"Puh!" he said. "Your country put it here, and you are afraid." 
There were children all around him, staring and shaking their heads. The interview continued down the street.
People have been conditioned, through lore and life alike, to expect certain qualities as arbiters of survival. Judgment, physical fitness, alertness, a knack with equipment -- all are supposed to ensure that a person in a bad spot has a chance of getting out.
In countless cases in New York and Afghanistan, they mattered not a bit. Chance was the ultimate arbiter, and good luck and bad were best expressed by the locations of one's feet when the planes came in, when the buildings came down or when bombs landed on a house.
One man's feet were at Liberty and Church on Sept. 11. He lived. Another's were in an office on the 65th floor of the second tower. He didn't. What determined who was where? Nothing much. It was impossible to choose to be in the good spot or the bad one, because when people made their decisions they had no idea of how serious the outcome would be a few minutes later, just as when an Afghan family took shelter in an airstrike it could not know that of all the bombs that would land in their neighborhood, the one that would crash through their ceiling would not explode.
Bad judgment or sloth could get someone killed, but good judgment and fitness wouldn't necessarily keep them alive. It was luck, and there were moments when it seemed the most powerful force in the world, stronger than the jihad soldiers' certitude in the will of God, stronger than America's bombs.
Then there were exceptions.
A lean alliance commander, Rhamazhoni, stood near a bomb crater on the highway the morning after Khanabad fell. A dozen of his men had been killed in rice fields roughly two weeks before, and now that the front lines had shifted he had come to give them proper graves. The first victim, Rahim Ullah, was carried to the shoulder of the road. Someone put a blanket over his mud-caked face. He had been a big man. It took six soldiers to carry his remains.
Mr. Rhamazhoni said he died like this: the men had been stranded after the Taliban ambushed their vehicles and they scurried into the fields. They fought until they were short of ammunition and then they tried to run. Some were injured and couldn't keep up, and were executed as the pursuing Taliban ran them down.
One man escaped, the other did not, and the reason was so basic it might have come from a schoolyard game of tag. "I was faster than him," Rhamazhoni said.
These were the constants: Just when you thought you had figured something out, you were proved wrong. You always risked missing the most important moments, because you were looking for something else.
The snow crunched beneath the hikers' feet. It was during a rest break in the Hindu Kush, and the porters crowded in to ask where the two foreigners were from. "London? Germany? America?" one said.
We were trying to keep the group moving so we could make it to Kabul.
"New York," I answered, in a hurry, starting to walk away.
He stopped me by my elbow, making sure his eyes had mine. When he spoke again it was in the slow diction of a man on an excursion into an unfamiliar language, but who wanted to be heard. He nodded, deep enough to be a bow, before raising both hands to eye level and letting them flutter to his waist.
The meaning was obvious, even high in mountains in a distant corner of the earth. Towers falling down.
"New York," the Afghan porter said. "Very sorry us."

Hankering for Russian sushi? Yemeni fried chicken? Taiwanese fish and chips, Japanese spaghetti or Jamaican jerk chicken with chop suey? 
 If not, you could always get the roast beef sub at a new Blimpie in Manhattan, and a side of shrimp pad Thai, or a turkey and Swiss with banana sticky rice. 
 But if you really must sink your teeth into authentic ethnic-ethnic fusion, forget the Blimpie, a k a Joey Thai. 
There are two new Indian-Chinese restaurants in Queens. There is Pakistani-Italian and Norwegian-Cantonese in Brooklyn and Korean soul food in Harlem. There is Irish-Dominican, Greek-Irish and Dominican-Italian food, and a Greek-owned Italian pizzeria in a Chinese section of Flushing that is popular among Indian Sikhs. 
Immigrant magnet that it is, New York City has long been the scene of some cross-cultural cuisine, including Cuban-Chinese restaurants, Albanian pizza parlors and a Chinese-owned Mexican taco chain.
But in a culinary phenomenon sweeping through the city's immigrant neighborhoods, dozens of rare and unusual ethnic combinations and eateries have emerged over the past few years, some of them opening just in the past few months. And immigrant restaurateurs say that in the highly competitive world of New York City ethnic food, it pays to branch out, mix, borrow and blend. 
Mostly undetected by critics and guidebooks -- and all but the most adventurous food lovers -- the restaurants cater largely to immigrants, advertising in ethnic-language newspapers and relying on word of mouth to build their business. 
In Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, Russian cafes have been serving sushi for several years. But last year, a Ukrainian restaurateur opened the Riviera Sushi Grill, where most customers are Russian immigrants and there is a Russian-style menu offering borscht and pickled herring, with a separate menu for the sushi bar. 
"We are not a restaurant where you can have the traditional California roll," said the owner, Alex Podolnyy, 29.
As Russian-speaking customers nibbled from large wooden sushi boats on a recent evening, Mr. Podolnyy said that the sushi, made by a Taiwanese chef who adds Russian twists to the food -- like black caviar -- is selling like mad. 
But Toshi Suzuki, a Japanese immigrant in the restaurant business, scoffed at the notion of Russian -- or Taiwanese-made -- sushi. "Everyone knows a real sushi chef must be Japanese," he said.
No matter that Mr. Suzuki runs an Italian restaurant, Basta Pasta, on West 17th Street in Manhattan, or that his chefs are either Japanese or Ecuadorian. "Most of the Italian chefs in this town are Spanish or Chinese," he said. "So, we are Japanese. This is New York."
His food is Italian, with Japanese influences, which are obvious in dishes like spaghetti with flying fish roe and Japanese basil. However, he draws the line at drinks, selling fine Italian wines. 
"I will not be serving spaghetti and sake," Mr. Suzuki said. 
There are perhaps dozens of upscale fusion restaurants in the city that, like Basta Pasta, combine the flavors of two or more countries. But there are many other off-the-radar neighborhood restaurants that cook less common combinations. 
Among them is Nakisaki International Restaurant, which has been serving Jamaican and Chinese food, and Chinese dishes with a Jamaican twist, for 15 years on a quiet street in Rosedale, Queens. The owner, Earl R. Lyn, an ethnic Chinese from Jamaica who also runs a 250-seat Nakisaki restaurant on Long Island, said he was an acrobat in Jamaica and was nicknamed Nakisaki.
Similar to the Cuban-Chinese restaurants that first opened in Manhattan decades ago, Jamaican-Chinese -- along with a growing number of Guyanese-Chinese restaurants in Queens -- reflect a type of food that is native to the home countries of the immigrants who cook it. 
In the past century, the Chinese have immigrated to or gone as indentured servants to countries all over the world, including Cuba, Guyana, Jamaica, Pakistan and India. And the style of Chinese food that is cooked there -- and influenced by the tastes and flavors of those countries -- was brought here. Lately, the Chinese food from those countries is cropping up all over Queens, a borough known for its large immigrant population and its many ethnic restaurants. 
With the market saturated by the cuisine of some ethnic groups, such as Indian food, new restaurateurs from well-established immigrant groups here are likely to cook a more specific or narrower style of food than most of those already in business, said Jim Leff, an expert on ethnic food and author who started the Web site Chowhound.com. 
"The first American restaurant in Nepal will not make spoon bread from South Carolina," he said. "But the 30th might." 
The owners of the two new Indian-Chinese restaurants in Elmhurst, Queens, said they felt that there were already too many Indian restaurants in the city. The owners -- both of them Chinese-Indians -- said their best chance of surviving in this economic downturn was to offer something Indian immigrants were yearning for and that few others were serving -- home-cooked Chinese. 
At one of them, Chopstick, on Grand Avenue, which opened three months ago, the shiny new menu lists Chinese dishes that could be found at any Chinese restaurant, like wonton soup and hot and sour shrimp. But others, like fried chili chicken and vegetable special Bombay style, are made with Indian spices and ingredients.
Akhil Bisaria, an Indian immigrant from Bombay who lives in New Rochelle, N.Y., and recently discovered Chopstick, said he had not found Indian-Chinese in New York before. "This is the Chinese food I ate growing up," Mr. Bisaria, who works for a computer company, said the other night, while he was sipping egg corn soup, an Indian variation of egg-drop soup. 
"I could really see this in the Village," said his wife, Alex, who had brought her sister along to try the food. "It would be such a hit." 
While some immigrant restaurateurs are serving mixed ethic cuisine native to their homelands, others are serving the food of other ethnic groups for a variety of reasons, profit foremost among them. 
In the case of the Russian sushi, Japanese food is a craze now in Moscow and establishments here are catering to the tastes of customers who no doubt know about sushi's popularity back home.
The Russians are joining Koreans, and more recently Chinese, in opening sushi establishments in New York City, according to Robert Sietsama, the restaurant critic for The Village Voice and the author of several books on ethnic food.
"Koreans have claimed rights to sushi for a long, long time," Mr. Sietsama said. "What is newer is Chinese restaurants serving sushi, that's astonishing. And the Russians like sushi very much. I guess it was a quick step from pickled herring to raw fish."
It is unclear how the new Blimpie, a k a Joey Thai, on East 31st Street in Manhattan, fits into all this. 
But in the two months since the owner, Sanoh Yunprayong, known as Joey Thai, began serving Thai fast food along with "America's best-dressed sandwich," it has drawn a small but loyal following.
Like several customers, Mr. Leff, who writes a regular column for Chowhound.com called "What Jim had for Dinner Last Night," discovered the fast-food restaurant by accident. He described it as "an oasis set in a highly commercial yellow plastic Blimpie," but wrote in his column that he felt Joey Thai did not have all the ingredients and equipment that he would need to make exceptional Thai food.
"It was the sort of meal you'd expect to eat if you'd met a Thai chef cooking spaghetti and steaks in a Peruvian railroad dining car," Mr. Leff wrote. 
Joey Thai, 52, an immigrant from Bangkok who ran a Thai restaurant in his native country, does the Thai cooking and makes the submarine sandwiches, as do his wife and three sons. There are two menus; Blimpie breakfast is served starting at 7 a.m., and the Thai food starts at 11 a.m.
Ultimately, Joey Thai said, his goal is to open a French restaurant with "a Thai touch." But for now, he said, he will continue serving subs and Thai, and probably add one other type of food to his menu. 
"We would like to survive in New York City," he said. "And I can't count on Blimpie alone. Next time you come, I may be serving Spanish. You know, rice and beans."

Neglected Cotton Bowl Confronts Its Future

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE 

 BODY:
It is a New Year's Day staple that, in its 65 years, has featured players like Davey O'Brien, Doak Walker, Ernie Davis, Jim Brown and Joe Montana. It is still played in the same stadium, a cozy relic on the Texas State Fairgrounds near downtown Dallas. Its sidelines are haunted by coaching legends like Bear Bryant, Darrell Royal and Frank Broyles.
 When Oklahoma (10-2) meets Arkansas (7-4) tomorrow in the 66th Cotton Bowl Classic, 68,252 people -- the 12th sellout in the game's last 15 years -- will file into a living time capsule, each side hoping its team will provide a new episode for a bowl game steeped in lore. 
 So why doesn't the Cotton Bowl matter as much as it once did? It is a victim of the business realities of modern college football, which have kept the game out of the Bowl Championship Series.
Until the mid-1990's, the Cotton Bowl was as prestigious as the Rose Bowl, now in its 88th year; the Sugar, now in its 68th; and the Orange, also in its 68th. Created in 1937 by J. Curtis Sanford, a Dallas oil man who attended the 1936 Rose Bowl and decided that his hometown needed a college football showcase, the Cotton Bowl was the coveted destination for the Southwest Conference champion.
For 54 years, from 1941 to 1995, Royal's Texas Longhorns, Broyles's Arkansas Razorbacks, O'Brien's Horned Frogs of Texas Christian and Walker's Southern Methodist Mustangs provided attractive opponents for some of the nation's best teams.
But in 1995, the Southwest Conference disbanded. Stalwart programs like Texas and Texas A&M merged with the Big Eight to form the more lucrative and television-friendly Big 12. The rest of the teams scattered to other conferences. The Southwest Conference's demise coincided with an initiative by several commissioners of big conferences to restore some order to the bowl season, establishing the B.C.S. in the hopes of creating a true national championship game.
"That meant when they were drawing up the B.C.S., we didn't have a conference commissioner at the table to champion our cause," said Rick Baker, the executive director of the Cotton Bowl. "The Sugar Bowl had the Southeastern Conference, the Orange had the Big Eight, and the Rose had the Pac-10 and Big Ten."
Still, Cotton Bowl organizers tried. It is second only to the 24-day State Fair of Texas in economic impact to the Dallas area, Baker said. He said college fans in Dallas for the game account for $30 million of direct spending and up to $90 million in overall economic impact. The nonprofit organizing committee has long been regarded as one of the better-run bowl operations and has offered ample payouts to participating teams.
Oklahoma and Arkansas will each receive $2.5 million. Outside of the $11 million to $13 million paid out per team by the four B.C.S. bowls, the Cotton Bowl ranks behind only the $4.25 million offered by the Florida Citrus Bowl. The Cotton Bowl gets the first pick of Big 12 teams not in the B.C.S. games and the second pick of SEC teams not in those games, behind the Citrus Bowl.
In 1957, Brown, the Syracuse running back, displayed his prowess on the national stage by rushing for 3 touchdowns and 132 yards and recording five tackles in a 28-27 loss to T.C.U. In 1960, the Orangemen's Davis took a halfback pass 87 yards for a touchdown, rushed for another, intercepted a pass and led undefeated Syracuse to a 23-14 victory over No. 4 Texas and a national title.
In 1968, Bryant, who brought a Kentucky team and four Alabama squads to the Cotton Bowl, provided college football with one of its most indelible images when he embraced one of his former players, Gene Stallings, after Stallings coached Texas A&M to a 20-16 upset of the Crimson Tide.
And in 1979, an ailing Notre Dame quarterback named Montana, fueled by chicken noodle soup at halftime, led the Irish to a 22-point comeback in the last seven minutes to defeat Houston, 35-34, in what is known as the Ice Bowl.
As stirring as that performance was, the ice storm of that afternoon was another factor that perhaps undercut the Cotton Bowl's inclusion in the B.C.S. The Orange Bowl in Miami, the Fiesta in Phoenix and the Rose in Pasadena, Calif., of course, are warm-weather sites. The Sugar Bowl is played inside at the Superdome in New Orleans.
There are plans, however, to eliminate that disadvantage before 2006, when the B.C.S. agreement runs out. Darrell Jordan, a Dallas lawyer and the chairman of the Cotton Bowl Dome Foundation, is working with city officials and corporate sponsors to fit the Cotton Bowl with a retractable roof.
The initiative, which began in 1996, attracted more than $25 million in commitments before it was halted in 1998, when Dallas proposed to rebuild the stadium as part of its bid to play host to the 2012 Olympics. That Olympic bid, however, was unsuccessful, and Jordan is back at work trying to put together a public-private partnership to raise the estimated $200 million to renovate the stadium.
He is hopeful, as is Baker, that a spruced-up, closed-in Cotton Bowl is perhaps the final piece that will allow the old game to muscle in on a new B.C.S. series.
"We have a great infrastructure, tremendous community and corporate support and the kind of history unique to college football," Jordan said. "The Cotton Bowl is, and always will be, a very big game in Dallas and Texas. If we can move it inside, I believe we can return it to a big game nationally."

Central Bank President Predicts Upturn in Europe
The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, voiced cautious optimism today about Europe's economy, predicting a moderate upturn during the next year.
 The economy of the 12-nation euro zone should be expanding at an annual rate of more than 2 percent at the end of 2002, provided a recovery materializes in the United States as expected, he said. On average, growth will be almost 1 percent next year, he added. Page C2. 

Expansion Sought for Online Games
Until now, online games have barely registered as a blip on the radar screen of the $14 billion computer game industry. Consoles like PlayStation 2 and PC-based games like Sims dominate their respective markets, with tens of millions of users tethered to monitors with a joystick or a mouse. That could change in 2002, industry analysts and executives said, as companies try to expand the universe of paying online players by selling more mainstream games like EverQuest by Sony, which has 400,000 users.

HEADLINE: Qatar Oil Minister Is Predicting A Price $20of to $22 a Barrel 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices will probably average $20 to $22 a barrel in 2002, a level that will help the economies of energy-consuming nations, the oil minister of Qatar said on Saturday, a day after OPEC agreed to cut production.
 The benchmark price of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for oil has averaged $23.18 this year as the group sought to keep prices between $22 and $28 a barrel. The group was prompted to moderate its price expectations when demand slowed because of recessions in the United States, the top oil consumer, and other countries. 
 "Today, because we have to be more pragmatic, to see how we can help the world economy, I think $20 to $22 is a reasonable price," Qatar's oil minister, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, told reporters. "We are hoping to see that average in 2002."
Mr. Attiyah spoke in Cairo a day after OPEC nations agreed for the fourth time since February to reduce oil production to arrest a decline in prices. OPEC's oil index has fallen 29 percent since the Sept. 11 attacks.
OPEC ministers say the group has not abandoned its official price range of $22 to $28 a barrel, which is higher than the $20 that the European Union considers a "reasonable" price. Yet other OPEC leaders have said they do not expect prices in 2002 to reach the levels of earlier this year.
OPEC's secretary general, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, said the group's oil index would lead to a price of about $22 in the first half of next year. The outgoing OPEC president, Chakib Khelil, said he did not expect Brent crude -- a more expensive grade of oil than those in OPEC's index -- to rise above $22 a barrel in 2002.
The group, which pumps about a third of the world's oil, kept its price between $22 and $28 for the first eight months of this year by curtailing members' official production by 3.5 million barrels a day.
Mr. Attiyah said that efforts to seek such prices were "on holiday for the time being."
The accord reached by OPEC on Friday calls for reducing daily supplies by a further 1.5 million barrels, or 6.5 percent. It came after independent producers also pledged to limit supplies.

HEADLINE: Leader of European Bank Predicts Euro-Zone Upturn 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, voiced cautious optimism today about Europe's economy, predicting a moderate upturn during the next year.
 "I think we may well have reached the trough," Mr. Duisenberg said in a Dutch television interview. "I expect a recovery in the course of 2002, though it will be slow. I see no recession." 
 The economy of the 12-nation euro zone should be expanding at an annual rate of more than 2 percent at the end of 2002, provided a recovery materializes in the United States as expected, he said.
On average, growth will be almost 1 percent next year, Mr. Duisenberg added.
The euro zone's economy was virtually stagnant in the third quarter. The gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent compared with the previous quarter, and 1.3 percent compared with the period a year earlier.
Mr. Duisenberg denied that he and France had a deal that would have him leaving office in early 2002. He does not expect to step down next year, he said.
"I won't step down in the near future -- I like what I'm doing," he said. Mr. Duisenberg was appointed at a stormy European summit meeting in May 1998 despite opposition from France. President Jacques Chirac said at the time that under a "gentlemen's agreement," Mr. Duisenberg would make way for a French candidate in 2002.
Mr. Duisenberg has never confirmed that.
His official position has been that he will retire at some time before the end of his term in 2006 because of his age. He is 66.
Asked whether the central bank had been slow to react to the economic downturn in the euro zone when compared with the Federal Reserve's much more aggressive easing of interest rates, Mr. Duisenberg played down the ability of monetary policy to spur growth.
"Monetary policy cannot trigger the economy by itself," he said. "We shouldn't expect too much from that."
The Fed has cut interest rates 11 times this year, by a total of 475 basis points, reducing its rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.75 percent, its lowest level in 40 years.
In contrast, the European Central Bank has trimmed rates four times, by a total of 150 basis points.

Death Toll in the Hundreds In Peru Fireworks Accident
A string of fireworks explosions in the historic center of downtown Lima caused a wall of fire that trapped street vendors and holiday shoppers along the narrow streets, officials said. There was little hope of finding survivors inside the burned-out buildings, where temperatures exceeded 1,100 degrees at the height of the fire. A1

Pakistan Arrests Militant
In what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to forestall a war with India, Pakistan arrested Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of two Islamic militant groups accused by India of mounting a deadly attack on the Indian Parliament, news services reported. A3

Common Currency in Europe
Euro coins and notes become legal tender in 12 European nations at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, and they will replace national currencies by the end of February. A4

Fewer Attacks on Israelis
Attacks on Israelis by Palestinians have declined nearly 50 percent in the two weeks since Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat called for a halt to violence, the Israeli Army said. Hopes for a continued lull were jolted when Israeli armed forces shot and killed six Palestinians in two separate incidents in the Gaza Strip. A3

Argentine Leader Resigns
Argentina's interim president, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, said he had been unable to govern since stepping in for Fernando de la Rua, who was ousted after food riots and protests over the failing economy. Mr. Saa handed power to Senate President Ramon Puerta, who refused to accept the designation and passed the job to the next in line as established by the Constitution, Eduardo Caamano. A6

More Trouble in Zambia Vote
International observers said that they had "serious concerns" about how votes were being counted in Zambia's most fiercely contested presidential election. A6

Across America, Facing New Year With New Resolve
New Year's resolutions may seem a silly ritual -- self-improvement vows that give way before winter does, plans to tackle projects that never get beyond the blueprints. In modern America, resolutions are as often fodder for humor as for reflection. People resolve not to make any more resolutions. But as this most momentous year wanes, many people are looking to the future in a more sensitive and serious way. A8

Fiscal Slashing, but at a Price
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, is happy to be cast in the role of fiscal slasher. But as enforcer of budget discipline, he has bloodied himself as much as he succeeded in imposing austerity. Even his biggest triumph -- insisting that Congress not give more money to the war on terrorism until the administration could develop its own proposals -- came at a heavy price. A8

Waiting for the I.R.S.
People calling the Internal Revenue Service for help with their tax returns waited an average of four minutes to speak to a representative this year and often got inaccurate information, a government report said. The average wait increased 15 percent over 2000, said the report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. More than 70 million people called the agency for tax help in 2001. A9

Building a Boom on Weekends
While most tourist destinations are content with one or two large festivals a year, Leavenworth, two hours east of Seattle, has 19 special-event weekends, like the Bavarian Ice Fest in January and a chamber music festival in July. That may help explain why, with Washington State and the nation in recession and the tourism industry hit particularly hard, Leavenworth is booming. Nationally, tourist locales a short drive from big cities are reporting the same trend: Americans are taking more day trips by car and fewer long vacations by plane in response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and to a weakening economy.

More Than Just a Mayor, Giuliani Leaves City Recast
The time has come for Rudolph W. Giuliani to go. He became more than just a mayor after Sept. 11 as he helped reassure a traumatized city that it would pull through. Tomorrow he hands to Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg a city transformed. During Mr. Giuliani's eight-year tenure, when the national economy soared, the city became safer, cleaner, better run. He also restored the sense that a city that had once seemed out of control was, in fact, manageable. It is an accomplishment that may benefit or burden his successor. A1

Mayor-elect Bloomberg chose Nicholas Scoppetta, who won praise for overhauling New York City's child welfare system, to be the city's next fire commissioner and rebuild a department that lost 343 firefighters at the World Trade Center. The appointment of Mr. Scoppetta, 69, came as something of a surprise because he had said he intended to leave government when Mayor Giuliani left office. F1

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: RISE AND FALL; 
The Legacy of the Taliban Is a Sad and Broken Land

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: SANGESAR, Afghanistan, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
When the last of the Taliban fled into the desert three weeks ago, the neighbors of Mullah Muhammad Omar wasted no time in celebrating his downfall. 
 They rushed to the madrasa, the religious school he built more than a decade ago, tore the wood frames off the doors and window panes and burned them for heat. They carried the straw mats to their homes, boxed up the books that Mullah Omar regarded as too important to be handled by the local boys. 
 Today, the Islamic school started by the founder of the Taliban stands empty, a mud-brick monument to the rise and fall of a man and his creed. 
"We didn't trust him," said Abdul Muhammad, a 25-year-old farmer in Sangesar. He was not born in the village, and "he kept to himself," Mr. Muhammad said. "Nobody went with him." 
And so the Taliban, the radical Islamic movement, died here at the outskirts of Kandahar, seven years after it came to life in the nearly the same spot. It had risen from the desert, forcing itself through a historical opening left by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the opportunism of Afghanistan's neighbors, and the growing appeal of radical Islam in a world shorn of its cold war faiths. 
Full of itself, the Taliban flourished outside the gaze of the world's remaining superpower, the United States, finally giving succor to the terrorists that would invite its own doom. As a revolutionary movement, the Taliban burned hot and fast.
The Afghanistan the Taliban left behind is a sad and broken land. To a visitor, the country seems an almost apocalyptic place, scattered with ruins and orphans and the detritus of wars.
In the five years that the Taliban held the capital, their record as a government might be measured by the numbers they produced: nearly one million refugees, joining the million others who had already left and refused to come home; six million Afghans, a quarter of the country, unable to find enough food.
But the real legacy of the Taliban rule lies deeper and is harder to grasp. A journey around Afghanistan, beginning on the border with Tajikistan and ending 400 miles away in Kandahar, revealed deep psychological wounds in a people still struggling with the torment of a government regarded by many as oppressive and strange.
In Kandahar, a 30-year-old man named Hekmatullah walks the streets in search of a new career. Five years before, he was a taxi driver, and then he was accused of theft, and his right hand was severed by the Taliban's religious police. Now he keeps the stump of his right hand hidden in a scarf lest anyone see.
"I am a joke to you," he snarled at an acquaintance. "Everyone knows what happened to me."
Syed Sher Agha, a 26-year-old English teacher, grapples most nights with the memories of his two cousins, slain by a Taliban soldier in Mazar-i-Sharif three years ago. The gunman had bickered with his comrades for the opportunity to do the deed, and when he finished, Mr. Agha recalls, the Talib took pleasure in his work.
"I am a Ghazi," the man had exulted, meaning a victorious holy warrior.
In Kabul, the widows gather in front of the city's most fashionable shops, hustling and fighting one another for the scraps tossed to them by the luckier in life. It is a pathetic scene, these grown and mature women, their faces shrouded in filthy burkas, sometimes tearing the worthless Afghani notes thrown their way.
"Please, mister," Sheela, a 40-year-old widow and mother of six, called to a passerby recently on Flower Street. "I haven't any food for my children."
The widows of Kabul may be viewed as Exhibit A for the Taliban's indifference to their own. Nearly one in eight families in Kabul is believed to be headed by widows, and most have children. But under the Taliban, they were not permitted to work.
The World Food Program had started an ingenious project, setting up a string of bakeries that allowed a group of widows to bake bread for money and provide food for the rest. The program's directors said they wanted to survey the city, to see who was in need and who was not, according to Peter Goossens, the program's deputy director in Afghanistan. The Taliban balked.
Several times, Mr. Goossens said, he thought that he had reached an agreement with the Taliban to survey Kabul's households to find all of its widows, only to return to the next meeting to find that he had not. He was led to wonder whether the Taliban leaders ever really understood what it was he wanted to do.
The survey was never completed.
"Sometimes, I thought the Taliban were from another century," Mr. Goossens said. "And sometimes I thought they were from another planet."
The Taliban stood as the embodiment of a nation, but succeeded only in gaining the allegiance of their own ethnic group, the Pashtuns, and in the end they lost that, too. It is now clear that as the end drew closer, only a combination of drugs, Pakistani help and the largesse of the world's most wanted man kept them afloat.
Osama bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996, with the Americans already regarding him as a stateless sponsor of terrorism. Over the years he exerted ever greater influence over the Taliban. Afghanistan became a training ground for terrorists. 
It seemed that the Taliban leadership and Al Qaeda increasingly became one. "Sometimes, Osama would walk in, take out a lot of money and give it to everyone," said Muhammad Khaksar, the Taliban's deputy minister for the interior who stayed behind in Kabul when the rest of his comrades fled.
With the Taliban having dispersed, some of its leaders now claim that a moderate faction had been struggling to expel Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan. A less confrontational approach by the United States, those Taliban say, might have succeeded in neutralizing Mr. bin Laden before Sept. 11. And afterward, they say, the Americans pulled the trigger too quickly on their military response.
"We needed more time, two weeks," Sohail Shaeen, the Taliban's deputy ambassador to Pakistan, said in an interview. "The rank and file of the Taliban were opposed to bin Laden; even some in the leadership were."
At the same time, Mr. Shaeen said, many in the Taliban grew frustrated with Mullah Omar's increasingly autocratic style and with the heavy-handed ways of his dreaded religious police.
"All the decisions were made by one man," Mr. Shaeen said, referring to Mullah Omar. "Many of us were frustrated." It is unclear whether such emotions were authentic or have been manufactured since the Taliban's fall.
American diplomats said they had given any moderates who might have existed in the Taliban every chance to step forward, before and after Sept. 11. But such Taliban never succeeded in making a difference, if they were ever there at all. When the two sides did meet, American diplomats said they could barely comprehend each other.
"Every time I met with these guys, I felt like I was going back to the 14th century," said William Milam, the United States ambassador to Pakistan until July."They never saw the connection between what Al Qaeda did and what their own fate and responsibilities were."
Even Mullah Omar seemed to sense that the end was near. Six months ago, while Mr. bin Laden plotted his attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Mullah Omar told a confidant that he was prepared to take all of Afghanistan down with him.
"He knew he might lose power; he knew that he might be killed," said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist who spoke to Mullah Omar regularly over the years. "He said half of his country had been destroyed in the jihad, and that if the other half had to destroyed to protect bin Laden, then so be it."

Mullah Omar
No Charisma, Just Pakistani Money
Mullah Omar rose as quickly as he fell, propelled to power not by charisma but by the geopolitical maneuverings of his friends. Like many successful leaders, he had a vision and a wealthy patron. For Mullah Omar, the patron was Pakistan.
The reclusive mullah, now believed to be in hiding in southern Afghanistan, was a dour, soft-spoken cleric in Sangesar, a wounded veteran of the jihad against the Soviets, when he was stirred to holy war once again. It was the summer of 1994, five years after the Soviet Union had departed in defeat, and Afghanistan had collapsed into an anarchy of competing warlords. In a story now part of the Afghan folklore, Mullah Omar gathered his men and attacked a group of warlords who had raped and shaved the head of a girl.
By the end of that year, Mullah Omar had nearly 12,000 followers, and he was rolling up the warlords to the north and east. With his promise of restoring the centrality of Islam to daily life, he had created a genuine popular movement.
In early 1996, as Mullah Omar swept across the country, his main rival, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, sent an envoy to take the measure of the man. Mr. Hekmatyar's messenger was stunned by what he saw.
"I was prepared for a strong and magnetic leader," said Syed Idris, the envoy. "This was a very ordinary Afghan. He was uninspiring, without charisma. He had no idea about what was happening in the world. He knew only jihad."
Even with the popular support, the Taliban might have withered were it not for the intervention of their neighbor to the east.
The Pakistani government had nurtured the Islamic revival that drove the war against the Soviet Union, and then watched with frustration as the fighters they helped began savaging one another. The Pakistanis had long harbored a vision of a stable Afghanistan as a gateway to the oil riches of Central Asia, and as a counterweight against India.
For the Pakistanis, the turning point came in 1994, when one of their convoys bearing relief supplies was held hostage by Afghan warlords. As Pakistani officials negotiated the convoy's release, Mullah Omar's men attacked, wiped out the bandits and sent the convoy on its way.
From that point on, former Taliban and Pakistani officials said, Pakistani intelligence officers began funneling arms, money and supplies to the Taliban, as well as military advisers to help guide them in battle.
The Pakistani government had served as the paymaster for the Americans during the war against the Soviets. With the Taliban, they carried on the same role, with American money and with their own. "The Taliban was not a creation of Pakistan, but a logical outcome of the war against the Soviets," said Mirza Aslam Beg, former chief of the Pakistan armed forces.
Not everyone saw it that way. Mr. Idris, the former aide to Mr. Hekmatyar, was so unimpressed by Mullah Omar that he concluded that he was merely a stand-in for a foreign government.
Years later, when he became chief of foreign intelligence for the Northern Alliance, Mr. Idris unearthed evidence justifying his skepticism: The Pakistanis, he said, had funneled as much as $10 million a year to the Taliban, much of it hidden in the budget for the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul.
"Omar was a puppet of the Pakistanis," Mr. Idris said.
For all its logistical and monetary help, Pakistan's most important contribution to the Taliban was people: the thousands of madrasa students who flooded across the border to join the Afghan militia. They did so at the urgings of their mullahs, who told them that it was their Islamic duty.
Indeed, it often seemed that there was little the Pakistani government could have done to stop the holy warriors even if it had wanted to. The border was too long and too desolate, the madrasas were too numerous.
The Islam that flourished in the Pakistani madrasas found its theological roots not in the mainline of the religion but in an offshoot, the Deobandi movement. The Deobandi creed, based in India, exalted extreme austerity and the subjugation of women. The mullahs in Pakistan added their own touches, including the emphasis on holy war. Many of the Taliban's top leaders, including Mullah Omar, studied at Deobandi madrasas.
Mullah Omar remained an enigma until the end of his reign. He shied away from cameras, thinking human images un-Islamic. His followers said he was an austere and serious man, but he seemed to enjoy his status and the comforts it conferred.
When he left Sangesar seven years ago to bring about a Taliban victory, Mullah Omar had a modest mud-brick home, a wife and a son. At the height of his power, he had three wives, lived in a gaudy estate and called himself "the Leader of the Faithful."
"He was a simple man unaccustomed to the perks of power," said Mr. Yusufzai, the Pakistani journalist who met regularly with Mullah Omar. "But over time he found that he liked them."

Bin Laden
A New Cash Cow For the Taliban
In May 1996, Mr. bin Laden arrived by chartered jet at Jalalabad Airport. For all the sacrifices that Mullah Omar later made on his behalf, he came originally as the guest of a local warlord, Yunis Khalis. When the Taliban emerged as the dominant force in Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden went with them.
The Arab Afghans, the name given to the foreigners who had fought against the Soviet Union, had been in Afghanistan for years; many of them played a weekly volleyball game on the outskirts of Kabul long after the jihad against the Soviet Army was over.
As the ensuing civil war dragged on and the Taliban became more isolated, Mullah Omar turned to the Arabs for support. The Arabs were some of the Taliban's toughest fighters, often far more so than the Afghans themselves. And they had money.
Wahidullah Sabawoon, the finance minister for the Northern Alliance, said financial records of the Taliban indicated that the movement faced growing shortfalls of money in the late 1990's.
There was no annual budget, Mr. Sabawoon and his aides said; the Taliban appeared to spend $300 million a year, nearly all of it on the war. In the last few years of their rule, he said, the Taliban had come to rely increasingly on three sources of money: "poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden." 
Mr. Khaksar, the former Taliban deputy interior minister, said Mr. bin Laden had essentially bought his influence in the Taliban government. He would sometimes walk into a room, Mr. Khaksar said, and pull out wads of cash worth as much as $100,000. 
Mr. Khaksar said he once tried to persuade Mullah Omar to rid himself of Mr. bin Laden and the foreigners, but that Mullah Omar rebuffed him."The foreigners had taken over our government," Mr. Khaksar said.
Toward the end of the Taliban's reign, the evidence of foreign infiltration of the movement's upper ranks was unmistakable. Monitoring Taliban radio transmissions, Northern Alliance generals picked up Arabic and Urdu, the language of Pakistan.
In Kabul, Qaeda members planned their attacks in homes scattered around, some of them bearing the seals of the Taliban government. A group of foreigners who had been imprisoned by the Taliban said in interviews that they had first been interrogated by Taliban officials, then by a group of Arabic-speaking men who were far more brutal.
The Taliban, too, grew more extreme. Western diplomats say Al Qaeda helped persuade Mullah Omar to order the destruction of 800-year-old Buddha statues at Bamiyan, an act condemned around the world.
Pakistan rushed a delegation to Kandahar to try to persuade Mullah Omar to hold off. A Pakistani official who attended that meeting said only Mullah Omar had spoken; none of the other Taliban officials seated around him uttered a word.
Mullah Omar did not budge.
"If even one Muslim prays before the Buddhas, how will I explain myself to God?" the Pakistani official recalled him as saying.
Mr. Milam, the American envoy to Pakistan at the time, said, "the Taliban had become so dependent on Al Qaeda that they didn't really need the Pakistanis anymore."

The Remains
Some Still Wait For More Holy War
The Taliban said they would fight to the end. But when the end came, they surrendered, changed sides and ran away. Some ran to Pakistan, where they wander the bazaars with their turbans and ideologies intact. "We will wage a guerrilla war," said Hamidullah, a former Taliban soldier, strolling with a group of comrades in Quetta. "I am waiting for word from my commander."
His pugnacity is rare these days. Among those Taliban who have not fled to the hills, some, like Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, have applied to Pakistan for asylum. His deputy, Mr. Shaeen, says he stays in touch with former Taliban comrades, but he plays down the likelihood that they would, or could, try a comeback.
"If decisions continue to be made by one person, and the same methods are used, then, no, the Taliban will not return," he said.
The mass of Taliban soldiers, who left their villages to join Mullah Omar, seem mostly to be waiting -- in the ranks of the new government they have joined, in the hamlets to which they have returned. There are thousands of these young men, many of them confused, most of them armed.
Not far from Mullah Omar's village, Muhammad Karam joined the Taliban seven years ago. He was fighting, he said, to restore the good name of Islam. He found many enemies on his journey, and his eyes have the glazed look of someone for whom pain no longer pricks the skin.
"I was just a soldier," Mr. Karam said, fiddling with his band of his watch.
Three weeks ago, Mr. Karam, 32, quit the only job he ever had and went home. He has never been to school, and he is not certain where his life will carry him. Most of the men in his village, he said, are willing to give the new government a chance.
But no more than that.
"We Afghans, we all love our children and respect our mothers, and fathers, but when the country is threatened by infidels, we are ready to start the holy war again," Mr. Karam said.
"I still believe in jihad."

 BODY:
 The Military Campaign

ARMY TO RELIEVE MARINES -- The Pentagon ordered soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division to relieve the Marine Corps in southern Afghanistan, paving the way for a long-term American military presence in the country. The Army's mission will be essentially the same as that of the marines: guarding Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners awaiting interrogation, securing an airfield for planes carrying military and relief supplies, and searching for remnants of the Taliban army near Kandahar. A1

Intrigue and Diplomacy

AL QAEDA AND IRAN -- Representatives of Osama bin Laden contacted Iranian intelligence agents in the mid-1990's in an attempt to forge an anti-American alliance of terror between Iran and Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, according to United States intelligence reports obtained by The Times. Iranian intelligence agents responded that they were willing to meet personally with Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, but it is unclear from the reports if such a meeting ever occurred, and if so, whether any agreement was reached. A1

INDIA-PAKISTAN RELATIONS -- In what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to forestall war with India, Pakistan was reported to have arrested Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, the founder of one of two Islamic militant groups accused by India of mounting an attack on the Indian Parliament earlier this month that left 14 people dead, including the five attackers. A3

Recovering From War

AFTER THE TALIBAN -- The Afghanistan the Taliban left behind is a sad and broken land. To a visitor, the country seems an almost apocalyptic place, scattered with ruins and orphans and the detritus of wars. A journey across the country revealed deep psychological wounds in a people still struggling with the torment of a government regarded by many as oppressive and strange. A1

ETCHED IN MEMORY -- A reporter recalls traveling from the devastation of ground zero to the roof of the American embassy in Kabul on Christmas Eve. The devastation in New York and Afghanistan, and the war that joined them, became a blur of people and impressions. B1

FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND -- In Kabul, the Taliban took Afghan brides sometimes by force, but more often with cash. Now, with the Taliban gone, the city's poorest neighborhoods harbor tale after tale of abandoned wives and children, or of sisters and daughters taken to foreign lands far from their families' reach. B2

SANCTUARY -- Chased from the caves of Tora Bora, hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have made their way east into the untamed tribal areas of Pakistan. There could be few better places for a fugitive to flee. The Pashtuns of the region think it their duty to give sanctuary to anyone who requests it, friend or not, Muslim or not, terrorist or not. B5

The President at Home

THE RANCH -- For a man who is no favorite of environmentalists, President Bush has built a surprisingly eco-friendly house on his 1,600-acre ranch in central Texas. Rainwater and household waste water are collected and reused for irrigation, and heat and air-conditioning come from a silent underground geothermal system. B2

Aftermath of the Attacks

GROUND ZERO -- The city opened its first official viewing stand for the World Trade Center site, and thousands of New Yorkers and tourists braved frigid winds and six-block-long lines to get their first good looks at the devastation. B5

RESOLUTIONS -- Like many Americans this year, residents of Newton, Iowa, are approaching the task of making New Year's resolutions with a new thoughtfulness, taking as a lesson from the terror attacks that time can be terribly short. A8

Security at Home

FALSE ALARMS -- Flights were delayed at airports in California and Hawaii because of threats that later proved to be unfounded. At Los Angeles International Airport, a plane was evacuated after the airline, American Trans Air, received a bomb threat; no explosives were found. And Honolulu International Airport was shut down for two hours after a screener saw an image of what she believed was a gun in a bag. B5

CIVIL LIBERTIES -- In response to the terror attacks, the Times Square Business Improvement District is weighing new security measures, some of which may lead to clashes with civil liberties groups and urban planners. F1

Business

TELEVISION -- Since Sept. 11, viewers have flocked to reliable old TV favorites, like those featured on the cable channel TVLand, and have shied away from anything new or outrageously different. C6

TOURISM -- Tourist locales a short drive from big cities are booming, as Americans take more day trips by car and fewer long vacations by plane in response to the terror attacks and to a weakening economy. A9

BOX OFFICE -- Despite the widespread perception that it has been a lackluster year for Hollywood movies and fears that the Sept. 11 attacks would keep people rooted at home and away from multiplexes, 2001 has turned out to be yet another record-breaking year at the box office. E5

Remembering, One by One

THE PORTRAITS -- Three days after the terror attacks, reporters at The New York Times began interviewing friends and relatives of the missing and writing brief portraits, or sketches, of their lives. In the weeks that followed, reading "Portraits of Grief" became a ritual for people nationwide. In hundreds of e-mail messages and letters, readers said they read them religiously, rarely missing a day. The profiles conclude today as a daily feature, although they may appear periodically as more families agree to be interviewed. B6

HEADLINE: Bush's Budget Director Girds for a Tough Year 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
To President Bush, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. is Blade, the guy who takes a knife to spending proposals in a quest to slow the inexorable growth of government, as Republicans see it -- or to cut into vital programs, in the Democratic view.
 Mr. Daniels, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and one of the administration's most conservative senior officials, is happy to be cast in the role of fiscal slasher. Typical of his sometimes biting sense of humor, he keeps a samurai sword over the mantel in his office. 
 But in his first year as enforcer of budget discipline, he bloodied himself as much as he succeeded in imposing austerity. An early effort to wean Congress off pork-barrel spending went nowhere. His early effort to limit the annual increase in discretionary spending to 4 percent became 7 percent after Mr. Bush requested more money for the Pentagon last summer. It jumped to nearly 14 percent after Congress allocated $40 billion in emergency spending to deal with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Even Mr. Daniels's biggest triumph -- insisting, over objections from both parties, that Congress not appropriate additional money to the war on terrorism until the administration could develop its own proposals -- came at a heavy price. 
Derisive comments he made about the tendency of Congress to spend money angered powerful Republicans and Democrats. And his effort to consolidate control over wartime budget writing in the White House left more bad feelings in Congress, where legislators view the power of the purse as perhaps the most important vested in them.
"His relationship with Congress is at a state now where you have to wonder about his effectiveness, if not doubt it," said Stanley E. Collender, managing director of the federal budget consulting group at the public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard managing director of the federal budget consulting group at the public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard. 
Given the demands on the federal government after Sept. 11, the onset of a recession and the rapid disappearance of the budget surpluses, the coming year is shaping up to be even more of a test.
While the administration plans to propose substantial increases in military and domestic security spending in the budget Mr. Bush submits to Congress on Feb. 4, Mr. Daniels has signaled that he will seek smaller budget increases, or outright cuts, for the rest of the government.
He is unapologetic about the $1.35 trillion tax cut Mr. Bush pushed through Congress, dismissing criticism from Democrats that it plunged the government back into deficit. But he said he would use the prospect of renewed deficits to argue against Democratic spending proposals.
"This is a serious business, a two-front war," Mr. Daniels said in an interview, referring to domestic security and military action abroad. "The president is going to insist that we fund every activity that's appropriate for winning on both fronts, and that ensures some significant growth in the budget. The question is whether you can make common-sense adjustments in the rest of the budget."
The answer, some budget analysts say, is no. Democrats are already gearing up to protect programs they consider essential and are eager to make an issue of their differences in next year's Congressional elections. 
"His agenda is to use whatever their spending priorities are to whittle away our ability to provide the funding levels we would like for education, health, science and things like that," said David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
The opposition does not come only from Democrats. Slowing the growth of spending, much less cutting it, has proved difficult for each party, given the entrenched interests that back nearly every government program. 
"The prospects are zero for being able to hold spending down to the levels they want," Mr. Collender said. "This budget is not dead on arrival; it's dead before typesetting."
For all the criticism he has faced, Mr. Daniels is admired by many conservatives in Congress. Within the administration, he is seen as an effective and loyal advocate for Mr. Bush's agenda.
This is not his first stint at the White House. He was President Ronald Reagan's political director in the mid-1980's before returning home to Indiana to pursue a business career. He got his start in Republican politics as a top aide to Richard C. Lugar, who was mayor of Indianapolis when he hired Mr. Daniels out of Princeton University in 1971. When Mr. Lugar was elected to the Senate in 1976, he brought Mr. Daniels along.
It has been politics more than spreadsheets that has tripped up Mr. Daniels since he returned to Washington early this year. 
His wisecracking style infuriated the leaders of the Congressional appropriations committees. He told reporters that Congress's approach was "Don't just stand there, spend something." So angry were the appropriators that Vice President Dick Cheney had to mediate.
Mr. Daniels said he had learned his lesson about not saying things that could be construed as insulting to Congress. "Beyond that, there's a degree of tension inherent in this job," he said. "I can do my duty to the president or be universally popular, but probably not both."
As Congress debated how to respond to the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Daniels said the initiative to decide how and where to spend should rest first with the president. "You can't run a war by a committee of 535 people," he said in the interview. 
Faced with resistance from the appropriations committees this fall, Mr. Daniels summoned the committee leaders to the White House to meet with Mr. Bush on Nov. 6. Mr. Bush, participants said, delivered a blunt warning that if Congress insisted on spending more for the Pentagon and domestic defense than he was seeking, he would veto the bill. 
The message was clear: Mr. Daniels had Mr. Bush's full backing.
Mr. Daniels prevailed. Republicans fell in line with the White House on spending, and Democrats gave up their fight to spend more. But the conflicts, and the principles behind them, remain unresolved. 
"That's a nice elitist view," Mr. Obey said of Mr. Daniels's assertion of presidential leadership. "The power of the purse is lodged by the Constitution in the Congress of the United States. Leadership is not just imposing your will, it's pulling people together so we can have a sustainable coalition over the long run."

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI YEARS: THE OVERVIEW; 
A Man Who Became More Than a Mayor

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
He bounded through City Hall as if it were his living room, singing "what a wonderful tow-w-n," while trailed by silent bodyguards. They stopped shadowing him only when he reached his corner office, a sanctuary where the most telling additions to the decor were the most recent: cardboard moving boxes stacked in the corner.
 So blurred has the man become with the office that it may take a while to remember who owns what. The large portrait of Fiorello H. La Guardia behind his desk stays; it belongs to the city. But that small portrait of Theodore Roosevelt? His. 
 "It's a great job. It's a great job," he said. And then the present tense became the past. "This was an absolutely great job." 
It was a few days before Christmas at City Hall, on a clear and crisp night when the lights of Lower Manhattan seemed to blend with the firmament. And mixed with the tempered joy of this holiday season was the palpable sense that eight years -- of tumult and change, of political wars won and lost, of loud baseball celebrations and quiet personal crises -- had passed in, well, a New York minute.
The time has come for Rudolph W. Giuliani to go.
Four months ago he was a lame duck, hobbling about City Hall with one ailing foot in a protective boot. He was remaining conspicuously silent while his divorce lawyer said nasty things about his estranged wife. He was openly dating another woman, to the chagrin of old friends. He was sleeping in a spare bedroom at a friend's apartment, and no longer living in Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence.
All in all, there was the whiff of irrelevance about him. He was like some temperamental, once-popular ballplayer, striking out more than he was hitting, waiting for his last season to end. There were rumblings, in fact: sure, he had done great things, but those were all in the past seasons of his first term. What has he done for us lately?
Then, on Sept. 11, a mayor whose signal achievement had been to reduce crime in his city witnessed the worst crime ever committed on American soil: a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center that killed almost 3,000 people. He ran for his life as the towering twin symbols of his frequent boast -- the Capital of the World -- collapsed, leaving a new and heartbreaking skyline visible from the windows of City Hall. Then he saw the return of fear.
For weeks afterward, Mr. Giuliani was more than just a mayor. Day after day, his calm explanation of complicated, awful news helped to reassure a traumatized city that it would pull through, and that someone was in charge. He attended funerals, comforted survivors, urged residents to dine out and tourists to come in, all the while exuding compassion and resolve, even as the new threat of anthrax emerged. The man who had seemed so finished just a few weeks earlier was now being greeted with cheers wherever he went: Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
Mr. Giuliani became so entwined in the disaster's aftermath that he briefly considered himself indispensable, and floated a plan that would allow him to continue as mayor after his term expired on Dec. 31. While it did little to diminish the international acclaim he had received for his leadership, this failed plan served as a reminder that Rudolph Giuliani was not an icon but an elected official. And that on New Year's Day, another man would assume the myriad challenges of being the mayor of New York, including the challenge of following so singular an act as that of Mr. Giuliani.
He hands to Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg a city transformed. During his eight-year tenure, when the national economy soared, the city became safer, cleaner, better run. He also restored the sense that a city that had once seemed out of control was, in fact, manageable. It is an accomplishment that may benefit or burden his successor.
Mr. Giuliani also turned city politics upside down, blurring the traditional distinctions between parties and changing the way that voters perceive candidates. In a predominantly Democratic city, he won two consecutive races as a Republican, and is being succeeded by a Republican. He was the consummate anti-politician politician; he consciously took extreme positions on seemingly intractable issues so that the resulting compromise would further his agenda.
All this is not to say that Mr. Giuliani solved every problem presented to him, or that he did not create a few along the way. The housing shortage, not just for the poor but for the middle class, remains a threat to the city's viability. A weakening economy and the terrorist attack have left the city budget with a projected $4 billion deficit beginning in July. The quality of education being provided to 1.1 million children in the public school system did not improve much during his tenure.
And even the most careful municipal manager could not have prepared for the awful wound inflicted on the western side of Lower Manhattan. The Bloomberg administration will have to grapple with the cost of the cleanup and development while tax revenues and employment are plummeting.
Over all, the unspoken challenge that the tireless and ubiquitous Mr. Giuliani presents to Mr. Bloomberg is the formidable dare to do better. In some cases, this may not be so difficult; Mr. Giuliani's relationship with many in the city's black and Hispanic neighborhoods was so bad that Philip Reed, a city councilman from Harlem, said "the field is wide open" for Mr. Bloomberg. In most cases, though -- in crime reduction, for example -- the mayor-elect faces a daunting challenge.
"Rudy's focus was on crime," Mr. Bloomberg said. "My biggest problems are going to be education and the deficit, along with the problems from the economy and the World Trade Center terrorism. It's just going to be a different measure."
In his final days as mayor, Mr. Giuliani, 57, has given a series of speeches and interviews intended to shape his legacy in the public mind. From his perspective, it is a legacy of revolutionary change, of the vanquishing of forces that were paralyzing his beloved city. These included liberals, newspaper editorialists, union bosses, advocacy groups and spinners of race-based politics, all of whom, he believes, had pursued their own special interests at the expense of the greater municipal good.
But even Mr. Giuliani acknowledges that his legacy is not yet secure, that only time will reveal whether the changes that took place during his years in City Hall have become part of the institutional fabric of city government. Some seem permanent, from the creation of a children's services agency to a police-management system that Mr. Bloomberg says he will keep in place. But the unions he tried to tame remain as strong as ever, the welfare rolls that he cut in half are already showing the strain of the recession, and even the sex shops he so famously hounded have proved their resilience.
"Any kind of assessment of what kind of mayor I am right now is unfair," he said. "I don't mean unfair to me; I mean unfair historically. The assessment should be made at least a couple of years from now."
It is more than just his policies that Mr. Giuliani hopes will survive him; it is also the way in which he promoted those policies, since style and substance never seemed far apart in his approach to the job. He said that the mayor of New York has to do two things: develop "an intimate relationship" with the people and the inner workings of their government, and be willing to fight on matters that may not be popular.
"You've got to stand for something, at least in this city," he said. "Otherwise, it rolls all over you."
He said that he had adopted this approach after determining that the two greatest mayors of the 20th century were La Guardia and Edward I. Koch. "They were very different than me," he said. "But they were omnipresent, and they were exceedingly controversial."
"And that's the advice that I'd give to Michael," he said. "You don't have to be controversial, but you've got to stand for something. And you can't be afraid of being unpopular."

A Record of Change
Ending Perception Of Untamable City
In the roiling social experiment that is New York City, the only constant is change. Over the last decade, the population increased by 456,000 to the unprecedented size of more than 8 million. It is as if all of Kansas City left Missouri to settle somewhere in the five boroughs.
As a result, the city's neighborhoods are evolving, bringing different languages, different foods, different feels. Mexicans are replacing Puerto Ricans in East Harlem; Eastern European and Hispanic immigrants are replacing the Italians in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx; transplants from across the country are crowding into Manhattan and spilling into western Brooklyn.
Ultimately, improbably, one person is held accountable for the basic services provided to all these people, from the removal of trash to the attitude shown by the local police. For this responsibility, the city's mayor receives $195,000 a year, the use of Gracie Mansion, a police escort and a daily scrutiny that perhaps only the president of the United States could understand.
On a brisk January morning in 1994, Mr. Giuliani was inaugurated as the city's 107th mayor, inheriting a metropolis with a million people on welfare, an 11 percent unemployment rate, an average of five murders a day, and the widespread perception that it was a city on the skids. In a speech delivered from the City Hall steps -- steps he would later make unavailable to the general public -- he set out a clear agenda. 
"The era of fear has had a long enough reign," he said. "The period of doubt has run its course. As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect."
Eight years later, there is near unanimity among students of city government that Mr. Giuliani succeeded in changing the perception that the city was unmanageable, partly through his policies and partly through his dominating, get-out-of-my-way manner.
"He walked into office at a period in time when people had become very skeptical about what municipal government could do," said Thomas Kessner, a professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the author of a biography on La Guardia. "He restored the notion that the city was governable. That with a clear, focused agenda, an individual who was a firm and good administrator could lay some control on the city."
At the center of the Giuliani legacy is crime reduction. In 1993, the last year of the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, there were 1,927 murders; last year there were 671. In 1993, 430,460 crimes were reported; last year, 184,111. The figures for both murder and overall crime are expected to be even lower by the end of this year.
"It's a vast qualitative change in New York life," said Myron Magnet, the editor of City Journal, the magazine of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group. Mr. Magnet, who is 57, added, "It's the biggest urban policy success in my lifetime."
Mr. Giuliani and his supporters say that making the streets safer was integral to the city's overall health. Beyond making life more appealing to its residents, they say, less crime made New York more attractive to businesses and tourists, generating revenues that could be plowed into other programs. It is a theory that Mr. Bloomberg embraces: "You have to continue to have safe streets. If you don't, you won't have a tax base."
The question of how much credit Mr. Giuliani deserves for the crime reduction continues to spur debate. Several external factors certainly played a role, including the waning of the city's crack cocaine epidemic and a $1 billion program begun under the Dinkins administration to increase the ranks of police officers. There was also a significant decline in crime nationwide, even in cities with seriously troubled police departments, suggesting that crime would have dropped in the city no matter who was mayor, no matter how improved the police work was.
But few dispute that the Giuliani administration's strategy for managing the Police Department played a central role in suppressing crime. That strategy included the vigorous enforcement of low-level offenses, the heightened focus on career criminals, and greater accountability of precinct commanders.
Then there was the development of a program called Compstat, which rigorously tracked the statistics of local precincts to anticipate crime trends. While crime has recently risen in some cities, New York's crime rate has continued to drop.
But does the mayor leave Mr. Bloomberg with a structure that ensures the continued suppression of crime? Or is it a gift-wrapped time bomb? After all, Mr. Giuliani spent an ever-growing amount on police overtime, including $337 million in the last fiscal year that ended on June 30.
Mr. Giuliani said that his Compstat program is the immunization against increased crime. If crime should start increasing, Compstat will show Mr. Bloomberg and his new police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, "where it's going up, and suggest the answer of where they should be deploying," Mr. Giuliani said. "Should they put more in the narcotics division? Should they put more into street crimes? Should they put more in the precincts?"
Mr. Bloomberg agreed. He pointed out that the Compstat concept was designed by Jack Maple, a top adviser to Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William J. Bratton. But he emphasized that it was Mr. Giuliani who seized on the issue of crime and accountability.
"We talk about him reducing crime, but the real lesson is that he focused on an issue," Mr. Bloomberg said. "He has shown that if you focus on an issue, and don't let yourself get diverted from it, or compromised, then government can really change."
The opinion that Compstat was an essential governmental tool, even a cure-all, led the Giuliani administration to apply similar programs to virtually every city agency. It is at the root of Mr. Giuliani's claim that he transformed the mayor's office from a political job to that of a governmental C.E.O., an approach that his critics say made him unsympathetic to the poor and to others who could not meet his exacting standards.
"He gave the city the clear sense that somebody was in charge," said Chris McNickle, the author of "To Be Mayor of New York: Ethnic Politics in the City" (Columbia University Press, 1993). "At the same time, when a mayor has that strong of a personality, he often leaves people with the impression that there's no room for opposition or alternate views."
Mr. Giuliani offers no apologies. "The city is now managed," he said. "Every city agency has a Compstat program in place; everyone is measured every week."
"If you take the time to look at it, you can see whether the agency is doing well or poorly in all the important indicators," he added. "The Parks Department: are the parks getting cleaner or dirtier? Or even more specifically than that, which ones are getting dirtier, and which ones are cleaner?" 
Mr. Bloomberg said that he plans to keep and expand upon Compstat and its sister systems, although he has no intention of leaving the Giuliani management model untouched. To begin with, he is replacing most of the city commissioners. "I am a big believer in term limits, and that after a period of time you've learned what can't be done," he said. "There's no reason to think that a new guy can't do better."
Beyond Compstat, Mr. Giuliani said, there are many other structural changes that should survive him, changes that were controversial at the time but that now seem part of the governmental fabric. The creation of the much-applauded Administration for Children's Services, for example. The merging of the housing and transit police forces with the Police Department. The creation of the Office of Emergency Management, which coordinated the city's response to crises, from routine water-main breaks to the collapse of the trade center. The creation of the Department of Design and Construction, which oversees much of the city construction, ending the costly and sometimes corrupt practice of having separate agencies manage their own building projects.
"Sometimes I think people restructure government just to restructure because you can spin that; it looks good," Mr. Giuliani said. "All the restructuring was designed toward the purpose of finding out how to make the agency more accountable and transparent, so that we could expose it to the public. If you expose it to the public, it will get better."
Some say that the Giuliani administration's claim to have reinvented government is a bit overblown. Under his auspices, parts of government have been reinvented, but most go on as always, said John H. Mollenkopf, the director of CUNY's Center for Urban Research. "And if innovation goes on, it's as much welling from the bottom as it is from City Hall."
As for the mayor's claim to have stood for a transparent -- that is, open -- government, there is a chorus of public officials, government watchdogs and advocacy groups who loudly differ. The Giuliani administration guarded basic city data as though they were state secrets, and spent millions of public dollars to deny the release of public information. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall had to sue to audit records of how the city delivered services. Public Advocate Mark Green had to sue to see records of complaints against the police.
The administration generally did not trust others to analyze basic city information, and maintained that the mayor's interpretation of that information, at his daily news briefings, for example, was a sufficient substitute for the information's release. And, in a cynical way, it was successful, said Gene Russianoff, a senior lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "They were better than their predecessors at controlling the flow of information about what government does, or doesn't do."
The suppression of dissent, or of anything that irked the mayor, became a familiar theme. The administration delayed and blocked permits for various organized protests. It sought to cut off money to the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and tried to block bus advertisements saying that New York magazine was "possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for." The administration also blocked access to the steps of City Hall for what it maintained were security concerns, until a federal court ruled that the city was violating the constitutional right of assembly. The steps, historically, have been a "democratic bazaar," Mr. Russianoff said.
Whether Mr. Giuliani's approach to such matters will continue into the next administration remains unclear. The mayor-elect said Mr. Giuliani had made "everything available on the city's Web site," and suggested that those who complained about a closed government were simply lazy.

Lingering Problems
Ailing Schools, Scarce Housing
Mr. Giuliani may well be handing to Mr. Bloomberg a government that is better than the one he inherited, in keeping with his oft-quoted Athenian Oath of Fealty. But significant problems remain, including some that have dogged the city for decades.
First, there is the city budget.
When he came into office, Mr. Giuliani had no choice but to cut city jobs and spending to erase the $2.4 billion budget gap that he had inherited; his actions earned him a reputation as a fiscal conservative. Then the economy rebounded and soared, enabling him both to cut taxes and to increase spending, with much of that money paying for more police officers and teachers. He now leaves Mr. Bloomberg with a $40 billion city budget whose current $600 million surplus will soon evaporate in the $4 billion deficit that is expected in July.
Various organizations that monitor government say that Mr. Giuliani should have been more fiscally prudent: he should have used more of the surplus for the city's long-term debt and secured more productivity gains through labor negotiations with municipal unions. Instead, they say, he spent the surplus to sustain a larger government, thereby leaving the Bloomberg administration with more programs and jobs, less money, and the costly aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, which no one could have anticipated. They add that his inability to privatize more of government, especially hospitals and failing schools, does not help matters.
"He came in during very tough fiscal times and did what needed to be done; he downsized the government and got the budget where it needed to be," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization. "And by the end of his administration he had taken a considerable bite out of the city's excessive tax burden. Those are considerable achievements.
"What he didn't do is keep the budget at that downsized level," she added. "It grew substantially in his second term. He spent on police and education, yes, but at spending levels that leave the next mayor with a problem."
Mr. Giuliani has little patience with such criticism. He said that he delivered a balanced budget each year that he was in office; kept government spending below the rate of inflation, a claim his critics dispute; and is handing over a fiscal structure that is much more sound than the one he inherited. He said that he reduced taxes "more than any other mayor, ever," and generated enormous job growth in the city.
"That's the choice that I made that did create more of an out-year budget gap, that the next mayor could simply reverse by restoring all those taxes," Mr. Giuliani said. "But if he did, I think you would destroy the economy of the city."
That does not leave Mr. Bloomberg much wiggle room. But the mayor-elect sounded almost nonchalant in discussing the city budget that will make for long nights in his future.
"Rudy did what he thought was right; he was living in flush times," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I wouldn't blame him. The tenor of the times was to keep expanding government, which he did. You want to do more for people, and when the party stops, you find other ways to do it."
"We had the benefit and now we have the pain," he added. "There's nothing wrong with that."
Then there is education. The poor performance of children in public schools remains a civic embarrassment. "We have really failed to reach the kids who attend failing schools," said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at New York University. "That's tragic."
Mr. Giuliani came to office with ambitious plans for education. He hoped to replicate the discipline of his own parochial-school education, in part by championing school uniforms and pushing for vouchers that would allow parents to provide private schooling to their children by using public money to bypass the public-school system. 
In the end, he enjoyed a few achievements. During his tenure, more than 60 new schools were built, more teachers were hired, and arts and reading projects were created. The grip of local school boards was loosened a bit by the State Legislature, allowing the schools chancellor to appoint school superintendents. Tenure for principals was ended, and a merit system established in its stead.
But it seemed that Mr. Giuliani was forever in rancorous battle with the Legislature, the Board of Education or the chancellor of the moment. He forced the ouster of Ramon C. Cortines as chancellor in 1995 and endorsed the appointment of Rudy Crew, an educator from Washington State who became a close confidant. But that relationship crumbled spectacularly in 1999, over a private falling out and a public dispute regarding the mayor's push for a pilot program on school vouchers.
Dr. Viteritti said that these protracted and ugly disputes reflected a central truth about public education in New York City: the Board of Education, not the mayor, has essential control over the school system. And these public mayoral tantrums, he said, were one of the ways that Mr. Giuliani unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Legislature to abolish the school board.
This political failure was the only regret that Mr. Giuliani cited during a recent interview. "We were not able to bring about the reform that I would like for one simple reason," he said. "Because we couldn't convince the State Legislature to do away with the Board of Education and give me control of the educational system."
But some education experts say that the mayor actually has a significant say in how the school system runs, by providing the money for its budget and controlling two of the seven seats on the school board, but chose not to do as much as he could have. He could have fought for more productivity from teachers through labor negotiations, they say, and used the power of his pulpit to effect change. 
"The current system provides plenty of opportunity for the mayor to intervene," said Robert Berne, the vice president for academic and health affairs at N.Y.U. But Dr. Berne added that Mr. Giuliani had strongly influenced the debate regarding ultimate control of the school system.
"Who knows? Bloomberg, by being apolitical, may be the person that they turn to," Dr. Berne said, referring to the State Legislature. "They didn't want, in my estimation, for Giuliani to be the first."
Mr. Bloomberg has made it clear that he intends to make education his issue, just as crime reduction was Mr. Giuliani's. "I can focus on education because Rudy brought the crime rate down," he said, adding: "I think that you can make the case that with sanitation and police and fire, there's always room for improvement, but they're doing a pretty decent job. It's hard to make that case for education."
The housing shortage is another perennial problem in New York. Although Mr. Giuliani made some strides in this area, housing experts say that it never emerged as a top priority of his administration. "I don't think he intended this to be a feather in his cap," said Michael H. Schill, the director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the N.Y.U. School of Law. "He didn't spend a lot of time talking about it and thinking about it. There were some solid achievements and some missed opportunities."
Recent studies, including one by Dr. Schill's center, indicate that overall housing conditions have improved in the city in the last several years, including conditions in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. There are several reasons for this improvement, he said, ranging from the booming economy and the reduction in crime to a 10-year capital housing plan begun under the Koch administration.
In addition, the Giuliani administration drastically reduced the number of mostly dilapidated apartment buildings that the city wound up owning and managing because of tax foreclosures. It began a program to couple the sale of the buildings with subsidies for rehabilitation, Dr. Schill said. "The program led to a revitalization of the housing stock, and at the same time got the city out of something it wasn't good at, which was managing housing."
But the administration weakened the enforcement arm of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and did not do enough to reform the Buildings Department or the city's outdated building code, Dr. Schill said. In his estimation, it also did not capitalize on the opportunity to convert areas zoned for manufacturing into areas where apartment buildings could be erected.
Earlier this year, Mr. Giuliani's administration introduced a four-year, $1.2 billion plan to build or renovate more than 10,000 apartments. For some critics, the plan came too late in his term; for others, it seemed to emphasize new units for middle-income families, not for low-income families. 
Preston Niblack, a deputy director of the Independent Budget Office, the city's nonpartisan fiscal watchdog agency, said that given predictions of an extended recession, Mr. Bloomberg may preside over a reversal in the improvement of housing stock, at the same time that all but the most expensive housing becomes ever scarcer. 
"Bloomberg faces some real constraints that limit his choices in the first couple of years," Mr. Niblack said. "To draft a policy with limited resources that holds ground -- that at least doesn't lose ground -- is going to be a challenge."
There are related problems in the offing. The number of homeless people has risen to record levels; nearly 30,000 people a night seek temporary shelter. Then there is the unease that surrounds what the Giuliani administration considers to be one of its greatest achievements: the reduction of people on welfare, from more than 1.1 million in 1994 to fewer than 500,000 today, the lowest level in 35 years.
After rooting out fraud and duplication in the welfare system, the city began a program to have the able-bodied work in exchange for their welfare payments, raking leaves in the city parks, for example, or cleaning subway cars. And welfare recipients who have drug or alcohol problems are required to be enrolled in counseling programs.
"The philosophy is the social contract," Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said. "If somebody is going to ask the city for something, then the city has the right to ask for something in return. But the other part of it is getting people to stay in the work force."
Many government experts praised the administration's welfare efforts, which came before a federal mandate to reduce welfare spending. Dr. Mollenkopf of the Center for Urban Research said that the city had successfully converted welfare offices "from machines to certify eligibility to devices to divert people out of the welfare system, if possible." But there are plenty of critics who say the city was more concerned with reducing the numbers than with equipping welfare recipients with skills to earn a living. 
"What's happened to these people?" asked Kathy Goldman, the executive director of the Community Food Resource Center. "And, particularly, what's going to happen to them in this period of recession and post-Sept. 11? If 100,000 people have lost their jobs already, some significant part of that are people in the service sector, and that's who these folks are.
"Giuliani will cover himself in glory, but they didn't really take people out of poverty," she added. "They just shoved people off assistance. They just stopped helping them."
Peter F. Vallone, who was speaker of the City Council during the entire Giuliani era, said that with regard to welfare, the mayor "leaves Michael Bloomberg with a good master plan."
"What we need more improvement on is the human plan," he said. "You've got to be able to listen to them, talk to them, and understand their problems."

Racial Matters
Rocky Relations With Minorities
Perhaps the greatest opportunity for change, though, is in how Mr. Bloomberg relates to the disadvantaged, the poor and the minorities of the city. 
After Mr. Giuliani defeated the city's first black mayor, Mr. Dinkins, in the racially charged mayoral race of 1993, he enjoyed the support of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake and a few other black community and elected officials. But he made little attempt to reach out to the rest, identifying many of them with an establishment of unions and advocacy groups that he was intent on smashing. He did not shun just the Rev. Al Sharpton, a political provocateur; for years he declined to meet with Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, or with C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president.
Over the years, Mr. Giuliani dismissed criticism of his race relations; he countered that his aggressive tactics against crime had particularly benefited the city's poorest communities. That argument had great resonance in many black and Hispanic neighborhoods, as reflected in surveys last summer suggesting some regret that he would be leaving office at year's end. 
But their appreciation for safer streets was always tempered by the perception that young black and Hispanic men were being unfairly harassed, and sometimes arrested, by overzealous police officers trying to meet the crime-crackdown mandate. That unease only intensified with three notorious cases that, for many, seemed to form a pattern of abuse.
In the summer of 1997, a police officer brutalized a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima in a bathroom of a Brooklyn station house. In the winter of 1999, four members of the Police Department's Street Crime Unit, searching the Bronx streets for a rapist, shot and killed an unarmed African immigrant named Amadou Diallo; they had mistaken his wallet for a gun. And in the winter of 2000, just as Mr. Giuliani was gearing up his candidacy for the United States Senate, an undercover officer shot and killed an unarmed black security guard named Patrick Dorismond after a brief struggle in Midtown; the victim had been offended by the undercover officer's inquiries about buying some drugs.
Several weeks after the Diallo shooting, and amid a public uproar, a contrite Mr. Giuliani met with Ms. Fields, Mr. McCall and other black officials in what was billed as the start of a continuing dialogue. Such overtures were all but forgotten within a year, when the mayor released Mr. Dorismond's minor criminal record a few days after his death to counter any impression that the victim was "an altar boy."
For many of the city's black residents, the moment marked a low point in Mr. Giuliani's mayoralty, serving to reinforce the sense that he had no understanding of life in New York City's neighborhoods. 
"This guy, time after time and in particularly high-profile situations like Diallo and Dorismond, demonstrated egregious insensitivity to the feelings of a lot of New Yorkers," said David Paterson, a state senator from Harlem. "When people would try to explain it to him, he had a tin ear. With just a slightly different tone or a heightened sense of understanding, Mayor Giuliani would have been heralded in the black and brown communities as much as former President Clinton is."
But Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the New York Urban League, who was recently named a deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, said that Mr. Giuliani leaves a more nuanced legacy than some other black leaders suggest. He recalled giving a speech on police practices at which a young black woman from Harlem criticized the mayor's policies, but acknowledged that when she left her apartment at night, she felt safer than she had ever felt before.
"When he talks about the benefits to the black and Hispanic communities, with more people living in safer conditions, he's correct," he said. "But when people also talk about the disconnect, that is a fact as well."
When asked whether he had any regrets about how he had handled race relations, Mr. Giuliani's first response was, "I think that the biggest regret that I have is schools."
He said that the way he was viewed in minority neighborhoods was shaped by his defeat of Mr. Dinkins, his refusal to continue the "prevailing politics of race relations," and the fluctuating perception of police practices. He also said that much of the angry emotions dissipated after the trade center attack, when "people in the minority community felt that I was working just as hard for them, that I didn't see any distinction between white and black."
Another change was "the feeling that maybe people were being too unfair to police," he said. "Maybe there was a prejudice going on about the police that isn't terribly dissimilar to race prejudice."
It is this kind of response that leaves Philip Reed, the city councilman from East Harlem, muttering about missed opportunities. He said that he had had a one-on-one conversation with Mr. Giuliani only once, in that "first wave of elected officials to his home" after the Diallo death. By contrast, he said, Mr. Bloomberg had returned a post-election call of good luck to congratulate him on his own re-election.
"In 90 seconds, he bought himself six months of good will," Mr. Reed said, adding, "It's wide open."
Back to that clear and cold night a few days before Christmas in a mostly deserted City Hall, one of the very last days that Mr. Giuliani would spend there as mayor.
A television production crew was setting up equipment in a side room for yet another interview about the Giuliani legacy. Bodyguards were chatting in the hallway, waiting for the familiar words to echo through their earpieces: the mayor's on the move. And Mr. Giuliani's longtime personal assistant, Beth Petrone, had said good night and was walking gingerly down the granite front steps. She is pregnant, after all; she learned the news a few days before the remains of her husband, Capt. Terence S. Hatton, a firefighter, were found in the rubble of the World Trade Center.
The presence of Ms. Petrone was a reminder of the very personal repercussions of Sept. 11 on Mr. Giuliani and his world. Despite his long and controversial tenure, it seems that everything that happened before has diminished in importance and receded in memory, waiting for future historians to resurrect it and put it in perspective. 
All those quarrels: with the street vendors, the taxi drivers, the business-improvement districts, the Pataki administration, the sex shops. All those celebrations: the New Year's Eve parties, the parades for the New York Yankees, the fund-raising birthday parties where the invocations thanked God for blessing the city with this mayor. The times that he scolded the press for occasionally challenging him. The time that he told the press of his diagnosis of prostate cancer, which ended his Senate candidacy and brought changes to his personal life.
For now, Mr. Giuliani is remembered less for these moments than for his leadership after a part of New York literally crumbled; he was compassionate, tough and ubiquitous in the way that he said the city's mayor has to be. It may be that these last days overshadow all the rest, the way that Fiorello La Guardia is remembered for smashing slot machines, or that John V. Lindsay is remembered for walking through Harlem in shirt-sleeves to ease tensions.
"He's not going to get knocked down by time," said Kevin McCabe, a former chief of staff for the City Council who spent years negotiating with the Giuliani administration. "The way you get knocked down is by having a fiction exposed. The reality of Sept. 11 is grafted in everyone's minds, and if that's what he'll be measured by, he'll never lose."
On that night in City Hall, Mr. Giuliani could not resist delivering one more summation of the city's eight million people in that familiar, father-knows-best tone of his. "They really don't know how badly they were attacked," he said, adding: "Two of our largest buildings get destroyed, thousands of people dead, more than that injured. And here they are, back on track with their lives -- enthusiastic, exceedingly patriotic, more united, defiant."
"And I just reflected that," the departing mayor said. "People ask me how I do it: I just reflect the way they are."

Andrew, the 7-year-old son of the 107th mayor, upstages his father, stealing one of the more potent lines of the speech: "It should be so and it will be so." Jan. 12, 1994 -- After a dispute at a mosque, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton cancels a meeting with black Muslims over the presence of the Rev. Al Sharpton. In a speech commemorating the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Giuliani tells black New Yorkers, many of whom were disappointed by his defeat of David N. Dinkins, that "there is nothing to fear" in his mayoralty. He later defends his refusal to meet with Mr. Sharpton. Jan. 25, 1994 -- Promising a block-by-block attack, Commissioner Bratton and the mayor announce a crackdown to improve New Yorkers' quality of life. This strategy, which they call "zero tolerance," evolves and expands, shooing panhandlers and the homeless from the subways, and squeegee men from the streets. Feb. 2, 1994 -- Saying the city faces "a fiscal emergency," Mr. Giuliani outlines an ambitious agenda in his first budget plan. Some targets and themes become perennial, like the Board of Education or tax cuts. He imposes a moratorium on hospital rebuilding, including the nearly $900 million renovation at Kings County Hospital Center. He proposes scaling back spending throughout city government and reducing municipal jobs to levels reminiscent of the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. April 6, 1994 -- The Police Department announces redeployment of officers and new strategies to combat low-level drug crimes. Around this time, Compstat, the use of statistical analysis, electronic pin mapping and strategy sessions with precinct commanders, emerges as a dominant style of crime-fighting that the mayor later adapts for other city agencies to spot and solve problems. April 10, 1994 -- After feuding to a height that requires the intervention of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines call a truce. A mayoral ally, Herman Badillo, is named to monitor schools spending. July 7, 1994 -- The Mollen Commission recommends an independent panel to investigate police misconduct, a proposal Mr. Giuliani rejects, although he vows to root out corruption. Sept. 10, 1994 -- Plans are announced to rid Times Square and other areas of sex-oriented adult shops, theaters and strip clubs. Oct. 24, 1994 -- Mr. Giuliani stuns Republicans by endorsing Mr. Cuomo for a fourth term, suggesting that George E. Pataki would not be good for the city. Once Mr. Pataki is elected, he and the mayor maintain a frosty relationship for years. Jan. 3, 1995 -- The Giuliani administration starts the nation's largest welfare-to-work program, requiring able-bodied adults to work in exchange for social service benefits. Feb. 14, 1995 -- The mayor proposes a budget with a 4 percent reduction in spending, the largest cut since the 1930's. Feb. 23, 1995 -- The administration announces plans to sell three of the city's hospitals, undertaking a lengthy legal battle that is ultimately unsuccessful. April 4, 1995 -- The Court of Appeals, the state's highest, upholds the mayor's authority to merge the city's three police forces. June 15, 1995 -- Chancellor Cortines quits. Rudy Crew is later chosen. Oct. 15, 1995 -- Crackdown on corruption focuses on the Fulton Fish Market. Oct. 23, 1995 -- During the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Mr. Giuliani ejects Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, from a benefit concert attended by world leaders at Lincoln Center. Jan. 11, 1996 -- Horrific child abuse cases help spur creation of a separate agency, the Administration for Children's Services. March 26, 1996 -- Commissioner Bratton resigns under pressure, amid brewing resentment over the amount of credit he received for plummeting crime. Fire Commissioner Howard Safir succeeds him. May 31, 1996 -- Expanding his year-long campaign against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Mr. Giuliani releases a plan to dissolve the agency created in 1921 to control the port and mass transit. He receives no broad-based support for such a move. July 17, 1996 -- TWA Flight 800 explodes just after takeoff, killing all 220 on board as it rips apart over the ocean off Long Island. Mr. Giuliani hammers away at the airline -- in news conferences and on network television programs -- for its failure to adequately assist the victims' families. Oct. 26, 1996 -- The Yankees win their first World Series in 18 years, defeating the Atlanta Braves. Mr. Giuliani plans a tickertape parade. Dec. 27, 1996 -- "The People vs. Larry Flynt" opens, with Donna Hanover playing the role of evangelist Ruth Carter Stapleton. A spokeswoman for the mayor's wife acknowledges that Ms. Hanover has stopped using Giuliani in her surname. March 1, 1997 -- Mr. Giuliani as "Rudia" sings "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" in blonde wig, high heels and a pink-spangled gown, at the Inner Circle media roast. This is one of several public glimpses of New York's mayor in drag. Aug. 9, 1997 -- Abner Louima is arrested and brutalized by police officers at the 70th precint in Brooklyn. Nov. 4, 1997 -- Mr. Giuliani easily wins a second term by defeating Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger.

Feb. 4, 1999 -- Amadou Diallo is shot at 41 times and killed by Street Crime Unit police officers in the Bronx. A month later, protesters begin converging daily outside 1 Police Plaza. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins, several elected officials and celebrities like Susan Sarandon are arrested for civil disobedience. While pressing for a thorough but fair investigation, Mr. Giuliani agrees several weeks later to meet more often with black officials. April 22, 1999 -- The mayor resumes his attack on the Board of Education, saying the school system "should be blown up." Mr. Crew labels those words the "rhetoric of destruction" and writes an impassioned letter to 600 political and education leaders, asking them to fight Mr. Giuliani's plans. June 7, 1999 -- The mayor's emergency crisis center opens on the 23rd floor of 7 World Trade Center. The bunker, sprawling over nearly 50,000 square feet, is equipped with sophisticated computers and aerial photos. It later crumbles when the building collapses in the Sept. 11 attacks on the twin towers. Sept. 22, 1999 -- The "Sensation" exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art draws the ire of the mayor, who objects that it is sacrilegious because it includes a portrayal of the Virgin Mary with her breast dappled with elephant dung. Sept. 25, 1999 -- The West Nile virus, unknown before in the Western Hemisphere, causes the deaths of least three people, officials disclose. The mayor eventually orders ground and aerial spraying of pesticides. By year's end, seven deaths are attributed to the mosquito-borne virus. Nov. 22, 1999 -- The State Board of Regents approved a plan that Mr. Giuliani had pushed for several years, eliminating remedial instruction from the City University of New York's 11 senior colleges.

May 10, 2000 -- Clutching a lectern in Bryant Park, the mayor reveals that he is separating from his wife and softly talks about the effects of his illness. "I don't really care about politics right now," he said. Caught unaware, Ms. Hanover hastily calls a news conference just outside Gracie Mansion to say that she has tried to save their 16-year marriage. May 19, 2000 -- Mr. Giuliani drops out of the Senate contest against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sept. 15, 2000 -- Six hours after undergoing outpatient surgery to have radioactive seeds implanted to treat his prostate cancer at Mount Sinai Medical Center, the mayor thanks his doctors and friends at a hospital news conference.

HEADLINE: Oh, You '02 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Asked at his year-end news conference how Sept. 11 changed him, President Bush grew testy. "Talk to my wife," he snapped. Not for him any of those look-in-the-mirror ruminations. His unspoken point: he's the same man he always was, and now people have come to appreciate the real him.
 He was misbriefed. It's a mistake to try to force half the voters to admit they were wrong. The better answer is: Of course the onslaught of terror changed him, in the same way as it changed all of us. Although our basic character is the same, America is rising to the occasion of making our world safe for civilization. 
 We were shocked into an epiphany: whenever a government offers safe haven to terrorists, it ceases to be sovereign. As an accessory to murder, it loses legitimacy and its national borders are no longer inviolate. The deliberate harboring of terrorists is a casus belli, an invitation to invasion.
With this realization, our leaders have matured, our foreign policy has won new respect, and international law has been forever altered.
This shift in the tectonic plates of statecraft -- brought about by the imperative of self-preservation -- did not begin on Sept. 11 and has not ended with the Taliban's collapse.
A few years ago, the Turks became fed up with a bloody campaign of terrorism by ultranationalist Kurds headquartered in Damascus. Turkey massed an army on Syria's border and told its dictator to oust the PKK terrorists. That was an early "or else." Syria hastily complied and the charismatic leader of the killers was soon on the run. The Turks captured him, and he is now in jail, his followers dispersed and disillusioned.
The world little noted this example of a nation protecting its citizens by applying military pressure on the harborers of terrorism; neither European nor Arab states seemed to have a dog in that fight.
The world did note, with varying degrees of disapproval, the same get-to-the-source policy when Israel began to apply its "or else" in 2001 to terrorist leaders given sanctuary by the Palestinian Authority. Last summer, even the United States frowned on Israel's execution in the West Bank of known Arab terrorists whom Yasir Arafat refused to arrest. 
That attitude dramatically changed after Sept. 11. Europeans long tolerant of Palestinian negotiating duplicity, as well as U.S. State Department officials clinging to Clintonian evenhandedness, did not try to swim against the sea change. 
America and its NATO allies could not complain of Israel's missiles hitting the organizers of suicide bombing who were operating with Arafat's tacit blessing -- when U.S. and British aircraft were lambasting the masters of suicide hijackers on a grand scale in Afghanistan. As a result, pressure is on Arafat to defeat his own internal insurrection or be replaced by Palestinians willing and able to stop the terrorists. 
The history made in the final quarter of 2001 was not so much in the surprising speed and efficacy of our bombing campaign directed by American commandos working with indigenous troops. Rather it was the world acceptance -- even in the much-televised "Arab street" -- of the principle that is the core of a Bush doctrine: any government that consciously harbors terrorists loses its legitimacy and will suffer the same fate as the murderers it shelters. 
We now see the fourth example of the new antiterror reality: India's threatened military response to the murderous attack on its Parliament by Kashmiri terrorists operating out of Pakistan. Whatever the merits of the Kashmir dispute, India is right to demand that President Pervez Musharraf crack down on the terrorist network operating out of Pakistan "or else." 
The U.S. owes Musharraf plenty for his help against the Taliban in the face of hot internal opposition, but we owe the new antiterror principle more. 
The Pakistani general, who stared down his own Islamic extremists in 2001, will have to imprison Kashmiri terrorists on his territory in the new year, as he has begun to do. The U.S. should offer sweet economic emoluments to Pakistan to make that medicine go down, but consistency counts -- we cannot go soft on terrorism anywhere. 
Yes, the world has changed somewhat. So have we and so has Bush. But by sticking to the new doctrine, we'll soon have normally happy new years.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI YEARS: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Reborn City, Stamped 'Giuliani'

BYLINE:  By JIM DWYER 

 BODY:
More than an era of changed government, Rudolph W. Giuliani presided at a moment of utterly changed minds -- about the city, the nature of urban life, and nearly every few weeks, about himself.
 For many, New York in the last decade was transformed into the unquestioned city of cities, where half the world seems to be clambering to draw breath on the jam-packed sidewalks. 
 Mayor Giuliani served during most of this epochal shift, one moment as the demanding agent of change, the next as spectator to city-shaping powers larger than his office or even his storm-raising personality. Viewed from the balcony of history, his mayoralty will mark an era when the nation and the world saw New York anew, and New Yorkers saw their hometown fresh, vibrant and renewed.
Those at the ground floor of daily life in the city have made it clear in opinion polls that while they approve of much of Mr. Giuliani's work, they are ready, and indeed would prefer, to view him from the distance afforded by history. 
Though he won global acclaim for his deportment after the attacks of Sept. 11, most New Yorkers did not join him in his pleas and sotto voce demands that he be granted a few extra months in office beyond the end of his term today. Perhaps he had just worn people out the way politicians do. Few have run through so many exhausting lives as Mr. Giuliani, from crimebuster to consoler, public moralist to straying husband, pitiless scold to teary cancer patient. That list does not include the glittering dresses, wigs and pumps he occasionally donned for skits.
Yet most of this dizzying series of incarnations may well end up forgotten behind the astounding revival of New York during his time.
In the earliest days of his administration, Mayor Giuliani told police cadets that they were, in effect, freedom fighters. "It's a struggle for the most basic civil right that we possess," the new mayor said on Feb. 16, 1994. "That is the right to public safety, the ability to use our public spaces, our public buildings, our education institutions, our hospitals, our schools, without the fear of being the victim of a serious crime."
To stunning ends, his pledge to fight crime was executed by his first set of police managers. Every crime was weighed on the same scale. A mugging in Bushwick was just as bad as one in Carnegie Hill. There were no excuses for criminals or, perhaps more important, for police commanders. A feeling of order settled across the city, with the biggest changes in neighborhoods of the impoverished and the working poor who had suffered with the most crime. Suddenly, criminal atrocities no longer dominated the city's news. Even in the wealthier precincts of the city, the lost and damaged souls who once seemed to occupy every other street or subway car vanished. Gone, too, was the hint of menace associated with the chronically unstable.
For many, that seemed like another visible wonder achieved by Mr. Giuliani. Its proper name would be timing. About 9,000 of the mentally ill homeless found homes in safe, small, structured residences with medical and social supervision. The homes were built under a program called New York, New York, begun by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and former Mayor David N. Dinkins. Just as Mr. Giuliani became mayor, thousands of police officers hired by his predecessor under the Safe Streets, Safe City program were going on duty. The last of about 100,000 apartments were rebuilt under a program dating back to Mayor Edward I. Koch. Acres and acres of rubbled blight in the South Bronx and Brooklyn had been salvaged and settled by two private concerns -- the Nehemiah Housing program and the New York City Partnership. 
Not only the general public was confused about who had done what. During a speech in Washington, Mr. Giuliani mentioned that he had recently seen the movie "Prizzi's Honor" and noticed a subway train splattered with graffiti. "I said to myself, 'Subway trains don't look like that anymore.' And then I said, 'Oh, yeah, you did that.' " Actually, he had not. The last of the old graffiti-covered trains had been taken out of service on May 12, 1989, two mayors and more than four years before Mr. Giuliani's election.
As often happens in the records of substantial political figures, the efforts of others were absorbed in the success story that Mr. Giuliani came to embody. And so were the circumstances of his time. 
The national economy soared. Jobs were plentiful. When Mr. Giuliani took office on Jan. 1, 1994, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 3,754.09. This morning, on his last day as mayor after eight years, it opens at 10,136.99. For most of his tenure, the city's treasury gushed with revenues generated by Wall Street. As a result, the considerable budget cutting he imposed early in his administration cost him little in political capital, a circumstance enjoyed by few New York mayors of the 20th century.
No matter how fair his winds, Mr. Giuliani was bound and determined to shape his time. By now, it is certain that the crime-tracking program known as Compstat will endure in New York and many other cities. That may not prevent a rise in crime, but will make it difficult for anyone in government to hide from its reality, or to allocate police resources in a way that is fundamentally unfair to the powerless.
Less certain is the ability of Mr. Giuliani's successors to continue the growth of the Police and Fire Departments, or even maintain them, as library, health and social services shrink. Many of the city's labor contracts were shaped by the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, when it was far easier for the government to require less work of employees than it was to pay them higher salaries. The result, independent budget monitors say, is large work forces that are unproductive in strict economic terms. This circumstance was little changed by Mr. Giuliani's years in office, but may not be one that his successor can ignore.
Another of his legacies will be his relationship to the city's organized political parties. Mr. Giuliani's term proved that a mayor can succeed emancipated from ideologies and interests that he does not share. A former Democrat, and now a moderate Republican, Mr. Giuliani practiced full-blooded politics, cutting deals and crushing enemies, but these actions were generally distinct from the interests of party organizations. Now he has been succeeded by another nominal Republican, Michael R. Bloomberg, who also sounds more agnostic than partisan.
Mr. Giuliani has said that he practiced a kind of politics of provocation. When he took what were, by New York terms, novel or extreme stands, he said he was acting tactically, to stir movement in an intellectually stagnant political culture dominated by the Democratic Party. For example, this approach, he said, was behind his proposals to finance scholarships at private schools to give poor children an exit from failing public schools.
The results were mixed. Reforms were won in the management of the school districts, and in the principals' contract, which traded raises for an end to lifetime job security that was virtually guaranteed without regard to performance. His key demand -- direct mayoral control of the schools -- never got very far. Even though the concept enjoyed broad support, the notion of turning over the schools to this particular mayor won few advocates in Albany, where the final decision rested.
Over the last two years, as he attacked the character of an unarmed man who had been shot by the police, or announced a marital separation at a news conference before informing his wife, or disclosed that he suffered from impotence as a result of cancer treatments, his provocative behavior seemed to bear little resemblance to well-considered strategy and quite a bit to impulses that were not particularly attractive when rendered in headlines. In the fine print, they read downright ugly.
On Jan. 19, 2000, 129 mentally ill people were dragged from beds at city shelters on one of the coldest nights of the winter. In all but six cases, they were taken to jail for nothing more than having failed to respond to summonses that had been issued years earlier for offenses like sleeping in the subway or public urination. The arrests lacked the broad emotional impact of the shooting of Amadou Diallo, or the torture of Abner Louima. Still, a number of senior police commanders viewed the sweep with deep dismay.
Not Mr. Giuliani. In defending the sweep, he played his most powerful card: He had vanquished crime. His critics had not.
"You can ignore the problem and say, 'Gee, I'm such a big, fuzzy-headed liberal that I'm going to walk away from it,' " Mr. Giuliani said. "That's New York in the 1980's. That's New York City with 2,000 murders."
The rout of crime served as an all-purpose slap to his critics, hitting with a force that will continue to resound. Mr. Giuliani proved it could be done. No longer could anyone see New York as simply another dying or dead city, a stark chalk outline drawn in the gutter of history by a bored detective. No longer would New Yorkers, who held a sneaking pride in their town even in the worst of times, have to apologize for it.
New York has come to be defined not by its poverty, but by its wealth; by its appetites, and not its hungers; and since Sept. 11, by its strengths and not its collapse. The city has risen on the American landscape as a place of plain civic virtue. No longer a belligerent mayor whose day was done, but the face of a calm, composed and resolute response to terror, Mr. Giuliani and his place in history have been secured by the tragedy and glory of his time. In the end, it grew hard to tell the dancer from the dance, to see where New York began and Rudolph W. Giuliani ended.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI YEARS: HISTORY; 
La Guardia's Legacy Is Formidable, but It May Be Surpassed

BYLINE:  By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani leaves office tonight assured of one pedestal in the pantheon of New York mayors: no other modern mayor, not even Fiorello H. La Guardia, departed at the crest of his popularity. But precedent suggests that history -- not the euphoria of the moment -- will determine whether Mr. Giuliani, after two terms, edges aside La Guardia, who served three, as New York City's greatest mayor.
 "Anyone who makes that decision today is nuts," said Edward I. Koch, who lost re-election to a fourth term in 1989, but whose support helped elect Mr. Giuliani four years later and who remains the city's most visible former mayor in memory. 
 Historians measure the legacy of former mayors against several standards: the city they inherited; the challenges they faced; the resources available to confront those challenges; and the degree to which their transformation of city government endured beyond their terms.
Most New York City mayors overstayed their welcomes; they are immortalized only in street signs. The job has been a political dead end. No former mayor ever succeeded so well as Theodore Roosevelt, who was only the police commissioner but became president. 
As Wallace S. Sayre and Herbert Kaufman wrote presciently more than a generation ago in "Governing New York City," the presidency can elevate the most mediocre of men, but the mayoralty "is the highly vulnerable symbol of all the defects in the city and its government."
Despite those defects, La Guardia was ranked first not only in New York but also among the nation's mayors in a poll of 160 historians, social scientists and journalists conducted by Melvin G. Holli for his 1993 book, "The American Mayor" (Pennsylvania State University Press). 
He defeated a corrupt Democratic machine, presided during a depression and a world war, made the city the model for New Deal welfare and public works programs and championed immigrants. He succeeded with the support of a sympathetic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and before the excesses of some officials produced a backlash that diffused the power of their successors and constrained the exercise of power.
"La Guardia represented a dangerous style of personal rule hitched to a transcendent purpose," Thomas Kessner, a City University professor and La Guardia biographer, wrote. "People would be afraid of allowing anybody to take that kind of power today." 
Until 1993, when people, more afraid of unconstrained crime, narrowly ousted David N. Dinkins and installed Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor who had never before held elective office.
"I think he's the greatest mayor that New York has had since Peter Stuyvesant," said Myron Magnet, the editor of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research's City Journal, who suggested that Mr. Giuliani's remarkable inroads against crime -- organized and individual -- and sharp reduction in the welfare rolls upended the accepted wisdom that New York was ungovernable.
Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian who is the president of the New-York Historical Society, recalled that La Guardia and Mr. Koch inherited a city that was in worse shape financially. And John H. Mollenkopf, a City University professor, agreed that Mr. Giuliani presided during a national economic boom with "the wind at his back." 
But Professor Jackson, who had earlier ranked La Guardia first and Mr. Giuliani second, has reversed himself. "If not for Sept. 11 he might have been almost even with La Guardia," he said, "but since then he showed his best side -- leadership, compassion, generosity, love of the city. Even before Sept. 11 my sense was that the city was not being seen as the past, but as a glittering future. His own star shines so brightly before and since then." 
Both mayors may be best remembered for their performance in their last few months in office -- La Guardia for reading the comics on the radio during a newspaper strike and Mr. Giuliani for his role since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Chris McNickle, the author of "To Be Mayor of New York" (Columbia University Press, 1993) describes Mr. Giuliani's performance in the aftermath of the attack as this or any other mayor's "greatest single moment." Nonetheless, he awards him second place over all.
"I think the title's going to remain with La Guardia," Mr. McNickle said. The judgment is likely to be colored by nostalgia and ideology. History makes the statesman, as Bismarck said, and La Guardia and Mr. Giuliani both personified their eras.
Vincent J. Cannato, the author of "The Ungovernable City" (Basic Books, 2001), a critical biography of Mayor John V. Lindsay, said that La Guardia embodied the New Deal and the ascendancy of the immigrant while Mr. Giuliani personified the "post-liberal centrist and social moderate."
"What am I proudest of?" La Guardia once asked. "That I raised the standard of municipal government everywhere in this country, by raising it in New York and so proving it could be raised." Mr. Giuliani, in his swan songs, has trumpeted the same theme. He made lesser inroads in improving education and housing. Like La Guardia, he bequeaths his successor a budget deficit. Unlike La Guardia, he alienated many black New Yorkers by failing to meet with black elected officials -- "behavior at odds with greatness," as Mr. McNickle put it. 
"He is going out a winner," Mr. McNickle said, "but as time goes on, the unfinished business will become more apparent, and he will lose a little bit of the glow." That Mr. Giuliani is going out a winner is due not only to his performance since Sept. 11 but also to term limits. La Guardia had run third in a straw poll before he bitterly decided against seeking a fourth term. 
Precluded from seeking a third term, Mr. Giuliani, who is only 57 years old, leaves with an astounding 85 percent approval rating -- 90 percent among whites and 71 percent among blacks -- compared with to 33 percent for Mr. Koch when he left office after three terms (although on election day last month only a minority -- a still-substantial 40 percent -- said they would have voted for Mr. Giuliani again if they could have). 
Professor Kessner wrote of La Guardia: "He left no party legacy, no structure, no institutional fusion or urban reform movement." Neither has Mr. Giuliani, except that his popularity after Sept. 11 helped elect Michael R. Bloomberg. 
La Guardia's political imprint, Professor Kessner wrote, "had been a great flashing star that tore across the firmament for its moment." Still, a half century later, he is the standard against which modern mayors are judged. Mr. Giuliani, Professor Kessner said, is "in the same league, but not ahead."
Fred Siegel, a Cooper Union historian, said, "I think Giuliani and La Guardia stand alone on the top tier as people who fundamentally transformed the city." So who's the greatest? It depends on whether Mr. Giuliani's legacy fundamentally transformed what New Yorkers expect from city government. "I wouldn't choose," Professor Siegel said.

HEADLINE: The Year in Pictures: IN THE TOWERS' SHADOW 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
So overpowering are the images of jetliners heading into the World Trade Center, of people watching in disbelief and fleeing in horror, that the other news of 2001, significant and not so significant, already fades from memory. And some of it was significant. There was the swearing in of a president after the Supreme Court decided the presidential election. There was the death of the legendary driver Dale Earnhardt in a stock car crash. There was Cal Ripken's retirement after 3,001 games, including a record 2,632 in a row (and 3,184 hits, 1,695 runs batted in and 431 homers). There was Robert Tools's quiet thumbs-up after becoming the first recipient of a self-contained artificial heart.
 But on a gleaming late-summer morning, there were those planes bearing down on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Suddenly, Americans had no sense of what the future might bring. As the shock and the tears subsided, faces that had been purposeful were newly diffident. And in the changed world of politics, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, prevented by New York City's term-limits law from seeking a third term, prepared to leave City Hall celebrating his much-heralded leadership. 
 The year had begun quietly. For 2000, there had been a bigger-than-usual countdown for the once-in-a-millennium calendar rollover. For 2001, there was a big ho-hum. The celebration in Times Square was less flamboyant, and there was a sense that the country was putting itself on cruise control as Bill Clinton prepared to leave office. Then a flurry of last-minute pardons, including one to the fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, raised troubling new questions for a president whose legal and ethical tangles already included the second presidential impeachment trial in American history.
George W. Bush was sworn in on a drizzly Saturday little more than a month after the Supreme Court decision that ended the vote counting in Florida. The Republicans' control of both houses of Congress was short-lived: Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont bolted from the G.O.P. in midsummer, becoming an independent and single-handedly returning control of the Senate to the Democrats.
With the dot-com boom fizzling, the nation drifted into its 10th recession since World War II despite the Federal Reserve's relentless rate-cutting. The first cut occurred on Jan. 3, when most forecasters were predicting nothing more than a slowdown. The Fed cut rates 10 times in the next 11 months. As for fiscal policy, President Bush and Congress agreed on nearly $40 billion in rebate checks as part of a $1.35 trillion tax cut championed by Republicans.
The nation spent much of the summer caught up in a Washington intrigue: What did Representative Gary A. Condit of California know about the disappearance of a 24-year-old former government intern? "I have not been a perfect man," he said on television. But he declined to say whether his "very close" relationship with the former intern, Chandra Ann Levy, had been romantic.
Then came Sept. 11 and the carefully coordinated attacks on symbols of America's financial power and military strength. The president, who quickly defined the fundamental purpose of his administration as fighting terrorism, said that it was a day America would never forget, a remark that seemed almost understated as the brutal efficiency of the attacks became clear. More than 3,200 people died, a third more than at Pearl Harbor. Two of the world's tallest buildings were reduced to rubble in a matter of hours, and the government had been caught unaware.
Retaliation came in two forms, economic and military, as the administration froze the assets of groups and individuals it accused of bankrolling the attackers. The Pentagon sent regular troops and special forces to Afghanistan to topple the Taliban leadership and find Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, the network that Washington blamed for the attacks. But the Pentagon moved into an endgame strategy with Mr. bin Laden still at large and administration officials debating whether to take the war on terrorism to Iraq and drive President Saddam Hussein from power.
The president created a new agency for homeland security and named Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania to run it, but not soon enough to prevent an attack of anthrax-laced letters that contaminated mail-sorting machinery on their way to Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, and Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, among others. In all, 18 people contracted anthrax and 5 of them died, including a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. How she and a New York victim, Kathy T. Nguyen, were exposed remains a mystery.
The country seemed to be lurching from one crisis to another. Vague warnings pointed up disagreements among officials about what the public needed to know. Nowhere was this more apparent than in California, where Gov. Gray Davis broke with federal officials and announced that "credible evidence" indicated terrorists were plotting to attack such landmarks as the Golden Gate Bridge. Even as the F.B.I. lifted the warning that Mr. Davis had decided to relay, some Americans were voicing concern that the government's larger response to terrorism -- from planned military tribunals for foreign suspects to expanded wiretapping to detainment -- was corrosive to civil liberties.
The year ended with talk of large sums for the survivors. The federal fund set up for the victims' families prepared to make tax-free payments averaging $1.6 million apiece, and Congress approved $8.2 billion for disaster relief in New York (where nearly $3 billion in federal assistance had already been spent) and $8.3 billion to tighten domestic security.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Chooses Head Of Fire Dept. 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday chose Nicholas Scoppetta, who won praise for overhauling New York City's child welfare system the last six years, to be the city's next fire commissioner and rebuild a department that lost 343 firefighters in the attack on the World Trade Center.
 The appointment of Mr. Scoppetta, 69, came as something of a surprise because a few months ago he announced his intention to leave government when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani left office. 
 But Mr. Scoppetta, who does not count Fire Department experience among his broad city government portfolio, said yesterday that he had been moved by a desire to help the city rebuild from the attacks downtown and by Mr. Bloomberg's persuasiveness. "We've all felt we wanted to do something, I think, since Sept. 11, to make some contribution to bring the city back," he said at a news conference at Mr. Bloomberg's campaign headquarters, where the mayor-elect announced the appointment. "And this is by far the most unique and wonderful opportunity for me to do that." 
Mr. Scoppetta will take over a department that is struggling not only to recover from the personal loss of so many of its members, but also to groom new talent throughout its ranks to take their places, all the while keeping the department running.
He will face several simultaneous and potentially conflicting tasks, including consoling widows and other survivors of the dead firefighters and trying to meet their needs and demands, and boosting morale, which has sagged in recent years. At the same time, he must prepare the rank and file for a contract that will be negotiated as the city's economy is in decline.
And he must oversee a department whose mission has broadened in recent years from fighting residential and high-rise fires to responding to medical emergencies, hazardous material incidents and terrorism.
"If we didn't know before Sept. 11 that our Fire Department is the first line of civil defense," Mr. Scoppetta said at the news conference, "we certainly learned it on Sept. 11 and thereafter."
Choosing a fire commissioner from outside the department is hardly unusual. Mayor Giuliani's first fire commissioner, Howard Safir, came out of the United States Marshals Service. Charles J. Hynes, who was named commissioner in 1981, had been a special state prosecutor for nursing homes. Joseph F. Bruno led the city's Parking Violations Bureau when he was appointed commissioner in 1987.
Mr. Bloomberg said that he was unconcerned by Mr. Scoppetta's lack of Fire Department experience. "Look at my own background," he chuckled. "I'm coming in, in case you hadn't noticed, without any experience in government. And I think that I will do a very good job as mayor. So it's sort of along those lines."
The choice of Mr. Scoppetta rounded out a flurry of appointments by Mr. Bloomberg in recent days. While some important posts remain unfilled, Mr. Bloomberg will be sworn into office tomorrow having announced all of his deputy mayors and many key commissioners. 
The mayoral transition is beginning to take physical shape, as well. Yesterday, workers continued putting the finishing touches on a series of cubicles Mr. Bloomberg has had installed in the old Board of Estimate chamber on the second floor of City Hall, to help him create an open office environment where he and his deputies can work together. It is modeled on the one he used at the Park Avenue headquarters of his private company, Bloomberg L.P. 
And in his first extended interview since the election, which was broadcast at 6:30 a.m. yesterday on "Sunday Edition" on WCBS-TV, Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican billionaire, warned of the difficult fiscal times facing the city and said that he would like to see public school principals given more autonomy.
Mr. Bloomberg announced Mr. Scoppetta's appointment as his police commissioner-designate, Raymond W. Kelly, looked on. Mr. Bloomberg wore a polo-style sweater; Mr. Kelly, a commando-style sweater with shoulder patches; and Mr. Scoppetta, a gray pinstripe suit. "Next time Nick will get the word about the outfit too," Mr. Kelly joked as the news conference ended.
Mr. Scoppetta, a former prosecutor, has held a variety of sensitive city posts. He was the commissioner of investigation in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay and also served as associate counsel to the Knapp Commission, which investigated police corruption in 1970, during Mayor Lindsay's tenure. He was a deputy mayor for criminal justice under Mayor Abraham D. Beame, and in recent years Mr. Scoppetta, who spent time as a foster child, was credited with rebuilding the city's child welfare system in the newly created Administration for Children's Services.
Mr. Bloomberg said that he found Mr. Scoppetta's resume appealing. "His background is in criminal justice, his background is in management, his background is in building," he said.
But someone familiar with the transition process said Mr. Scoppetta was not on Mr. Bloomberg's initial list of potential fire commissioners, which included many candidates from within the department. 
Mr. Scoppetta had breakfast on Saturday with the departing commissioner, Thomas Von Essen, who has had to contend in recent months with the deaths of many friends in the trade center attack and also with widespread anger and dissatisfaction among rank-and-file firefighters. They complained that Mr. Von Essen, a former firefighter and union official, too often sided with the Giuliani administration in various matters. 
Union leaders said that they were optimistic about Mr. Bloomberg's choice of Mr. Scoppetta. "He's highly regarded by almost everyone in the city," said the president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, Peter Gorman. "His integrity is above reproach, and we think he's a tough, gritty guy, and he's up to the task."
The Brooklyn trustee of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, Matty James, said, "We're looking for someone who will help us heal right now, help us get back to where we were before Sept. 11." 
Robert A. Ungar, a counsel to the union representing emergency medical technicians and paramedics, who were part of the separate Emergency Medical Service until it merged with the Fire Department under Mayor Giuliani, praised Mr. Scoppetta but added that he would be confronting issues of morale, staffing and recruitment.
Mr. Scoppetta, for his part, made it clear that he saw his own role as that of a manager. "The firefighters know how to fight fires, and I'm not going to pretend for two seconds that I know how to do that very difficult job that they're well trained and very well experienced in doing," he said. "My role is entirely different. I'm a civilian, a manager."
